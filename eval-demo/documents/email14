2008-12-03 What's New in the Magazine: The Ig Issue

The Nov/Dec 2008 issue (vol. 14, no. 6) is the special Ig Nobel
issue of the Annals of Improbable Research. It will emerge soon
from the printer, speeding straight to subscribers' doorsteps.
(And of course a subscription - to pleasing paper or to hi-res
PFDs - makes a perfect holiday or non-holiday gift.)

The Ig issue will also be available free online. Many back issues
are online, too, at <http://www.improbable.com/magazine/>


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-12-04 A Random Mystery: Is There a Stochastic Association?

Help us solve a stochastic mystery. (The word "stochastic" of
course means "having to do with randomness.")

We stumbled across two book reviews attributed to the "Journal of
the American Stochastic Association." But we have not yet
succeeded in finding any further trace of that journal - or of
the American Stochastic Association.

A review <http://tinyurl.com/58gohh> of J. Michael Steel's book
Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications raves:
      "This is one of the most interesting and easiest reads
      in the discipline; a gem of a book."

A review <http://tinyurl.com/5gb8ye> of Robert S. Liptser et
al.'s two-volume book Statistics of Random Processes raves:
      "These two classic volumes are very important resources
      for both probabilists and statisticians."

But...
Is or was there a Journal of the American Stochastic Association?
Is or was there an American Stochastic Association?

If you have definite knowledge of the existence or nonexistence
of either entity, please send it (the evidence) here.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-12-05 Echoes from the Salute to Smets

Three very excited scientists, each from a different city in
France, emailed us about the identity of Professor Philippe Smets
of the Universit=E9 Libre de Bruxelles, celebrated here last month
as the author of studies on the necessity of the pignistic
transformation and the generalized pignistic transformation.

According to each of these three vibrant individuals, "Professor
Philippe Smets" is leading a double or perhaps even triple life -
- having been born with the name "Jean-Philippe Smet" and then
attaining fame as a singer, under the name "Johnny Hallyday," and
only subsequent to that becoming a professor. A photo and other
information about the musical incarnation (including his
involvement with a clothier called "Smetshop") is
<http://tinyurl.com/6g8kcp>.

A photo and other info about the pignistical incarnation is at
<http://tinyurl.com/5ut8hu>.

Our preliminary investigation suggests that Smets and Smet may be
two distinct persons, only one of whom is currently alive. But we
will not give up hope until and unless forced to.

2008-12-07 That-Which-Lurketh-Between

The judges have chosen a winner in the That-Which-Lurketh-Between
Limerick Competition, which asked for a limerick to honor the
study "Toewebs as a Source of Gram-Negative Bacilli," W.C. Noble,
et al., Journal of Hospital Infection, vol. 8, November 1986, pp.
248-56.  <http://tinyurl.com/6a4pdy>.

The winner is INVESTIGATOR KNOWN AS "CUTTLEFISH", whose slightly
ungrammatical creation reads:

      The violet Gram-staining shows
         Pathogenic bacteria grows
         (If you work where it's wet,
      Then you knew this, I'd bet)
      In the webbing connecting your toes!

And who offers a second helping:

      Since bacteria thrive where it's wettish,
      Be safe, when you get heavy-pettish:
      If you're dating a miner
      You will find it benigner
      To pass, on that toe-sucking fetish.

Here's the offering from LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:

It's the well-informed reader who knows
What interdactylously grows.
    Can it harm us or kill us,
    This dreaded bacillus,
That's down there, right now, in your toes?

(Eiger adds: "The English language appears to lack a pretentious
adverb that refers to the spaces between toes. I propose a humble
remedy for this tragic oversight.")


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-12-08 Orange Proton Spin Relaxation Time Competition

Orange proton spin relaxation time is the subject of this month's
limerick competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

      "Proton Spin-Spin Relaxation Time of Peel and Flesh
      of Navel Orange Varieties Exposed to Freezing Temperature,"
      Prem N Gambhir, Young J Choi, David C Slaughter,
      James F Thompson and Michael J McCarthy, Journal of the
      Science of Food and Agriculture, vol. 85, 2005, pp. 2482-6.
      (Thanks to Alison Brown for bringing this
      to our attention.) <http://tinyurl.com/18r>

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to
the correct address) a free, possibly relaxed high-res PDF issue
of the Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per
entrant) to:

2008-12-09 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Nauseating Walk Around a Pole

This month's specially selected study explores the bravery of
volunteers. It's:

"Susceptibility to Motion Sickness Induced by Optokinetic
Rotation and Self-Rotation by Walking Around a Vertical Pole," S.
Hu and Y.J. Luo, Perceptual and Motor Skills, vol. 93, no. 1,
August 2001, pp. 289-96. The authors, are at Humboldt State
University, Arcata, CA, summarize their experiment thusly:

"31 subjects viewed an optokinetic rotating drum for 12 min. in
one session and self-rotated by walking quickly around a vertical
pole with eyes closed while alternately flexing and extending the
neck in another session.... The subjects developed symptoms of
nausea, sweating, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and changes in
salivation in both drum rotation and self-rotation sessions.
However, the subjects reported higher ratings of nausea in the
session of optokinetic rotation than in the session of self-
rotation around a vertical pole."
