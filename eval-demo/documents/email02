2008-04-03 What's New in the Magazine

The entire magazine -- the Annals of Improbable Research -- is
now online for free for all. Open access, open access, we repeat.

The March/April 2008 issue (vol. 14, no. 2) is a special Writing
Research issue. Highlights include:

<> "How to Write 85,000 (or maybe 200,000) Books"
<> "How to Write an Interdisciplinary Research Paper: Planning
for Retirement by Solving Time Travel Paradoxes Using Open Book
Management in Nearby Disk Galaxies," Eric Schulman, Eric
Schulman, Eric Schulman, and Eric Schulman
<> "Hard Looks at Doctors' Handwriting"

It and many back issues are online at

----------------------------------------------------------
2008-04-04 Sentence-of-Death: Kluge's Masterpiece

The Sentence-of-Death project grinds on. Investigator Blanton
Daves writes to remind us that it has been ten years since we
presented E. Kluge's classic sentence-of-death.

In tribute, we present it again. Investigator David Rind alerted
us to the study "Health Information, Privacy, Confidentiality and
Ethics," E.H. Kluge, International Journal of Bio-Medical
Computing, vol. 35, supplement 1, 1994, pp. 23-7. The study's
author, Eike-Henner Kluge, at the University of Victoria, Canada,
begins his abstract with this sentence-of-death:

"Electronic patient records are becoming tologically reified
entities that play the role of epistemic patient analogues in
information space."


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-04-05 Great Research Kluges

Here are pointers to some exploits by other great Kluges of the first
type:

"The mere fact that so distinguished a scholar as Professor Kluge could
edit a practically unaltered version of a Chaucer Grammar and
Prosody..." <http://tinyurl.com/3nq6kz>

"Professor Kluge has confidence in cladograms..."
<http://tinyurl.com/45wn3t>

<Professor Kluge has served as editor of the German literature journal
Monatshefte..." <http://tinyurl.com/45z3mc>

<Professor Kluge has written a beautifully written and insightful look
at the educational process at a small liberal arts college...>
<http://tinyurl.com/3v8cuc>

"Professor Kluge will visit MSL on Tuesday, 2 September, to discuss a
possible collaboration in the future accelerator project..."
<http://tinyurl.com/4om2vd>

"Professor Kluge prescribes a quantity of Epsom salts..."
<http://tinyurl.com/4bsx6f>

Kluge is of course not only a noble name, but also a noble, and perhaps
unrelated, word. One of the word's definitions, put (or perhaps
repeated?) into words by celebrity hacker Eric Raymond
<http://tinyurl.com/6gqclf>, is:

     "A clever programming trick
     intended to solve a particular nasty case
     in an expedient, if not clear, manner.
     Often used to repair bugs."

2008-04-07 Plea for Incompetence

You may have missed our plea for incompetence - specifically for
social scientists to reap and study the rare bounty that's
available right now. The entire tract is at

2008-04-08 Pithy Thought of the Month

"That we are smarter than algae is a given. Whether we are wiser
remains an open question."

-Robert Frenay, in the book Pulse, page 440.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-04-09 Why Bedouin Robes Are Not Gray, Perhaps

Investigator Mike Adams writes, about the report "Why Do Bedouins
Wear Black Robes":

      ***
Many years ago I heard Knut Schmidt-Nielsen, famous for his work
on adaptations to desert conditions, talk about this. He said
that he finally asked the Bedouin why they used black wool. Their
answer was 'all of our goats are black'. So, if the story is
true, they didn't see the decision as one of choice.
      ***

Note: He was referring to:

2008-04-10 Shuffling/Hitching/Scooting/Sliding Poet

The judges have chosen a winner for last month's
Shuffling/Hitching/Scooting/Sliding Limerick Competition, which
asked for a limerick to honor the study "Shuffling, Hitching,
Scooting or Sliding: Some Observations in 30 Otherwise Normal
Children," R. Robson, Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology,
vol. 12, 1970, pp. 608-17.

The winner and her limerick are:

INVESTIGATOR ALANNA COCTOKIN:
Their normal behavior aside,
They scoot and they shuffle or slide.
    Whenever they swerved,
    Doc Robson observed
Who moved, and with what kind of stride.

AND HERE IS THE ASSESSMENT FROM LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:
The kids in this short publication
Are normal, save one aberration.
    They shuffle and hitch,
    Scoot and slide, all of which
Subjects them to some observation.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-04-11 Peat-Bog Man's Intestines Competition

Peat-Bog Man's intestines are the subject of this month's
limerick competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

                * * *

"The Intestines of a More Than 2000 Years Old Peat-Bog Man:
Microscopy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 14C-dating," Hans
St=F8dkilde-J=F8rgensena, Niels Otto Jacobsenb, Esbern Warnckec and
Jan Heinemeierd, Journal of Archaeological Science, vol. 35, no.
3, March 2008, pp. 530-4.
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2007.05.010>
(Thanks to Tom Gill for bringing this to our attention.) The
authors, at Aarhus University, report:

"The intestines of Grauballe Man, who is a 2400-old late Iron Age
body found in a raised bog in the central part of Jutland,
Denmark, was examined by microscopy and magnetic resonance
imaging. Plant roots found in the tissue were radiocarbon dated
by AMS.... The low signal spots observed by MRI turned out to be
formed by plant roots penetrating the tissue. AMS 14C-dating of
these indicated that penetration appeared not more than 200 years
after the body was laid in the bog."

                * * *

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to
the correct address) a free, possibly peaty issue of the Annals
of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per entrant) to:

2008-04-12 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Music Response in a Mental Asylum

This month's specially selected study is:

"A Comparison of the Effects of Hard Rock and Easy Listening on
the Frequency of Observed Inappropriate Behaviors: Control of
Environmental Antecedents in a Large Public Area," Clarke S.
Harris, Richard J. Bradley and Sharon K. Titus, Journal of Music
Therapy, vol. 29,  no. 1, Spring 1992, pp. 6-17. (Thanks to Jim
Cowdery for bringing this to our attention.) The authors explain
that their report:

"Compares the inappropriate behavior of clients in an open
courtyard at a state mental hospital when hard rock and rap music
were played (21 days), followed by easy listening and country
music (21 days).... More inappropriate behavior was observed when
hard rock and rap music were played than when easy listening and
country western music were played."
