2008-09-03 What's New in the Magazine

The September/October 2008 issue (vol. 14, no. 5) is the special
Dots and Spots issue of the Annals of Improbable Research.
Highlights include:

<> "Dots and Spots Research Review"

<> "The Inventive Inventions of Dotts"

<> "Spots Where the Spotted Were Spotted"

The issue will emerge from the printers any day now, and will
appear both in paper and online.
Many back issues are online, too, at

Submitted by investigator Jolinda Smith

Vatalanib

COUNTER-PRODUCTIVELY NAMED DRUG:

Acitac
<http://www.nepalibazar.com/pharma/industries/gd.htm>
Submitted by investigator Elizabeth Palmberg, who says:
"I actually knew someone who was working for the consulting company
that named this drug, and he protested the idea, pointing out that, if
you say it out loud, it sounds like someone's derriere is being
attacked."

More next month.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-05 Ig Nobel Ceremony approaches

On October 2, the ten 2008 Ig Nobel Prize winners - each having
done something that first makes people LAUGH, then makes them
THINK - will be revealed. Coming from four continents, the
winners will step forth at the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, collect
their Prizes, give one-minute acceptance speeches, and assume
their places (whatever those may be) in history.

The live webcast will begin at 7:15 pm Boston time with a pre-
ceremony mini-concert by Paul & Storm. There will also be a live
cablecast at MIT, Gustavus Adolphus College, University of
Wisconsin, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and elsewhere.

INFO: <http://improbable.com/ig/2008/>.

CEREMONY TICKETS:

WEBCAST AND CABLECAST: <http://improbable.com/ig/2008/webcast/>


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-06 More about the Ig

More of what's on tap at the ceremony:

This year's 24/7 Lecturers (each explaining a subject first in 24
seconds, then in seven words) and their topics:

Benoit Mandelbrot: Fractals
Anna Lysyanskaya: Cryptography
Steven Pinker: The Human Mind
Dany Adams: Biology
William Lipscomb: Redundancy

The ceremony will include the Win-a-Date-With-Benoit-Mandelbrot
Contest, and the premiere, for the first time, of the mini-opera
"Redundancy, Again."

Also, several past winners are returning to take a bow.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-07 And a bit more

The Ig Informal Lectures will happen at MIT on Saturday, Oct. 4,
at 1:00 pm. It's free, but seating is limited.
Details: <http://improbable.com/ig/2008/#informal-lectures>


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-08 More Sex From A. Slob

Investigator P.J. Finn complains that we have neglected the once-
popular feature called "Sex From A. Slob." Dr. Slob, investigator
Finn reminds us, is based at Erasmus University, Rotterdam.

To lessen investigator Finn's unhappiness, the series resumes:

SEX FROM  A. SLOB (1)
"Sexual Arousability and the Menstrual Cycle," A. Koos Slob, et
al., Psychoneuroendocrinology. vol. 21, no. 6, August 1996, pp.
545-58.  <http://tinyurl.com/3mvuqp>

SEX FROM A. SLOB (2)
"Age, Libido, and Male Sexual Function," A. Koos Slob, Prostate,
vol. 10, 2000, pp. 9-13.  <http://tinyurl.com/4pwv58>


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-09 Regge Pole Poet

The judges, their cheeks stuffed with crisp bread and tongue,
have chosen a winner for last month's Regge Pole Limerick
Competition, which asked for a limerick to honor the study "What
Can One Do With Regge Poles?" D. Sokolovski, A.Z. Msezane, Z.
Felfli, S.Yu. Ovchinnikov and J.H. Macek, Nuclear Instruments and
Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with
Materials and Atoms, vol. 261, nos. 1-2, August 2007, pp. 133-7.
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2007.04.057>

The winner is INVESTIGATOR R. BURPEE BOHAKER. His limerick:

With Regge poles, what can one do?
Six scientists wish that they knew.
    They looked at some studies
    By fun fuddy-duddies,
And wrote a nice five-page review.

And here's an offering from LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:

Electrons and atoms collide.
Pole analysis, thus, is applied.
    What happens to matter?
    Does it splatter or scatter?
The authors provide, here, a guide.


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-09-10 Tongue Scraper Side-Effect Limerick Competition

Tongue scraper side-effects are the subject of this month's
limerick competition. (Thanks to investigator Kristine Danowski
for bring it to our attention.) To enter, compose an original
limerick that illuminates the nature of this report:

                * * *

"Endocarditis after Use of Tongue Scraper," A.M. Redmond, C.
Meiklejohn, T.J. Kidd, R. Horvath, and C. Coulter, Emerging
Infectious Diseases, vol. 13, no. 9, September 1, 2007, pp. 1440-
1. The authors, at The Prince Charles Hospital, Chermside,
Queensland, Australia and at Pathology Queensland, Herston,
Queensland, Australia, report:

"Tongue scraping is advocated as a therapy for managing halitosis
and as a technique for preventing dental caries by reducing
bacterial counts in the mouth.... We report the case of a woman
in whom infective endocarditis followed the use of a tongue
scraper."

                * * *

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to
the correct address) a free, possibly scraped issue of the Annals
of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per entrant) to:

2008-09-11 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Speed of Sound in Frozen Orange
Juice

This month's specially selected study is:

"Ultrasonic Velocity Measurements in Frozen Model Food
Solutions," Ibrahim G=FClseren and John N. Coupland, Journal of
Food Engineering, vol. 79, no. 3, 2007, pp. 1071-18.
<http://tinyurl.com/48xk72> (Thanks to Bob O'Hara for bringing
this to our attention.) The authors, at Pennsylvania State
University, report:

"The speed of sound was measured in solutions of sucrose (0-70
wt/vol%), glycerol (0-30 wt/vol%) and orange juice (0-40 solids
wt/vol%) as a function of temperature (10 =B0C to -13 =B0C)."
