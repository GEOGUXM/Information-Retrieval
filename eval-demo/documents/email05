2007-08-04 Cold Feet

We have amassed a small collection of provocative research about
cold feet. Here are highlights, without comment or edification.

4, Winter 1975, pp. 475-8.

COLD FEET: BASKETBALLERS
"Surface Temperature, Body Temperature, and Heart Rate as
Affected by Immersing the Feet of Conditioned Basketball Players
in Cold Water Bath," F. L. Jacobsen, Thesis (M.S.), South Dakota
State University, 1968.

COLD FEET: OYSTERS
"Do Oysters Get Cold Feet in Sweden? A Preliminary Report on
Winter Tolerance of Ostrea Edulis Linn=E9, from the Swedish West
Coast," E.M. R=F6dstr=F6m, in N. De Pauw, et al., editors,
Aquaculture: A Biotechnology in Progress, 1989, pp. 361.

COLD FEET: ADVENTURES IN DENTISTRY
"The Journey Back, Part Three. Cold Feet and Warm Sand vs. the

2007-08-06 Star Trek: Ultimate Purpose

Star Trek has fulfilled its ultimate purpose -- a tool to teach
people about Direct Marketing.

So one infers from reading a dispatch by Matt Bailey. Bailey
describes himself as "a speaker and trainer for the Direct
Marketing Association, the American Advertising Federation, and
the Search Engine Strategies Conferences." He writes (at
<http://tinyurl.com/2flwq6>):

           ***
The fun is in finding effective and memorable methods to help
people understand the concepts. One of my favorites is an
analysis of the Red-Shirt Phenomenon in Star Trek. What? You
don't know about the Red Shirt Phenomenon? Well, as any die-hard
Trekkie knows, if you are wearing a red shirt and beam to the
planet with Captain Kirk, you're gonna die. That's the common
thinking, but I decided to put this to the test. ... Unless we
dug into Kirk's personal life, we may never have spotted the
contrast of Kirk's attraction to alien females as it related to
saving red-shirt crewmen's lives.
           ***

(Thanks to investigator Ron Josephson for bringing this to our
attention.)

2007-08-07 Self-Compatible Daffodil Poets

The judges have chosen a winner for last month's Self-Compatible
Daffodil Limerick Competition, which asked for a limerick to
honor the following study:

The winner is INVESTIGATOR HERKY GOTTFRIED, who wrote:

When boy parts and girl parts of plants
Grow closely together by chance,
     "They'll all be inbred,"
     It is usually said,
But this shows it's just happenstance.

A runner-up mention goes to INVESTIGATOR TONY HARKER:

Spare a thought for the humble narcissus
That knows to inbreed's inauspicious.
    By keeping apart
    The bits at its heart
It won't be both Mr. and Mrs.

And here is the latest from Limerick Laureate MARTIN EIGER:

When daffodils contemplate mates,
They ignore certain physical traits.
    The plants seek a means
    For spreading their genes --
Just like people when going on dates.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-08-08 Android Hermetic Melancholia Competition

Hermetic melancholia is the subject of this month's limerick
competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

      "Hermetic Melancholia and the Suffering of Androids,"
      Eric G. Wilson, Esoterica, vol. 8, 2006, pp. 83-111.
      The author explains:
      "Ever since Victoria Nelson published her book on the
      spiritual scope of puppets, many of us have been
      re-thinking our relationship to creatures generally
      ignored or even excoriated by esoteric thinkers."

The article is online at
<http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeVIII/EsotericaVIII.pdf>

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive a (if we manage to send it
to the correct address) a free, possibly melancholic issue of the
Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per
entrant) to:

      ANDROID HERMETIC MELANCHOLIA COMPETITION

2007-08-10 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Aye, Smell! A Rat

Each month we select for your special attention a research report
that seems particularly worth a close read. This month's pick:

"Rats Assess Degree of Relatedness from Human Odors," E. M.
Ables, L. M. Kay, and J. M. Mateo, Physiology and Behavior, vol.
90, no. 5, April 23, 2007, pp. 726-32. (Thanks to Wim Crusio for
bringing this to our attention.) The authors explain:

"Rats were first habituated to a referent human odor and were
then presented with two test odors obtained from individuals
related in different degrees to the referent. Investigation times
for each odor were compared.... For six of ten odor donor
families, rats investigated the odor of the less closely related
individual significantly longer than that of the more closely
related individual, and investigation durations were in the
expected direction for all families."
