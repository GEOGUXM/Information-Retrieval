2008-11-05 Salute to Smets

If you believe in something, but you're not sure how (let alone
how much) to count on your belief, Philippe Smets, of the
Universit=E9 Libre de Bruxelles, is your man.

Professor Smets wrote "Quantifying Beliefs by Belief Functions:
An Axiomatic Justification," P. Smets, Proceedings of the 13th
International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
IJCAI'93, 1993, pp. 598-603.

And Professor Smets coined the word "pignistic," which has
allowed a generation of party-goers (especially party-goers who
go to parties planned to promote the propagation of the phrase
"pignistic probabilities") the pleasure of proposing that other
people proclaim these phrases:

"THE NECESSITY OF THE PIGNISTIC TRANSFORMATION"
"THE GENERALIZED PIGNISTIC TRANSFORMATION"

The phrases come from these two studies:

      "Decision Making in the TBM: The Necessity of
      the Pignistic Transformation," Philippe Smets,
      International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,
      vol. 38, no. 2, February 2005,pp. 133-47.

      "The Generalized Pignistic Transformation," Jean Dezert,
       Florentin Smarandache and Milan Daniel, Proceedings of
      the Seventh International Conference on Information Fusion,
      International Society for Information Fusion,
      Stockholm, Sweden, 2004, pp. 384-91.

2008-11-07 Delicious-Guinea-Pigs Substitute

The judges, themselves sated on Guinea pig, declare that there is
no winner for last month's Delicious Guinea Pigs Limerick
Competition, which asked for a limerick to honor the study
"Delicious Guinea Pigs: Seasonality Studies and the Use of Fat in
the Pre-Columbian Andean Diet," Silvana A. Rosenfeld, Quaternary
International, vol. 180, no. 1, March 2008, pp. 127-34.
<http://tinyurl.com/4ohdgr>.

But... the judges do declare an honorary winner - INVESTIGATOR
CHIP VERES, who writes:

"I tried unsuccessfully to read the article 'Delicious guinea
pigs: Seasonality studies and the use of fat in the pre-Columbian
Andean diet'. And I reply:

      Guinea Pigs are nifty
      But not very thrifty
      To read I must pay
      Thirty-one fifty"

But here's an offering from LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:

This paper explains to us why it
Is safe to skip carbs in your diet.
    Do not eat a rat,
    Cat or bat for your fat,
But a guinea pig. Go ahead, try it!


----------------------------------------------------------
2008-11-08 That-Which-Lurketh-Between Competition

Toe web bacilli are the subject of this month's limerick
competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

      "Toewebs as a Source of Gram-Negative Bacilli,"
      W.C. Noble, et al., Journal of Hospital Infection, vol. 8,
      November 1986, pp. 248-56.  <http://tinyurl.com/6a4pdy>

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to
the correct address) a free, possibly delicious issue of the
Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per
entrant) to:

2008-11-09 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: No Rest for the Healthy

This month's specially selected study is:

"The Well-Made Bed: An Unappreciated Public Health Risk," Robert
Patterson and Christopher Stewart-Patterson, Canadian Medical
Association Journal, vol. 165, no. 12,  December 11, 2001, pp.
1591-2. (Thanks to Francis Turner for bringing this to our
attention.) <http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/165/12/1591.pdf>
Dr. Patterson is a general surgeon at Uintah Basin Medical
Center, Roosevelt, Utah. Dr. Stewart-Patterson is a general
practitioner in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

2008-11-10 TV Disturbs Them

Although our new TV series is getting good reviews, the
dissenters can be most fun to read. The copies on New Scientist's
YouTube channel, especially, have drawn some dismissive comments
(though the viewers there overall rated the videos four-to-five
stars out of five):

      <http://tinyurl.com/6687dj>:

           "yo, that was so random"

           "worst video created"

The newest video features snippets of The Great Inertial Debate
that was held in London. See it at
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DhEJ-VKa9KYs>.
