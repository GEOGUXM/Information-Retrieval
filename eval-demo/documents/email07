2007-07-03 What's New in the Magazine

The July/August issue (vol. 13, no. 4) of the Annals of
Improbable Research will be the special What's in Your Head
issue. It will appear on subscribers doorsteps any day or week
now. Highlights include:

<> "A Rivalry is Joined: Lester vs. Voracek," by Alice Shirell
Kaswell. ABSTRACT: Professor David Lester (of The Richard
Stockton College of New Jersey), who has published almost 2000
scholarly reports, many of them about suicide and most of them
brief, now has a young rival. He is Martin Voracek of the
University of Vienna.

<> Against Ipecac* --Alice Shirell Kaswell. ABSTRACT: Among
doctors, ipecac-the medication with the most enjoyable name to
say aloud-has fallen from favor. Here are two reports describing
what happened.

<> POEM: "The Fruit Fly (Genotype: nevermore)," by Jennifer
Sosnowski. ABSTRACT: This is a poem based on Edgar Allen Poe's
original. Unlike Poe's, it ideals with fruit flies and research
grants. Like Poe's, it is surprisingly long.

2007-07-04 A Fly Based on a Theory

Investigators Sally Shelton passes on news from investigator
Robin Leech, who passes on news from an entomologists'
discussion:

"Neil Evenhuis described a new species of bee fly (Bombyliidae)
from the US Southwest. It is named Phthiria relativitae, n.sp.
pronounced Theory O' Relativity."

Dr. Evenhuis is past president of the International Commission on
Zoological Nomenclature. This naming is, we are told, unrelated
to his no longer being president. Further info about the naming
(and a subsequent de-naming) appears in Discover magazine
<http://tinyurl.com/yon2rp>.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-07-05 Apology to Professor Lester

We apologize to Professor David Lester of The Richard Stockton
College of New Jersey. Professor Lester and his voluminous work
were the subject of the magazine's special Rivalry issue (vol.
13, no. 3, May/June 2007). Also see <http://tinyurl.com/2nkbrf>
and <http://tinyurl.com/2gp77d>. We described him as the author
of "approximately 1500 published studies."

This week we received a note from Professor Lester. It reads:

You have to stop "short-changing" me.
1,000 articles!!!!!!
I'm over 2200 articles, chapters and books.

Best wishes,
David Lester

Hereafter we will try, in our ongoing coverage of Professor
Lester's work, to be more accurate. Professor Lester kindly
included a list of all his more than 2200 publications. We are
trying to find a way to fit this list into a future issue of the
magazine. Some reduction in font size may be necessary.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-07-06 Many Say "Mono"

Sturm and bombast dominated the voting for what, officially, to
call the category of professors who have only one name.

Inspired by the MIT professor named Arvind, the vote offered a
choice of these three:

(A) mono-professor
(B) uni-professor
(C) just plain professor-professor

Voters pointed out a problem with (B) uni-professor: the title
already exists in many places, usually as an abbreviation for
"university professor." Few voted for (C) just plain professor-
professor. The winner, now the official name for the breed, is
(A) mono-professor. Mono-professors will be listed on the same
web page as the professor-professors.

Thus Professor Arvind becomes the first officially recognized
mono-professor.

The second is Professor Professor Kinshuk, of whom we learned in
the following note:

INVESTIGATOR SALLY JO CUNNINGHAM:
I'd like to point out a known mono-prof, Professor Kinshuk
(http://infosys.massey.ac.nz/~kinshuk/), formerly in New Zealand,
now in Canada.  Kinshuk genuinely has only the one name, which
causes no end of trouble in filling out forms.  A friend was once
privileged to fly with him on Air New Zealand, and has a
wonderful routine describing Kinshuk's interactions with the
AirNZ woman as she attempted to fathom that he is Kinshuk, no
other name.  Then my friend, Masood Masoodian, stepped up to get
his ticket...

Harrumphing in from London came this note from the Poet
Hirschorn:

INVESTIGATOR NORBERT HIRSCHHORN:
Mono Professor Caveat: Indonesians mostly have only one name, and
so expect a flood of nominees. I vote against the whole self-
serving idea.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-07-07 A Computer Science Approach to the Problem

Complexity can arise almost anywhere. The following note is an
example. INVESTIGATOR FREDRIK VIKLAND writes:

Borrowing terms and ideas from name resolution in the C++
programming language, the term "professor professor" can be seen
as a shorthand declaration of a professor constructor. The
twofold "professor" can be  seen as type specifiers declaring
that the two following names are both of the type "professor".

A statement such as "professor professor Fawzy Fawzy" thus tells
our brain that there is a professor having Fawzy both as his
first and his last name. After this statement, our brain can
refer to that professor as "Fawzy", "professor Fawzy", "professor
Fawzy Fawzy" or "professor professor Fawzy Fawzy" as appropriate
from the context. The closer you are to the professor, and the
more professor Fawzys you have to keep in mind at the same time,
the more specific you have to be.

Thus, the correct way of naming a single named professor
professor, such as Arvind, is:

"professor professor Arvind (void)" or "professor professor
(void) Arvind" depending on if you are required to call him by
first or last name. Fortunately this only has to be done the
first time. The following times, he may be referenced to as
"professor Arvind."

The length of the above discussion may give a hint to why
computer scientists for a long time have had a relaxed attitued
about naming, declaring and calling professors. This is also
supported by the fact that Arvind is a professor of Computer
Science and Engineering.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-07-08 Ant-Crowding Poets

The judges have chosen a winner for last month's Ant-Crowding
Competition Limerick Competition, which asked for a limerick to
honor the following study:

"Optimal Traffic Organization in Ants
Under Crowded Conditions,"
A. Dussutour, V. Fourcassi=E9, D. Helbing and
J.-L. Deneubourg, Nature, 2004, vol. 428, pp. 70=963.

The winner is INVESTIGATOR TONY HARKER, who created a rare
limerick about dyslexic ants:

To scientists we just say "scram."
We can't move but don't give a damn.
    There is a cure for it (*)
    But we all ingore it,
For all know that ants love a jam.

(*) see the report "Optimal Traffic Organization
in Ants Under Crowded Conditions"

And here is the latest from Limerick Laureate MARTIN EIGER:

Guys from Germany, Belgium, and France
Study traffic congestion with ants.
    Their conclusions provide
    That ants need to collide --
Only then can the traffic advance.

Some of the runner-up limericks are posted at
<http://improbable.com/2007/07/31/three-ant-crowding-limericks/>


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-07-09 Self-Compatible Daffodil Competition

A self-compatible daffodil is the subject of this month's
limerick competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

"Herkogamy and Mating Patterns in the Self-Compatible
Daffodil Narcissus longispathus," M=F3nica Medrano,
Carlos M. Herrera and Spencer C.H. Barrett, Annals of
Botany, vol. 95, no. 7, 2005, pp. 2005, pp. 1105-11.
<http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/7/1105>

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem is in classic, trips-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive a (if we manage to send it
to the correct address) a free, possibly rhomboid issue of the
Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per
entrant) to:

2007-07-11 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: What's Hot in Shoes

Each month we select for your special attention a research report
that seems particularly worth a close read. This month's pick:

"Effect of Shoe Color on Shoe Temperature and Potential Solar
Injury to the Insensate Foot," P.A. DeLuca, W.P. Goforth, Journal
of the American Podiatric Medical Association, vol. 88, no. 7,
July 1998, pp. 344-8. The authors, who are at Scott and White
Clinic and Memorial Hospital, Temple, Texas, explain what they
did:

"The authors compared shoes of different colors in terms of the
amount by which their temperature increased when subjected to
radiant heat. Three trials of temperature measurements were
performed for white and black leather walking shoes. A balloon
filled with water was placed in the shoe and the surface
temperature of the balloon was measured at baseline and after the
shoe had been exposed to an infrared heat lamp for 15- and 30-
minute periods. The results were significant: The mean increase
in temperature after 15 minutes of exposure was between 4.0
degrees F and 8.8 degrees F greater in the black shoe than in the
white shoe."
