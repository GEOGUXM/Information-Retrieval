2007-06-02 Imminent Events

AUSTRALIA:
The Improbable Australia tour will happen the last two weeks of
August, with events in Tasmania and possibly also in Sydney.
Details will be posted soon at

2007-06-03 What's New in the Magazine

The May/June issue (vol. 13, no. 3) of the Annals of Improbable
Research is the special Rivalry issue. Highlights include:

<> "Voracek's Variety," by Alice Shirell Kaswell.
ABSTRACT: Martin Voracek published more than 100 studies. Here is a
sampling of Dr. Voracek's published research on a variety of topics.

<> TITLE: "Tips from a Master," by Alice Shirell Kaswell.
ABSTRACT: Suicidologist David Lester (of The Richard Stockton College
of New Jersey), author of almost 2000 academic reports, wrote a letter
to the Chronicle of Higher Education, which is summarized here. The
letter disparages academics who do not accomplish as much as Professor
Lester does. Professor Lester explains how he avoids wasting his own
time and how he enjoys the finer aspects of life.

TITLE: "Boys Will Be Boys," by Katherine Lee.
ABSTRACT: Research by and for adolescent males of all ages and sexes.
TOPICS INCLUDE: homeland security reaches the anus; many means of
obtaining malodors; the economics of strategic virginity loss; flaccus-
bull; underwear-inside views; defecation and tight clothes; mammoth,
sloth dung; swimsuit, sweater and a math test

2007-06-04 Peanut Butter Research (1)

Here is another in our series of meaningfully meaningless micro-
studies.

SUBJECT: The popularity of conserves for scientific research
AUTHORS: John Bell, Irenka Suto and Rita Nadas -- University of
Cambridge
AIM: To identify which fruit conserve is most popular with
researchers _
METHODOLOGY: The name of a range of conserves was typed in to
Google scholar and the number of hits was recorded.
RESULTS: The number of hits in descending order were:

23,400 -- Peanut Butter
21,000 -- Chocolate Spread
03,610 -- Marmalade
02,660 -- Strawberry Jam
02,330 -- Plum Jam
01,320 -- Raspberry Jam
00,381 -- Blackcurrant Jam
00,304 -- Gooseberry Jam

CONCLUSION: Researchers write most about peanut butter. Further
research is needed into the social and environmental impacts of
this study.
DISCLAIMER: No toast was consumed in the conduct of this
research.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-06-05 Peanut Butter Research (2)

A team from the University of Edinburgh converts peanut butter
into diamonds. They are mounting an exhibit at the Royal Society
in London. Details are, directly or indirectly, at
<http://tinyurl.com/25xxq9>.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-06-06 Classification Classification Problem

Following the micro-wave of (two) complaints about the professor-
professor project (see last month's mini-AIR), INVESTIGATOR
SHANKAR UNNI writes :
           ***
Since everyone seems to be tiring of "Professor Professors", how about
going the other way -- looking for single-named professors. Depending
on how you choose to look at it, the single name could be considered
either a first name or a last name, or both.

Here's a start: Prof. Arvind. Just Arvind.
His home page is at http://csg.csail.mit.edu/Users/arvind/

           ***
And so there's a decision-and-a-half to be made. Ought single-named
professors be classed as professor-professors? If so, should we give a
special name to this sub-specialty?

If you have a strong opinion, please vote for one of these:

(A) mono-professor
(B) uni-professor
(C) just plain professor-professor

2007-06-07 Video Poker for the Master

After hundreds of hours of research, Todd Mateer determined that
if you quit your job to play video poker full-time in South
Carolina, you won't do too well. For this work, Mateer was
awarded a master's degree from Clemson University in 1999.

Details are trumpeted in a press release at
<http://tinyurl.com/ysxlk4>. An early version of the study is at
<http://tinyurl.com/18r>.

(Thanks to investigator Charles Bergquist for bringing this to
our attention.)


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-06-08 Rhomboid Intramembrane Protease Poets

The judges have chosen a winner for last month's Rhomboid
Intramembrane Protease Limerick Competition, which asked for a
limerick to honor the following study:

      "Enzymatic Analysis of a Rhomboid Intramembrane Protease
      Implicates Transmembrane Helix 5 as the Lateral Substrate
      Gate," Rosanna P. Baker, Keith Young, Liang Feng,
      Yigong Shi and Sinisa Urban, Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences, vol. 104, no. 20, May 15, 2007,
      pp. 8257-62.

The winner is INVESTIGATOR LEILA HADJ-CHIKH, who limerickisized
thus:

A rhomboidal enzyme can stall
When working a membranous wall.
    The protease waits
    At helical gates,
And then there's no problem at all!

And here is the latest from Limerick Laureate MARTIN EIGER:

Hydrolysis happens, but how's it
The cellular membrane allows it?
   There's a serine, recessed.
   Hey, who would have guessed?
This paper explains it.  Go browse it.


----------------------------------------------------------
2007-06-09 Ant Crowding Competition

Ant Crowding is the subject of this month's limerick competition.
To enter, compose an original limerick that illuminates the
nature of this report:

      "Optimal Traffic Organization in Ants
      Under Crowded Conditions,"
      A. Dussutour, V. Fourcassi=E9, D. Helbing and
      J.-L. Deneubourg, Nature, 2004, vol. 428, pp. 70=963.

RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your
poem adheres to classic limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive a (if we manage to send it
to the correct address) a free, possibly rhomboid issue of the
Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per
entrant) to:

      ANT CROWDING COMPETITION

2007-06-10 The Secret to Success

What is the secret to success? The current issue of the journal
BJU International includes a special section that might, just
might, give the key:

"Overactive Bladder: The Path to Successful Outcomes,"
BJU International, vol. 99 no. s3, June 2007, pp. 1-16.

2007-06-12 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Waffles and Age

Each month we select for your special attention a research report
that seems particularly worth a close read. This month's pick:

      "Differences in Perception of Sweet and
      Savoury Waffles Between Elderly and Young Subjects,"

      and Preference, January 2007, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 106=9616.
      The authors report that:

      "The observed texture flavour interaction effect
      was not different for the elderly and young...
      [but] the young were more efficient in chewing."
