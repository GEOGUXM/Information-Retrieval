2010-01-03 The Magazine: Delayed Issue, Imminent Planes

The special Ig Nobel issue of the magazine got stuck at the
printer. Something went very wrong there. We've been told the
magazine finally did go into the mail yesterday. US subscribers
should be receiving it over the next few days, subscribers
elsewhere after a lilting snail-mail delay.

We apologize for this delay. We and the printer will work hard to
keep such a thing from happening again. The Jan/Feb issue, the
special Beards & Bagels & Paper Airplanes issue, should be making
its way into the world, more timely-ly a few weeks from now.

Read many back issues online at:
<http://www.improbable.com/magazine/>.


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-04 The Club for Bald Scientists

Bald scientists now have a place of their own.

The Luxuriant Former Hair Club for Scientists (LFHCfS) is a club
for scientists who have a luxuriant head of former hair.

LFHCfS is a conjoined-twin organization to the Luxuriant Flowing
Hair Club for Scientists (LFHCfS). The two clubs share their
acronym, in heady exhilaration.

Henceforth, scientists who have lots of hair and scientists who
had lots of hair can rejoice together, and bask in universal
admiration.

Mitch Dushay become the first member of the Luxuriant Former Hair
Club for Scientists. See Mitch and his head at
<http://improbable.com/2010/01/10/mitch-dushay-joins-lfhcfs>

And see new Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists member
Joanne Manaster and her hair at
<http://improbable.com/2010/01/13/joanne-manaster-joins-jfhcfs>

Want to join LFHCfS? Here's how:

----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-05 Nature Loves a Mystery

Nature magazine (in the person of Katharine Sanderson) has joined
us (and gone beyond us) in trying to solve the mystery of
Scientific Research Publishing, a journals publisher that
presents old studies as if they are new. Here's Nature's report
(which requires a subscription):
<http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100113/full/463148a.html>

For background, see
<http://improbable.com/2010/01/07/strange-journals-scam-update-2>


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-06 Ig in San Diego Feb 19

Two new Ig Nobel Prize winners and two past Ig winners will
headline the show at the AAAS Annual Meeting next month.

Topics include: invention of the emergency bra/facemask; 60 years
of knuckle-cracking; string inevitably tangling itself into
knots; romantic love being biochemically indistinguishable from
obsessive-compulsive disorder; a Ph.D dancing her dissertation;
the history of how Murphy's Law got its name; and a physician's
appreciation of objects found in her patients' rectums.

The show is at the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina, in the
Seaview Room, Friday night, Feb 19, starting at 8:00. This event
(unlike most of the AAAS meeting) will be open to the public,
free. Bring friends, and get there early. It always overflows.

See the lineup at <http://improbable.com/improbable-research-shows/complete=
-schedule/>


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-07 Blog Burgeoning

You can now write comments on the Improbable blog
<http://improbable.com>. Thanks to the many of you who patiently
(and in a few cases not so patiently) suggested it.

And we're posting more items every day.

And some impressively new Improbable bloggers are joining the
mix, beginning with Martin Gardiner. Martin is the founder of
Really Magazine; he is also our Buenos Aires Desk Chief. Other
Improbable bloggers will be leaping in soon.


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-08 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Mediocrity in the Hedges

This month's specially selected study is:

"How Smart Are the Smart Guys? A Unique View from Hedge Fund
Stock Holdings," John M. Griffin and Jin Xu, SSRN research
924242, March 2007. <http://bit.ly/74Isy2> The authors, at the
University of Texas at Austin, report:

"We provide the first comprehensive examination of hedge funds'
long-equity positions and the performance of these stock
holdings.... Overall, our study raises serious questions about
the proficiency of hedge fund managers."


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-09 Mad Honey Sex Poet

The judges have chosen a winner in the Mad Honey Sex Limerick
Competition, which asked for a limerick to honor the study "Mad
Honey Sex: Therapeutic Misadventures From an Ancient Biological
Weapon," Ahmet Demircan, et al., Annals of Emergency Medicine,
2009. <http://bit.ly/7OgfWn>

The winner is INVESTIGATOR LESLIE ROSENBLOOD, who wrote:

Alternative "doctors" use honey
To part middle aged men from their money.
   "It's not poison," they say,
   "You'll have sex every day!"
As though fainting and barfing were funny.

Here's the offering from LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:

It wasn't for love or for money,
I had me some badass mad honey.
   The sex was fantastic,
   Orgasmic and spastic.
The symptoms thereafter? Not funny.

The judges note that the honey/money/funny troika figured in more
than half the submitted entries. See some of the runners-up at
<http://improbable.com/2010/01/21/mad-honey-runners-up>


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-10 Four-Horodecki Entanglement Competition

Quantum entanglement and four Horodeckis inspire this month's
limerick competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report (suggested by investigators
David F. Austin and David Pendlebury):

"Quantum Entanglement," Ryszard Horodecki, Pawel Horodecki,
Michal Horodecki and Karol Horodecki, Reviews of Modern Physics,
vol. 81, no. 2, 2009, pp. 865-942. <http://bit.ly/4ENWEo> The
authors, at the University of Gdansk, Poland, report:

"All our former experience with application of quantum theory
seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must
occur in the laboratory.... However, it appears that this new
resource is complex and difficult to detect.... The basic role of
entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is
emphasized."

RULES: Please make sure that: (1) your rhymes actually do; and
(2) your poem is in classic, trills-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to
the correct address) a free, perhaps entangled, high-res PDF
issue of the Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one
entry per entrant) to:

        FOUR-HORODECKI ENTANGLEMENT LIMERICK COMPETITION

----------------------------------------------------------
2010-01-11 Big Bank Theory and the Big Bank Opera

We've made a nicely edited (and captioned) video version of "The
Big Bank Opera." The 4-act mini-opera premiered at the recent Ig
Nobel Prize ceremony. (Act 3 is the epic song "The Big Bank
Theory.")

The opera stars Maria Ferrante, Ben Sears, and Branden Grimmett.

Supporting cast, in non-singing roles, includes: Benoit
Mandelbrot, Stephen Wolfram, John Barrett, Wade Adams;  Nobel
laureates Rich Roberts, Wolfgang Ketterle, Dudley Herschbach,
Paul Krugman, Roy Glauber, Frank Wilczek, Martin Chalfie, Orhan
Pamuk, and William Lipscomb; and many Ig Nobel Prize winners.

2010-01-13 MAY WE RECOMMEND: Do Dogs Do Calculus?
