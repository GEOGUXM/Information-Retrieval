issue) online, and/or subscribe to the fully tangible paper
version, at: <http://www.improbable.com/magazine/>.


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-02 World Cup's Mental Depths

The current World Cup tournament, like its predecessors, may
never be fully understood. A study about the 1990 tournament
demonstrates how a state of deep confusion can arise and persist:

"Scotland's Tartan Army in Italy: The Case for the
Carnivalesque," Richard Giulianotti, The Sociological Review,
vol. 39, no. 3, August 1991, pp. 503-27.
<http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347933/abstract>

"This short paper seeks to explain the activities of Scottish
fans in Genoa and Turin, during the 1990 World Cup, by drawing on
some key concepts offered by contemporary writers in the field of
post-modernism and post-structuralism. These writers include
Foucault, Derrida, Barthes and Baudrillard. All emphasize a re-
empowerment of agency, evading more conventional forms of
domination: Foucault within the domain of enabling discourse,
Derrida on the open interpretation of the sign's apparent
meaning, Barthes on the 'nature' of jouissance and the body
principle, and Baudrillard on the public toying with their media
representation...."


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-03 Planetary Medical Stars (2)

Astronomers-of-a-sort sent some additional stars for the all-star
team of physicians with planetary family names (for the original
team, see last month's mini-AIR).

Enid Rose Neptune, MD, of Johns Hopkins <http://bit.ly/bD2DBX>
(Thanks to investigator Max Hailperin for bringing Dr. N to our
attention.)

Michael G. Mercury <http://bit.ly/bD2DBX>
(Thanks to investigator Norbert Hirschorn for bringing Dr. M to
our attention, and demonstrating that he is, at least according
to some documentation, an MD.)


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-04 Ig Nobel Tickets Will Go on Sale Aug 1

Tickets for the 20th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony will go
on sale August 1. We expect they will sell out quickly this year
- so consider yourself warned.

Ceremony info: <http://improbable.com/ig/2010/>


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-05 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Cosmic Mothballs

This month's specially selected study is:

"Simple Linear Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules and the
Infrared Emission Features - Mothballs in the Orion Ridge?"
Duley, W. W.; Jones, A. P., Astrophysical Journal, Part 2 -
Letters (ISSN 0004-637X), vol. 351, March 10, 1990, p. L49-L52.
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...351L..49D>
The authors report:

"It is shown that the IR emission spectrum in objects as the
Orion ridge is compatible with the presence of two- to five-ring
linear PAH species in amorphous carbons (specifically, the
derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and perhaps
pentacene). An origin for these molecules in carbon dust is
indicated and is consistent with the structure of laboratory
hydrogenated amorphous carbons."


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-06 Dirty Word Usage Poet

The judges have chosen a winner in the Dirty Word Usage Limerick
Competition, which asked for a limerick to honor the study "Sex
Roles and Dirty Word Usage: A Review of the Literature and a
Reply to Haas," Timothy B. Jay, Psychological Bulletin, vol.  88,
no. 3, November 1980, pp. 614-21.  <http://bit.ly/9BqtWU>

The winner is INVESTIGATOR John Jermey who wrote:

I wrote a love letter to Brenda;
I phrased it in accents so tender.
   But now I'm in jail
   And they've just refused bail,
'Cos profanity varies with gender.

Here's the offering from LIMERICK LAUREATE MARTIN EIGER:

Which sex uses dirty words more?
Women? Men? Both the same? What's the score?
   She says same. He says men.
   Who is right? Then again,
Were it men, he'd have called her a whore.


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-07 Active Nonsense-Mediated Competition

Now-old new insights into nonsense inspire this month's limerick
competition. To enter, compose an original limerick that
illuminates the nature of this report:

"New Insights into the Formation of Active Nonsense-Mediated Decay
Complexes," Guramrit Singh and Jens Lykke-Andersen, Trends in
Biochemical Sciences, vol. 28, no. 9, September 2003, pp. 464-6.
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0968-0004(03)00176-2> The authors are at
the University of Colorado at Boulder.

RULES: Please make sure that: (1) your rhymes actually do; and
(2) your poem is in classic, trills-off-the-tongue limerick form.

PRIZE: The winning poet will receive (if we manage to send it to the
correct address) a free, perhaps no, hinsensiclgh-res PDF issue of the
Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per entrant) to:

        ACTIVE NONSENSE-MEDIATED LIMERICK COMPETITION

2010-06-08 Davian Behavior: A New Report

Davian behavior creeps yet again into the scientific literature:

"The Corpse Bride: a case of Davian Behaviour in the Green Ameiva
(Ameiva ameiva) in southeastern Brazil," Henrique Caldeira Costa,
Emanuel Teixeira da Silva, Pollyanna Silva Campos, Marina Paula
da Cunha Oliveira, Andr=E9 Valle Nunes and Patr=EDcia da Silva
Santosm, Herpetology Notes, volume 3: 079-083 (2010). The
authors, at several institutions in Brazil, report:

"Herein, we report necrophilia (Davian behaviour) in the lizard
Ameiva ameiva in Brazilian Atlantic Forest Domain. A male A.
ameiva was found during a sunny day courting and trying to
copulate with a road-killed female. The presence of developed
ovarian follicles confirmed that the female was in breeding
condition. The female probably died while making a chemical trail
to attract reproductive males. Apparently the male's behaviour
was influenced by the high temperature of the female's body that
was warmed up by the heat of the sun. Although Davian behaviour
is not expected to occur frequently, a high number of dead
reproductive females in Brazilian roads could result in a high
frequency of necrophilia in A. ameiva."

The full report, including photos, at <http://bit.ly/c5fdHV>


----------------------------------------------------------
2010-06-09 Beyond Davian: Limerick-Inspired Technical Terms?

The curious term "Davian", which is now generally used in the
biological literature, originated in a limerick. Wikipedia gives
some of its history:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davian_behavior>

Question:
Are there other, widely accepted, scientific terms that
originated in limericks? If you know of one, please send us
details.

BACKGROUND NOTE: Kees Moeliker, author of the first
scientifically recorded report of homosexual necrophilia in the
mallard duck <http://bit.ly/9NNN12>, became, maybe inevitably,
the central collecting point for reports on animal Davian
behavior.
