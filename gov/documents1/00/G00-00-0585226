                  Workshop on Laboratory Spectroscopy Needs
                           for Atmospheric Sensing
                  San Diego, California, 23-26 October 2001
                     Chair: Michael Kurylo, NASA / NIST
      Organizer: Ken Jucks, SAO / Harvard, and Bhaswar Sen, NASA / JPL

 The workshop will provide a forum for discussion of a broad range of topics
                 in laboratory spectroscopy required to meet
     the needs of remote sensing and in-situ measurements of the Earth's
                        atmosphere. Invited talks are
scheduled focusing on the various spectral regions: microwave, far infrared,
    near and mid-infrared, and ultraviolet/visible, as well as aerosols.
Contributed posters are welcome -- poster sessions will be held for two days
                         during the conference week.
               Posters will be displayed for the entire week.
