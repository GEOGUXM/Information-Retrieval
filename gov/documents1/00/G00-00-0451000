   Global Hydrology and Climate Center, a joint venture between government
   and academia to study the global water cycle and its effect on weather
   and climate

   Research
   The GHCC's many areas of study are closely related to each other. Like
   the climate and environment we study, no one aspect stands alone; all
   connect in a complex, interactive Earth-Atmosphere system. This is what
   makes our work both challenging and intriguing. Below are some of our
   areas of research:
     * Understanding the Global Water Cycle.
     * What Microwaves teach us about the atmosphere.
     * Observing lightning from space.
     * How satellites observe changes in atmospheric aerosols and their
       effects on the climate.
     * Measuring atmospheric winds with lasers.
     * The urban environment.
     * Learning from the past.

   Education
   One of the most important aspects of environmental research is
   developing a sense of stewardship among the young people who will
   inherit the problems and solutions we are developing today. In addition
   to a graduate degree program in atmospheric science through the
   University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), the GHCC has several
   education outreach programs to mentor future scientists and to
   cultivate awareness among tomorrow's taxpayers and voters. More

   Data
   Satellites continually record information about the earths surface and
   atmosphere, and send large volumes of data (gigabytes per day) back to
   data processing and archiving centers. The GHCCs data processing and
   archive center is the Global Hydrology Resource Center. The GHRC
   collects data from many different satellites, surface ground validation
   stations, as well as high altitude aircraft outfitted with science
   instruments. We also offer an extensive set of geostationary weather
   satellite images. More Information

   Climate Impacts
   While much of our climate research has long-term goals, the data
   collected can also be applied to help solve near-term problems.
   Recently, the GHCC initiated an effort to apply NASA remote sensing
   data and technologies to issues of local and regional concern. These
   include the vulnerability to climate change and the evaluation of the
   potential social, economic, and human effects on agriculture, forests,
   fisheries, local natural ecosystems, and water resources. More
