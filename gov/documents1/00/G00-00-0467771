  Information Infrastructure Task Force Logo

   The White House formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF)
   in 1993 to articulate and implement the Administration's vision for the
   National Information Infrastructure (NII). The task force consisted of
   high-level representatives of the Federal agencies that play a major
   role in the development and application of information and
   telecommunications technologies.

   Working together with the private sector, the IITF has fulfilled the
   goals set forth by the White House, and the Task Force no longer
   convenes.

   To learn more about the modern National Information Infrastructure
   (NII), sometimes called the "information superhighway," visit the NII
   Virtual Library.
