   College Students Interested in LLNL 2002 Internships
   When considering research internships at LLNL for 2002, you should
   access the Lab's home page for information about our Science &
   Technology research areas. The two main programs for college student
   internships are STEP's Critical Skills Internships and the Scholars
   Summer Employment Program. Examples of recent students' research is
   available from the Student Portfolio. In addition to research
   experience, LLNL college interns will have the opportunity to attend
   lectures, tours, socials, etc. as described in LLNL's Electronic
   Student Bulletin Board. For additional information about research
   employment for college students at LLNL, contact Barry Goldman
   (goldman1@llnl.gov), STEP manager for college internships at (925)
   422-5177.
   Science on Saturday
   STEP and the Livermore Chapter of Sigma Xi will again sponsor the
   Science on Saturday (SOS) lecture and demonstration series. This year's
   SOS will take place on five consecutive Saturdays from February 2nd
   through March 2nd. LLNL scientists along with local high school
   teachers will cover topics ranging from astrophysics, medical
   technologies, to robotics. SOS lectures are intended for students from
   6th grade through high school. As in previous years, the location will
   be LLNL's Building 123 Auditorium from 9:30 am to 11:00 am. There is no
   charge for attendance. Seating is on a first come first serve basis and
   there is no pre-registration.
