   REAL-TIME WRF
   FORECASTS

     The overall goal of the WRF Model project is to develop a
     next-generation mesoscale forecast model and assimilation system
     that will advance both the understanding and prediction of important
     mesoscale precipitation systems, and promote closer ties between the
     research and operational forecasting communities.  The model is
     being developed as a collaborative effort among several NSF, Dept of
     Commerce, and DoD sponsored institutions, together with the
     participation of a number of university scientists.




                         [new.gif] Upcoming Meeting

     We are holding a WRF Planning Meeting at NCEP (Camp Springs, MD) on
   13-14 February, 2002. Information for travel arrangements is available,
     and an RSVP for an approximate number of attendees is appreciated.

                           WRF Real-Time Forecasts

    There are several real-time forecast sites running WRF. AFWA (45 km),
    NCAR (22 and 10 km), NOAA, and NSSL (34 km) are on board to cover the
   US, and now we have forecasts over Italy and the Balkans (20 km)! There
    are daily precipitation verification maps and comparative model skill
            scores for the US. Let us know when yours is set up!


                           WRF Related References

    We are starting our WRF related references. If you have a paper, Word
    file, link to some HTML location, whatever, send it in. Check out the
    DOCUMENTATION/PRESENTATIONS section at the top, though the references
   are mostly about the WRF design and implementation. Got something about
    a solver, physics package, initialization or post-processing? Help us
                            fill this section up.
