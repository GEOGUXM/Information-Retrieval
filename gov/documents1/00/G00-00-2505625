       Release.
     * When we use the word "plasma", we are (usually) referring to a
       collection of atoms where the kinetic energy of the particles is
       sufficient to cause a significant fraction of the electrons to be
       ripped off of the atoms, leaving the electrons (and ions) free to
       move about. Typically, this occurs at temperatures higher than
       10,000 degrees.
