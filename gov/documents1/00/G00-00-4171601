   Welcome to ODIN

   The Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA, or ODIN, is NASA's
   innovative approach to desktop computing and communications support.
   Through ODIN, NASA and other forward-thinking federal agencies have
   embraced a new paradigm in information technology management; one which
   focuses your civil service workforce on mission-related activities,
   leverages the experience and flexibility of the commercial sector, and
   reduces the costs of providing these services to your customers!

   With ODIN you have the flexibility to decide what services and service
   levels are best for your agency; NASA provides the contract vehicle,
   and you determine the support requirements. ODIN is not a concept, it
   is a reality.

   Imagine:
     * Knowing exactly how much your IT and communications costs are on a
       monthly basis,
     * No longer having to dedicate staff to 'chasing technology';
     * Having a single, 24x7 Help Desk with toll-free access, and
     * Buying only the IT services you need, for only as long as you need
       them!

   We encourage you to have a look at ODIN; browse through our web site,
   and examine the contract. Then give us a call, and we'll be happy to
   share our experience in this new way of providing information
   technology support in the federal government.
