   FEMCI Workshop 2002 will be held about the third or fourth week of May.
   Due to the recent security changes, no conferences will be held on
   center at GSFC. Therefore, we are moving the Workshop off center. This
   means there will be a nominal charge for the workshop. We are hoping to
   keep it in the range of $100/person.

   The format will also change. We expanded the workshop to a day and a
   half in 2001. This will fall back to one day, but we plan on having
   concurrent sessions throughout the day. Also, since there will be a
   charge for the workshop, lunch will be provided to participants. More
   inforation will be posted as it comes available.

   FEMCI Random & Sine Vibration, and Validity Check pages in the FEMCI
   Book have been expanded and updated. New information on Miles' Equation
   has been added and the NASTRAN vibe example problems have been updated
   from UAI/NASTRAN to MSC.NASTRAN 2001. Take a look!

   FEMCI Workshop 2001

                       FEMCI Workshop a Success!

      FEMCI and Code 542 want to say Thank You to everyone who attended the
      FEMCI Workshop 2001 and helped make it a success. The two-day format
      was well received and facilitated discussions between attendees. We
      already have several ideas on making the workshop even better for next
      year.

      Visit the Workshop website for information on online publication of
      presentations
