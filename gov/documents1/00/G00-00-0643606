      In the stratosphere, the region of the Earth's atmosphere from 6 to
   30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) above the surface, the chemical compound
     ozone plays a vital role in absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation
       from the sun. During the past 20 years, concentrations of this
    important compound have been threatened by human-made gases released
     into the atmosphere, including those known as CFCs. These chemical
     compounds as well as meteorological conditions in the stratosphere
     affect the concentration of stratospheric ozone.   Sunrise over the

   NOAA uses satellite, airborne and ground-based systems to continuously
      monitor stratospheric ozone as well as the chemical compounds and
    atmospheric conditions that affect its concentration. NOAA's Aeronomy
     Laboratory, Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, Climate
    Prediction Center and the National Climatic Data Center are actively
     involved in monitoring and research, which enhances the scientific
   understanding of ozone and the processes affecting its concentration in
       the stratosphere. This site provides information on these NOAA
   organizations, links to current and historical stratospheric ozone and
   climate data as well as information on the science of ozone. A list of
        NOAA representatives, recent ozone-related press releases and
     frequently asked questions are also provided via the pulldown menu
                                   above.
