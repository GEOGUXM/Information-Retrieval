   Those of us who live in California derive great benefit from the
   state's natural resources. With that benefit comes the responsibility
   to use and preserve our resources wisely, with both the economy and the
   environment in mind. The Department of Conservation works toward this
   goal through its programs to safeguard farmland and open space
   resources, regulate oil, gas and geothermal wells, study and map
   earthquakes, landslides and mineral resources, ensure reclamation of
   land used for mining, and promote beverage container recycling.
