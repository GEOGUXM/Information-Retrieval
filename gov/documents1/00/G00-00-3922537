                                  Introduction

   bunk bed fire
     __________________________________________________________________

   This bunk bed fire was a test performed at NIST in order to measure the
   heat release rate. To learn more about this and other fire test cases,
   view this web page.

   Fire on the Web is a companion to the FAST software developed by the
   Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) at NIST. These Web pages
   provide links to fire related software, experimental fire data and
   mpeg/quick time movies of fire tests that can be downloaded and/or
   viewed with a Web browser.

                             Fire resources at NIST

  Publications

     * Report on the Simulation of the Dynamics of the Fire at 3146 Cherry
       Road NE Washington D.C., May 30, 1999
     * BFRL Publications Online - A collection of recent publications
       (since 1993) available for free download published by and for BFRL
       staff.
     * Factsheets, providing fire safety information especially for people
       living in manufactured housing.
     * FIREDOC , a web searchable database of publications in the Fire
       Research Information Service at BFRL,

  Software/Models

     * NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview - whats new Version 2.0
       of the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview have been
       officially released. FDS 2.0 predict smoke and/or air flow movement
       caused by fire, wind, ventilation systems etc. Smokeview visualizes
       the predictions generated by NIST FDS.
     * ALOFT-FT is a smoke plume trajectory model for personal computers
     * CFAST/FAST and (FASTLite): CFAST is a zone model that predicts the
       effect of a specified fire on temperatures, various gas
       concentrations and smoke layer heights in a multi-compartment
       structure. FAST and FASTLite are graphical user interfaces (GUI)
       for the computational model (CFAST). They include the FIREFORM
       tools package. FASTlite is no longer distributed. The complete
       functionality of FASTLite is included in the FAST package.
     * Fire Modeling Software Online - A collection of fire related
       software developed by the Building and Fire Research Laboratory
       available for free download.

  Fire Tests/Data

     * Diffusion Flame Measurements - Profile data are presented here to
       aid research on the chemical structure of laminar, hydrocarbon
       diffusion flames - both for comparisons with other experimental
       results as well as for evaluating the predictions of flame models.
       Specifically, measurements made at NIST during the period 1984-1998
       of species concentrations (mole fraction), temperatures (K), and
       velocities (cm/s) are included for two diffusion flame systems.
     * Fire test data, a collection of actual test data for a range of
       commodities which may be found in residential and commercial
       applications. These data include video and still pictures of the
       fires, graphs of important measurements made during the testing,
       and data which can be downloaded to run with the FAST or FASTLite
       software to simulate these burning items.
     * FASTData extends the original Fire on the Web test data. FASTData
       is a collection over 450 tests ranging from cone calorimeter tests
       of single materials and assemblies to real-scale tests of single-
       and multiple-compartment configurations. Plots of data include
       focus on heat release rate, but additional plots including
       temperatures, species concentration, mass loss, and flows are
       included for some tests.
     * Industrial Sponsored Fire Test Data As a service to the fire safety
       community the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
       is making available reports and data that have been donated to NIST
       by the sponsoring organizations for wide spread use. The
       contributions of these organizations to help advance fire safety
       are gratefully acknowledged.
     * Residential Fire Sprinklers Two tests are presented that
       demonstrate how a fire is affected by a sprinkler.
     * Fire Fighting AgentsFire experiment comparing treated and untreated
       vinyl siding.

  Other

     * Fire Research Division - The Fire Research Division develops,
       verifies, and utilizes measurements and predictive methods to
       quantify the behavior of fire and the means to reduce the impact of
       fire on people, property, and the environment.
     * Fire Research Information Services (FRIS) FRIS' 60,000 document
       collection searchable through FIREDOC is accessible via the Web.
     * Other NIST fire resources can be found by browsing from BFRL's home
       page
