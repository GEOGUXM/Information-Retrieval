   Welcome to CEQAnet, the online searchable environmental database of the
   State Clearinghouse within the Office of Planning & Research.

   CEQAnet contains key information from all California Environmental
   Quality Act (CEQA) documents submitted to the State Clearinghouse for
   state review since 1990. For information on documents submitted prior
   to 1990, email us at state.clearinghouse@opr.ca.gov. In addition, some
   federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents are
   submitted to the Clearinghouse for state review; key information from
   these NEPA documents is also contained in this database.

   The CEQAnet database provides summaries of Environmental Impact Reports
   (EIRs), Negative Declarations, Environmental Impact Statements, and
   other types of CEQA and NEPA documents. The summaries include the
   project title, project location, lead agency name, contact information,
   and project description. At this time, CEQAnet does not provide the
   full text of any environmental documents.

   Because not all environmental documents are submitted to the State
   Clearinghouse, CEQAnet is not a comprehensive database of all CEQA and
   NEPA documents in California.

   LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK! Please let us know if you have questions or
   comments regarding this information service by e-mailing the State
   Clearinghouse at state.clearinghouse@opr.ca.gov. This is a brand new
   service; we expect to make refinements and improvements based on your
   input. Please let us know how to make this more user friendly.
