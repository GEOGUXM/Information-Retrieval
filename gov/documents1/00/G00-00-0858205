                    Welcome to Your New Home in Cyberspace!
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is a placeholder page installed by the Debian release of the
   Apache Web server package, because no home page was installed on this
   host. You may want to replace this as soon as possible with your own
   web pages, of course....

     This computer has installed the Debian GNU/Linux operating system
     but has nothing to do with the Debian GNU/Linux project. If you want
     to report something about this host's behavior or domain, please
     contact the ISPs involved directly, not the Debian Project.

     See the Network Abuse Clearinghouse for how to do this.

   Unless you changed its configuration, your new server is configured as
   follows:
     * Configuration files can be found in /etc/apache.
     * The DocumentRoot, which is the directory under which all your HTML
       files should exist, is set to /var/www.
     * CGI scripts are looked for in /usr/lib/cgi-bin, which is where
       Debian packages will place their scripts.
     * Log files are placed in /var/log/apache, and will be rotated daily.
       The frequency of rotation can be easily changed by editing
       /etc/apache/cron.conf.
     * The default directory index is index.html, meaning that requests
       for a directory /foo/bar/ will give the contents of the file
       /var/www/foo/bar/index.html if it exists (assuming that /var/www is
       your DocumentRoot).
     * User directories are enabled, and user documents will be looked for
       in the public_html directory of the users' homes. These dirs should
       be under /home, and users will not be able to symlink to files they
       don't own.

   All standard Apache modules are available with this release and can be
   chosen with the apacheconfig script. Installing a new module on your
   system is just a matter of compiling it (with the apache-dev package)
   and adding a line to your httpd.conf configuration file.

   More documentation on Apache can be found on:
     * The Apache documentation stored on your server.
     * The Apache Project home site.
     * The ApacheWeek newsletter.
     * The Debian Project Documentation which contains HOWTOs, FAQs, and
       software updates.

   You can also consult the list of World Wide Web Frequently Asked
   Questions for information.

   If you find a bug in this Apache package, or in Apache itself, please
   file a bug report on it. Instructions on doing this, and the list of
   known bugs of this package, can be found in the Debian Bug Tracking
   System.

   Thanks for using this package, and congratulations for your choice of a
   Debian system!

                                Debian Apache
