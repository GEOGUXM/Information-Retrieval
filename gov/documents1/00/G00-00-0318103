   Park
   Coe Park is the largest state park in northern California, with over
   80,000 acres of wild open spaces.  The terrain of the park is rugged,
   varied, and beautiful, with lofty ridges and steep canyons.   Once the
   home of Ohlone Indians, the park is now home to a fascinating variety
   of plants and animals, including the elusive mountain lion.

   Within Coe Park are the headwaters of Coyote Creek, long stretches of
   the Pacheco and Orestimba creeks, and a 23,300-acre wilderness area.

   The park is open year-round for hikers, mountain bikers, backpackers,
   equestrians, car campers, picnickers, photographers, and people who
   simply like to visit parks.
