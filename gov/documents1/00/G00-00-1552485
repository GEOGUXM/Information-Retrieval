   [clear.gif] Our Mission: The primary mission of the GeoSpatial Data and
   Climate Services (GDCS) group is to provide a cross-cutting service to
   all of NOAA regarding data, information, and other services needed to
   support data management activities within NESDIS, across all NOAA Line
   Offices, with other federal agencies, as well as with international
   organizations on matters of data and information management. Data
   management deals
   [clear.gif] with acquiring, quality controlling, preserving, storing,
   and providing user access to data holdings. GDCS planning and liaison
   functions stress cooperative efforts across NOAA and among agencies and
   international partners for facilitating environmental information
   exchange and user access. Specific [30_years.gif]

   Services Data and Information Management (ESDIM) program,the NOAA
   Environmental Data Rescue Program, the NOAA Data Directory of 14,000
   metadata descriptions maintained on the NOAAServer, the main focusof
