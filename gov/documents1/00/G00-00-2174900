   Accessibility:
   USDA, ARS is committed to making its web sites accessible to all USDA
   customers and employees.  All of the agency web sites are undergoing
   review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed the
   requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
   Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
   standards.  Furthermore, USDA, ARS continues to work on making all web
   sites accessible.  Thank you very much for your patience through this
   redesign process.  If you have any comments or suggestions for
   improvement, please contact Lori Wanner by email,
