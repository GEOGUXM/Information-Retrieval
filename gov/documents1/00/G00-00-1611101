     The Transportation Improvement Board



     The TIB invests state gas tax funds in local communities through five
     grant programs serving cities, urban counties and transportation
     benefit districts in Washington State. The TIB identifies and funds the
     highest-ranking transportation projects based on criteria established
     by the Board for each program. Subject to available revenue, each
     funding program offers an annual call for new projects in the Fall and
     projects are awarded in January. TIB Project Engineers provide customer
     service and grant administration throughout the project life.
