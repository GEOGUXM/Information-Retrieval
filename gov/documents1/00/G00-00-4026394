   This web site is your source of information for the U.S. Department of
   Education PIN. Select one of these links for more information about
   what the PIN is and where you can use it or select the PIN Frequently
   Asked Questions link.

   If you have never received a U.S. Department of Education PIN or you
   are unsure if you already have a PIN, please select Apply for PIN to
   receive one. By accepting this PIN you agree to not disclose or share
   your PIN with anyone. Because your PIN serves as your electronic
   signature and provides access to your personal records, you should
   never give your PIN to anyone. Be sure to keep your PIN in a safe
   place; you will be able to use the same PIN in the future to apply
   electronically for student aid and access your U.S. Department of
   Education records.

   If you have received a PIN previously but no longer have access to it,
   select PIN Request and Information from the menu list on the left side
   of this page.
