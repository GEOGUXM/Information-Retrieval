   Artist Concept of GLAST
   The Universe is home to numerous exotic and beautiful phenomena, some
   of which can generate almost inconceivable amounts of energy.
   Supermassive black holes, merging neutron stars, streams of hot gas
   moving close to the speed of light ... these are but a few of the
   marvels that generate gamma-ray radiation, the most energetic form of
   radiation, billions of times more energetic than the type of light
   visible to our eyes. What is happening to produce this much energy?
   What happens to the surrounding environment near these phenomena? How
   will studying these energetic objects add to our understanding of the
   very nature of the Universe and how it behaves?
   The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) will open this
   high-energy world to exploration and help us to answer these questions.
   With GLAST, astronomers will at long last have a superior tool to study
   how black holes, notorious for pulling matter in, can accelerate jets
   of gas outward at fantastic speeds. Physicists will be able to study
   subatomic particles at energies far greater than those seen in
   ground-based particle accelerators. And cosmologists will gain valuable
   information about the birth and early evolution of the Universe.
   For this unique endeavor -- one that brings together the astrophysics
   and particle physics communities -- NASA is teaming up with the U.S.
   Department of Energy and institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Italy
   and Sweden. The launch is scheduled for March of 2006.
   GLAST is part of the Structure and Evolution of the Universe theme, one
   of four major science themes within the NASA Office of Space Science.
   Through the SEU program, scientists seek to explore the limits of
   gravity and energy in the Universe, explain the structure of the
   Universe, and forecast our cosmic destiny.
