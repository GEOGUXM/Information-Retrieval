   NASA Glenn Research Center SBIR Program Office

   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is conducted by
   the Commercial Technology Office which is a part of the External
   Programs directorate. It is a federal program established to promote
   innovative research by small businesses. The intent is to increase
   private sector commercialization of innovations and, whenever possible,
   support and encourage minority and disadvantaged businesses. NASA is
   one of eleven agencies participating through an annual NASA-wide
   solicitation of proposals. Funding is provided by allocating 2.5
   percent of each agency's extramural R&D budget for SBIR. Each agency
   administers its own individual program within guidelines established by
   the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA is responsible for
   establishing governing policy and for overall program monitoring,
   reporting, and analysis.

   The SBIR program is valuable for the NASA Glenn Research Center and
   small businesses. For NASA Glenn Research Center, it provides
   innovations to enhance and complement research and development
   activities. For businesses, it provides a low-risk way to develop and
   commercialize innovations.
