   The LBNL Image Library provides an Web-based image management service
   to the LBNL community.

   There are three types of users of the Image Library:
     * Browsers (people who search or browse the collections for whatever
       reason)
       You can browse small images which are grouped by subjects into
       sub-collections; you can do text based searches over a complete
       collection; and in some collections, you can retrieve the
       high-resolution original images.
     * Authors (who incorporate images and text from ImgLib into their own
       documents)
       You may use ImgLib as an archival source of information through
       links from your own documents to ImgLib. Examples of this type of
       use is LBL News 50th Anniversary Issue, "My Service with Ten
       Presidents" and A microscopic tour of the lung.
     * Curators (who create and maintain collections of images and
       desriptive text)
       For more information on the curator function, see User's Guide. If
       you wish to add images or a collection to the LBNL's Image Library
       Web server contact (MRThompson@lbl .gov). You may also download the
       software to your own Solaris Web Server.

   The Image Library represents an implementation of the Wide Area
   Large-Data-Object architecture that the Imaging and Distributed
   Computing Group is developing. This architecture provides a
   distributed, wide area network based approach to collecting,
   cataloguing, storing, and providing Web access for large-data-objects
   that originate as high-speed data streams. Such data streams originate
   from many types of on-line instruments and imaging systems, and are a
   "staple" of modern intelligence, scientific, and health care
   environments. The approach provides for real-time conversion of the
   data streams and large datasets to "objects" that are searchable,
   browsable, persistent, and available to both "ordinary" and high
   performance applications through the integration of a high-speed
   distributed cache and transparent management of tertiary storage. The
   user interfaces - for both application users and data collection
   curators - are provided by the capabilities of the World Wide Web.

   The capabilities of the architecture are not unlike a digital library
   system, providing persistence, searchability, curation, flexible user
   access, high capacity, etc., and we give an example of an image library
   that has been built using this architecture. However, our approach
   particularly addresses the issues involved in creating such digital
   library-like collections automatically from the real-time output of,
   e.g., intelligence imaging systems, scientific instruments, health care
   imaging systems, etc.

   Two interesting ImgLib collections that are publicly viewable are
   Berkeley-Lab on-line photo archive, consisting of selected images from
   the Lab's photo archives and Lung_stucture consisting of
   high-resolution micrographs of lung tissue provided by Jacob Bastacky.

   The article "Historical Collections for the National Digital Library:
   Lessons and Challenges at the Library of Congress" (part 1,    part 2)
   from "D-lib: The Magazine of Digital Library Research" describes work
   in the Library of Congress to put image collections on-line as part of
   their National Digital Library project. There are many parallels
   between their work and ImgLib.
