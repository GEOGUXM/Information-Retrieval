   The activities of the Laboratory Experimental and Computational Biology
   (LECB) fall into several broad areas: macromolecular structure and
   function; membrane structure and function; immunology; phamacokinetics
   and computational and modeling methodology. The work is both
   theoretical and experimental. Application of theoretical understanding
   to these biological systems is accomplished through the use of advanced
   computing. Many of the theoretical studies are possible only through
   use of the supercomputing facilities at the Advanced Biomedical
   Computing Center, FCRDC, which was created and sponsored through the
   initiative of the Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology.

   The Laboratory oversees the development and operation of the
   contractor-operated The ABCC which serves as the only public-domain
   supercomputing center dedicated to biomedical research in the world.
   Access is provided to suitable applicants from the biomedical
   community, on the basic of scientific priority as evaluated by a time
   allocation group made up of representatives from the NCI, other NIH
   Institutes, and the extramural community. The goal is to provide access
   for challenging computational biology problems to proven, easy-to-use,
   fast, reliable, efficient, high-performance computers. The computing
   environment is centered around Cray vector supercomputers and scalar
   parallel machines. A fiber optic network interconnects these platforms,
   and provides Internet access and high speed connections to a userbase
   of more than 1600 researchers.
