               Langley 8-Year Surface Radiation Budget Dataset

                                  SRB logo

   Surface radiative fluxes were computed with parameterized broadband
   radiative transfer models using meteorological data (clouds,
   temperature and humidity profiles, ozone, etc). The input data were
   obtained from satellite sources, International Satellite Cloud
   Climatology Project (ISCCP) C1 and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
   (ERBE). ISCCP-C1 provided top of atmosphere (TOA) narrowband radiances,
   atmospheric soundings, and cloud information. ERBE provided TOA
   broadband clear-sky albedos.
   Monthly average shortwave and longwave surface radiative fluxes are
   available for the 96 month period July 1983 through June 1991. More
   information regarding this dataset is given below.

    The monthly average SRB data is now available from the NASA Langley
    Atmospheric Sciences Data Center.  The dataset name is SRB_SW_LW_MONTHLY.

                                     New

We are in the process of improving our surface radiation budget (SRB) products.
The models are currently being modified to increase resolution and accuracy. The
     new dataset will use ISCCP-DX data for clouds and radiances and GEOS-1
 temperature and humidity profiles. The results will be produced on a 1 degree
     equal-angle grid, spanning the period July 1983 through December 1995.
Processing of the new data sets has already started. Work is underway for making
 the new data sets available in the Fall of 2001. The dataset and documentation
                       will be available through the web.
