locations. Using Nesting Birds to Test Predictions from Ecological Risk
Assessments

   EES-10 scientists are studying cavity-nesting western bluebird
   populations around LANL to confirm results of previous ecological risk
   studies. Additionally, they are developing and testing non-lethal
   indicators of ecological risk that can be applied to multi-spatial
   scales of assessment.

   Deep drilling at Technical Area (TA) 16 at LANL recently revealed high
   explosives (HE) contamination at depths from 750 to 1500 ft,including
   in the regional aquifer. This discovery has heightened public concerns
   about groundwater contamination from Laboratory operations. EES
   scientists are working to determine the extent of the contamination,
   and investigating
