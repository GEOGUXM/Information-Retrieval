   Discovery Definition
   In space exploration, the possibilities for discovery are without
   limits. Even with the vast amount of knowledge gained since exploration
   of our solar system began, there are still more questions than answers.
   NASA's Discovery Program gives scientists the opportunity to dig deep
   into their imaginations and find innovative ways to unlock the
   mysteries of the universe. It represents the implementation of NASA
   Administrator Daniel Goldin's vision of "Faster, Better, Cheaper"
   planetary missions.
   The program's prime objective is to enhance our understanding of the
   solar system, both historically and as it is today, by exploring the
   planets, their moons and other small bodies, either by traveling to
   them or remotely from the vicinity of Earth.
