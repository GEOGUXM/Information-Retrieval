   Search Help
   * You can search for names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any
   other information that is contained in the directory.
   * You can also search for partial names (or email addresses or phone
   numbers), but you must enter an asterisk (*) after partial search
   strings. For example, searching for SMIT will not locate any SMITHs,
   but searching for SMIT* will.
   * You can employ Boolean operators to further refine your search.
