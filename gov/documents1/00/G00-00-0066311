   Our Mission
   The Office of Satellite Operations (OSO)manages and directs the
   operation of NOAA's satellites and the acquisition of remotely sensed
   data. The Office has operational responsibility for the Satellite
   Operations Control Center (SOCC) at Suitland, MD and Command and Data
   Acquisition (CDA) facilities at Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, AK to
   command and control the satellites, to track the satellites, and to
   acquire their data.
   The Office supports the launch, activation, and evaluation of new
   satellites and the in-depth assessment of satellite and ground systems
   anomalies. It prepares plans and procedures for responding to satellite
   and ground anomalies, and establishes and coordinates the schedules for
   satellite operation and data acquisition to meet users' needs. The
   Office also evaluates the technical performance of the satellites and
   maintains current information and future prediction on satellite orbits
   and attitudes. It evaluates the effectiveness of the operational
   facilities and procedures in terms of the quality, quantity, coverage,
   and timeliness of the data acquired.
