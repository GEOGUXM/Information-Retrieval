                               Coastal Factory

     To better serve as stewards of the nation's ocean and coastal
     resources, NOAA was the first federal agency in the United States
     Government to establish an office dedicated to Sustainable
     Development.

     Created in 1993 by NOAA Administrator Dr. D. James Baker, the Office
     of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs works
     within NOAA and with partners inside and outside of the federal
     government to promote sustainable development solutions to advance
     NOAA's Strategic Goals, environmental stewardship and environmental
     assessment and prediction.

     Most directly, NOAA is dedicated to Building Sustainable Fisheries
     and Sustaining Healthy Coasts. Coastal communities are among the
     fastest growing and most ecologically rich regions in our country.
     In coastal areas, the need for development is pressing and the
     stakes of getting that development right are high. The NOAA Office
     of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs is
     dedicated to meeting this challenge by helping to find solutions
     that bring balance between economic vitality, social equity and
     environmental integrity.

     Functions of the office include:
     * Supporting the Secretary of Commerce and the Undersecretary of
       Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (the Administrator of NOAA) in
       their roles as members of the President's Council on Sustainable
       Development.
     * Advising the Secretary on Commerce and the Under
       Secretary/Administrator on policies to encourage positive
       relationship between economic growth and environmental protection.
     * Offering organizational and technical assistance to collaborative
       pilot community and academic projects that promote sustainable
       development.
