   The purpose of the South Delta Improvements Program (SDIP) is to
   incrementally maximize diversion capability into Clifton Court Forebay,
   while providing an adequate water supply for diverters within the SDWA,
   and reducing the effects of State Water Project exports on both aquatic
           resources and direct losses of fish in the South Delta.
