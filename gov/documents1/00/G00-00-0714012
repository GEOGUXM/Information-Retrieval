   ESA-MTs Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation Team provides personnel,
   facilities, and equipment to:
   [ball.gif] Analyze material properties, and locate and characterize
       flaws within materials, fabricated
       [ball.gif] Monitor and/or image the internal and/or external
       condition of mechanisms and dynamic experiments.

   The NDTE Team serves Los Alamos and the DOE community. While Los Alamos
   National Laboratory does not compete with the private sector, we can
   provide services to other government agencies and to non-governmental
   customers in cases where one of our unique capabilities or a unique
   combination of capabilities is needed to solve a specific problem.
   Please contact us for ideas about solving your problem. The NDTE Team
   is committed to providing state-of-the-art inspection capabilities in
   support of the Laboratorys Mission. We are interested in establishing
   partnerships with industrial companies to speed the development of new
   technologies. Contact our Industrial Partnership Office for further
   information.
   Fourteen of our nondestructive testing or evaluation techniques are
   listed below with links to brief descriptions of each technique. You
   are invited to contact the team members who are listed at the end of
   each description for further information. They will be happy to answer
   your questions regarding technical details, schedules, costs and
   tradeoffs between different solutions to your problem. You may also
   reach any team member directly by browsing our personnel list.

  [newnew.gif] Examples of customer problems and NDE solutions

   The following list is designed to show you how a non-destructive
   evaluation techniques can help solve your problems. Some of our
   customers problems are listed below with links to suggested NDE
   solutions. Please click on suitable links to see how NDTE has helped
   others with problems that are similar to yours. If none of the
   following applications is similar to your problems, please contact a
   team member directly.

   Techniques for surface
       inspection (temperature or defects)
     * Observing temperatures of hot pressings and material inside
       furnaces or heated by microwaves.
     * Measuring temperature gradients across molded plastic parts.
     * Measuring temperatures of traces in printed circuit boards during
       operation.
     * Detection of surface defects in welds, castings and stressed
       materials.
     * Examination of steel dies for fatigue cracks.
     * Detection of stringers or cold shunts in forgings after finish
       machining.
     * Measurement of coating thickness and displacements.

    Techniques for locating bulk or internal defects
     * Check for internal defects such as voids, cracks or inclusions in
       materials.
     * Determination of internal clearances between parts of an assembly.
     * Examination of pinch welds of small-bore tubing.
     * Examination of internal circuitry of a small electronic devices.
     * Inspection of components inside a closed assembly.
     * Measurement of thickness of metal, plastic or ceramic parts.

   Inspection of dynamic systems
     * Tracing the path of an object dropped through a slurry.
     * Observing the motion of parts in a mechanical system.
     * Recording of drop tower experiments, heat powder burns, launch
       phenomena in ballistics etc..
     * Recording of internal mechanical functions as in a compressor or
       engine and the mixing of x-ray dissimilar fluids.
     * Imaging the impact of a projectile on a target.
     * Observing the mechanics of detonation.

    Material analysis and inhomogeneity inspection
     * Measurement of a small thickness or density variation in a part.
     * Alloy determination and material composition analysis.
     * Inspection of adhesive, soldered and diffusion bonds.
     * Detection of inhomogeneities in materials caused by porosity, grain
       orientation or grain size.
