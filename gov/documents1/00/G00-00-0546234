   FEATURED PROJECT:
   In 1998, a 5-mile reach of the Jacks Fork from the town of Eminence to
   its confluence with the Current River was included on Missouri's list
   of impaired waters as required by Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean
   Water Act. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the National
   Park Service and Missouri Department of Natural Resources, is
   conducting a study to better understand the extent the intense
   recreational use of the Jacks Fork may be having on the river.
