        We are responsible for the management of workers' compensation
            claims. Workers' compensation is a state-mandated, no fault
            system providing protection to employees who suffer a job
            incurred injury or illness.
            The laboratory's workers' compensation program is
            self-insured; this means that the full cost of workers'
            compensation benefits is paid directly out of the laboratory's
            operating budget. Payments are made for the Laboratory by a
            claims administrator, currently Occupational Health Care
            Management services (OHMS) in Albuquerque.
            For more information please see Contacts or email
