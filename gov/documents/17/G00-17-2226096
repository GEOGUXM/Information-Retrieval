  [world.gif] Stratospheric ozone depletion (Antarctic, Arctic, and global)

   [bluebar.gif]

   In the stratosphere, the region of the atmosphere between about 10 and
   50 kilometers (6-30 miles) above the Earth's surface, ozone (O[3])
   plays a vital role by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the
   sun. Stratospheric ozone is threatened by some of the human-made gases
   that have been released into the atmosphere, including those known as
   chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

   Once widely used as propellants in spray cans, refrigerants,
   electronics cleaning agents, and in foam and insulating products, the
   CFCs had been hailed as the "wonder chemicals." But the very properties
   that make them useful - chemical inertness, non-toxicity, insolubility
   in water - also make them resistant to removal in the lower atmosphere.

   CFCs are mixed worldwide by the large-scale motions of the atmosphere
   and survive until, after 1-2 years, they reach the stratosphere and are
   broken down by ultraviolet radiation. The chlorine atoms within them
   are released and directly attack ozone. In the process of destroying
   ozone, the chlorine atoms are regenerated and begin to attack other
   ozone molecules... and so on, for thousands of cycles before the
   chlorine atoms are removed from the stratosphere by other processes.

   The Ozone Layer. This profile shows how the amount of ozone (O[3])
   varies with height in the atmosphere. Note that most of the ozone is in
   the lower stratosphere, at an altitude of about 20-25 kilometers (12-15
   miles) above sea level. This is the so-called "ozone layer." It acts as
   a shield by absorbing biologically active ultraviolet light (called
   UV-B) from the sun. If the ozone layer is depleted, more of this UV-B
   radiation reaches the surface of the earth. Increased exposure to UV-B
   has harmful effects on plants and animals, including humans. The
   chlorine and bromine in human-produced chemicals such as the ones known
   as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons are depleting ozone in the
   stratosphere. The figure shows a simplified cycle of reactions in which
   chlorine (Cl) destroys ozone (O[3]).

   At the Aeronomy Lab, researchers are conducting laboratory and field
   experiments and designing computer models to study this issue. Aeronomy
   Lab researchers have traveled to Antarctica to study the ozone "hole"
   that has been occurring there since the late 1970s each
   Southern-Hemisphere spring. Their measurements confirmed their theory
   that the ozone hole is caused as a result of the interaction of CFCs,
   sunlight, and the ice clouds that form in that special region of the
   Earth.

   The Aeronomy Laboratory has played leading roles in the key
   international field campaigns that have led to this and other findings
   related to the ozone hole and, more generally, the ozone layer. These
   missions were organized by NASA and involved the collaboration of
   several scientists from institutions around the world.

   The National Ozone Expedition (see photo below) was the first of these,
   occurring just one year after the 1985 publication of the discovery of
   the ozone hole by the British Antarctic Survey. First-time measurements
   of key chlorine-containing and nitrogen-containing gases were made by
   members of the Aeronomy Lab's Middle Atmosphere and Optical Aeronomy
   Programs.

   NOZE I Research Team Arrives in Antarctica. Researchers arrive in
   Antarctica at noon, 23 August 1986, as part of the first National Ozone
   Expedition (NOZE I) to study the phenomenon known as the ozone hole.
   Aeronomy Lab scientist Dr. Susan Solomon led a team of 16 scientists
   who made measurements of trace gases and physical properties of the
   atmosphere. The data, along with additional findings from the NOZE II
   mission the next year, showed conclusively that human-produced trace
   gases that contain chlorine and bromine were causing the ozone hole.
   Scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA), NOAA, and other organizations made the key measurements and
   analyses that showed the CFC/ozone/polar stratospheric cloud theories
   of the ozone hole, and not other theories, were consistent with the
   observations.

   The Meteorological Chemistry Program and Middle Atmosphere Program of
   the Aeronomy Laboratory have a long history of conducting field and
   theoretical research that makes use of data gathered by instruments
   aboard the NASA ER-2 stratospheric research aircraft. In 1987, the
   Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE) gave the first clear
   evidence of exactly how the chemistry of the Antarctic stratosphere is
   perturbed by the ice particles (it was found that the ice particles
   remove nitrogen-containing gases from the atmosphere which, in turn,
   allows chlorine to stay in its active ozone-destroying forms longer).
   Instrumentation developed at the Aeronomy Lab for measuring
   nitrogen-containing gases, ozone, and water vapor provided critical
   data that led to those findings. More recently, Aeronomy Lab scientist
   Dr. Adrian Tuck served as Project Scientist and several other Aeronomy
   Lab scientists were investigators in the 1994 Airborne Southern
   Hemisphere Ozone Expedition (ASHOE), which furthered the understanding
   of chemistry that depletes ozone over Antarctic and other latitudes of
   the Southern Hemisphere.

   Laboratory researchers install chemical instrumentation on the ER-2
   aircraft. The ER-2 carries only a pilot and the automated, remotely
   operated instrument payloads for making meteorological and chemical
   measurements. Several agencies and universities provide the
   instrumentation; the Aeronomy Laboratory instruments measure reactive
   nitrogen compounds, ozone, and water vapor. Those are located in the
   instrument bay beneath the cockpit, where the investigators in the
   photo are shown working. Other payloads are carried in the nose, areas
   of the wings, and rear areas of the aircraft. The ER-2 has been used in
   several key international field campaigns concerned with stratospheric
   ozone, including AAOE, AASE, and ASHOE (see text for descriptions).

   It is clear that the decreases in Arctic ozone are far less dramatic
   than those of the Antarctic. The Aeronomy Laboratory's field,
   theoretical, and laboratory research has demonstrated some of the key
   processes that contribute to this observed difference. Data from the
   1988/89 and 1991 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expeditions (AASE-1 and
   AASE-2), combined with theoretical and laboratory work at the Aeronomy
   Laboratory, revealed that the nitrogen-removing processes are far less
   effective in the north. Several Aeronomy Lab scientists were
   investigators on those missions, and Dr. Adrian Tuck served as Mission
   Scientist.

   Other stratospheric research is concerned with the downward trends in
   global ozone that have recently been measured over populated regions in
   the midlatitudes. A special interest is the role of volcanic eruptions
   (in particular, the atmospheric particles that result from them) in the
   chemistry of ozone depletion. Here, Aeronomy Laboratory scientists are
   making contributions from all corners (field measurements, theoretical
   modeling, and laboratory studies) that are furthering our understanding
   of heterogeneous (in this case, gas-particle) chemistry - truly one of
   the "frontier areas" of atmospheric science.

   A growing area of stratospheric research at the Aeronomy Laboratory
   (and at other scientific institutions worldwide) is the possible
   effects of aircraft on the ozone layer. We describe this activity in a
   separate section below.

  Recent Major Collaborative Efforts

   Like the expeditions mentioned above, the stratospheric work of the
   Aeronomy Laboratory is often carried out in close collaboration with
   colleagues from other institutions in the U.S. and abroad. As examples
   we describe two major collaborative efforts:
     * The STRAT program (Stratospheric Tracers of Atmospheric Transport)
       investigated how gases and particles are transported in the
       stratosphere. This major field campaign especially clarifies how
       gases and particles from the exhaust of potential future fleets of
       supersonic airplanes would be distributed around the globe. The
       findings are expected to increase the scientific understanding of
       how exhaust products might influence the stratospheric ozone layer.
       During 1996, the NASA ER-2 research plane carried several
       instruments for measuring gases, winds, and temperature into the
       upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Flights began in 1995 and
       were repeated on a regular basis through 1997 in a broad region
       from the tropics to the middle latitudes of the Northern
       Hemisphere, allowing scientists to study both the latitudinal and
       seasonal characteristics of the stratosphere. Additional
       measurements were obtained from satellite instruments and from
       instruments that were carried aloft by balloons in the summer of
       1996. The project involved an international team of researchers
       from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the NOAA
       Aeronomy Lab, the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Lab, and
       several universities and other organizations. STRAT is co-sponsored
       by NASA and NOAA.
     * Fieldwork of the Photochemistry of Ozone Loss in the Arctic Region
       in Summer (POLARIS) mission was completed in 1997. This experiment
       was designed to study ozone photochemistry in the summertime lower
       stratosphere at middle and high latitudes, with the aim of
       understanding the processes that cause ozone column amounts to
       decline during the summer/early fall period at northern high
       latitudes. Chemical and meteorological data were obtained from
       instruments aboard the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft, other
       aircraft, balloons, and satellites. The project involved an
       international team of researchers from the National Aeronautics and
       Space Administration, the NOAA Aeronomy Lab, the NOAA Climate
       Monitoring and Diagnostics Lab, and several universities and other
       organizations.

   The STRAT and POLARIS missions have scientific objectives that are
   consistent with the goals of SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their
   Role in Climate), an international program to facilitate stratospheric
   research efforts on climate-related issues.

  An Ongoing International Collaboration: The WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessments of
  Ozone Depletion

   1998 Assessment cover 1994 Assessment cover 1991 Assessment cover 1989
   Assessment cover 1955 Assessment cover
   International Scientific Assessments of Ozone Depletion. An
   international agreement known as the "Montreal Protocol on Substances
   That Deplete the Ozone Layer" was reached in 1987. Through that
   agreement, and subsequent amendments and adjustments in 1990 and 1992
   and adjustments in 1995 and 1998, many nations of the world have
   carried out policies to reduce and then phase out their use of
   ozone-depleting chemicals. The Montreal Protocol also called for the
   international scientific community to periodically update governments
   on the latest scientific findings related to the ozone layer. Conducted
   under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and
   the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and co-sponsored by
   NASA, NOAA, and other organizations, these periodic
   "state-of-the-science" assessments have guided policymakers as they
   strengthened the original provisions of the Montreal Protocol. Together
   with colleagues at NASA, other NOAA laboratories, and other scientific
   institutions across the U.S. and around the world, the Aeronomy
   Laboratory has played a leading role in preparing these assessments
   (1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, and 1998). The Executive Summary of the most
   recent assessments (1994 and 1998) are available here.
