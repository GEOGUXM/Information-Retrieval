     __________________________________________________________________

   Our vessels, which range in length from 45 to107 feet, are
   well-equipped for population assessment studies in the Lakes. Equipment
   on these vessels includes wet laboratories, trawls, gillnets, larval
   fish tow nets, equipment for limnological and contaminant sampling,
   hydroacoustical fish-detection systems, and Loran C/GPS navigation
   computer systems for the precise location of sampling stations. The
   Center has a side-scan sonar and a remotely operated vehicle.

   The Center also operates a fleet of small (18-25 foot) research vessels
   outfitted with various types of electronic gear, including GPS
   navigation systems and other equipment required for fishery and
   limnological research in Great Lakes nearshore and connecting waters.

   The R/V Grayling

   R/V Grayling on Lake Huron
   Homeport: Cheboygan, Michigan
   Built 1977 by Bender Shipbuilding (Mobile, Alabama)
   Length: 75.0 ft
   Cruising speed: 9.1 knots

   The R/V Grayling is the Center's second largest vessel with great
          geographic range and advanced scientific abilities. Nearly all
          of the fish population and habitat research in Lake Huron is
          conducted aboard the R/V Grayling. It also assists with fish
          population assessment in eastern Lake Superior.

   The R/V Kaho

   R/V Kaho on Lake Ontario
   Homeport: Oswego, New York
   Built 1961 by Hansen Welding Company (Toledo, Ohio)
   Length: 64.9 ft
   Cruising speed: 8.7 knots

   The fish population research program on Lake Ontario aboard the R/V
   Kaho is closely coordinated with the New York State Department of
   Environmental Conservation. The R/V Kaho fishes all U.S. waters of Lake
   Ontario and is often involved in specific research projects near its
   home port in eastern Lake Ontario. The Kaho, Grayling and Siscowet are
   also used in Canadian waters of Lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior,
   respectively, in collaborative research with Canadian agencies.

   The MV Kiyi

   M/V Kiyi on Lake Superior
   Homeport: Bayfield, Wisconsin
   Built 1999
   Length: 107.0 feet
   Cruising speed: 11 knots

   The M/V Kiyi is the newest vessel in the Center's fleet.  Fish
   population and habitat research is primarily conducted in western Lake
   Superior.  Long-term research has particularly focused on the Apostle
   Islands area.

   The RV Musky II

   R/V Musky II on Lake Erie
   Homeport: Sandusky, Ohio
   Built 1960 (Toledo, Ohio)
   Length: 45.0 ft
   Cruising speed: 9.6 knots

   The R/V Musky II is the Center's smallest vessel. Fish population and
   habitat research is primarily conducted off the R/V Musky II in the
   western basin of Lake Erie. It is the most limited vessel in the
   Center's fleet in terms of geographic range and scientific equipment
   but occasionally also works in the central and eastern basins of Lake
   Erie.
