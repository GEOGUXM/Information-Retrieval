Professional Discipline Actions

Searching for Summaries

   Summary information of disciplinary actions taken against licensees by
   the Board of Regents in New York State since January 1, 1994, can be
   found here. You may search for an individual by last name or review an
   entire month's summary by the date of the action.

   In New York State, professional misconduct in all the professions
   (except that by physicians, physician assistants and specialist
   assistants, which is investigated and prosecuted by the Office of
   Professional Medical Conduct (OPMC) of the Department of Health) is
   investigated and prosecuted by the New York State Education
   Department's Office of the Professions. The Board of Regents, which
   also has responsibility for licensure in all the professions, is
   responsible for the final disposition of all disciplinary matters
   except those handled by OPMC.

   Information on uncontested determinations in which a licensee has been
   assessed a fine for committing an infraction of a minor and technical
   nature is available by phone: 518-474-3817, ext. 330; fax:
   518-473-0578; or e-mail: dplsdsu@mail.nysed.gov, or by writing to the
   Office of the Professions. Information on pre-1994 Regents Actions may
   also be obtained at these sources.

   Also posted is a list of compliance agreements reached in cases of
   alleged illegal practice of the professions.
