   NASA's Laboratory for Atmospheres, Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics
   Branch at the Goddard Space Flight Center has a unique facility for the
   calibration, characterization, and development of new remote sensing
   instrumentation. Starting with the Shuttle Solar Backscatter
   Ultraviolet (SSBUV) project, the laboratory has participated in the
   intercalibration of many US and foreign ozone monitors to enhance the
   precision in tracking the long term depletion of ozone in the Earth's
   atmosphere. Recently, the laboratory has been working on the
   development of new technology and new techniques for measuring ozone
   and other constituents in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.
   Demonstrations of these instruments were successful with the flight of
   the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE) and the Limb Ozone
   Retrieval Experiment (LORE) on the Space Shuttle Columbia in November
   of 1997.
