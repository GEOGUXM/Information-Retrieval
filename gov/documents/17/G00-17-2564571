   What is QWIP Technology?
          Recent developments on the Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector
   (QWIP) technology at Jet Propulsion Laboratory have culminated in one
   of the most sensitive yet affordable handheld long-wavelength infrared
   (LWIR) cameras. A QWIP is an advanced nanodevice that is fabricated
   using state-of-the-art semiconductor technology. The flexibility of the
   precision QWIP design and fabrication technology allows it to be
   optimized for a variety of mission conditions. Based on highly mature
   GaAs growth and processing technology, QWIPs can be used to produce
   large-format focal plane arrays for high-resolution infrared cameras at
   lower cost than any other competing technologies. The manufacturability
   of QWIP-based advanced infrared camera has enabled a rapid
   commercialization of this technology. The availability of QWIP cameras
   has already contributed to the advancement in medical applications. A
   novel QWIP-based breast cancer detection technology was recently
   approved by the FDA. The high operability, high uniformity, high
   stability, and high radiation tolerance of QWIP cameras remarkably
   simplify the on-board and ground based data analysis for NASA missions,
   thus providing a significant cost reduction in software development,
   data processing and major system level benefits upon integration. As
   such, the QWIP technology will enable NASAs vision of frequent and low
   cost missions in the 21st century.
