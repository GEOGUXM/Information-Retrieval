                                Team Mission

   The U.S. Geological Survey's Geologic Hazards Team conducts global
   investigations of earthquake, geomagnetic, and land- slide hazards.
   Team scientists study basic processes and mechanisms, monitor geologic
   hazard events, analyze their effects, and develop strategies to
   mitigate the impacts on vulnerable regions. Results of their research
   are presented on maps and in written and electronic publications to
   inform and to educate the general and scientific public. The Team
   consists of eight research groups and three information centers.

   Seismic Hazard Mapping

   National seismic hazard maps are the primary products of this research
   activity. These maps have been incorporated in National building code
   maps since the mid 1980's. The current U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
   maps, using the latest geologic and seismologic data, are available on
   the Internet (http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov). They will form the basis
   for the 1997 Recommended Provisions of the National Earthquake Hazards
   Reduction Program. These maps are also used in the regulation of waste
   disposal sites, highway design, insurance, loss estimation, and damage
   mitigation.

    USGS researchers devise new methods of quantifying seismic hazards
   using alternative models. They perform regional and local hazard
   mapping with emphasis on the amplification of ground motion by local
   geology and 3-D sedimentary basin geometry.

   Seismic Networks

   USGS seismologists develop, install, operate, and maintain
   state-of-the-art National and global seismograph networks, including
   the U.S. National Seismograph Network (USNSN) and the Global
   Seismograph Network (GSN). These networks are the essential
   Observational infrastructure for earthquake rnonitoring, nuclear test
   monitoring, earthquake hazards assessment, and basic research.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Global Seismology

   USGS scientists conduct research on earthquake source mechanisms, Earth
   structure, and properties of seismic waves passing through the Earth
   using real-time telemetry from a global network of digital, broadband
   seismograph stations to:
     * Refine Earth models of seismic velocity and attenuation to improve
       the accuracy of earthquake locations and magnitudes
     * Develop theories and methods for characterizing the earthquake
       source
     * Transfer results of research into operational practice
         ______________________________________________________________

   Engineering Seismology

   USGS researchers develop methods to reduce damage to structures from
   earthquakes. They:
     * Design and install seismic arrays to record earthquake motions in
       structures and on the ground
     * Deploy temporary instruments to record aftershocks following large
       earthquakes
     * Develop new methods for analyzing strong-motion data
     * Determine the effects of geology and topography on ground motions
       and structural response
     * Determine ground-motion parameters that correlate best with
       structural damage
         ______________________________________________________________

   Neotectonics

   USGS scientists study the geologic setting of active faults, volcanoes,
   and other active areas of the Earth's crust. Their investigations
   provide a geologic and geophysical framework for understanding and
   assessing historic earthquakes, paleoseismicity, earthquake hazards,
   and volcano hazards. Some of their efforts include:
     * Geologic and structural mapping
     * Paleostress analysis
     * Electromagnetic and potential field surveys
     * Collection and analysis of seismic reflection and refraction data
     * Sedimentary basin analysis
     * Tectonic synthesis
     * Seismotectonic mapping

   Paleoseismology
   USGS paleoseismologists conduct geologic studies of prehistoric
       earthquakes (especially their location, recurrence, and magnitude).
       They focus on characterizing and understanding hazards created by
       large earthquakes throughout the U.S., as well as in the
       Philippines and Australia, but also study neotectonics and active
       deformation. For these studies, they:
     * Map Quaternary faults and folds at local and regional scales
     * Make detailed maps of Quaternary deposits
     * Analyze tectonic geomorphology at a variety of large scales
     * Trench active faults and folds to document their history of
       movement Date fault-related materials using radiometric,
       thermoluminescence, and other techniques
     * Make detailed maps of faults using electronic surveying techniques
     * Create regional and National digital maps showing Quaternary faults
       and folds
     * Compile a paleoseismic database for the Nation

   Landslide Hazards
   Geologic hazards created by landslides cause billions of dollars in
       damages and many fatalities annually. USGS scientists investigate
       ways to reduce long-term losses caused by landslides and seek to
       understand the causes of ground failure nationally and worldwide.
       They:
     * Gather landslide information and conduct landslide process studies
     * Respond to landslide emergencies and disasters
     * Produce scientific reports for technical journals, government
       agencies, and the general public

    National Landslide Information Center

     The NLIC is responsible for distributing information about
     landslides to the lay public, researchers, planners, and local,
     state, and federal agencies. The NLIC provides a toll-free number
     (1-800-654-4966) and a webpage, whereby anyone can make inquiries
     about landslides.

     A searchable database containing landslide bibliographic references
     is available on-line, and a search of topics, authors, dates,
     publisher, and keywords can provide the user with resource material
     that can be obtained through most libraries. USGS publications can
     be obtained by contacting the USGS Earth Science Information Centers
     (ESICS). The main ESIC can be contacted by calling 1-800-USA-MAPS.

     The NLIC is outreach entity for the USGS Landslide Hazard Program
     and provides information, exhibits, and contacts about the program
     and its various projects and personnel. Homeowners can contact the
     NLIC and receive advice about dealing with landslide hazards--the
     NLIC is prohibited by law from consulting about individual problems,
     but can provide general information and refer a user to various
     resources for localized information.

     The National Landslide Information Center is one of three geologic
     hazard information centers, funded by the U.S. Geological Survey,
     The three centers, the National Earthquake Information Center, the
     National Geomagnetic Information Center, and the National Landslide
     Information Center are housed in one building on the Colorado School
     of Mines Campus, Golden, Colorado, USA.

   National Geomagnetic Information Center

   The USGS National Geomagnetic Information Center (NGIC) collects
   geomagnetic data from the INTERMAGNET global network of more than 60
   geomagnetic observatories, including 13 U.S. observatories. NGIC
   scientists assist other nations in the operation of 6 more
   observatories.

   Data are received in near real time via satellite and computer links at
   NGIC in Golden, Colorado. The NGIC is one of five worldwide INTERMAGNET
   data-collection points. These data (received every 12 minutes) are used
   to provide warning of geomagnetic hazards to U.S.

   military and commercial business personnel. Data are disseminated to
   scientific and other users in a real-time, on-line mode, as well as on
   diskette and CD- ROM.

    National Landslide information Center The USGS National Landslide
   Information Center (NLIC) collects comprehensive landslide information
   world- wide and distributes that information to landslide researchers,
   geotechnical practitioners, and public entities concerned with
   landslide hazards analysis and mitigation. Products include:
     *  Landslide maps and reports
     * Inventory of landslide researchers worldwide
     * Photographic materials
