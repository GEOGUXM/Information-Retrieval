Find the Hidden GLOBE Students

   Where in the world are those other GLOBE students? That's the question
   three groups of students had about each other. They had to locate other
   GLOBE schools armed with just a handful of clues, including GLOBE data.

   The fun began when three GLOBE teachers met during a training session
   and devised a project to have their students use GLOBE data in an
   exciting way: guided by their respective teachers, students at each
   school put together a "Mystery Box," providing clues about themselves
   for the other, unknown GLOBE classes. Each class devised a different
   way to provide clues.

   Scott Lobdell's 5th grade at Fair Haven Grade School in Fair Haven,
   Vermont, provided longitude and latitude, some information describing
   their state and town (but not the names) and rain and temperature
   readings. "My students had a blast with it," Mr. Lobdell said. "Our
   approach was a way to combine social studies and science."

   The clues from Jim Lane's 4th grade at Charles B. Murray Elementary
   School in Sheridan, MT included horns, skin and hair from elk, moose,
   deer, snakes, buffalo and other animals native to that area. He also
   turned GLOBE data into math problems. For example, when the other
   schools' students solved the math problem, they had in hand the
   longitude and latitude of their colleagues' school. "They also included
   a lot of names of rivers and mountains, so there were a lot of map
   skills for my students," Mr. Lobdell said of the Sheridan Mystery Box.

   The third hidden group was Carol Boyce's after-school GLOBE club with
   3rd- , 4th- , and 5th-graders at Orange Elementary School in Waterloo,
   IA. Their mystery box included a lot of GLOBE data, including average
   minimum and maximum temperatures for each of the four seasons,
   altitude, and some graphs. They also included the state rock, and
   following Mr. Lane's example, turned some data sets into math problems.
   Orange Elementary divided their clues into "difficult," "medium," and
   "easy," and asked the teacher to dole out the most difficult questions
   first.

   Once the clues were assembled, two sets of Mystery Boxes were sent, one
   to each of the other schools.

   "The clues were difficult until we arrived and saw the box's pictures
   of bitterroot and meadowlarks. Then it started to fit into place,"
   wrote Jonathan, an Orange Elementary 4th-grader, to Mr. Lane's class.

   Although geographically quite far apart, the exercise drew the children
   closer. After the Mystery Boxes were solved, the classes exchanged
   videotaped "hellos" so they could "meet," and many students exchanged
   letters. The teachers, who are interested in doing the exercise again,
   believe it would work even better if there were more participants.

   Ms. Boyce said the search for clues involved a lot of research, using
   the GLOBE web site and other Internet sources, as well as more
   traditional reference materials. "It was a wonderful project," she
   said. "It was so fun and our kids learned so much."

   Mr. Lobdell agreed, adding that the students had to use critical
   thinking skills to decipher the boxes. In fact, the teachers all said
   the project reflected many of GLOBE's educational goals and educational
   ideals in general.

   "This was a really good research project, not only to figure out the
   others' boxes but also to prepare the boxes to send," Mr. Lane said.
   "To be effective, education is not going to be just typical classroom
   work. We're a little school in a little town out in the middle of
   nowhere and we have to get out. That's where you get the learning done,
   and that's why I like GLOBE."

   The search also turned up differences in GLOBE schools' hometowns.
   Rural Sheridan, MT, doesn't have a single stoplight in town. "Why don't
   you have any stoplights?" wrote Waterloo 3rd-grader Nicole to one of
   Mr. Lane's students, once the mysteries were solved. "I mean, we have
   stoplights almost on every corner!"
