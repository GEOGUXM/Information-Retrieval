   Welcome to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) web site for
   Technology, which is hosted by the Office of Technology and Industrial
   Relations (OTIR). NCI is committed to developing and encouraging the
   adoption of technologies that will accelerate the discovery and
   translation phases of cancer research.

   This web site is designed to inform academic, government, and corporate
   technology developers about NCI funding programs that focus on and
   incorporate technology development and how to forge collaborations with
   NCI. By clicking on the appropriate left navigation links, visitors
   can:
     * Research current funding opportunities
     * Learn about technology programs supported by NCI
     * Understand NCI's role in trans-National Institutes of Health
       bioengineering activities
     * Investigate programs that exist to support small business
     * Identify complementary resources and programs
     * Learn about NCI's Strategic Technologies Seminar Series

   Technology developers that want to explore collaboration opportunities
   with NCI but are not sure where to begin are encouraged to contact OTIR
   for assistance. OTIR serves as a convenient access point for technology
   developers into NCI.

   Visitors can learn about OTIR's mission and role within NCI, activities
   and programs it plays a key role in managing, and staff by clicking on
   About OTIR in the top navigation bar.

   Corporate technology developers are strongly encouraged to also visit
   NCI's Industrial Relations web site, accessible via the top navigation
   bar. OTIR hosts the Industrial Relations site, which informs companies
   about the breadth of opportunity that exists for collaboration with NCI
   and how to access NCI funding, research resources, scientists and
   discoveries.

   Visitors to all three sites-Technology, About OTIR, and Industrial
   Relations--will find summary information that has been integrated and
   distilled from many other web sites internal and external to NCI, as
   well as dozens of links to related programs and resources. More
   detailed information about a topic can be found by clicking on the
   links embedded throughout the text.

   First time visitors may wish to visit the NCI Overview, Scientific
   Priorities, and Funding Tutorial to learn about NCI, its mission and
   goals, and how to obtain financial support. For general information on
   cancer, please visit CancerNet, NCI's source for the most current and
   accurate information about cancer.

   A comprehensive overview of this web site is provided in the site map.
   If you have questions or would like to speak with an OTIR staff member,
   please contact us at any time.
