    After a few months of foggy vision, NASA's Stardust mission team has
      improved the spacecraft's navigation-camera resolution to nearly
     normal, just as Stardust is preparing to make a close flyby of the
     Earth on Monday. By heating the camera's optical path, the Stardust
   team was able to help its nearsighted spacecraft boil away contaminants
                that had been deposited on optical surfaces.
