     Established in 1917, the Department of Labor Library is one of the
     oldest Cabinet-level libraries. Large segments of its collection 
     which document the history of labor, labor unions, and the growth
     and development of the labor movement in a national and world
     context  are unique either in their nature and content or in the
     length and completeness of their coverage.
