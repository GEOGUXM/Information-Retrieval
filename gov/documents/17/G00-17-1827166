    22 March 2001 - Racin' with the Wind...

   Scene from Easy Rider Those captivated by the "free spirits"
   immortalized by icons like Peter Fonda and James Dean now have some new
   rebels who can't be stopped: neutral atoms from the solar wind. Click
   here for the GSFC press release.
    16 February 2001 - Collaborative Coup

   In a stunning display of the power and promise of multi-instrument
   collaborations resulting from the IMAGE mission, Fuselier et al., in a
   recently accepted article to appear in the IMAGE special issue of
   Geophysical Research Letters, combine LENA and FUV data to investigate
   the timing between an impulsive input of energy into the ionosphere and
   the resulting ionospheric outflow. They conclude that for 30 eV neutral
   oxygen outflow there is no delay between the ionospheric disturbance
   and the initiation of the ionospheric outflow.
    17 January 2001 - Solar Wind LENAs to be Featured in First JGR Paper

   The Journal of Geophysical Research Space Physics has accepted its
   first LENA paper for publication sometime in the next few months. The
   paper, by Collier et al., is entitled "Observations of Neutral Atoms
   from the Solar Wind" and discusses the first observations of the
   neutral solar wind formed by charge exchange with interstellar
   neutrals, dust and the Earth's hydrogen geocorona. In the two specific
   events examined in the paper, the flux of neutral atoms observed by
   LENA inside the magnetosphere is about 10^-3 - 10^-4 of the solar wind
   flux. The implications of these observations on proposals concerning
   the effect of the neutral solar wind on geophysical phenomena, early
   CME warning and ozone depletion are discussed.
    22 November 2000: First LENA Paper Accepted by Geophysical Research
   Letters

   The first journal paper focused on science results from LENA was
   recently accepted by Geophysical Research Letters. It is entitled: "Low
   Energy Neutral Atoms in the Magnetosphere", and provides an overview of
   the types of observations being routinely made by the LENA imager,
   including observations of the solar wind from inside the magnetosphere,
   and of the prompt ionospheric outflow response to solar wind
   enhancements produced by solar CMEs.
    7-8 November 2000: LENA Software Featured at GSFC Workshop on Data
   Processing

   The Science Data Systems Branch, Code 586, and the Advanced Data
   Management and Analysis Branch, Code 587, jointly held a Science Data
   Processing workshop at GSFC on 7-8 November 2000. The LENA imager was
   represented by Evelyn Lee, who presented a poster entitled: IMAGE-LENA
   Science Data Processing. Barbara Giles, with support from Evelyn Lee,
   also gave a talk comparing the ISTP and IMAGE data systems.
    20 October 2000: First Magnetosheath ENA Emission Model Unveiled

   Dr. M.-C. Fok of USRA in Greenbelt, MD (supported by the IMAGE theory
   and modeling team) recently unveiled the first calculation of the
   expected ENA emission from the magnetosheath interaction with the
   Earth's geocorona. This model is useful for understanding the LENA
   imager observations of neutral atoms evidently coming from the sun or
   solar wind interaction with ambient neutral gas. It integrates the line
   of sight LENA flux from 5 to 50 RE, using a magnetosheath description
   from the global simulation results of the Gombosi/U. of MI BatsRus code
   running at GSFC.
   The model results can be previewed at the three different energies: 200
   eV, 1000 eV, and 4000 eV (links to figures below). Each figure contains
   three simulated LENA 24 hour spectrograms, from orbits aligned at 8-20
   hours, 6-18 hours, and 0-12 hours. The 1000 and 4000 eV traces look
   remarkably like those observed by LENA, indicating that substantial
   emissions are expected from the magnetosheath that are brightest in the
   nominal sun direction, even when the orbit is oriented normal to the
   sun-earth line. This substantiates our inferences of a solar wind
   origin for these LENA fluxes.

   In a final figure (for 1000 eV, link #4 below), spectrograms are shown
   for three different inner limits of integration. The differences seen
   as the inner limit moves outward represent loss of cusp features
   originating from the intrusion of magnetosheath plasma into the
   northern and southern cusp regions. These features tend to be dimmer
   than the streak near the sun direction, except at lower energies.

    15 September 2000 - LENAs To Shake Up San Francisco (09/21/00)
   San Francisco CA, perpetual home of earthquakes, left-wing politics,
   and the Fall American Geophysical Union meeting (www.agu.org), will be
   penetrated late this fall by something completely different: Low Energy
   Neutral Atoms. As part of a special session devoted to discoveries from
   the ground-breaking IMAGE mission, scientists analyzing LENA data will
   present the first observations of low energy neutral atoms from the
   ionosphere and interplanetary medium: Moore et al., Overview; Collier
   et al., Heliospheric LENAs; Fuselier et al., LENAs from Earth; Wilson
   et al., Auroral LENAs; Stephen et al., LENA Cross Sections; Coffey et
   al., LENA association with ionospheric outflows
    3-4 August 2000 - Texas sunshine sheds both light and heat on LENA
   observations (08/15/00)
   Members of the IMAGE team recently converged on San Antonio for the
   second Science Working Team meeting since the flawless IMAGE launch
   last March. Will IMAGE revolutionize [scientific] publication?" IMAGE
   PI James Burch asked cinematically, suggesting that we will need to
   publish movies to depict the plethora of stunning images returned by
   IMAGE's six scientific instruments.

   LENA Lead Investigator Dr. Thomas E. Moore presented an operations
   overview along with images and analysis from the first major storm
   observed by IMAGE/LENA on 8 June including low energy neutral atoms
   from the solar wind, and from the auroral plasma fountain. Dr. Michael
   R. Collier followed with a detailed discussion of observations of
   direct neutral solar wind resulting from charge exchange with
   interstellar material, and also neutral solar wind resulting from
   charge exchange in the magnetosheath relatively near the Earth. Dr.
   Stephen Fuselier of Lockheed Martin completed the LENA story by
   describing observations of neutral atom outflow in the June 8 event,
   concluding that the 38 minute time delay between the shock passage and
   the observation of a low energy oxygen burst is consistent with topside
   ionospheric heating and acceleration by electron precipitation (see
   figure for observations of the ionospheric oxygen ejection). The LENA
   presentations produced animated and sometimes heated discussion about
   the meaning of the new LENA imager observations.
   Ionospheric Oxygen Ejection
    18 July 2000 - LENA Instrument Lead Interviewed by Astronomy Now
   (07/26/00)
   The old way of tracking magnetic storms is like trying to understand
   severe thunderstorms in the Midwest by driving around with a rain gauge
   out the window." So explained LENA instrument lead Dr. Thomas Moore of
   NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in an interview with Astronomy Now,
   Britain's best-selling astronomy magazine http://www.astronomynow.com
    6/8/2000 - LENA Observes Geomagnetic Effects of Gigantic Solar Bubble
   (6/26/00)
   Early this morning at 08:42 UT, a vigorous shock wave passed NASA's ACE
   spacecraft, an upstream solar wind monitor designed to give advanced
   warning of geomagnetic activity. This disturbance was the leading edge
   of a gigantic bubble of gas ejected from the Sun on 6 June. Shortly
   thereafter, the Low Energy Neutal Atom imager on the recently launched
   IMAGE spacecraft observed the effects of this shock on the Earth's
   environment. LENA observed direct evidence of the solar wind shock
   arrival as an increase of neutral atom flux passing through the
   magnetosphere from the direction of the sun. It also observed the
   enhanced ionospheric outflows from the Earth, in response to the solar
   wind enhancement. The IMAGE mission will allow scientists to understand
   the link between these inter-planetary disturbances and their
   frequently devastating impact on Earth satellites, communications and
   power grids. LENA CME/Storm
    Initial LENA Data Presented at IMAGE Team Meeting 5/23/00 (5/26/00)
   Spectrograms from LENA presented at the recent IMAGE Science Working
   Team Meeting at Goddard Space Flight Center on May 23-24, 2000 showed
   how the real neutral atom signal is separated from other signals such
   as the sun pulse and diffuse noise from the radiation belts. A movie of
   the LENA data from a perigee pass over Antarctica on May 16 showed that
   LENA is recording neutral hydrogen atom emissions from the Earth's
   ionosphere, remotely sensing the heating and outflow of plasma from the
   ionosphere into the magnetosphere, known as auroral plasma fountains.
   Long term variations observed by LENA were compatible with those
   observed by the POLAR TIDE instrument. LENA's are the first remote
   sensing observations of this phenomena, which should lead to better
   knowledge of how the fountains respond to solar wind variations.
   Initial LENA Data
    LENA Obtains First Images (5/5/00)
   LENA was ramped to full operation early on 3 May 2000, and immediately
   began to record signals coming from the Earth's vicinity. Upon ramping
   High Voltage, a sun pulse appeared, and was later interrupted by
   eclipse as the spacecraft passed around behind the earth. The radiation
   belts produce large singles rates but modest coincidence rates. A
   particularly strong signal was observed in eclipse and near perigee, as
   shown in the figure. Other weaker signals were also observed and we
   look forward to optimizing instrument performance and analyzing this
   data set.

   Jim Green  IMAGE Mission Lecture Tuesday April 18 at 3:30 P.M.
   (4/14/00)
   Dr. James Green, Chief of the Space Science Data Operations Office Code
   630, will deliver a GSFC Visitor Center Mission Lecture on the IMAGE
   mission on 18 April 2000 (NOT 19 April 2000) at 3:30 P.M. in the
   auditorium at the Visitor Center.
       IMAGE LAUNCHED MARCH 25 (3/28/00)
      "IMAGE will rewrite the textbooks," according to the IMAGE mission PI
      Dr. James Burch of Southwest Research Institute at a press briefing
      last Friday, the day before the flawless launch of the IMAGE spacecraft
      aboard a Delta rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. One
      of the instruments carried on the IMAGE spacecraft, the Low Energy
      Neutral Atom or LENA imager, will for the first time explore the low
      energy neutral atoms in the geospace environment.

      By Monday morning, the AST has been successfully powered on, the torque
      rod put into acquisition mode (spin control mode), HENA turned on with
      acoustic door opened, and LENA turned on with successful LV SFF. In the
      next 24 hours FUV will be powered on with an SFF, GEO on, and RPI SFF,
      and EUV powered on with SFF. The IMAGE S/C is operating nominally
      except for the Nutation Damper, which is not damping. There is
      currently a 3 deg. coning motion, and efforts to eliminate it are being
      planned.

   Tom Moore 1  LENA Lead Co-I on FOX NEWS (3/23/00)
   Dr. Thomas E. Moore of Goddard Space Flight Center, Mission Scientist
   for IMAGE and the Lead Co-Investigator for the Low Energy Neutral Atom
   (LENA) imager on IMAGE, will appear on Fox News (channel 5) this Friday
   morning, 24 March 2000, at about 9:45 A.M., to discuss the upcoming
   IMAGE launch and its associated science, including LENA's role.
   LENA Browse Movie  GSFC first to gaze at Low Energy Neutrals
   A team of scientists and engineers led by Dr. Thomas Moore at NASA's
   Goddard Space Flight Center will soon be the first to peer at a cloud
   of low energy neutral atoms that encircle the earth. The instrument,
   named LENA, will be launched this February from California's Vanderberg
   Air Force Base...
    IMAGE SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH MARCH 25 (3/23/00)
   NASA is about to launch the first spacecraft dedicated to imaging the
   Earth's magnetosphere - an invisible magnetic field surrounding the
   planet that is strongly influenced by the solar wind. Imager for
   Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration, or IMAGE is scheduled to
   launch onboard a Delta II 7326 rocket, on March 25 from the Western
   Range of Vandenberg Air Force Base, California during an eight-minute
   launch window, which opens at 3:35 p.m. EST. IMAGE is the first of its
   kind, designed to actually "see" most of the major charged particle
   systems in the space surrounding Earth. Previous spacecraft explored
   the magnetosphere by detecting particles and fields they encountered as
   they passed through them. This technique limited their "vision" to
   small portions of this vast and dynamic field, which extends about
   40,000 miles on Earth's day side and about 110,000 miles on Earth's
   night side. It would be similar to attempt understanding the nature of
   the world's oceans from a single buoy. Goddard Space Flight Center, in
   addition to managing the mission, has supplied one of the neutral atom
   imagers on the spacecraft.
    NASA to Launch Spacecraft to Study Impact of Magnetic Storms
   (3/17/00)
   A new NASA spacecraft, the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global
   Expl oration (IMAGE), will make the hidden chaos of the Earth's
   magnetosphere visibl e for the first time. Scheduled to launch
   Saturday, March 25 from Vandenberg Ai r Force Base, Calif. at 3:35 p.m.
   EST, the Goddard-managed IMAGE spacecraft wil l be the first mission
   dedicated to studying the vast but invisible magnetic fi eld around
   Earth. Sophisticated imaging instruments on IMAGE will help research
   ers better understand and predict magnetic storms. IMAGE will use
   energetic neu tral atom imaging and conventional photon (light-based)
   imaging, including ultr aviolet wavelengths and radio sounding, to
   gather large-scale images of the pri ncipal plasma regions and
   boundaries of Earth's inner magnetosphere. For more information on this
   exciting mission, go to: http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/gnews/031700

    IMAGE Launch Date
   Finally, launch of IMAGE has slipped a little, and is currently
   expected no earlier than March 25. IMAGE is the first satellite mission
   dedicated to im aging the Earth's magnetosphere. Follow the news at
   http://pluto.space.swri.edu/IMAGE/
    IMAGE Launch Date Being Evaluated
   The launch of NASA's Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global
   Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft is under review pending results of a
   thorough analysis and testing of power converters on the spacecraft. To
   date, there have been no problems with components on IMAGE, however
   identical converters have failed on two known spacecraft, prompting the
   IMAGE Project to request testing of these components for reassurance
   they will function as intended once on orbit. The project has recently
   completed the Mission Readiness and Mission Status Reviews in
   preparation for launch. For more information visit the project website
   at: http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov
    IMAGE Launch Rescheduled
   The launch of NASA's Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global
   Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft at the Vandenberg Air Force Base launch
   site in Central California has been rescheduled. The launch will take
   place no earlier than Feb. 26. For more information about the IMAGE
   mission and its instruments, go to: http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov
