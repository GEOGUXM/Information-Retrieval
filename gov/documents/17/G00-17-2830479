   Welcome!

   The PSAO is a systems analysis group within NASA Glenn's Aeronautics
   Directorate. We analytically predict the thermodynamic cycle
   performance of a variety of airbreathing engines, perform
   aeromechanical engine design, aircraft trajectory calculations,
   economic assessments, and environmental analyses in support of many
   NASA aeronautics programs.
