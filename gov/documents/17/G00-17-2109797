   [construction.gif] Most recent update to this page: January 14, 2000

   We intend to use this server as a medium for the distribution of CERN
   library related announcements, release notes, programming hints,
   examples and answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). From time to
   time, items obtained from CERN and other sites not directly related to
   the CERN library will appear here as well.

   Some items on this page are, in fact, links to other servers so there
   may be long downloading delays. To give you some advanced warning about
   possible long delays, items with links local to the Fermilab site are
   marked with a [greenball.gif] while items with off-site links are
   marked with a [redball.gif] .
