   Introduction

   The Template Numerical Toolkit is a collection of mathematical
   libraries for numeric computation in C++. Its fundamental classes
   include vectors, matrices, and multidimensional arrays. The basic goal
   is to allow one to express mathematical computation at a higher level
   of abstraction, while still retaining some control over performance and
   optimization issues. Doing so requires a careful analysis to balance
   these tradeoffs.

   The toolkit provides an integrated collection of generic matrix/vector
   classes based on components of the Standard Template Library (STL) and
   ANSI C++, together with specialization of generic algorithms for
   maximal efficiency.

   The TNT component for linear algebra is a successor to the Lapack++,
   Sparselib++, IML++, and MV++ packages. Its goal is to formally
   integrate these ideas into a generic algorithmic library, supporting
   user-defined data types, and increasing its functionality. It also
   takes advantage of the latest features in the ANSI C++ specification
   which were not available when we designed these earlier packages.
