                           NWFSC Privacy Statement

     Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information
     about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide
     that information to us.

      Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:


               Information Collected and Stored Automatically

     If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
     read pages, or download information, we will gather and store
     certain information about your visit automatically. This information
     does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store
     only the following information about your visit:


     * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
     * the type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
     * the date and time you access our site;
     * the pages you visit;
     * if you linked to the NWFSC website from another website, the
       address of that website.


     We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
     visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and
     the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
     information about individuals and their visits.



                     If You Send Us Personal Information

     If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an
     e-mail to the webmaster or any other individual listed on the site,
     or by filling out a form with your personal information and
     submitting it to us through our website (such as the guestbook) --
     we use that information to respond to your message and to help us
     get you the information you have requested. We treat emails the same
     way we treat letters. We are required to maintain many documents for
     historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for
     any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the
     information you give us with another government agency if your
     inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law.
     Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information
     you provide or to give it to any private organizations. The NWFSC
     does not collect information for commercial marketing.



                            Links to Other Sites

     Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases
     we link to private organizations, with their permission. Once you
     link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the
     new site.

     For more information, see the general NOAA Privacy Statement.
