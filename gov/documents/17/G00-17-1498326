                             OMAC API Workgroup

                            Information HomePage

   The OMAC API is a working group that is part of the Open Modular
   Architecture Controls (OMAC) User's Group. The OMAC API charter is to
   develop a specification that defines an intelligent closed loop
   controller environment to support open architecture concepts including
   application portability at the source level, interoperability of
   modules, and extensibility of controller functionality. It is intended
   for system integrators and applications software developers. In
   addition to information on the OMAC API, this home page contains
   hyperlinks to other standards or specification efforts for open
   architectures.

   For information on API Working Group Specification:
     * OMAC API Specification Part 1 - General Introduction HTML | PDF
     * OMAC API  Reference Documentation
     * OMAC API Dated Overview v0.23 Draft PDF | RTF
     * OMAC API Bibiliography
     * OMAC API IDL Definitions - Source

   Source code developed at NIST is available for some of aspects of the
   OMAC API.
     *   new2.gif (147 bytes)   OMACAPI Demo Source  The code gives the
       basic idea of how components would work. Documentation has not been
       posted yet. It is a zip file, with setup.exe to install. Those
       familiar with Visual Studio will understand the layout. Under
       /omacapidemo/proj/AxisHMI is the primary project.
     *  Measures and Units Software Package - This software package
       contains some source code and Visual Studio projects illustrating
       an implementation of STEP 41 measures and units as a MIDL
       specification and implemented as a COM component. Automatic
       conversion of units and derived units is available. Has not yet
       been integrated into the OMAC API Single Axis Demo.
     * Finite State Machine Software Package - This software package
       contains some C++ source code and Visual Studio projects
       implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) library, useful for
       Visual C++   Is part of the OMAC API Single Axis Demo.
