     Newly Discovered Subclass of "Local" Gamma Ray Bursts May Solve a
          Mystery or Two - January 8, 2002
          Although scientists have believed for some time that most
          gamma-ray bursts are very distant, a Goddard scientist has
          discovered 100 of them that are quite "local," within 325
          million light years from Earth.

     NASA's HETE Spots Rare Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow - November 7, 2001
          A rare optical afterglow of a gamma-ray burst, the most powerful
          type of explosion in the universe, was recently discovered by
          NASA's High Energy Transient Explorer (HETE), the first
          satellite dedicated to spotting these frequent yet random
          explosions that last only for a few seconds.

     Black Hole Hunter Instrument Tested in Flight at Edge of Space -
