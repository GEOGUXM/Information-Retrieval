   [spacer.gif] [spacer.gif]

   Thank you for visiting the Legal Services Corporations web site and
   for reviewing our privacy policy. Our policy is clear:

   Other than information automatically collected and stored (see below),
   we compile no information about you when you visit our web site unless
   you choose to provide that information to us. We will not disclose any
   personal information you decide to provide us, unless disclosure is
   required by law.

   Information Automatically Collected and Stored:

   When you browse through our web site, we automatically collect and
   temporarily store the following information about your visit:

   [blk_bul.gif] the name of the domain you use to access the Internet;
   [spacer.gif]
   [blk_bul.gif] the type of browser and operating system you used to
                 visit our web site;
   [spacer.gif]
   [blk_bul.gif] the date and time of your visit;
   [spacer.gif]
   [blk_bul.gif] the pages you visited; and
   [spacer.gif]
   [blk_bul.gif] the address of the web site you used to visit our web
                 site.

   We use this information for statistical purposes and to help make our
   site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated
   otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

   Personally Provided Information:

   If you choose to provide personal information about yourself, we will
   use the information only to respond properly to your request or to
   fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. We will not disclose

   request, your name and a copy of your request normally must be
   disclosed if requested by any person. Your home address and phone
   number, however, would be protected under FOIAs privacy exemption.
