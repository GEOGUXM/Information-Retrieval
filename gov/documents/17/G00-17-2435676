   This is a collection of NASA Airborne Oceanographic LIDAR (AOL3)
   fluorosensing information. This area is currently for the use of
   researchers, and others who are interested in the science and
   technology of remote sensing. and any data presented here should be
   considered a preliminary data product.

                                Introduction

   The NASA AOL project is involved in several different ways of remotely
   measuring chlorophyll and other biological and chemical substances in
   the world's oceans. The AOL uses sensors that are flown in aircraft to
   make these measurements.

    Why measure and study chlorophyll in the ocean?

   There is an excellent website called Living Ocean on the NASA SeaWifs
   site that can answer basic questions on why what the NASA AOL measures
   is important to everyone. After visiting the Living Ocean site, please
   return here to see how the AOL project supports satellite measurements
   of chlorophyll.

    Why use aircraft to do oceanography?

   Aircraft have several advantages as a platform to study the ocean.
   Aircraft can fly over long stretches of ocean very quickly (as compared
   to a ship), therefore the measurements made by the aircraft instruments
   have less changes due to time than shipborne measurements. Aircraft can
   also fly in weather that makes satellite measurements impossible (for
   example under cloud cover). On the other hand, ships can make
   subsurface measurements that aircraft cannot, and can carry a wider
   variety of instruments to study the ocean. Satellite sensors have
   advantages in measuring large areas of the ocean very quickly, and
   repeating measurements over a number of years. The three types of
   platforms actually work well with each other, with the measurements
   from all three validating and supporting each other.

   Here's some photos of the aircraft with the AOL3 installed.

    How does the AOL measure chlorophyll in the ocean from an aircraft?

   The AOL fluorosensor uses a pulse of laser light fired from the
   aircraft down into the ocean. The laser light hits the single celled
   plants in the ocean. The chlorophyll inside the plants absorbs the
   laser light, and fluoresces, giving off red light, in much the same way
   as certain paints glow under a "black light". A telescope onboard the
   aircraft collects the light from the plants, and electronic equipment
   converts the signal into numbers a computer can record.

   The AOL also carries spectrometers similar to the type used by
   satellite sensors, that measure the color of the sunlight reflected
   from the ocean. The spectrometers used onboard the aircraft have more
   channels than the satellite spectrometers, so the data collected by the
   aircraft can be analyzed in greater detail, and improved methods of
   processing satellite data developed.

   The combination of using two completely different methods of measuring
   chlorophyll from the aircraft allows comparison of the results by each
   method, and a better understanding of how both sunlight and laser light
   interact with ocean water.

    How long has the AOL been making these measurements?

   The present NASA Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (known as AOL3), evolved
   from several earlier versions of airborne laser instruments dating back
   to 1977. To read about the history and development of the NASA AOL
   project, please visit the history page.

    What other instruments are available through the AOL program?

   The AOL program also has developed the NASA Shipboard Laser Fluorometer
   (SLF) which is carried onboard research ships, and automatically makes
   laser measurements of plankton in the ocean. The SLF data is useful in
   verifying the airborne and satellite measurements.

   The AOL program maintains a NASA GSFC Code 921 AERONET CSPOT sensor at
   the WFF airport. The CSPOT makes aerosol measurements by viewing the
   sky and sun on clear days, and also operates automatically. The CSPOT
   data can be useful in evaluating data from the satellite-like sensors
   onboard the AOL3 aircraft.

    Details

   The NASA AOL Fluorosensor is a laser fluorospectrometer (and associated
   instruments) which is carried onboard aircraft as small as twin engine
   planes. The AOLFL measures a variety of reflected and induced light
   properties, from which a number of oceanographic surface water
   properties can be derived.

   The primary AOL3 sensor is a dual wavelength laser fluorospectrometer.
   This sensor transmits two laser wavelengths, one UV (355nm) and one
   green (532nm) to the ocean surface from the aircraft. These laser
   frequencies interact with the water molecules, causing a shift in the
   laser frequency. This Raman shift of the 355nm and 532 nm laser
   radiation allows normalization of other light measurements to
   compensate for changes in water clarity. If biological organisms
   containing chlorophyll and/or phycoerythrin are present in the water,
   the 532nm laser light is absorbed, and reemitted as particular bands of
   fluorescence. These fluorescent signals can be normalized to the water
   Raman signal, and have been shown to agree well with shipboard
   measurements of the same pigments. The 355nm laser radiation causes
   fluorescence of some of the dissolved organic material in the water.
   The water Raman normalized of this dissolved organic material is
   labeled CDOM or FDOM is the AOL3 data product library.

   The AOL3 also carries several spectrometers which measure the
   downwelling sunlight incident on the top of the aircraft, and the
   reflected sunlight from the ocean surface. From these measurements,
   various algorithms can determine chlorophyll concentrations in the same
   manner as CZCS satellite. The ability of the AOLFL sensors to make
   oceanographic optical component measurements by both laser fluorescence
   techiques and by reflected spectra techniques allows the validity of
   each technique to be tested.

   history of the AOL project can be found here.
