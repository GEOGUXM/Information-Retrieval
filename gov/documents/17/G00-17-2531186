  Information Automatically Collected and Stored:

   When you connected to this web page, the details of your visit
   automatically began to be recorded in the log files of the computer
   that runs this software.  This is not unusual.  Virtually all network
   servers create these log files as a tool for improving the reliability
   and efficiency of the machine.  We use this information for statistical
   purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.  No
   additional information will be collected about you without your
   specific permission.  These logs are destroyed after 90 days.

   We automatically collect and temporarily store the following
   information about your visit:
     * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
       aol.com, if you are using an American Online account, or
       stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
       domain);
     * The date and time of your visit;
     * The address of the page where you came from; and
     * The pages you visit while you are here.

  Personal Information That You Provide:

   You do not have to give us any personal information in order to use our
   web information. If you choose to provide additional information about
   yourself in an e-mail message, a survey form, etc., we will keep the
   information only as long as it is needed to respond to your question or
   to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.  However, the
   Federal Records Act requires that we keep all communications addressed
   to the HHS Secretary for historical purposes.  The Privacy Act ensures
   that these communications receive certain limited protection from
   unauthorized use and disclosure.

   HHS does not give away, rent, sell, or share with others any personal
   information about our visitors.

  Systems of Records:

   Information collected in traditional paper systems can be submitted
   electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions such as
   applications for grants, requests for publications, etc.  Any
   information you provide electronically will be covered by the rules of
   the Privacy Act to the same extent as if you provided it on paper.  If
   your personal information is to be used in a system of records, a
   specific Privacy Act Notice will be provided.

  Security Concerns:

   This is a U.S. Government computer.  Under Title 18 of the U.S. Code it
   is illegal to use this resource for any purpose other than as an
   Internet Server for the dissemination of information authorized by the
   Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department
   of Health and Human Services.  For security purposes and to ensure that
   this service remains available to all users, we monitor incoming
   traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload, change
   information, or otherwise cause damage.  In the event of an
   investigation by law enforcement authorities, information from these
   sources may be used to investigate possible crimes.
