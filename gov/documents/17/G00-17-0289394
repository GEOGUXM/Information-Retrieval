   AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDs)

   Automated external defibrillators are an important lifesaving
   technology and may have a role to play in treating workplace cardiac
   arrest. Thirteen percent of workplace fatalities reported to OSHA
   during the past two years were due to cardiac arrests. While most of
   the cases were not related to work, there are a number of work factors
   which may contribute to heart disease. These issues are discussed in
   the following document:

       Safety and Health (NIOSH)

   Cardiac arrest is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm, usually
   ventricular fibrillation, and is treated with electrical
   defibrillation. Emergency medical service teams typically respond to
   cardiac arrest, and survival is improved with early defibrillation. In
   order to respond more rapidly to cardiac arrest, AEDs have been
   developed which can be used by trained lay people. The American Heart
   Association has proposed public access defibrillation programs to place
   AEDs in areas where cardiac arrests occur and the response time can be
   reduced to three to five minutes.

       Association.

   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in conjunction with the
   American Heart Association, is studying whether community volunteers
   can be as effective as emergency medical service personnel in the use
   of AEDs. The study will determine if it is realistic and cost-effective
   to train large numbers of people to use these devices, and will be
   concluded in 2003.

   professional organization representing occupational physicians, has
   developed guidelines for instituting AEDs in the workplace. The
   elements of a successful program are discussed.
