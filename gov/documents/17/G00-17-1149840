     and pension records, passenger arrival records, census records,
     Eastern Cherokee application records, and land entry records may be
     requested by mail using NATF Forms 81 through 86. You may obtain

Up Questions on the Status of NATF Orders

     Orders placed on NATF Forms 81 through 86 are generally completed in
     approximately eight weeks from the time we receive them. Please
     note, however, that orders placed on NATF Form 85, for full pension
     files, generally take twelve to sixteen weeks, due to the large size
     of the files.

     If you have not received a response to your order for copies within
     the stated times, please send an email to orderstatus@nara.gov or
     call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-234-8861. Be sure to
     provide the following information:
     * your name and postal mailing address
     * the order number (preprinted on the NATF Forms 81 through 86), if
       applicable
     * a daytime phone number, if you wish to be called.

     This email address may also be used to check on the status of orders
     for fee and free publications.
