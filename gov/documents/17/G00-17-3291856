   and store the following non-identifying information:
     * The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web

   site more useful to visitors by learning the number of visitors to our
   site, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for specific

   individuals and their visits.

   We generally do not use cookies, which are files or file entries placed
   on your computer's hard drive by a web site, that allow monitoring of
   your use of the site. Some activities, such as using the American
   FactFinder, do require the use of transient cookies. In American
   FactFinder, transient cookies are used to keep track of user selections
   so that new requests for specific data or maps can be created more
   efficiently. No personally identifiable information is permanently
   retained on either the user's or the Census Bureau's computers. These
   transient cookies go away completely when you exit the browser.

   Information Collected from E-mail: When you send us
   personally-identifying information in an e-mail, we use the information
   you provide only to help us gather the information you might request.
   In an effort to respond to your request, information you submit may be
   viewed by various people within the Census Bureau. Public notices
   issued by the Bureau in which interested persons are invited to comment
   by e-mail will contain a notice of what we intend to do with the data
   gathered. Once received, the information in your e-mail is protected in
   accordance with law (e.g., the Privacy Act and the Freedom of
   Information Act).

   Security, Intrusion, and Detection: For site security purposes and to
   ensure that this service remains available to all users, this
   government computer system employs software programs to monitor network
   traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
   information, or otherwise cause damage.

   An e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Whether or
   not an e-mail is encrypted in transmission depends on your software.

   Links to Other Web Sites: Our web site contains links to other federal
   agencies, international agencies, and private organizations. Once you
   link to another site you are subject to the policies of the new site.

Privacy Policy for Respondents to Surveys and Censuses

   Some Census Bureau surveys and censuses permit response over the
   Internet. The following additional policies apply to
   personally-identifiable information provided in response to a Census
   Bureau survey or census.

     To respond to a survey or census via the Internet, you will have to
     provide us personally-identifiable information. For each survey and
     census, we provide an explanation to respondents about the
     confidentiality of the data and the laws that protect that data
     (e.g., Title 13, United States Code Section 9 (a)).

     To protect your privacy, in the remote chance that your survey or
     census responses are intercepted, all web data submissions are
     encrypted.

   Questions concerning this policy may be addressed to:
   webmaster@census.gov, attn: Policy Office.

  Document Accessibility

   The Census Bureau is committed to making every document on its internet
   server accessible to all. Currently, we are reviewing our site and
   making modifications to those pages which are not in compliance with
   the Americans with Disabilities Acts. We use Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) to create pages that are generally accessible to persons using
   screen reading devices, and we are careful in our construction of HTML
   documents to insure maximum accessibility. We will include alternate
   text describing graphics.

   Many Census Bureau internet documents are in ASCII or HTML formats.
   These documents are accessible to persons using screen reading
   software. We also have a large number of documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF
   (Portable Document Format) files. Currently, many people using screen
   reading devices cannot read documents in PDF format.

   Adobe Systems, Inc., is producing various products designed to make
   Adobe Acrobat documents accessible to persons using screen reading
   software. Their accessibility web pages describe their efforts. They
   also have a free downloadable accessibility plug-in, called Adobe
   Access, for use with the latest versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader
   for Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT. This plug-in,
   which is still in a beta version, helps to overcome some of the
   problems of reading PDF documents with screen readers. While these
   tools are in development, we are committed to providing ASCII or HTML
   versions of these PDF files.

   Comments on our accessibility policies are invited, and should be sent
   to: James.R.Clark@ccMail.Census.GOV.

  Links to Third Party Sites

   For the benefit of our visitors, the US Census Bureau Web site contains
   links to third party sites not operated by the US Census Bureau. Such
   sites are not within the control of the US Census Bureau and may not
   follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility policies as the US
   Census Bureau Web site. The US Census Bureau is not responsible for the
   content or availability of those sites, their partners, or advertisers.

  Census Bureau Statement on Statistical Quality

   NOTE TO ALL DATA USERS:

   All survey and census results contain measurement error and may contain
   sampling error.

   Available information about these potential errors is provided or
   referenced in data products as they are presented.

   The Census Bureau recommends that data users incorporate this
   information into their analyses as these errors could impact
   inferences.

   Researchers analyzing the data to create their own estimates are
   responsible for their validity and should not cite the Bureau of the
   Census as the source of the estimates but only of the core data.

  Confidentiality

   Protection of Confidential Information -- Sections 9 and 214 of Title
   13

   Sec. 9. Information as confidential; exception

   (a) Neither the Secretary, nor any other officer or employee of the
   Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof, or local government
   census liaison may, except as provided in section 8 or 16 or chapter 10
   of this title or section 210 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice,
   and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
   1998.^(1)

     (1) use the information furnished under the provisions of this title
   for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is
   supplied; or

     (2) make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular
   establishment or individual under this title can be identified; or

     (3) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the
   Department or bureau or agency thereof to examine the individual
   reports.  No department, bureau, agency, officer, or employee of the
   Government, except the Secretary in carrying out the purposes of this
   title, shall require, for any reason, copies of census reports which
   have been retained by any such establishment or individual. Copies of
   census reports which have been so retained shall be immune from legal
   process, and shall not, without the consent of the individual or
   establishment concerned, be admitted as evidence or used for any
   purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial or administrative
   proceeding.

   (b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section relating to the
   confidential treatment of data for particular individuals and
   establishments, shall not apply to the censuses of governments provided
   for by subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title, nor to interim
   current data provided for by subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title
   as to the subjects covered by censuses of governments, with respect to
   any information obtained therefor that is compiled from, or customarily
   provided in, public records.

   Sec. 214. Wrongful disclosure of information

   Whoever, being or having been an employee or staff member referred to
   in subchapter II of chapter 1 of this title, having taken and
   subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe the
   limitations imposed by section 9 of this title, or whoever, being or
   having been a census liaison within the meaning of section 16^(2) of
   this title, publishes or communicates any information, the disclosure
   of which is prohibited under the provisions of section 9 of this title,
   and which comes into his possession by reason of his being employed (or
   otherwise providing services) under the provisions of this title, shall
   be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or
   both.

   1. The Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994, P.L. 103-430 amends
   section 9(a) by inserting "or local government census liaison" and
   adding references to section 16. P.L. 105-119, the Departments of
   Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies
   Appropriations Act, 1998, adds the reference to section 210.

   2. The Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-430)
   amends section 214 making references to section 16 and "census
   liaisons."
