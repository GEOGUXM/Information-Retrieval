                Nonindigenous Sponge Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sponges (Phylum Porifora) are sessile organisms usually found in marine
   waters, although a few species do live in fresh water. Standard methods
   of introduction include ship fouling or transportation in ballast water
   of ocean-going vessels. Potential impacts include competition with
   native species for suitable substrate and negative effects on organisms
   to which they attach. An example of an introduced sponge is Bowerbank's
   Crumb of Bread sponge, Halichondria bowerbanki. This sponge was
   introduced to the west coast with commercial oyster plantings. So far,
   its impacts are unknown.
   We welcome any contributions or comments you may have.
