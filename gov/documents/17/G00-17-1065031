Senator McCain's Criteria for Pork

   For ten years, Senator McCain has reviewed the annual appropriations
   bills to determine whether they contain items that are low-priority,
   unnecessary, or wasteful spending. In this process, he has used five
   objective criteria to identify programs and projects that have not been
   appropriately reviewed in the normal, merit-based prioritization
   process. These criteria are:
     * Unauthorized appropriations;
     * Unrequested locality-specific earmarks, research facility-specific
       earmarks, and other earmarks that would circumvent the normal
       competitive award process;
     * Budget add-ons that would be subject to a budget point of order;
     * Transfer or disposal of federal property or items under terms that
       circumvent existing law; and
     * New items added in conference that were never considered in either
       bill in either House.


   Senator McCain's criteria are not intended to reflect a judgment on the
   merits of an item. They are designed to identify projects that have not
   been considered in an appropriate, merit-based prioritization process.
