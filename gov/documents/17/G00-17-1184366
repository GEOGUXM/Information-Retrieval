NEW! Redistricting Plan 4

     The Saint Paul City Charter states that after every federal census,
     the City Charter Commission ...shall redefine the council districts
     so as to make them substantially equal. The Commission is now in
     the process of drawing ward redistricting plans with year 2000
     census data. It intends the final City plan to be adopted no later
     than April 30th, 2002. Public involvement is important to the
     process and the Commission is currently reviewing four plans for
     public consideration and comment. These plans have been drawn using
     the following criteria:
     * Substantially equal ward populations
     * The voting strength of minority populations are not diluted
     * The communities of interest are substantially maintained
