   The Voyager Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) is designed to exploit to the
   fullest practical degree the proposed trajectories of Voyager-1 and -2.
   The significance of these measurements will be greatly enhanced by
   concurrent measurements with similar particle telescopes on satellites
   such as the Pioneers, IMPs, and similar series in near-earth orbits.
   The principal scientific objectives of this experiment are:
     * To measure the flow patterns of energetic solar and galactic
       particles separately in the inter-planetary field. To interpret
       this measurement, simultaneous determination of the energy
       spectrum, radial gradient, distribution, and streaming parameters
       is required for each nuclear species and over as wide an energy
       range as is practicable.
     * To measure the energy spectra, and isotopic composition of galactic
       and solar cosmic rays from the lowest practical energies up to ~800
       MeV/nucleon and (by use of objective 1) to unfold the primary flare
       and interstellar spectrum.
     * To measure the time variations of the differential energy spectra
       of electrons, hydrogen and helium nuclei over the corresponding
       energy intervals. During flare events, to obtain time histories;
       during quiet times, to relate gross time variations to those near
       earth thus deducing a spatial gradient for galactic cosmic rays.
     * To study the energy spectra, time variations and spatial gradients
       associated with recurrent and non-flare associated interplanetary
       proton and helium streams and to define the related solar or
       inter-planetary acceleration processes.
     * To provide information on the energetic particle distribution
       surrounding Jupiter and Saturn.
     * To try to determine the extent of the solar cavity, the energetic
       particle phenomena occurring at this interface and the cosmic ray
       density in nearby interstellar space.

   To accomplish these objectives CRS makes the following measurements:

     * Galactic cosmic ray protons and Solar proton intensities in the
       energy range 1.8 - 200 MeV
     * Galactic cosmic ray helium and Solar helium intensities in the
       energy range 1.8 - 500 MeV/nucleon
     * Galactic and Solar electron intensities in the energy range 0.2-
       13.0 MeV
     * Li,Be,B,C,N,O,F,Ne intensities and their isotopic composition in
       the energy range 6 MeV/nuc - 200 MeV/nuc
     * Integral flux of IONS > 70 MeV
