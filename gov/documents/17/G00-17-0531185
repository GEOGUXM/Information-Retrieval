   Administration has been having a major problem with incoming mail.  The
   following are tips to expedite delivery.
        1.  Do not send anything to the P.O Box by Express Mail.   The
   mail is only checked when I pass the post office, every couple of
   days.  The correspondence will not reach the adressee any faster than
   regular mail.  It is a waste of money and will not speed it up.
        2.  If you have mail for a specific staff member, it is best if
   you address it to the staff member at his/her home address.  Admin can
   only resend it which only adds to the delay.   If you can't find an
   address, contact the webmaster who will help you.
        3.  The Admin officer opens all mail addressed to region
   headquarters that is not specifically addressed to a staff member.  If
   there is no hurry on the communications, you can address it to the
   region headquarters address such as Headquarters, Rocky Mountain
   Region, CAP/DO for the DSC/Operations.   If the member lives in the
   Denver area and comes to the twice a month meetings, I distribute
   then.  If the member is out of town, we resend it as expeditiously as
   possible.
        4.  I recommend using email as much as possible.  The email
   address of all staff members is available on the home page under Region
   Staff Roster.  I recommend contacting the staff member in question
   first by email to determine the best method of communicating with them.
