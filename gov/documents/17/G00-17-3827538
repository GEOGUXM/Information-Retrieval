            Workshop on Structure Formation and Dark Matter Halos

                          Fermilab, 10-12 May 2001

       The meeting will focus on how recently or soon-to-be released data
       sets can best be used to constrain models of hierarchical
       clustering.

Galaxy surveys: Observations and models

          clustering as a function of colour, morphological type
          evolution of clustering as a function of colour, type
          redshift space distortions
          halo models
       Cluster surveys

     optical, X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich

Gravitational lensing surveys

     strong, weak, galaxy-galaxy, quasar-galaxy
     shear and magnification bias

(In)direct dark matter searches

Problems

     cuspy cores and halo substructure

                    General information and accomodation

     General information about Fermilab, travel between Chicago's O'Hare
     airport and Fermilab, and hotels in the area is available here.
     Rooms at Red Roof Inn or at Extended Stay America should get a
     discounted rate if you mention Fermilab when making your
     reservation.

     A hotel map is available here. We will not be organizing any special
     transportation between Fermilab and the hotels.
