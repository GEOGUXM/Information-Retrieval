                              Comet Ephemerides

   There is a new IAU numbering scheme for periodic comets observed at
   more than one apparition. (This is something like the numbering scheme
   for asteroids.) These are links to the official (IAU) lists -- as a
   function of name and as a function of number.

   For those observers that want to compute their own ephemerides...

   The JPL HORIZONS On-Line Solar System Data and Ephemeris Computation
   Service provides access to key solar system data and flexible
   production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar system objects
   (21000+ asteroids and comets, 63 natural satellites, 9 planets, the
   Sun).

   Given below are direct links to the orbital elements and ephemerides
   provided by the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) for
   comets that can be visually observed. Orbital elements and ephemerides
   for all observable comets are also provided by (CBAT). Please note that
   most of the comets on CBAT's general list are too faint to be visually
   observed and many are too faint to be observed by amateur CCD
   equipment. On this page, links are provided for those comets expected
   to be at least as bright as magnitude 13.5 (with the except of
   29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, which could have an outburst an any time).

   All these ephemerides are given in 2000 coordinates.
