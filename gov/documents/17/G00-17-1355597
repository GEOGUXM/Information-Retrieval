   [clearspc.gif] Cantor Presents Purple Heart Medal Posthumously to the
   Family of Specialist Floyd Burnett Coates

   Culpeper, VA, Nov. 13— This afternoon, at the Culpeper Board of
   Supervisors Meeting Room, Congressman Eric Cantor (R-Virginia)
   presented the Purple Heart posthumously to the sister of Floyd Burnett
   Coates for Mr. Coates’ service in the Vietnam War. Congressman Cantor
   contacted the United States Army and helped to secure the Purple Heart
   for Coates who died at age 20 in service to his country.

   Coates was a member of Alpha Troop, First Squadron, 11^th Armored
   Cavalry Regiment. He earned the Purple Heart by remaining steadfast at
   his artillery firing position as a mortar round exploded, taking his
   life on March 25, 1970.

   "Specialist Coates was one of these brave Americans to perish in the
   service of his country in Vietnam," Cantor said during the award
   ceremony this afternoon. "Thirty-one years later, he is not forgotten.
   Today, we are mindful of his life and thankful for his contributions to
   this nation."

   "He embodied the spirit of patriotic Americans around the country and
   throughout history who have answered the call to duty," Cantor added.
   "As we reflect upon the valor and patriotism of Specialist Coates, I
   can assure you that America does not take her freedom for granted."

   In addition to the Purple Heart awarded today, Specialist Floyd Burnett
   Coates previously was the recipient of the Bronze Star, Good Conduct,
   and National Service Defense Medals; the Combat Infantryman’s Badge;
   and the Vietnam Campaign Ribbon.
