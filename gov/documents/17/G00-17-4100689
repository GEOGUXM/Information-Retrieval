   [whitedot.gif]

   To explore the formation and evolution of the solar system and the
   earth within it.
     * Understand the origin of the solar nebula and the forces that
       formed Earth and the other planets.
     * Determine the evolutionary processes that led to the diversity of
       solar system bodies and the uniqueness of planet Earth.
     * Use the exotic worlds of our solar system as natural science
       laboratories.

   To seek the origins of life and its existence beyond earth.
     * Understand the sources and reservoirs of water and organics... the
       building blocks of life.
     * Determine the planetary conditions required for the emergence of
       life.
     * Search for evidence of past and present life elsewhere in our solar
       system.

   To chart our destiny in the solar system.
     * Understand the solar system forces and processes that affect the
       future habitability of Earth.
     * Find extraterrestrial resources of human interest.
     * Assess suitability of selected planetary locales for human
       exploration.
