      CURRENT ISSUES
      Signs, Posters, and Placard Nuisance Abatement Task Force
      Read what citizens are saying about posters

   Many citizens throughout the District of Columbia have expressed
   displeasure at the proliferation of signs and posters placed in public
   space. The undesirable advertising messages, debris in the public
   space, and the visual blight they cause are ongoing problems that the
   city has not had a lot of success in abating. Posters left in the
   public space that end up being removed by city employees also consume
   financial resources that could be used for more positive programs. See
   photos.

      The Signs, Posters, and Placard Nuisance Abatement Task Force has been
      formed to determine what actions can be taken to discourage the
      placement of such materials on public space in the District. They are
      looking at how best to enforce existing regulations (24 DCMR Section
      108), while developing specific short and long term recommendations
      that can be implemented to provide the residents of the District with a
      cleaner city.

      The task force is also looking at a bill introduced to the City Council
      by Mayor Williams disallowing completely the placement of posters,
      signs and advertisements in public space. The task force will review
      the bill with a view towards developing testimony to address issues
      within the bill that may be controversial.

      The task force is chaired by Vincent Spaulding, Clean City Coordinator,
      Office of the Mayor. Members of the task force include representatives
      from the Metropolitan Police Department, Corporation Counsel, U.S.
      Attorney's Office, Department of Public Works, and Department of
      Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.

      Mission statement
       1. Develop recommendations to discourage the placement of
          advertisements not in compliance with District Municipal
          Regulations.

               that can be implemented to provide the residents of the
               District with a cleaner city.
             + Come up with specific recommendations as to the role and
               duties of the District agencies which have responsibilities
               regarding illegal advertisements in public space.

               measure progress in the abatement of illegal advertisements in
               public space.

          advertisements in public space.
