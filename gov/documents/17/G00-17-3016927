                               Coastal Hazards

                                   hazards

   Coastal hazards include both natural and man-made events (chronic and
   episodic) that threaten the health of coastal ecosystems and
   communities. This definition includes, but is not limited to,
   hurricanes, tsunamis, erosion, oil spills, harmful algal blooms, and
   pollution. Center projects in this theme area work to reduce the
   environmental, social, and economic impacts from coastal hazards by
   providing information and tools that facilitate increased
   decision-support capabilities for coastal managers.

     * GOAL 1
       Coastal communities have a significant reduction in loss of human,
       environmental, and economic impacts from both man-made and natural
       hazards.
     * GOAL 2
       The hazard-risk and vulnerability data, information, and
       application needs of Center clients are met.
     * GOAL 3
       Awareness and coordination among client groups is achieved,
       eliminating redundancy or gaps in hazards-related activities.
     * GOAL 4
       Coastal managers have the knowledge and skills to develop and
       implement hazard mitigation policies and practices.
