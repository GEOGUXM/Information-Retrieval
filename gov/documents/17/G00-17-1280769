   Introduction

   The Forest Service is a part of the United States government, which is
   usually called the federal government. The federal government is
   divided into departments. Each department is concerned with a topic of
   concern to United States citizens. The Forest Service is part of the
   United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. You probably think of
   food when you hear someone say "USDA". (To find out more about the
   USDA, go to www.usda.gov/news/usdakids/index.html). But food is not the
   only thing that land provides for people. The Forest Service is part of
   the USDA because it provides many things from the land for United
   States citizens. These things include minerals, clean water and air,
   trees for wood products, places to camp and hike, and places for
   animals to live.

   The Forest Service has three main branches. The largest branch consists
   of people who take care of over 150 national forests and grasslands.
   This branch is called the National Forest System. The second branch
   works with your state government and the corporations that are
   concerned with forests in your area. This branch is called State and
   Private Forestry. The third branch consists of scientists and others
   who conduct research projects to discover new things about the natural
   environment. This branch is called Research and Development. The
   Natural Inquirer describes the work of scientists within this branch of
   the Forest Service.

   The Forest Service is led by an individual who is called the Chief of
   the Forest Service. Chief Mike Dombeck, who leads the Forest Service
   today, used to be a school teacher! He wants everyone to learn about
   the Forest Service! If you want to read a message from the Chief, click
