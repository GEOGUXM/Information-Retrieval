Message from Administrator Christine Todd Whitman about Children's Health
Month

   EPAs mission is to protect human health and the environment. I am
   pleased to announce that we will be celebrating Childrens Health Month
   during October to highlight our efforts to protect childrens
   environmental health.

   As you know, childrens environmental health is a priority of mine. The
   quality of our air, water, and land has a direct effect on the health
   of our families, and especially our children. We all recognize that
   children are a unique population that requires special attention.

   To celebrate Childrens Health Month we will highlight the many
   partnerships we have made to promote the protection of children from
   environmental harm. We are kicking off the month by announcing our work
   with the Girl Scouts of America to incorporate environmental health
   into their programs. Through grants totaling $20,000, the Girl Scouts
   have developed a new Environmental Health Badge, a new chapter on
   environmental health in their Junior Girl Scout Handbook, and expanded
   their website to educate girls on water, sun, and air quality. I hope
   that many girls in the EPA family will be included in the 1.5 million
   Junior Scouts who will have an opportunity to earn the new badge.
