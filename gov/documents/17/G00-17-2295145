   Encryption Information

   When you login to the NEPP web site, all the information is sent in a
   scrambled format so that it cannot be intercepted and read by a third
   party. This scrambling is called encryption, and protects your private
   information when in transit to and from your computer.

   Make sure to review our browser recommendations. To login into NEPP you
   need a browser that is able to code/decode messages in 128-bit
   encryption, the highest level of encryption currently available.

   While signed-on to NEPP you will use a secure connection. If you do not
   login, there is no encryption involved.

   Also, recommended browsers will display a symbol of a lock, when you
   visit a site that requires encryption. If you are not in a secure area,
   lock will be open or not shown.
