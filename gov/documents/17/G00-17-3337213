   Graduate and Undergraduate Student Internships broaden the education of
   students majoring in science, mathematics, engineering, technology, or
   other areas that support the mission of the Department of Energys
   Nuclear Energy Program. These internships provide an intensive
   introduction to science and engineering careers through the guidance of
   experienced mentors at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental
   Laboratory (INEEL). The INEEL, in partnership with Argonne National
   Laboratory, is the Department of Energys lead nuclear energy
   laboratory. [ more on INEEL's nuclear programs ]
