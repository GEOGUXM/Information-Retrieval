   Version 3.0 Coming Soon - 12/21/01
   BSI-II version 3.0 will soon be released.
   To see all the exciting new features check out the BSI-II version 3.0
   announcement

   Version 2.7 Available - 12/07/00
   Today marks the release of version 2.7 of BSI-II. This upgrade will
   require everyone to uninstall the existing BSI-II system, then install
   the new one. We have made many small improvements to the system, to
   make it more reliable and easier to use.
   Changes include :
     * Most of the screens accessible from the View and Tools menu have
       become managers on the main tabbed panel. The View menu allows you
       to show or hide each manager.
     * Printing reliability is greatly improved.
     * The requisition editor allows many columns to display either
       unformatted or formatted values. The column-header menu is used to
       switch modes.
     * The data entry batch editor's "Export to text file" command now
       gives a choice of exporting all displayed columns or just columns
       with changed values.
     * There is a new "Go to row" command for finding a specific row in a
       data entry batch.
     * The search screen now remembers the last search performed
       (accessible through the "More" menu).
     * Automatic updating is easer: some updates will not require you to
       restart BSI-II, and many will be smaller and faster than before.


   Server Status Page - 09/13/00
   There is now a page which shows the status of the BSI-II Server.
