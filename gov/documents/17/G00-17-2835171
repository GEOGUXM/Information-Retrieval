   A message from David K. Garman, Assistant Secretary for Energy
   Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy.

   The attacks on our nation have changed all of our lives in ways we
   cannot yet fathom. We are immediately mindful of the human dimensions
   of this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone, known and
   unknown to us, who has suffered loss.

   I would like to thank everyone for the messages of sympathy we have
   received concerning this national tragedy. In this time of crisis, when
   energy security is a matter of critical importance, we encourage
   everyone to do what they can to use energy more efficiently and to
   consider the use of renewable energy sources.

   Sincerely,
   David K. Garman
