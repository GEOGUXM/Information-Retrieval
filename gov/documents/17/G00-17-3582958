   This is the home page for the Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR)
   experiment. This is an experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. It is an
   international collaboration of many institutions.

   STAR will search for signatures of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation
   and investigate the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high
   energy density. The emphasis will be the correlation of many
   observables on an event-by-event basis. In the absence of definitive
   signatures for the QGP, it is imperative that such correlations be used
   to identify special events and possible signatures. This requires a
   flexible detection system that can simultaneously measure many
   experimental observables. For an introduction to the Physics of STAR

   You should be able to access all STAR-specific information from here.
