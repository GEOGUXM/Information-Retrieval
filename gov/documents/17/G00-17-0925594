     The Kepler Mission depends on the ability to reliably measure the
     very small relative change in brightness of a star caused by the
     transit of an Earth-size planet. We have constructed a high-fidelity
     Testbed Facility of the end-to-end photometry system. This has been
     used to show that under all of the expected operating conditions
     which can add noise to the measurements, the signature of an
     Earth-size transit is readily detectable.

     This page provides an overview of the the technology demonstration
     that has been performed. It is followed by a page on the laboratory
     facility that has been constructed and then by a page that discusses
     the results.

Overview

     To perform an end-to-end system test of the Kepler Mission a
     laboratory facility has been built to replicate the elements that
     will compose the flight system. The laboratory system consists of:
     * A simulated star field that represents all of the features of the
       real sky that are important for ensemble photometry;
     * A photometer that operates and has the same characteristics of the
       flight photometer, including:
          + Fast optics to focus the star field onto the CCD detector,
          + A commercially available CCD that could be used in the flight
            system,
          + High speed readout electronics (operating at 1 mega
            pixel/sec/amp) to process the data as if onboard the
            spacecraft, and
          + Ground software used to produce the light curves, detect
            transits and evaluate the precision of the data.
     * A structure that provides thermal, mechanical and RF isolation and
       stability from the laboratory environment.

     The objective of the technical demonstration was to show that this
     end-to-end system can maintain the required relative precision over
     a period of time necessary to detect transits when all of the
     confounding noise factors are included. Note that the critical
     parameter is only relative precision, that is, the ratio of the flux
     of one star relative to the fluxes of many nearby stars read at the
     same time on the same CCD.
