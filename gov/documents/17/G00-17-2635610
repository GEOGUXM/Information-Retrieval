         The Monitoring Country Progress in Central and Eastern Europe and
      Eurasia report, produced annually by the Office of Program Coordination
      and Strategy of USAID's Europe and Eurasia Bureau, tracks the progress
      of twenty-seven transition countries as they attempt the transformation
        from communism to market-oriented democracies. The report provides
         criteria and analysis to assist U.S. government decisionmakers in
         determining when a country's graduation from USAID assistance is
        merited. Progress in economic and democratic reforms, macroeconomic
         performance, and social conditions are tracked and compared with
         countries outside of the region. This October 2001 report is the
                                 seventh edition.
