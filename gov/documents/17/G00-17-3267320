   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides numerous sources for
   obtaining natural science information and data pertaining to biology,
   geology, hydrology, and mapping. Science information can be obtained
   from information specialists located in field offices throughout the
   United States, from facilities that specialize in certain facets of
   science, and through partnerships that the USGS has with other
   organizations.
