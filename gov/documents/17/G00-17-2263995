                             PPPL's Arlene White
                        Receives Princeton University
                       Presidential Achievement Award

   Plainsboro, New Jersey -- In special recognition of her commitment to
   excellence, her exceptional dedication, and her outstanding service
   over many years, Princeton University recently presented Arlene White
   with the 1999 Presidential Achievement Award. White, a Senior Buyer and
   Small Business Liaison Officer at the U.S. Department of Energy's
   Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), is one of four recipients
   of the award. The honorees were cited during a ceremony at Princeton's
   Rockefeller College on January 27.

   PPPL Business Operations Head Ed Winkler said, "I have had the pleasure
   of watching Arlene White continuously develop professionally during the
   approximately eight years that I have worked with her. The keys to
   Arlene's success have been her intense desire to constantly improve her
   capabilities, her incredible enthusiasm and energy, and her uncanny
   ability to work with people in order to achieve her objectives. In
   short, Arlene inspires confidence regarding her ability to meet mission
   objectives and to get the job done. It is indeed a pleasure to work
   with her."

   The award, part of Princeton's Staff Recognition Program, was
   established in 1997 and is designed to recognize members of the support
   and administrative staff with ten or more years of service who, through
   their dedication and excellent work, have made a significant
   contribution to the success of their department and to the University.
   Four awards are made annually. Nominations are made by managers and
   their vice presidents or deans. Recipients receive a certificate, a
   cash award of $2,000, and have their names inscribed on a plaque
   displayed in the Office of Human Resources on main campus.

   In a nomination letter, PPPL Procurement Head Rodney Templon states,
   "In the years since Arlene took over the Small Business Program, PPPL
   has exceeded all expectations. For four successive years -- due to
   Arlene's tireless outreach and sourcing efforts -- the Laboratory has
   exceeded its goals by significant margins." White's leadership in the
   program since it was created in 1995 led the Lab to being recognized
   repeatedly during the last few years. In 1998, PPPL received the Award
   of Distinction from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). In
   1999, the Lab garnered the U.S. Department of Energy's Corporate Award
   for its outstanding small business program, as well as the SBA's Dwight
   D. Eisenhower Award for Excellence in Small Business Subcontracting.

   White has been employed at the Laboratory since 1977. She is a board
   member of the Mercer County Small Business Association, a non-profit
   organization dedicated to the promotion of opportunities for local
   small businesses, and serves as a mentor to others in best practices of
   the small business liaison. She also is a member of the Mercer County
   Chamber of Commerce and of the National Association for Female
   Executives. White is a resident of Lawrenceville.

   Upon receiving the citation from Princeton University, White said,
   "This award leaves me breathless when I think of what it means. It was
   such an honor to be nominated; especially since there are so many
   capable and worthwhile people to choose from at PPPL. I truly believe
   in the people here and in the Laboratory's mission."

   White is the only 1999 recipient from PPPL; the others are from other
   University departments. PPPL, which is funded by the U.S. Department of
   Energy and managed by Princeton University, is a collaborative national
   center for science and innovation leading to an attractive fusion
   energy source.
