[Up] Copyright, Restrictions, and Permissions Notice

     * Generally, materials produced by Federal agencies are in the public
       domain and may be reproduced without permission. However, not all
       materials appearing on this website are in the public domain. Some
       materials have been donated or obtained from individuals or
       organizations and may be subject to restrictions on use.
     * You may consult our reference staff for details on specific items.
       We are aware of donor restrictions applicable to our collections,
       but we can not confirm copyright status for any item. We recommend
       that you contact the United States Copyright Office at The Library
       of Congress to search currently copyrighted materials.
     * Please note that because we cannot guarantee the status of specific
       items, you use materials found in our holdings at your own risk.
     * Images on our web site which are in the public domain may be used
       without permission. If you use images from our web site, we ask
       that you credit us as the source. Please note that some images on
       our site have been obtained from other organizations. Permission to
       use these images should be obtained directly from those
       organizations.
     * Links may be made to our web site from other personal and
       organizational web pages. We request that you link to our site
       rather than downloading portions of it to another web server, so
       that our viewers will see our most up-to-date information.
     * Certain individuals depicted may claim rights in their likenesses
       and images. Use of photographs or other materials found on NARA's
       website may be subject to these claims. Anyone who intends to use
       these materials commercially should contact the individuals
       depicted or their representatives.
     * It is possible that our site will provide you an opportunity to go
       to a software manufacturer's web site so you may download a related
       plug-in that will enable your browser to show you a part of our web
       site. This prompt occurs because our system can tell whether your
       browser has the needed capabilities provided by these plug-ins. Our
       system does not read or place anything on your hard drive when
       recognizing your browser's capabilities. While the plug-in(s) are
       needed to view some content, you retain control and choice about
       conducting the download. At the time that we create and post the
       web pages that require these software plug-ins for viewing, they
       are provided by their manufacturer for download and use free of
       charge. We can not guarentee, however, that the plug-in will remain
       free, or that the manufacturer will not collect personally
       identifying information about you when you elect to download the
       software from their site. If you choose to visit the manufacturer's
       web site to obtain the plug-in, please carefully review their
       posted policies for details about personal privacy and use of
       downloaded plug-ins.

     Donor Imposed Restrictions upon Materials in our Holdings

     Please note that dissemination of some documents--including images,
     sound, cartographic, textual, or electronic materials--found in our
     holdings may be restricted by donor agreement. To purchase a copy of
     these materials, you must obtain permission from the donor. We have
     provided a Source and Permissions Contact List for some motion
     pictures, sound and video which may assist you. If you have
     questions about this process, please contact us.

     Copyright Restrictions upon Materials in our Holdings

     Some documents --including images, sound, cartographic, textual, or
     electronic materials--found in our holdings may be copyrighted.
     Please note that it is your responsibility to identify the copyright
     owner and to obtain permission before making use of this material in
     any way. We have provided a Source and Permissions Contact List for
     some motion pictures, sound and video which may assist you. If you
     have questions about this process, please contact us.

     The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States
     Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of
     copyrighted material. This law provides that under certain
     conditions libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a
     photocopy or other reproduction of materials. One of these specific
     conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used
     for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research."
     If you use a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of
     "fair use," you may be liable for copyright infringement.

     Please note: The National Archives and Records Administration
     reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its
     judgement, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of
     copyright law.

[Up] Information Surety

     We recommend that you acquire information describing the services
     and products of the National Archives and Records Administration
     (NARA) directly from NARA's official web sites, because other,
     non-NARA sources may not be able to maintain accurate information
     pertaining to our programs.

     We work hard to ensure the information provided to you is accurate
     and complete. However, it is possible that information may change
     prior to updating. We welcome your suggestions on how to improve our
     home page and correct errors.

     Please use the information on this web site based on your evaluation
     and analysis of any risks. It is your responsibility to ensure that
     the information you use (including software, images, audio files,
     artwork, and documents) are free of any violations of intellectual
     property rights. For further discussion on this topic, please read
     our "copyright, restrictions, and permissions" notice.

     Some of the documents on the server may contain live references (or
     "pointers") to information created and maintained by other
     organizations. NARA does not control and cannot guarantee the
     relevance, timeliness, or accuracy of the outside materials.

     Please note that electronic editions of Federal Register
     publications are posted on the GPO Access web site. NARA's GPO
     Access web pages are jointly administered by NARA and the Government
     Printing Office. Federal Register online publications are generally
     considered to be documents of record under Federal Register
     regulations and statements posted on NARA's web site and GPO Access.
     NARA's Office of the Federal Register controls the content of
     Federal Register publications on GPO Access and stands behind the
     accuracy and authenticity of the material. Therefore, we provide
     direct links from NARA's web site to Federal Register web pages on
     GPO Access.

     Because we do not know how you are using information found on our
     web site, we do not make any express or implied warranties about the
     information contained in this web site for your particular use.
     Except as to segments of this web site specifically identified as
     authoritative guidance, we disclaim these warranties to the full
     extent provided by state and Federal law, including, but not limited
     to the warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular
     purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights. All indirect,
     consequential, implied, punitive and special damages are deemed
     waived if you use the information on this web site in any manner.

     The vast majority of information presented through web sites
     administered by the National Archives and Records Administration
     (NARA), are not documents of record. Please note that authenticity
     of information can be confirmed only by examining the "record"
     version. If you have questions about the authenticity of a document,
     please contact the owner of the page that concerns you, or you may
     contact us.
       _______________________________________________________________

[Up] Virus Protection

     We use virus protection software on our computer systems and
     regularly update the software. This is a computer security measure
     that, in addition to maintaining our computer systems, also ensures
     that all files that we develop and/or post on our web servers are
     virus-free. When you request a file for download from our site, it
     is possible, though unlikely, that the data may contract a virus and
     become corrupted before it reaches your computer. The National
     Archives and Records Administration is not responsible for files
     that may become corrupted as the data travels the Internet.
