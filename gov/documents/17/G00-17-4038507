                        Idaho Natural Resource Trends

   This new report on the health of Idaho's private land is based on a
   National Resource Inventory conducted by NRCS.  Conversion of farmland
   and other open space to development and urban uses is rising rapidly.
   Other data in the report includes how rural land is used, erosion by
   water and wind, and prime farmland.




                  Tips for Stretching Short Water Supplies

   Water shortages in Idaho this spring and summer mean many farmers,
   ranchers and homeowners will need to take extras steps to make the best
   use of available water.  Tips for stretching short water supplies cover
   crops and soils, irrigation water, pasture and range, wildlife, home
   and gardens.
