   Airline Alerts, U.S.

   Aloha & Hawaiian Airlines Can Share Operations
   Hawaiian Airlines (HA), which announced plans in Dec-01 to merge with
   inter-island competitor Aloha (AQ), says the two airlines are
   considering taking advantage of a provision in the aviation security
   law that would allow them to legally "share operations" without
   completing a merger. USA Today reports the little-noticed provision was
   added by Senator Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, more than two months before
   the two airlines announced their proposed merger. The law allows
   carriers with flights that originate and terminate in the same state to
   create a "temporary partnership" that would achieve some of the
   benefits of a merger, but would NOT be subject to anti-trust
   examination by the Justice Department. Instead the Secretary of
   Transportation would have to approve the partnership, which could then
   run until Oct-2003 with the DOTs approval. Major airlines are watching
   the deal closely because most have partnerships with one or the other
   to provide interisland transportation for passengers the majors bring
   to-and-from the 50th state.
   Union Turned Down at AirTran
   AirTran (FL) announced that a group of its employees voted against
   representation by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Ballots
   for the election were mailed to all 1,731 customer service, ramp and
   reservations agents. The National Mediation Board informed the airline
   that the Teamsters received 33% of the total votes. >AirTran never
   requires a roundtrip purchase or Saturday night stay, and offers an
   affordable upgrade to Business Class.
   Judge Turns Down Mechanics Request for Release to Strike
   United (UA). US District Judge James Robertson refused to block
   President Bushs order preventing United mechanics from going on strike.
   At the same time, however, he agreed to a union request for a hearing
   on whether the White House should have stepped into the dispute. The
   complaint by the IAMAW centers on the National Mediation Boards
   recommendation that Bush intervene in negotiations. Federal mediators
   suggested Bush create a Presidential Emergency Board to help break a
   two-year stalemate over salaries. >No strike is imminent at this time.
   America West Announces Ticketing Changes
   America West (HP) announced that is is changing some of its ticketing
   policies. Now, customers purchasing electronic tickets will have
   several additional payment options and customers who elect to have
   paper tickets when the itinerary qualifies for electronic ticketing,
   will be charged a $10 fee. Effective 16-Jan-2002, customers are able to
   purchase e-tickets with cash, check, credit card, America West
   transportation vouchers and gift certificates, and Senior Saver Pack
   tickets. The airline says the $10 paper ticket fee is necessary to
   offset costs including additional ticket stock, manual collection, and
   processing and postage. >America West, the nations 8th largest carrier,
   serves 88 destinations in the USA, Canada and Mexico.
   Sun Country Fights Creditors Who Want Liquidation
   Sun Country (SY) is fighting a forced liquidation under Chapter 7.
   Three creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition 08-Jan-2002
   seeking to liquidate the struggling carrier which essentially grounded
   itself in Dec-2001. A spokeswoman said the airline would seek to move
   the case to federal court in Minnesota and have it converted into
   voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding.
   Security Fee Begins on February 1st
   Nationwide. To help pay for increased baggage and passenger screening,
   air travelers will begin paying a security fee of up to $10 per trip in
   February reports the US Department of Transportation. The fee applies
   to tickets sold on or after 01-Feb-2002 and is $2.50 per flight
   boarded, with a $5 maximum for one-way travel or $10 for a round trip.
   The charges which were established by a law passed in Nov-01, apply to
   domestic flights, and overseas flights which originate at US airports.
   Frequent fliers traveling on earned free tickets will also have to pay
   the fee.
   Midwest Express Fined for Slow Refunds
   Midwest Express (YX) has been fined $25,000 by the DOT for failing to
   make "prompt credit card refunds." The DOT said a review of the
   airlines handling of refund requests indicated the carrier was not
   fully complying with the Consumer Credit Protection Act "regarding the
   timely processing of credit card refund requests." Midwest has revised
   its procedures including investing in additional technology and
   staffing to process passenger refunds. In a consent order, the DOT said
   Midwest Express agreed to the assessment of the $25,000 penalty, half
   of which will be forgiven if the carrier avoided similar problems for
   one year.
   America West Gets Loan Approval
   American West (HP) has received approval for $380 million in federal
   loan guarantees from the federal government, subject to two conditions:
   (1) the government will get 1/3 ownership in the company; and (2) labor
   costs must be held in check. Said CEO Doug Parker, "With the approval
   of the loan guarantees, competition is preserved and the viability of
   America West is assured well into the future. As the nations largest
   low-cost, hub-and-spoke airline, America West provides important price
   discipline to larger, higher-cost airlines throughout the United
   States." So far only America West and regional carrier Vanguard have
   applied for the loan guarantee program, but Fridays decision could pave
   the way for other airlines to apply.
