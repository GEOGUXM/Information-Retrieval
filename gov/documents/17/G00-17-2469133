     The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) operates two facilities -
     one in Washington, D.C., and one in Fort Worth, TX. At the present
     time, tours are only offered at our Washington, D.C. facility.

     The BEP's public tour and Visitor's Center Gift Shop will reopen on
     February 4, 2002.

     You'll see millions of dollars being printed during a tour of the BEP.
     The tour features the various steps of currency production, beginning
     with large, blank sheets of paper, and ending with wallet-ready bills!

     As the U.S. Government's security printer, the BEP is responsible for
     the design, engraving and printing of all U.S. paper currency. A world
     leader in printing technology, the Bureau also produces postage stamps,
     White House invitations, Treasury obligations and other U.S.
     securities.

     Currency production methods have changed drastically since the BEP was
     established in 1862. At that time, just six people separated and sealed
     notes by hand in the basement of the Treasury building. The Bureau
     moved to its present site in 1914. The Fort Worth, Texas facility was
     created to meet increased currency production demands - it opened its
     doors in 1991.

     Though new printing, production and examining technologies have brought
     us into the 21st Century, the Bureau's engravers continue to use the
     same traditional tools that have been used for over 125 years - the
     graver, the burnisher, and the hand-held glass.
