       If you live in Orange County, you may request a United States flag
   that has been flown over the United States Capitol.

       The Capitol is currently experiencing a severe backlog on flag
   orders. Orders are expected to take a minimum of SIX MONTHS to be
   filled.

       In the meantime, Rep. Cox is compiling a backlog list of orders.
   As soon as flags become available, his office will contact you to
   confirm your order.  Flags will cost approximately $13, plus an extra
   $4.05 to have the flag flown over the Capitol.

       If you would like to add your name to the backlog list, please fax
   or mail the form below.  Do not send payment until someone from Rep.
   Cox's office contacts you.  When flags become available, you will
   receive a call to confirm your order and to collect payment.

       We apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you in advance for your
   patience!

       Please use this form to place a backlog order for your flag.

   Note: If you live outside Orange County, please contact your
   Representative at http://www.house.gov to order your flag.
