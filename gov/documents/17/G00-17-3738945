   Athena is a three year collaboration between Science Applications
   International Corporation (SAIC), the Office of Superintendent of
   Public Instruction (OSPI) in the state of Washington, and the local
   school districts of Seattle, Bellevue, Northshore, and Lake Washington.
   NASA funds Athena as part of its Public Use Of Remote Sensing Data
   project.

   The Athena Cooperative Agreement began on 7 September 1994. Athena is
   developing curricular and resource material using geophysical and other
   data sets acquired via Internet and preparing this curricular and
   resource material to form part of the presently developing science,
   math, and technology curricula. New material is added as it is
   developed.

   Currently the material is used by teachers in the participating school
   districts and elsewhere. It is available to anyone.
