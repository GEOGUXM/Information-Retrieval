Joint Projects between USINSC and RINSC

   Historically, the United States and the Russian Federation both have
   had significant research programs on many of the topics that are vital
   to the safety of nuclear reactors. Unique capabilities and strengths
   have been developed in each country over the years. The leaders of the
   two countries have recognized that we can build on this combination of
   strengths by engaging in collaborative research. This approach applies
   the best talents to the problems that must be addressed and maximizes
   the benefits that can be derived from the available resources.
   To facilitate this, International Nuclear Safety Centers have a mission
   to develop and coordinate collaborative nuclear safety research
   programs. Currently, the Centers are managing joint research projects
   on topics that have significant impact on the safety of
   Russian-designed nuclear power plants. Some aspects of these projects
   are being conducted in Russian laboratories and some aspects are being
   conducted in United States laboratories. Five projects were initiated
   in January 1997, and four projects were initiated in the middle of
   1997.

World Nuclear Power Reactor and Plant Data

   Basic information on the world's nuclear facilities has been collected
   for use by INSC scientific researchers and project participants. This
   includes plant locations with maps, reactor types and models, net
   output, operational status, critical dates, plant operation history,
   listings of available documents, country summaries, brief design
   descriptions, and more for nearly 600 nuclear power reactors in 35
   countries. In addition, data on 590 research reactors in 74 countries,
   and on 560 fuel cycle facilities in 44 countries is available. Research
   reactor information includes general facility data, technical
   specifications, experimental facilities, reactor fuel, utilization, and
   facililty modifications. Fuel cycle facility information includes
   facility type, operational status, mode of operation, capacity, owner,
   and operator.

Reactor Material Properties Compilation and Assessment

   Material properties that are to be included in the database are
   intended to meet the needs of analysts using computer codes and
   performing experiments for safety evaluation of the world's commercial
   nuclear reactors. The focus is on the materials used in light water
   reactors (LWRs) with initial emphasis on high-priority properties of
   materials unique to Soviet nuclear reactor designs and reactors in
   eastern-Europe and developing countries. An initial list of properties
   for each material and the phases to be considered were determined based
   on a needs assessment. The longer-term goal is to include data that
   will meet future needs such as materials used in evolutionary reactor
   designs, properties of extended burnup fuel, and possibly properties of
   mixed oxide fuels.

INSC Safety and Risk Assessment Library

   A collection of documents related to safety of Soviet-designed nuclear
   power plants is available in the International Nuclear Safety Center
   (INSC) library. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the
   originating organizations. An automated search capability on selected
   subjects in document titles in the INSC library has been developed.

Audio-Visual Materials and Capabilities

   Access to audio-visual materials from the INSC library is provided.
   Currently available materials are limited to background information on
   the Russian INSC>

Uranium Dioxide Properties Review Board

   The purpose of the peer review is to have an independent examination of
   the assessments made to verify assumptions, results, and conclusions
   and to check that the relevant data and literature have been included
   in the critical assessment. Peer reviews will be made by international
   experts as part of the IAEA-coordinated research program to establish
   an internationally available, peer-reviewed database of thermophysical
   properties of reactor materials that is scheduled to begin in 1998. The
   INSC Database Clipboard will facilitate communication by participants
   in the peer review by serving as an electronic forum in which reviewers
   post comments by e-mail and retrieve comments from other reviewers via
   the World Wide Web. The peer review may lead to reassessments or minor
   changes which will again be peer reviewed. This process will continue
   until agreement is reached. The final peer-reviewed recommendations
   will be included in the INSC Database and in a technical document as
   part of the IAEA-coordinated research program.

VVER Redbook Review and Publication Plan

   The original report entitled Overall Plant Design Descriptions, VVER,
   Water-Cooled, Water-Moderated Energy Reactor, also known as the VVER
   Redbook was written with U.S.D.O.E. Office of Nuclear Energy support in
   1985, and revised in 1987. In 1996, a second revision of the VVER
   Redbook was performed by the Russian Academy of Sciences- Nuclear
   Safety Institute. The result of that revision is available to INSC
   program participants as a source of information and for review and
   comment.

IBRAE Reactor Safety Database Project

   As expressed in a joint statement signed by the Minister of the Russian
   Federation for Atomic Energy and U.S. Secretary of Energy in Washington
   in January 1996, the U.S. and Russian partners agreed to develop a
   reactor safety database consisting of plant-specific information and
   reactor safety evaluation. The project was conducted in coordination
   with other related activities to optimize the benefit to improving
   nuclear safety in both countries.

Probabilistic Safety Assessment of Dukovany NPP Report Publication

   The full text of the first volume (13 chapters, 6 appendicies) of the
   the report documenting the Level 1 Probabilistic Safety Assessment
   (PSA) for Dukovany Unit 1 is provided for use by INSC program
   participants.
