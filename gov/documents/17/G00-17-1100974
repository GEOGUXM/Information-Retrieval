   In 1966, motor vehicle crashes nationally claimed the lives of 50,894
   people. Recognizing the need to reduce the carnage on the nation's
   roadways, Congress passed the National Highway Safety Act (NHWSA). As a
   result of that act, federal traffic safety funds are now made available
   to states that meet specific guidelines.

   At the federal level, program authority rests with the U.S. Department
   of Transportation (DOT). Responsibility for administering the program
   is shared by two DOT agencies - the National Highway Traffic Safety
   Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

   1n 1967 the California Traffic Safety Program (TSP) was enacted by the
   Legislature to provide authority for California to carry out the
   direction of NHWSA. Therefore, the Governor gave the responsibility of
   TSP to the Secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency
   (BTHA). The Secretary of BTHA in turn created the Office of Traffic
   Safety (OTS) with the administration of the TSP resting with the
   director of the OTS.

   Each year the Highway Safety Plan (HSP) is developed to reflect current
   needs and details the planned use of federal funds. The HSP identifies
   problems, specific goals and objectives, proposed solutions, time
   frames and fiscal information on existing and planned new grants that
   are designed to mitigate traffic safety problems. OTS's role in this
   cycle has proven invaluable as it provides a vital link between Federal
   and State functions.

   There are nine priority areas that have been identified by NHTSA for
   grant funding. These grants, administered by OTS, include: Alcohol and
   Other Drugs, Occupant Protection, Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety,
   Traffic Records, Emergency Medical Services, Roadway Safety, Police
   Traffic Services, Motorcycle Safety and Speed Control.

   As traffic safety impacts every aspect of life in California, from
   congestion to air quality to family safety to individuals' finances and
   quality of life. To ensure a healthy and productive quality of life for
   all Californians and to support OTS's mandate to reduce injuries,
   fatalities and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes,
   the Davis Administration has identified three traffic safety priority
   areas on which to focus: Congestion Relief, Driver Behavior and Child
   Safety.
