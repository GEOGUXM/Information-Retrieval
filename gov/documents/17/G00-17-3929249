   Brain Imaging and Modeling

   The past few decades have witnessed extraordinary progress in the
   development of techniques for noninvasive structural and functional
   imaging of the human brain.  However, despite this progress, no
   existing medical imaging modality provides all of the information
   required for best clinical practice or cutting edge basic research.
   MRI is the premier technique for characterizing the soft tissue anatomy
   of the human brain, but has significant limitations for defining the
   geometry of the skull.  Functional MRI, and PET  provided detailed
   pictures of spatial patterns of neural activation based on associated
   hemodynamic changes, but cannot capture the temporal dynamics of
   electrophysiological activation on its characteristic timescale.  MEG
   and EEG provide excellent temporal resolution of neural population
   dynamics but are limited in spatial resolution by the ambiguity and
   ill-posed nature of the current reconstruction problem.  Electrical and
   magnetic stimulation offer the possibility of direct intervention in
   central or peripheral neural pathways, but depend on knowledge of
   anatomical and functional organization drawn from other sources.  Other
   methods, including optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, SPECT
   and nuclear medicine, histology, endoscopy, neurosurgical intervention,
   etc., each provide important and unique insight into neural function
   and functional organization.  Although the mix and relative importance
   of imaging technologies will continue to evolve, the need to integrate
   information from multiple methods will remain.

   The goal of research supported by the Human Brain Project is to develop
   composite techniques for noninvasive, functional brain imaging that
   provide spatial and temporal resolution superior to any available
   imaging technique.  We are developing experimental, theoretical and
   computational procedures to combine anatomical MRI, functional MRI, and
   MEG into an integrated structural/functional imaging technique that
   exploits the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of each modality
   alone.

   The second major effort addresses the development and application of
   Advanced Optical Methods  for tissue measurements on the macroscopic
   and microscopic scale.  For macroscopic measurements the principal
   challenge is the highly scattering nature of biological tissue.  Tissue
   is relatively translucent, particularly in the near IR, and these
   wavelengths provide useful spectral data, e.g. allowing measurement of
   the quantity and oxygenation state of hemoglobin.  However, a photon in
   the near IR may scatter >10 times per cm , so that light travels
   through tissue by a process that resembles diffusion.  To address the
   uncertainty in path and pathlength we are developing time-resolved
   imaging methods that allow measurement of the time of flight of photons
   launched into the medium.  The first approach  employs high-speed gated
   intensifiers (gate time ~200 ps) coupled to cooled CCDs.  A second
   strategy currently being explored will employ time-resolved photon
   counting technologies developed at Los Alamos.  This class of methods
   coupled with sophisticated modeling techniques shows promise for
   noninvasive quantitative characterization and tomographic
   reconstruction of the optical properties of highly scattering media
   such as brain tissue.

   A second project is developing a hybrid hardware/software technology
   for confocal and spectral imaging via microscope or endoscope.  A
   prototype imager has been employed for in situ imaging of fast
   intrinsic signals associated with excitation in the brainstem of an
   experimental animal, and shows promise for characterizing patterns of
   cellular activity in extended neural networks.  These technologies are
   presently being developed with support from the DOE Technology Transfer
   Initiative
