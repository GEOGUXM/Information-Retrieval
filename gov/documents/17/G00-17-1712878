      In Geometry and Algebra: The Future Flight Equation, students will
      learn how NASA engineers develop experimental aircraft. They will learn
      about the Hyper-X Research Vehicle, an experimental plane that uses
      scramjet engine technology to propel itself to ten times the speed of
      sound. Students will understand how the Hyper-X is part of the Future
      Flight Equation. They will observe NASA engineers using geometry and
      algebra when they measure and design models to be tested in wind
      tunnels. By conducting hands-on and web activities, students will make
      connections between NASA research and the mathematics, science, and
      technology they learn in their classrooms.
