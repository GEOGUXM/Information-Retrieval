   When you ask for WEATHER, do you want: What it will be? What it is
   right now? Or what it was last week/month?
   Here are definitions to help you choose where to find what you want.
   FORECAST = What the weather is expected to be in the future. The short
   range forecast covers a 1-2 day period. The extended forecast covers a
   3-5 day period.
   OBSERVATIONS = Current weather conditions (temperature, precipitation,
   dew point, relative humidity, and wind) reported from a specific
   location - usually updated hourly.
   CLIMATE = 1, 6, and 24 hour precipitation maps and tables, as well as
   latest 24 hour highs and lows .
   HISTORICAL DATA = Archive of past maximum, minimum, and 24 hour
   precipitation for selected stations (from May 1997 to present). Data is
   arranged in a daily format. Also station climate summaries, based on
   data from past years.

   What is GMT, Zulu (Z), and UTC time?

   GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time and UTC stands for Universal
   Coordinated Time. All three refer to same time, which is a standard
   used around the world by the military and other agencies. It can also
   be thought of as the time at the Prime Meridian, or zero degrees
   longitude. Greenwich is a borough of London that the Prime Meridian
   runs through. Hence the name Greenwich time.
   In short, to convert this time to PDT, subtract 7 hours. To convert to
   PST, subtract 8 hours. Here's a few examples:
   Convert 2030Z to PDT:
   2030 - 7 hours = 1330 (1:30 pm PDT)
   Convert 0000 GMT October 8, 2001 to PST:
   Note: 0000 GMT is equivalent to 2400 GMT
   2400 - 8 hours = 1600 (4:00 pm PST October 7 , 2001)
   Remember: This would be midnight in England, so that's why it's October
   8 in GMT and October 7 in PST.
   Convert 0830 UTC to PDT:
   0830 - 7 hours = 0130 (1:30 am PDT)

   How do you read those numbers at the bottom of the experimental images?
   The numbers at the bottom of the experimental images contain
   information about the time and date the image was taken, what kind of
   image it is, etc. For a graphic illustration of what they mean and how
   to interpret them, Click here.

   What is meant by NWS Modernization?
   The National Weather Service has been undergoing a enormous
   transformation the last 10 years or so. Though many of the changes will
   be transparent to the users (i.e. the general public), they are,
   nonetheless, critical to improving the services we provide and to carry
   out our mission. Please click here to see all that is going on with the
   NWS Modernization.

   What are NOWcasts?

   A NOWCAST is issued only during significant weather. Generally, the
   NOWCAST will discuss current thunderstorms, showers, fronts, fog, and
   wind. If these phenomena become more of a threat to life or property,
   appropriate watches, warnings, or advisories will be issued. The
   NOWCAST is intended to replace the Special Weather Statement during
   weather events. Special Weather Statements will still be issued for
   weather events that are more than 6 hours away.

   How to read the pressure gradient tables

   First of all, what is a pressure gradient? The term "gradient" implies
   a difference. Therefore, simply put, "pressure gradient" means
   "pressure difference." Meteorologists use pressure gradients in many
   ways, but primarily for determining wind speed and direction. Without
   going into too much detail or technicalities, in the upper atmosphere,
   air generally flows clockwise around areas of high pressure and
   counter-clockwise around areas of low pressure. However, at the
   surface, due to friction and other smaller scale effects, air flows
   more from high pressure to low pressure.

   In Southern California, pressure gradients are critical in forecasting
   the weather. When reading weather related documents, you will often see
   Meteorologists refer to "onshore" and "offshore" flow. Onshore flow
   refers to air flow from the water onto the shore. In other words, west
   to east. A majority of the time, the pressure gradients in Southern
   California are onshore. Why is this? Well, that would take a little
   while to explain in detail. However, to put it simply, climatologically
   speaking, there is an area of high pressure in the eastern Pacific and
   low pressure in the desert southwest. The low pressure in the desert
   intensifies during the day because when the air heats up, it rises,
   causing the air pressure at the surface to lower. This increases the
   pressure gradient. When the gradient increases, so does the wind. This
   is why we so often get afternoon sea-breezes at the coast and why it
   seems to increase as the day goes along. The mountains provide a very
   effective block, keeping the cooler marine air to the west. However,
   the breezes due filter through some of the passes, which is why the
   Antelope Valley gets breezy in the afternoons.

   "Offshore" flow occurs when the pressure is higher over the land than
   over the ocean, often resulting in north-east winds over Southern
   California. This is also referred to as the Santa Ana effect, or the
   Santa Ana winds. The terrain here often enhances the offshore breezes
   because as the winds are forced through the narrow canyons, they
   increase in speed. This is referred to as the Bernoulli effect. This is
   why during Santa Ana's, some places will have winds exceeding 50 mph
   and others will have almost nothing.

   Having said that, what do the three columns in the table represent? The
   first column is the actual difference in the pressure between the two
   listed stations, in millibars (mb). So, for example, a 3.2 mb. gradient
   means that the surface pressure at LAX (Los Angeles International
   Airport), is 3.2 mb. higher than at (DAG) Barstow-Daggett airport. If
   the value was -3.2 (negative 3.2 mb.), that would mean the pressure at
   DAG is 3.2 mb. higher than at LAX.

   The second column and third columns are a little more complicated, but
   equally as important. The second column is the difference between the
   gradient today and the gradient yesterday, at the same time. This is
   also referred to as the 24 hour change. So for example, if the number
   in the first column today at 16z is 3.2, and the number yesterday at
   16z was 2.4, then the value in the second column today would be 0.8. To
   put it another way, if the gradient at 16z today was 3.2, and the
   second column showed a 0.8, then that would mean that the gradient
   yesterday at 16z was 2.4. Meteorologists use the second column to
   determine trends; that is, whether the gradient is becoming more
   onshore or offshore. Using the above example, the 0.8 would indicate
   that the gradient is becoming slightly more onshore (an onshore trend).
   A negative value would imply an offshore trend. Keep in mind, though,
   that an offshore trend doesn't necessarily imply offshore flow. It can
   simply imply a weaker onshore flow.

   The third column is even more complicated. To put it as simply as
   possible, it is the difference in the difference. In mathematical
   terms, it is an acceleration, or the second derivative. More
   definitively, it is the difference between the 24 hour change now and
   the 24 hour change 3 hours ago. So, for example, if the 24 hour change
   at 16z was 1.4 and at 13z is was 2.4, the third column value would be
   -1.0. What does this tell us? It tells us whether the change is
   increasing or decreasing. If, for example, we have offshore flow, and
   the third column is negative, this would tell us that the offshore flow
   is intensifying (becoming more negative).

   You will notice that there are two links to gradient tables: one for
   Los Angeles and one for San Diego. The Los Angeles gradient table
   contains gradient values that are relevant to the Los Angeles/Oxnard
   forecast area. The similar is true for San Diego.

   to the San Diego gradient table.

   What does the "date last modified" refer to on each of the pages?

   This refers to the date of which a link was added or removed from the
   page, or some other style change has been made to the page. It has
   nothing to do with the date or time of the latest weather update. It is
   assumed that since this is a weather page, the information within it
   must always be the latest. What would be the point of a weather page
   with old forecasts and observations?

   The purpose of having this date is to keep users aware of link updates
   and additions. If previously a link was unavailable, a recent update
   may mean the link has been changed. It also tells users that there is
   possibly something new on the page that may be of interest to them.

   What do each of the columns represent in the marine observations
   listing

   Here is an example:

     46054 2518 / 3224 / 15-17 / 57 / 54 / 1018.3 W. SANTA BARBARA CHNL

     46054 - Station ID number

     2518 - Observation time, day/hour (UTC) (in this case, Feb. 25 at
   1800Z)

     3224 - Wind direction and speed (here, from 320 degrees at 24 kts.)

     15-17 - Swell height and period (here, 15 ft at 17 second intervals).
   If there is a third number, that will be the direction from which the
   swells are travelling (26 would represent 260 degrees).

     57 - Sea surface temperature in degrees F.

     54 - Air temperature in degrees F.

     1018.3 - Air pressure in millibars.

     W. SANTA BARBARA CHNL - Name of buoy or site of observation.
