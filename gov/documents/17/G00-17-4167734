   ...discover the historical research resources of the Office of Cultural
   Education.   The history of New York State is the story of its people,
   places, and things -- the story of why, where, and how they came to be
   a part of this Empire State.   Some of this history has been gathered,
   analyzed, and reported by researchers and historians in books and other
   publications that the New York State Library makes available. Other
   elements of this history, such as original documents and important
   objects, artifacts, and specimens, are housed in the New York State
   Archives and the New York State Museum.
