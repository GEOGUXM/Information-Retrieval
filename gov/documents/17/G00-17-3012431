                           Gifts Between Employees

   Even gifts within the office are governed by law. It is good to be
   aware that there are some limitations on gift giving within the office
   to avoid potential problems. For example, ALL employees are prohibited
   from engaging in the activities noted below.

   Prohibitions:
     * Giving or SOLICITING contributions for a gift to another federal
       employee.
     * Giving a DONATION for a gift to an official superior, even
       voluntarily, is also prohibited.
     * And finally, it is prohibited for you to ACCEPT a gift from any
       employee who is receiving less pay than yourself.

   The reason for these prohibitions is to eliminate any actions which
   could influence, or appear to influence, a supervisor or official
   superior's impartial conduct of his/her job -- especially in the areas
   of promotion, performance appraisal or other personnel actions which
   could affect a subordinate's paycheck in any way.

   Exceptions:
   However, there are occasions totally unrelated to the office and based
   on personal friendships which grow over the course of years which are
   excluded from the prohibitions outlined by this statute. Gifts are
   allowed in 5 basic areas:

     * On items with an aggregate market value of $10 or less
     * For food and refreshment shared within the office
     * As personal hospitality gestures of gifts provided at a residence
     * Gifts to a Hostess
     * Leave transferred under an approved leave sharing program

     There are also special infrequent occasions, such as:
     * Gifts given on an infrequent occasion such as a marriage, illness
       or birth of a child, or
     * Upon an occasion which terminates the subordinate-official superior
       relationship, such as retirement, resignation or transfer.

     * Finally, it is acceptable to solicit voluntary contributions toward
       a gift only on those special infrequent occasions mentioned above
       and on an occasional basis, for items of food and refreshment to be
       shared within the office.

   your ICD's Ethics Coordinator.
