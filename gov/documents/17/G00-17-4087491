   Information, products, and services of The National Atlas of the United
   States of America^速 delivered on the World Wide Web are provided by the
   National Mapping Division (NMD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
   Contributions to this Web Site come from National Atlas partners in
   government and industry. The following statements and disclaimers apply
   to all Web sites managed by the NMD.

  Privacy

    How we handle the information we gather when you visit our Web site -

   Web server activity logs
   As part of the normal operation of our Web server, certain information
   is automatically and continuously collected and stored in "access" and
   "referrer" log files. The information collected includes:
     * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (e.g.,
       "aol.com" if you are connecting from an America Online account, or
       "howard.edu" if you are connecting from Howard University's
       domain);
     * the type of Web browser you use to view our site;
     * the type of transaction you engage in (i.e., database query, data
       download, page or image retrieval);
     * the date and time you access our site; and
     * the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly
       to our site.

   These data are periodically summarized and analyzed in order to study
   site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve
   the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.

   Electronic mail
   When you send us personally-identifying information via E-mail (i.e.,
   in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form
   that E-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your
   requests. We may forward your E-mail to other Government employees or
   contract personnel who are better able to answer your questions. We do
   not retain or distribute lists of E-mail addresses to any parties
   outside of the USGS except as necessary to conduct official U.S.
   Government business. In any event, we do not distribute lists of E-mail
   addresses to non-Government entities, or for commercial purposes.

   Online surveys
   When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of
   our online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and
   qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We
   may forward the information collected to other Government employees or
   contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no
   obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not
   inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided the
   information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time.

   Marketing information
   We may collect information from you, with your permission, that will
   allow us to provide customer services, such as promotional materials
   and product availability notices. We may forward the information
   collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to
   provide specific marketing services. We will remove such information at
   your request.

   Collection and release of gathered information
   We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying
   information about you when you visit our Web sites, unless you choose
   to provide such information to us. Except for officially authorized law
   enforcement investigations, or in the event of a suspected attempt to
   deliberately circumvent our system's security with the intent to gain
   unauthorized access or to do physical damage (e.g., an attack by
   hackers), we do not attempt to identify individual users or share any
   information we receive with any parties outside of the USGS. In the
   latter case, collected information associated with a suspected intruder
   might be shared through the USGS's Bureau Information Resources
   Security Administrator with an incident response service such as the
   CERT^速 Coordination Center.

   Retention of collected information
   Web server activity logs - Monthly extracts of the log files are
   archived and stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be
   retained online or offline at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time.

   E-mail - Information collected via E-mail will be retained at our
   discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary to
   complete our response. The E-mail may be retained in an archival form
   as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the retention of
   historical records of government agencies. For more information, refer
   to the National Archives and Records Administration's Records
   Management Program.

   Online surveys - Information collected via online surveys may be
   maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.

   Marketing information - Such information may be maintained at our
   discretion for an indefinite period of time.
