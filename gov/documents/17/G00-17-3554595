   Welcome to the NASA Glenn Research Center's High Performance Computing
   and Communications Program web site. The HPCC Program is developing
   technologies that will enable the U.S. to use powerful computers and
   high speed networks to solve problems of national interest.
   NASA Glenn participates in three projects under HPCC that contribute to
   this goal:

   CAS LTP NREN

                      Computational Aerospace Sciences

   The CAS Project is reducing the time and cost to develop new propulsion
   systems for aircraft and space transportation vehicles.

                            Learning Technologies
                                   Project

   LTP is using computers and networks to enhance the teaching of math,
   science and engineering in the K-12 classroom.

                              NASA Research and
                              Education Network

   The NREN Project is developing reliable, high-speed networks to rapidly
   transmit large quantities of scientific and engineering data.
