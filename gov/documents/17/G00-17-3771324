                                   CARI-6

   The CARI-6 computer program, developed at the FAA's Civil Aerospace
   Medical Institute, calculates the effective dose of galactic cosmic
   radiation received by an individual (based on an anthropomorphic
   phantom) on an aircraft flying a great circle route (or a reasonable
   approximation) between any two airports in the world. The program takes
   into account changes in altitude and geographic location during the
   course of a flight, as derived from the flight profile entered by the
   user.

   Deviations from a great circle route of up to 200 miles have very
   little effect on the flight dose. Based on the date of the flight,
   appropriate databases are used to account for effects of changes in the
   earth's magnetic field and
   solar activity (heliocentric potentials) on galactic radiation levels
   in the atmosphere. The program also calculates the effective dose rate
   from galactic radiation, at any location in the atmosphere at altitudes
   up 87,298 feet. The program requires MS-DOS and can be run on most
   personal computers. Of interest to epidemiologists, CARI-6 calculates
   effective doses and dose rates back to January 1958.

   LUIN99 and LUIN2000 contain the theoretical transport code used to
   generate the databases referenced by CARI-6. These two LUINs are
   computationally identical (same radiation doses, particle fluxes,
   etc.). LUIN2000 is more user-friendly as a stand-alone program. Neither
   code calculates flight doses, only dose rates at individual locations.
   The transport code has been extensively tested against measurements.

               INFORMATION ABOUT THE LATEST VERSION OF CARI-6

   The current version of CARI-6 is dated November 7, 2001 (see upper
   left-hand corner of MAIN MENU in the program). We made minor changes in
   the help file and fixed some messages and events regarding the F1 key.
   None of the changes affect the radiation dose or dose rate
   calculations.

                              CARI-6M SOFTWARE

   CARI-6M allows for much more freedom and accuracy when defining the
   flight path than does CARI-6. CARI-6M calculates the effective dose of
   galactic cosmic radiation received by an individual (based on an
   anthropomorphic phantom) on an aircraft flying a user-specified route.
   The main differences between CARI-6 and CARI-6M are:

   (a) CARI-6 assumes a single great circle route between origin and
   destination airports. With CARI-6M, the user enters a route plan
   consisting of geographic coordinates and altitudes (waypoints) and the
   program assumes a great circle route between each successive pair of
   waypoints.

   (b) After the first en route altitude, CARI-6 combines time climbing or
   descending to a new en route altitude with time spent at that new
   altitude. CARI-6M calculates the radiation dose received during any
   change in altitude.

   HELIOCENTRIC POTENTIAL

   The heliocentric potential enables the program to adjust for changes in
   galactic radiation levels that occur with changes in solar activity.
   The program employs the user-entered flight date to select the
   appropriate heliocentric potential from its database. The program will
   prompt the user in entering heliocentric potentials for dates not
   already in the database. There may be a lag of up to one month in
   availability of heliocentric potential data on our Web site. To
   estimate flight doses during the current month, use the most recent
   heliocentric potential available. Do not use a heliocentric potential
   more than two months removed from the month of interest. Flight doses
   for specific flight profiles normally change very little in a couple of
   months. To compare CARI-6 or CARI-6M dose estimates with instrument
   measurements, we recommend using heliocentric potentials appropriate
   for the days or hours of the measurements. We will provide these
   heliocentric potentials on request.
   Heliocentric Potentials for Recent Dates
       For flights in December 2000 (12/2000) use heliocentric potential
       1021 megavolts.
       For flights in the Year 2000 (00/2000) use heliocentric potential
       1004 megavolts.

       megavolts.
       For flights in April 2001 (04/2001) use heliocentric potential 1022
       megavolts.
