[pp_icon.gif] Groundwater Level Contour Data Retrieval
     __________________________________________________________________

   This page provides access to groundwater level data for all wells in a
   basin for a discrete time period. Queries are based on your input. The
   data returned can be used in various software packages to create
   groundwater level contour maps.

   First, enter a beginning and ending date range for the data retrieval
   you want. The dates should be entered in a MM/DD/(YY)YY format, for
   example 03/01/1996. Don't forget to make your begin date before your
   end date! Next, choose a coordinate system for your retrieval.
   Currently, we provide UTM coordinates and decimal latitude-longitude.
   We're working on the data set to add State Plane coordinates. Then,
   choose one basin from the list. Finally, press the "Get Contour Data"
   button at the bottom of the page.

   NOTE! In some of our basins, we monitor several hundred wells each
   year, with records starting as early as the 1910s. This retrieval form
   is optimized to return data sets for discrete periods of time, for
   example a spring or fall measurement period 3 to 6 months long. If you
   limit your begin and end date parameters to this length of time, most
   retrievals will be returned to you within 20 seconds. Longer retrieval
   periods will, of course, take longer to process. If you would like
   complete data retrievals for wells in a basin, use our historical data
   query form.
