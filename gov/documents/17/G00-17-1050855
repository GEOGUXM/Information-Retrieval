  Welcome to The Past Performance Database System!

Overview

     The purpose of the NASA Past Performance Database (PPDB) is to
     collect, authenticate, and store contract evaluations for use by
     NASA in evaluating contractor performance for Source Selection
     purposes. This site is designed to guide NASA Contracting Officers
     and participating contractors through the process of submitting and
     responding to evaluations electronically.

     This system uses electronic forms to exchange data between NASA and
     contractors, and electronic signatures to identify participants.
     Users will need to install software for Entrust and Informed Filler
     in order to use this system. An outline of the process (workflow)
     and step by step instructions are provided to guide through the
     process of setting up and using Entrust and Informed Filler, and to
     submit or respond to evaluations.
