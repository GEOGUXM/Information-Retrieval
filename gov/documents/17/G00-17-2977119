                      Building the framework of success
   _______________________________________________________________________

                          Why the CMA Was Created?
    Passed by California voters in 1990, Proposition 111 added nine cents
     per gallon to the state fuel tax to fund local, regional and state
    transportation projects and services. It also required urban counties
         to designate a congestion management agency, whose primary
    responsibility is to coordinate transportation planning, funding and
            other activities in a congestion management program.
    The Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (CMA) was created in
     1991 by a joint-powers agreement between Alameda County and all its
     cities. The CMA's goals, duties and composition make it easier for
   local governments to tackle the increasingly complex problem of traffic
                                 congestion.
                CMA Goals Lead to Transportation Improvements
     The CMA is Alameda County's transportation information and funding
      conduit. By properly channeling information, expertise and scarce
    transportation dollars, the CMA makes sure that tax dollars are spent
    wisely to improve transportation countywide. The CMA's goals include:
          * strengthening local jurisdictions ability to compete for
                              transportation funds,
        * giving Alameda County a stronger voice in state and regional
                            transportation decisions,
      * coordinating planning and development that crosses jurisdictional
                                   lines, and
        * generating and supporting legislation to coordinate local and
                 regional policies on transportation investment.

                     Representation from Broad Spectrum
   The CMA Board includes representatives from Alameda County, its cities,
   AC Transit and BART. Technical expertise is provided by the staff-level
    Alameda County Technical Advisory Committee with representatives from
      each of these organizations, plus Livermore-Amador Valley Transit
          Authority (LAVTA), Union City Transit, the Alameda County
      Transportation Authority (ACTA), the Metropolitan Transportation
    Commission (MTC), Caltrans, the Port of Oakland and the Bay Area Air
                    Quality Management District (BAAQMD).
                      CMA Builds Framework for Success
   The CMA helps local governments meet the requirements of federal, state
    and local transportation laws by providing technical assistance. The
        CMA also coordinates with county and regional transportation
    organizations. Over the past six years, the CMA has built a framework
    to plan and obtain funding for Alameda County transportation services
                                and projects.
                Planning for TomorrowÌs Transportation Needs
      The CMA develops and periodically updates the Alameda Countywide
    Transportation Plan. This long-range policy document includes future
    population and employment patterns. It guides transportation funding
     and service decisions over the next 20 years, addressing freeways,
    buses, rail, ferries and other options like telecommuting, bicycling
                         and pedestrian facilities.
    Transportation projects competing for state or federal funds must be
   consistent with this plan, as well as with the long-range plan of MTC,
                the Bay Area transportation planning agency.
      The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a short-range document
   mandated by Proposition 111. It ensures that gas-tax funds produce the
   greatest benefit by coordinating planning, funding and other activities
                   that affect the transportation system.
   Updated every two years, the CMP deals with day-to-day problems caused
    by congestion. This means setting level-of-service standards for our
    roadways, analyzing the impact of land development on transportation,
   exploring ways to manage travel demand and developing a 7-year capital
                            improvement program.
    The CMP provides the short-term response to congestion, yet reflects
    the goals and policies of the long-range plan. Projects competing for
                  state funds must be included in the CMP.
                    Helping Corridors Flow More Smoothly
       The CMA conducts studies to assess traffic problems and explore
   solutions along specific corridors. For example, the San Pablo Corridor
   Study, completed in April 1997, was a joint project with the cities of
    Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley and Albany and AC Transit, Caltrans and
   MTC. The end product was a coordinated program of desired improvements
                           in this busy corridor.
    Other studies include the Interstate 880 Corridor Study and a traffic
   operations study for I-680, the latter a collaborative effort with the
     CMAs in Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties under the lead of the
                                Alameda CMA.
                   Alameda County's Transportation Broker
   The CMA decides which transportation projects are the best investments
                             for Alameda County.
    In the most recent 7-year funding period, the CMA secured a total of
   $500 million Û about $70 million annually - in state and federal funds.
   This annual amount is roughly equal to the yearly revenue of the local
        sales-tax program Û referred to as the Measure B program and
                            administered by ACTA.
    Part of the CMA's job is to make the most of local, state and federal
    dollars by leveraging funds against one another. For example, the CMA
       secured approximately $95 million in state and federal dollars
    -including a $78 million advance of state money - to support Measure
                             BÌs I-880 project.
      The CMA also made sure that ACTA's projects were included in the
   stateÌs allocation plans, allowing the projects to proceed on schedule.
    Both the state and federal governments provide discretionary funding
   for capital projects. The CMA, in cooperation with MTC, determines how
      it should be used in Alameda County. Since 1991, these funds have
    included $50 million for local street projects, as well as funds for
    rehabilitating BART vehicles and building the Port of Oakland's Joint
   Intermodal Terminal, carpool lanes on I-880 and I-80, and the BART Warm
                             Springs Extension.
   The CMA decides which Alameda County projects should be considered for
     the state transportation funding program. In 1998, as much as $100
   million may be available for new transportation projects in the county.
      The CMA also distributes 40 percent of the money raised from a $4
          air-quality surcharge on vehicle registration fees. This
   "Transportation Fund for Clean Air" generates $1.6 million annually for
      Alameda County transportation projects that improve air quality.
                           Making Projects Happen
    At the request of local jurisdictions, the CMA has taken the lead on
      projects traversing more than one municipality, including signal
   interconnect projects on Hesperian Boulevard and San Pablo Avenue. The
   CMA was able to get state construction grants totaling approximately $4
                         million for these projects.
     The CMA also is preparing engineering studies to determine how the
     I-238 connector between I-580 and I-880 should be improved. Federal
   funds for this study were obtained through a partnership with ACTA. The
      CMA also obtained a state grant to build interim improvements on
                              eastbound I-238.
    The CMA, the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission and the Santa Clara
     Valley Transportation Authority have joined forces for a three-year
   demonstration commuter rail service. The service will run from Stockton
   through Tracy, the Livermore Valley and Fremont to Santa Clara County,
   providing relief to commuters in the heavily congested I-680 corridor.
                         An Advocate and a Catalyst
   Another charge of the CMA is leading advocacy efforts for the countyÌs
    transportation projects. For example, the state Legislature has been
     considering a bill that would eliminate the State Local Partnership
    Program used by ACTA for Measure B projects and by local government.
   The CMA successfully lobbied for a special provision that would provide
                         funds to offset this loss.
       Locally, the CMA cosponsored, with the Alameda County Economic
   Development Alliance for Business and ACTA, a transportation task force
   representing the business community. The task force developed a program
     of potential transportation improvements, and now many members are
     helping to develop the expenditure plan for the next generation of
                                 Measure B.
