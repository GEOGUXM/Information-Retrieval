   The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) is offering
   Financial Education Program Workshops to meet the growing need CalSTRS
   members have for information on financial and retirement planning. The
   non-sales educational workshops prepare CalSTRS members, ten or more
   years from retirement, to make informed financial decisions with
   confidence.

   Each workshop addresses financial issues of particular importance to
   you as an educator. The topics covered are:

   [triangle.gif] CalSTRS benefits, including how the CalSTRS monthly
                  retirement allowance is calculated.
   [triangle.gif] Social Security provisions affecting CalSTRS members and
                  spouses.
   [triangle.gif] How to develop a personal financial plan to meet your
                  goals.

  Who Should Attend the Workshop

   The workshop provides the greatest benefit to CalSTRS members who are
   10 or more years from retirement. A spouse or guest is welcome to
   attend. If you are an educator in your early or mid-career years,
   workshop attendance is particularly meaningful as those years are the
   best for building the solid financial base required for a comfortable
   lifestyle now and during retirement.
