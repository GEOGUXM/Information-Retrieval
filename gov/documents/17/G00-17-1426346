   Employment Projections by Occupation
   The links below are in alphabetical order by county or county
   consortium. There are three components per area:
     * Occupations with Greatest Growth (publication Tables 4 & 5
       combined) ("Demand Occupations")
     * Occupations with Largest Openings/Declines (publication Tables 7 &
       8 combined)
     * Occupational Projections (publication Table 6).
       The complete projections table, Table 6, is available both as an
       HTML document that you can view online and as a Microsoft Excel
       document that can be downloaded.   These Excel files are all less
       than 200 Kb.

   For more information, please see the Occupational Projections -
   Introduction and Methods.

   Note that beginning in the 1997-2004 round of projections we are
   including the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Training Level by
   occupation. The Training Level is a measure of how much training or
   experience an occupation requires.

   Occupational Projections for the nation and individual states are
   available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

   The California Industry and Occupation Staffing Patterns, which are
   developed from these data, can provide a list of the occupations
   employed within a particular industry, or a list of the industries that
   employ a particular occupation.  Job seekers or training providers may
   use these lists to contact appropriate employers for job openings.
