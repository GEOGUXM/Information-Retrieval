   CDF Event Display Live.

   This display allows you to look at the real events comming from the CDF
   detector LIVE. You have a choice between different views of the
   detector and some physics displays. You can choose between them by
   clicking on the corresponding pictures or by selecting one at the
   bottom of the bar on the left side. Also, you are able to stop and
   resume LIVE operation by choosing that in the bar (LIVE is not the
   default). If you find an interesting event, please, do not claim the
   Nobel prize before us. Thank you.

   Please, choose from the following views:
