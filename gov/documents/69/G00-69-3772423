   Maryland's diverse landscape is an expression of her geology. The
   mountains, valleys, waterfalls, rivers, and dunes, islands and cliffs
   you see are produced by erosion. Bedrock, soil and sand are sculpted by
   water, ice and wind over thousands or millions of years to present us
   with breathtaking vistas throughout the state. Mountains, cliffs and
   highlands are formed of hard rocks where erosion removes softer
   surrounding rocks and sediments. Gorges, valley and caves are the
   result of water grinding or dissolving away softer types of bedrock and
   sediments.

   Here we present a virtual tour of some of Maryland's most notable
   landscapes and geologic features. The feature map shows the approximate
   location of these features. To view a feature, you can click on a
   number in the map or on a link to the right of the map.

   We will add to the gallery as time permits. Please let us know if you
   would like to see a specific location or feature added to the gallery.
   Do you have good pictures of Maryland geologic features, such as
   cliffs, overlooks, waterfalls, outcrops, valleys, caves or other
   interesting features? If you have some photos that you think we could
   use, please let us know. If you have pictures in digital format such as
   jpeg gif or bmp files, you can email them to Bob Conkwright
   (bconkwright@mgs.md.gov) along with a description of the site and
   statement that gives us permission to use the picture on our web site.
   The MGS web site gets more than 2 million visitors a year, so you
   picture could get a lot of exposure.
