     * Reforming Welfare: Implications for Rural America (1,226 kb)The
       Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
       dramatically altered the social safety net for poor Americans, and
       raised concerns over the 7.5 million people living in poverty in
       nonmetro areas. So far, welfare reform has reduced caseloads,
       increased employment, and lessened poverty. While the impact of
       welfare reform does not appear to differ greatly between rural and
       urban areas at the national level, many studies of individual State
       welfare programs report smaller welfare reform impacts on
       employment and earnings in rural areas than in urban areas. These
       smaller effects are due largely to the demographic characteristics
       of recipients and to the poorer job opportunities and lack of
       critical work supports in rural areas. For more information,
       contact Leslie Whitener.
     * Nonmetro Labor Markets in the Era of Welfare Reform (893kb)Despite
       the economic prosperity of the last decade, nonmetro job growth,
       earnings, and wage progression seem destined to remain a step
       behind labor market outcomes in metro areas, often hindering
       efforts under welfare reform to move recipients into successful
       employment. The challenge is sometimes more difficult than an
       overall assessment of nonmetro areas would suggest. First, the
       demographic subgroups most in need of public assistance tend to
       have less education and lower earnings, and to experience higher
       unemployment, than average. Second, welfare recipients tend to be
       concentrated in nonmetro areas marked by chronic economic distress,
       which both contributes to, and reinforces, the need for public
       assistance. For more information, contact Robert Gibbs.
     * Welfare Reforms and Employment of Single Mothers Are Rural Areas
       Keeping Pace? (92kb)Changes in social policies in the mid-1990s
       increased the penalties for not working and raised the rewards for
       working. These policies played a major role in stimulating
       employment among single mothers and the gains were approximately as
       high in nonmetro areas as in metro areas. For more information,
       contact Robert Lerman.
     * Poverty and Welfare Among Rural Female-Headed Families Before and
       After PRWORA (113kb)Rural poverty among female-headed families has
       declined since the new welfare bill was passed in 1996. Moreover,
       the income of femaleheaded families has increased, while income
       from earnings has more than offset declines in public assistance
       income. Rural single mothers nevertheless continue to experience
       higher rates of poverty than their urban counterparts, and a higher
       percentage are working but are still poor. For more informaiton,
       contact Daniel Lichter.
     * Is There A Rural Disadvantage in Reducing Welfare and Food Stamp
       Participation in Mississippi and South Carolina? (134kb)Rural
       areas in Mississippi and South Carolina have had more difficulty
       than urban areas in reducing both cash assistance and food stamp
       program participation. These rural disadvantages might be overcome
       by improvements in rural transit to link rural residents to urban
       jobs and by increased child care and job training in rural
       counties. For more informaiton, contact Mark Henry.
