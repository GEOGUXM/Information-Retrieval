   OVERVIEW

        The missions of the Intramural Research Program of NIAMS are to
        conduct innovative basic and translational research relevant to the
        health concerns of the Institute and to provide training for
        investigators interested in careers in these areas. The ultimate
        goals are to provide new insights into the normal function of
        joints, skin and muscle and diseases that affect them and to
        generate a cadre of well-trained investigators equipped to continue
        the progress to a complete understanding of these structures and
        disease conditions that affect them adversely. Intramural
        investigators pursue diverse projects in biomedical research ranging
        from fundamental analyses of protein structure and function
        involving crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy, and atomic force
        microscopy, through protein chemistry, cell biology, signal
        transduction, gene regulation, tissue development and
        differentiation, genetics and immunology to more directly applicable
        research on the genetics, etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of a
        variety of rheumatic, autoimmune, inflammatory, joint, skin and
        muscle diseases.

        The Intramural Research Program provides unique opportunities for
        creative scientists. Among these are the extensive intellectual
        resources available to intramural scientists that facilitate
        collaborations among experts who possess unique skills; the stable
        funding that permits investments in long-term and even risky
        projects; and the ability to carry out or interface with clinical
        research and, therefore to participate in the rapid translation of
        bench research to the clinic.

        From its inception, the NIAMS Intramural Research Program has
        attracted junior and even more senior scientists interested in
        research training. Most of them stay for only a few years, but their
        presence has a profound influence on the intellectual vigor of the
        research effort. The fresh perspectives and enthusiasm encourage
        novel approaches that stimulate and energize the research effort.
        The intramural research program of NIAMS actively seeks "trainees"
        at all levels not only to educate the next generation of researchers
        but also to benefit from the genuine excitement about science they
        bring to the program. Importantly, the Intramural Research Program
        of NIAMS is committed to developing an activity that reflects the
        rich diversity of the Nation's population.

        Following is an overview of the current research activities of the
        Intramural Research Program of NIAMS. For each research group, the
        opportunities for training are listed as well as information on the
        means to apply or to obtain further information. Readers are also
        encouraged to learn more about the extensive variety of training and
        education opportunities available within the NIH's intramural
        program by accessing the NIH Office of Education homepage.
