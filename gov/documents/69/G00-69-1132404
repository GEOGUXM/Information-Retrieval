   How do I save these images to my hard disk?

   With netscape, at least, if you click-and-hold with the mouse over the
   image, you get a pop-up menu with "Save Image As..." as an option. If
   your image appeared in a separate window, the program that opened it
   should have a save item in its menu. You may want to rename it since
   it's an automated output from a cgi-bin script.

   What image format are these images in?

   They're all JPEG images at 75% quality. Can I use these images in my
   CD-ROM / article / web page / t-shirt / video?

   Refer to the Image Usage Info page.

   How real are these images?

   The body positions should be accurate near the limits of our knowledge
   of them (i.e. pretty dang accurate). The appearance, well I'm using
   static texture maps which should be pretty good. Look at the samples
   page for accuracy tests and see for yourself! One item the simulator
   does not yet model is light time, i.e. the time it takes for the light
   from a distant object to reach the Earth is nonzero, and this can have
   potentially noticeable effects on the position of the bodies.

   It takes a long time for the images to download. What can I do to speed
   it up?

   Well, you can try the mirror site(s) - if one is listed on the top
   page. Or, you can try keeping to the suggested 320x240 image size until
   you're ready for your final image. Orbits tend to take a while to draw,
   especially if a lot of them are drawn - this tends to happen when
   orbits are requested but don't really add anything (like when you're
   looking at the whole solar system, and check "satellite orbits" -
   geez). Don't turn them on unless you're sure you need them. Be patient,
   there are a lot of other users.

   How do I set up the simulator to give me what I would really see for
   the naked eye or my binoculars / telescope?

   If you mean, "what would I see if I were really standing there looking
   at it," that's kind of complicated. The human eyes have a really wide
   field of view, but the world is projected onto your eyeballs, which is
   a spherical surface, and then processed by your brain as such. If you
   were to try to draw a wide field of view image with the simulator, it
   would look really distorted because it has to be projected onto a flat
   surface (your computer screen). It's kind of an apples and oranges
   thing.. what you see on the screen can't really be compared to what you
   would see through your eyes, only what you would see if, say, you took
   a picture. The average person's total field of view (including
   peripheral vision) is probably something like 170 degrees. Even at 120
   degrees (the maximum setting on the simulator) everything starts to
   look distorted on the flat images. It would also depend on how far you
   were standing from the screen, etc. I like to try 60-90 degrees, and
   pretend I'm looking out a car (or spacecraft) window - that's pretty
   close.

   For binoculars or a telescope, it really depends on how you've set it
   up or what model you have. You'll have to look in your instructions or
   figure it out, I'm afraid. Remember, the Moon is about one half of one
   degree in width - try looking at it and guess from there. (Be careful
   with a powerful telescope - it can be very bright and even painful
   sometimes.)

   How is the vantage point determined? Am I standing on the body I
   picked, or what?

   The simulator renders as if you were at the center of the your body of
   choice (an unrealistic case, I know, but it does simplify things). I've
   been thinking about adding a lat/lon feature to it which would allow
   you to pick a spot, but that'll be a week or two if it happens.

   I tried to get a picture during a solar eclipse / stellar occultation /
   planetary occultation I knew about, and it didn't look right. What
   gives?

   For eclipses / occultations, there are likely to be significant
   differences depending where on the Earth (or wherever) you are
   standing. The simulator renders images as if you were only at the
   center of the body (see previous question). Also, as mentioned earlier,
   light time is not included yet in the body positions, and this can have
   potentially noticeable effects for multibody or distant occultations.

   The image looks too bright / the colors are washed out. What gives?

   If the "extra brightness" box is checked, uncheck it. If it's not,
   that's weird - try adjusting your monitor (sorry - that's the best
   answer I have).

   The image looks too dark. What gives?

   If the "extra brightness" box is unchecked, check it. Each monitor is
   different, and many have differrent distributions of brightness to the
   naked eye (this is called "gamma").

   How does this simulator work?

   Try the technical details page.

   How do I make a movie from these images?

   I'm afraid the only way to do this at this point is by hand, since
   allowing people to make movies would choke my machine. If you're a web
   whiz, you can look at the form itself and figure out what arguments are
   called what, then generate requests with a script on your machine to
   automate this a little.

   Can I download this program (or source code, etc.) to use on my
   computer?

   Not yet, but maybe some day. Keep checking!

   Where can I get the texture maps you used for the planets / satellites?

   Try the technical details page, it's discussed there.

   How come I can't pick a year in B.C. or very far in the future?

   We really have very little way of knowing precisely where the planets
   and satellites were / will be back then / that far ahead. Each body
   acts on each other in small ways, and we can only predict their exact
   positions so far. The range in the form is about the longest range that
   we can be very accurate.

   I got a server error when I tried to run the simulator. What gives?

   Occasionally I see these in the log files, but don't know what caused
   them. I admit I probably haven't worked out all the bugs, and if this
   happens to you, LET ME KNOW what options you picked so I can correct
   the error!

   Why aren't all the JPL spacecraft on the body list?

   I don't have ephemeris files for all the JPL spacecraft; I'm trying to
   get all of them eventually. Request your favorite if you don't see it
   there and I'll give it higher priority.

   I thought that some of these bodies are irregularly shaped. What gives?

   Irregular body rendering is a capability the simulator can't do yet. I
   realize this creates inconsistencies with Phobos, Deimos, and some of
   the smaller satellites of Saturn. I'm working on it!

   How come I don't see shadows when the moon(s) pass in front of their
   planet?

   This body to body shadowing (except for Saturn's rings) is a feature
   the simulator doesn't have yet. I'm working on it!

   I thought we hadn't gone to Pluto yet. How come you have a map for it?

   Well, it's just a guess. I had to show something.

   I thought Venus' spin was opposite, making its north pole point down -
   your simulator shows it pointing up (like Earth's). What gives?

   It depends on who you ask. I figured that having the pole be down
   (which determines part of the viewing geometry - the "twist" axis,
   really) would confuse more people who weren't aware of this. The de
   facto standard, I think, is down.

   How come you don't have rings for the other planets besides Saturn like
   Jupiter?

   I haven't had time to assemble ring files for those planets; yes, it is
   an oversight which is on my list of things to fix in the future.
   However, the rings of Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are extremely dim and
   you probably wouldn't see much of anything if you were actually
   standing there, unless you were at just the right geometry and had
   really good eyesight. Actual images of those planets' ring systems that
   you've seen in the past were probably heavily exaggerated to show
   detail.

   I want to send you a bunch of money just for doing this. How do I reach
   you?

   Send it care of Dave Se-- no, really, I work for Caltech. Taking the
   time to get this site set up has been my pleasure. (But see the
   question on usage rights if you're using any of this for a commercial
   product, news broadcast, or non-educational video.)
