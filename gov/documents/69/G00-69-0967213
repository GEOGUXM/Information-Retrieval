       Shar Hendrick Welcome to the Government and Community Relations
       Department's home page. I appreciate your interest in the Marshall
       Center and the services our department offers.

       The Government and Community Relations Department serves as the
       principle liaison between the Marshall Center and government leaders at
       the local, state, and federal levels. In addition, we serve as the main
       interface with the public. Through services such as the Public
       Inquiries Office, the Speakers Bureau, the Freedom of Information Act,
       and community based outreach efforts, we strive to keep the public
       informed about Marshall's vital roles and missions within NASA.

       Take time to explore our web site and please call us if you need
       further information about the Marshall Space Flight Center.

       Shar Hendrick,
       Manager
