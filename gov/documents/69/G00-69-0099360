                          OSTP'S PRIVACY STATEMENT
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting the Office of Science and Technology Policy's
   Website and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear:
   We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our
   website unless you choose to provide that information to us.
   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically
   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
    3. The date and time you access our site;
    4. The pages you visit; and
    5. If you linked to the OSTP website from another website, the address
       of that website.

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.

   If You Send Us Personal Information
   If you choose to provide us with personal information -- by filling out
   a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through
   our website -- we use that information to respond to your message and
   to help us get you the information you have requested. We treat emails
   the same way we treat letters sent to the White House. We are required
   to maintain many documents under the Presidential Records Act  for
   historical purposes, but we do not collect personal information for any
   purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information you
   give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that
   agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create
   individual profiles with the information you provide or to give it to
   any private organizations. OSTP does not collect information for
   commercial marketing.

   Links to Other Sites
   Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we
   link to private organizations, with their permission.  Once you link to
   another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
