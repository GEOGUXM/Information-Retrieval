   Why did the City revise the Municipal Code on garage sales?
   Due to the concerns of their constituents, City Council requested staff
   to address the issue of continuous and unpermitted garage sales and
   develop recommendations to address the communitys concerns. On October
   15, 1998, staff from the departments of Financial Management, Police,
   and Planning and Building met with 21 representatives from various
   community groups in order to gain a citywide perspective on garage
   sales. The consensus from this group was that garage sales should not
   be prohibited; however, they identified numerous concerns:

     * A significant amount of noise is generated at garage sales.
     * The same individuals without permits are conducting numerous garage
       sales at the same location.
     * Individuals, who are actually in business, are paying residents to
       have garage sales at various locations to avoid having to obtain a
       commercial site and a business license.
     * New merchandise is being purchased for resale at garage sales.
     * Garage sales are being conducted on vacant lots.
     * Merchandise from garage sales is being displayed on the sidewalk
       and obstructing the public right-of-way.
     * Stolen merchandise is being sold at garage sales.
     * Signs advertising garage sales are being posted on street trees,
       utility poles, street signs and parkways in violation of the
       Municipal Code.
     * There is the potential for continuous garage sales at multi-unit
       residential locations with the current regulations allowing two
       garage sales per person per location per year.

   On May 4, 1999 following several long discussions by citizens and
   council members, City Council approved staff recommendations, and on
   July 22, 1999 Mayor ONeill approved the new garage sale ordinance
   adopted by the City Council on July 20, 1999. It becomes effective on
   August 21, 1999, and City staff is preparing to implement the new
   procedures for all garage sales starting Monday, August 23. (It would
   be too confusing to change procedures in the middle of the August
   20-21-22 weekend.
