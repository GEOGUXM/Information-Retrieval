    Leadership Library
   Black line
      Southern Region Headquarters has established a Leadership Library,
      which consists of audio tapes, video tapes, books, and workbooks. This
      Leadership Library is a part of Southern Region's BLAST program. Any
      Southern Region employee (not just BLAST selectees) can check out a
      book or tape from the library through his/her office supervisor. This
      library is formulated around the interest of Southern Region employees
      on improving their leadership skills.
      Some of the material has been rated by one or more reviewers. We ask
      that, upon return of any material you checkout, please provide a very
      brief review of the material. This will provide the next person with a
      better understanding of what he/she can expect from the lessons.
      The Southern Region Leadership Library consists of...


      Books    A-B C-E F-K L-M N-R S-Z
   Video Tapes A-E F-J K-Z
      Other    Audio Tapes Workbooks
