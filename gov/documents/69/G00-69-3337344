   Mission Statement
                    [clearpixel.gif]


   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]
     * The Mission of the Plant Science Group is to increase the

     * Yields
     * Quality
     * Desirability
     * Food Safety


     of agronomic and horticultural plants  grown on Salt and Pathogen
   affected soils.

     This MU is a component of the U.S. Salinity Laboratory and
   fulfillment  of its mission is dependent upon knowledge and resources
   developed in the other Groups.

     [clearpixel.gif]
       * The Plant Science Group continues to develop an integrative
         understanding of  salt and ion-specific tolerance in crop plants
         that will lead to improved  tolerances in crops.

       * Research on the effects of salts on physiology and  development,
         and the integration of physical and chemical factors  associated
         with the environment and management are being combined to  develop
         comprehensive approaches for dealing with the salinity problems in
         agriculture.

       * Research on the detection, survival, transport, and reduction of
         human pathogens from animal manure

                                             Goals and Priorities

   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]

    Research objectives over the next 5
    to  10  years are as follows:
     * Identification of the fundamental and primary cause of growth
       reduction  in plants due  to salinity stress.
     * Identification of the salt-induced developmental changes that occur
       in  plants.
     * Establishment of predictive concepts that integrate plant
       responses  with physical and  chemical factors of saline
       environments (soil-water-plant-air)
     * Delivery of information and predictive systems that will help the
       grower manage and  make management decisions for crop production in
       saline environments..


   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]
     * Determination of the genetic characters responsible for salt
       tolerance  and specific salt-induced responses in plants and
       development of screening  and selection methodologies for  the
       breeding of salt-tolerant varieties.

     * Detection, Survival, Transport, and Reduction of Human Pathogens
       from Animal manure
       Quantify mechanisms and processes affecting the transport and
       survival of pathogenic microorganisms

     * Technical transfer of Salt Tolerance  and Boron Tolerance
       Information for Crops and Ornamentals , including an Interactive
       Bibliography Database.
