   [photo5.gif] Throughout his public career, John McCain has been a
   leader in the most critical issues facing our country. He has waged a
   determined and often solitary campaign against pork barrel spending,
   fighting for ten years to pass a line item veto. He has been a
   persistent proponent of lower taxes, genuine deregulation and free
   trade. He has become one of Congress' most respected voices for a
   strong national defense, and for sound foreign policy and is considered
   one of the leading defenders of the rights of Native Americans.

   John McCain has been an outspoken advocate for the reform of government
   institutions, and he has fought to

   change a campaign finance system that favors the interests of a special
   few over the needs of the majority. Recently, millions of Americans
   rallied to John McCain's campaign for the presidency and to his cause
   of reforming the institutions of government and were inspired to fight
   for causes greater than their self interests.

   John McCain was first elected to represent the state of Arizona in the
   U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. As a longtime admirer of Ronald
   Reagan, McCain was an early foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution. He
   served two terms in the House before being elected to the Senate in
   1985. He was re-elected to a third Senate term in November 1998. In
   that election, he received nearly 70% of the vote, a total which
   included 65% of the women's vote, 55% of the Hispanic vote, and even
   40% of the Democrats.

   Senator McCain is Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce,
   Science and Transportation, and has in that capacity become a
   recognized leader on telecommunications and aviation issues, stressing
   the need to promote competition and government deregulation in the
   industries that are so important to the growth of our economy.

   Senator McCain has received numerous awards from taxpayer and foreign
   policy organizations for his distinguished public service and
   conservative leadership. In 1997, he was named one of the "25 Most
   Influential People in America" by Time magazine.

   The son and grandson of prominent Navy admirals, John McCain was born
   in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936. After graduating from the United
   States Naval Academy in 1958, McCain began a twenty-two year career as
   a naval aviator.
   In 1967, he was shot down over Vietnam and held as a prisoner-of-war in
   Hanoi for five and a half years (1967-1973), much of it in solitary
   confinement. He retired from the Navy as a Captain in 1981. McCain's
   naval honors include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit,
   Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross.

   John McCain tells what he learned about life and honor from his father
   and grandfather, both four-star admirals in the U.S. Navy, in his
   best-selling family memoir, "Faith of My Fathers." The book, detailing
   McCain's early life and military career, spent 24 weeks on the New York
   Times "Best Sellers" list.

   Senator McCain has seven children and four grandchildren. He and his
   wife, Cindy, reside in Phoenix.
