   SubsurfaceTopics is the quarterly newsletter for the Subsurface Science
      Initiative. Newsletter topics include program activities, updates on
    development of the planned Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory, features
       on specific research projects, hiring announcements, and updates on
   research collaborations and partnerships. Sign up to get on our mailing
                                                                     list.

   In this Issue:
   Stimulating Biogeochemical Reactions to Sequester Strontium - Among the
   major goals of the INEEL's SSI is finding ways to immobilize subsurface
   contaminants such as heavy metals and radionuclides. Researchers are
   testing a theory that native microbial communities could be used to
   sequester strontium-90.

   Dr. Gill Geesey--New SSI Biosciences Discipline Lead - After 23 years
   in academia, Dr. Gill Geesey has joined the INEEL's SSI as the new
   Discipline Lead for Biosciences. Geesey previously spent 13 years as a
   professor of marine microbiology at California State, and ten years as
   professor of microbiology at Montana State University.- more -

   LASIMS Research Yields Unexpected Results -Researchers from Montana
   State University and the INEEL are only one years into a three-year
   research project, and they already have some very interesting results.
   The team is the first to employ a laser with traditional secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (SIMS) for studying contaminant speciation on
   naturally occurring surfaces. The new technique is known as
   laser-assisted SIMS or LASIMS. - more -

   Investigating Fate and Mobility of Actinides, Fission Products and
   Other Contaminants - INEEL researchers are addressing the hypothesis
   that heavy metals, such as uranium, plutonium, cesium, strontium,
   americium, neptunium, and technicium may be more mobile than current
   thought. The team is working to better understand the influence that
   chemical speciation has on contaminant transport.  - more -

   Triangulating on the ESRP Aquifer - Researchers from Southern Methodist
   University, University of Idaho, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the
   INEEL are combining their research endeavors to improve our
   understanding of the regional geologic and hydrologic process at work
   in the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer.
     - more -

   Board Lauds Progress: Urges Intensified Science Planning - When the SSI
   Peer Review Board met in September 2001 to assess the SSI, they offered
   both praise and recommendations for future improvement. The Panel's
   recommendations emphasized scientific planning and development.  - more

   New SSI/INRA Liaison--Dr. Robert Smith
   On October 1, 2001, Dr. Robert Smith, previously the Science Director
   for the INEEL's Subsurface Science Initiative, began a new position as
   University of Idaho's Distinguished Professor of Subsurface Science. In
   his new role, Smith will be the primary liaison between the University
   of Idaho and the INEEL's SSI. - more -

   Initiatives Notes:
   The newest member of INRA is the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. INRA
   is a consortium of eight research universities dedicated to enhancing
   the quality of life in the Inland Northwest through collaborative
   educational and research enterprises. INRA was formed to facilitate the
   leveraging of new research and national partnerships between the member
   institutions and the private sector, federal agencies and federal
   laboratories.
