   The Mars Exploration Program's Science Theme

   The Mars Exploration Program is a science-driven program that seeks to
   understand whether Mars was, is, or can be, a habitable world. To find
   out, we need to understand how geologic, climatic, and other processes
   have worked to shape Mars and its environment over time, as well as how
   they interact today.

   Mars is similar to Earth in many ways, having many of the same
   "systems" that characterize our home world. Like Earth, Mars has an
   atmosphere, a hydrosphere, a cryosphere and a lithosphere. In other
   words, Mars has systems of air, water, ice, and geology that all
   interact to produce the Martian environment.

   What we don't know yet is whether Mars ever developed or maintained a
   biosphere--an environment in which life could thrive.

   Four Science Goals for Mars Exploration

   The key to understanding the past, present or future potential for life
   on Mars can be found in the four broad, overarching goals for Mars
   Exploration:

          Goal 1:    Determine if Life ever arose on Mars.

          Goal 2:    Characterize the Climate of Mars.

          Goal 3:    Characterize the Geology of Mars.

          Goal 4:    Prepare for Human Exploration of Mars.
