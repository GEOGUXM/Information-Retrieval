                                 Who We Are

    The California Coastal Commission was established by voter
    initiative in 1972 (Proposition 20) and made permanent by the
    Legislature in 1976 (the Coastal Act). The primary mission of the
    Commission, as the lead agency responsible for carrying out
    Californias federally approved coastal management program, is to
    plan for and regulate land and water uses in the coastal zone
    consistent with the policies of the Coastal Act.

    The Commission is one of California's two designated coastal
    management agencies for the purpose of administering the federal
    Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in California. The most
    significant provisions of the federal CZMA give state coastal
    management agencies regulatory control (federal consistency review
    authority) over all federal activities and federally licensed,
    permitted or assisted activities, wherever they may occur (i.e.,
    landward or seaward of the respective coastal zone boundaries fixed
    under state law) if the activity affects coastal resources. Examples
    of such federal activities include: outer continental shelf oil and
    gas leasing, exploration and development; designation of dredge
    material disposal sites in the ocean; military projects at coastal
    locations; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fill permits; certain U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service permits; national park projects; highway
    improvement projects assisted with federal funds; and commercial
    space launch projects on federal lands. Federal consistency is an
    extremely important coastal management tool because it is often the
    only review authority over federal activities affecting coastal
    resources given to any state agency. The San Francisco Bay
    Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) has this authority
    within San Francisco Bay while the Coastal Commission exercises this
    authority relative to the rest of California's coastal zone.

    Commission jurisdiction in the coastal zone (which is specifically
    mapped) is broad and applies to all private and public entities and
    covers virtually all manner of development activities, including any
    division of land, a change in the intensity of use of state waters
    and of public access to them. The Coastal Act includes specific
    policies (see Division 20 of the Public Resources Code) relating to
    public access and recreation, lower cost visitor accommodations,
    terrestrial and marine habitat protection, visual resources,
    landform alteration, agricultural lands, commercial fisheries,
    industrial uses, water quality, offshore oil and gas development,
    transportation, development design, power plants, ports,
    universities and public works. These policies constitute the
    statutory standards applied to planning and regulatory decisions
    pursuant to the Coastal Act.

    The Commission is an independent, quasi-judicial state agency
    situated for organizational purposes in the California State
    Resources Agency. Its membership is composed of twelve voting
    members, appointed equally (four each) by the Governor, the Senate
    Rules Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly. Half (six) of the
    voting commissioners are locally elected officials and half are
    representatives of the public at large. It also has four ex officio
    (non-voting) members representing the Resources Agency, the
    Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, the Trade and Commerce
    Agency and the State Lands Commission.

                            Commission Meetings

    The Commission holds public meetings for three to five days each
    month in different locations throughout the state where
    commissioners take public testimony and make permit, planning, and
    other policy decisions to implement the Coastal Act. Prior to each
    meeting, Commission staff collects and analyzes information
    pertinent to meeting agenda items and prepares written staff reports
    with recommendations for Commission action.

                            Public Participation

    The Commissions business requires active and frequent communications
    with the public, local governments, and state and federal agencies.
    The Commissions primary constituencies include coastal local
    governments; industrial ports; development interests needing coastal
    permits; national, statewide, regional and community-based
    environmental organizations; special districts; state agencies;
    federal agencies; universities; utilities and other energy
    companies; tourist industry; recreation organizations; sport and
    commercial fishing industries; and shipping interests.

                       Key Statutory Responsibilities

    Development within the coastal zone may not commence until a coastal
    development permit has been issued by either the Commission or a
    local government that has a Commission-certified local coastal
    program.

    The coastal zone (specifically mapped by the Legislature) covers an
    area larger than the State of Rhode Island and extends from three
    miles at sea inland to a boundary that varies in depth from several
    hundred feet in highly urbanized areas up to sixteen miles in rural
    areas having water bodies extending inland. In particularly
    important and generally undeveloped areas of southern California
    where there can be considerable impact on coastal resources from
    inland development, the coastal zone extends to a maximum of 5 miles
    inland from mean high tide line. The coastal zone established by the
    Coastal Act does not include San Francisco Bay. Development in the
    Bay and in a narrow strip of land surrounding the Bay is regulated
    by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission.

    California's coastal management program is carried out through a
    partnership between state and local governments. Implementation of
    Coastal Act policies is accomplished primarily through the
    preparation of local coastal programs (LCPs) that are required to be
    completed by each of the 15 counties and 58 cities located in whole
    or in part in the coastal zone. Completed LCPs must be submitted to
    the Commission for review and approval. An LCP includes a land use
    plan (LUP) which is the relevant portion of the local general plan,
    including any maps necessary to administer it, and the zoning
    ordinances, zoning district maps, and other legal instruments
    necessary to implement the land use plan. Coastal Act policies are
    the standards by which the Commission evaluates the adequacy of
    LCPs. Amendments to certified LUPs and LCPs only become effective
    after approval by the Commission. To ensure that coastal resources
    are effectively protected in light of changing circumstances, such
    as new information and changing development pressures and impacts,
    the Commission is required to review each certified LCP at least
    once every five years.

    After certification of an LCP, coastal development permit authority
    is delegated to the appropriate local government. The Commission
    retains original permit jurisdiction over certain specified lands
    (public trust lands such as tidelands) and has appellate authority
    over development approved by local government in specified
    geographic areas. Any new development in areas of the Commissions
    retained original jurisdiction can only be granted a coastal
    development permit by the Commission. An appealed local coastal
    permit decision is stayed until the Commission acts on the appeal.

    The Commission must review and act on all port master plans and any
    amendments to them. Port master plans are required for the
    industrial ports of Hueneme, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Diego.
    Commission approval is necessary to allow port expansions to meet
    future growth needs. A similar requirement applies to land areas of
    universities in the coastal zone (e.g., the University of California
    campuses at Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and San Diego; Pepperdine
    University; and San Diego State University). The Commission also has
    an oil spill prevention and response program as well as a newly
    increased statewide Coastal Act enforcement program.

    Under 1990 amendments to the federal Coastal Zone Management Act,
    the Commission and the State Water Resources Control Board have
    prepared and adopted and are now implementing a Coastal Nonpoint
    Source Water Pollution Control Program. The Commission also
    implements a Coastal Access Program, in partnership with other state
    agencies such as the Coastal Conservancy, State Lands Commission,
    Parks and Recreation and federal, regional and local park and
    recreation entities. The Commission carries out an extensive public
    education program that includes annual statewide coastal clean-up
    events, the "Adopt-A-Beach" program and the whale tail license plate
    program. It also maintains a Coastal Resource Information Center.
