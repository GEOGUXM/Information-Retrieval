   Natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes affect
   both coastal and inland areas. Long-term data from these events,
   including photographs, can be used to establish the past record of
   natural hazard event occurrences. These data are also important for
   planning, response, and mitigation of future events.

   The National Geophysical Data Center plays a major role in post-event
   data collection. We also assist in the detection, location, and
   evaluation of the extent of certain hazards using satellite data. The
   types of hazards detected using the Defense Meteorological Satellite
   include fires, floods, hurricanes, and cyclones. We invite you to
   browse our pages to learn more. If you use data or information from
