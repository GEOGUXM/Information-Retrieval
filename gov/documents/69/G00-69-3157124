   What is School-to-Career?

   The School-to-Work Opportunities Act provides states with federal
   assistance to develop and implement a statewide School-to-Work
   transition system (known as School-to-Career in California). The goal
   for this system is to ensure students a seamless transition from
   secondary education into meaningful, high quality employment and/or
   further education. Under this legislation, significant partnerships
   must be developed at the state, regional, and local levels to bring
   together educators, business/industry/labor and community-based
   organizations to integrate academic and vocational-technical education
   and to more closely align secondary and postsecondary curricula.
   For questions or information regarding School-to-Career, please contact
   Rick Mejia at 916.657.3492 or Linda Gaylor at 916.657.3612.
