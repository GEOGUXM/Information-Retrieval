   Privacy
     * Information Collected
       This Web site collects no personal information about you pursuant
       to your use unless you choose to provide this information to us.
       Certain site-access information is automatically captured and
       stored, including:
       The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the domain from which you
       access the Internet (i.e. 123.456.789.012) whether yours
       individually or provided as a proxy by your Internet Service
       Provider (ISP);
       The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
       The date and time you access our site;
       Pages accessed (recorded by the text and graphics files that
       compose that page); and
       Referring Web site (if you linked to this site from another Web
       site).
       Site-access information is aggregated and used to assess the value
       of the Web site in accomplishing its stated information
       dissemination goals, to plan for enhancements to make this site
       more useful to visitors, to optimize the site's technical design
       specifications, and/or to identify system performance or problem
       areas. This information is used only as a source
       of anonymous statistical data, and is shared only when required by
       law enforcement investigation. We do not track or record
       information about individuals and their visits.
     * Personal Information
       You may choose to provide us with personal information by filling
       out a form or sending an e-mail message containing specific
       comments and/or questions. This information is used to respond to
       your request or to forward your request to the appropriate party
       who can best answer your question. Except for authorized law
       enforcement investigations, these e-mails and addresses are shared
       only to the extent necessary to assure that an accurate and timely
       response is provided. This Web site does not collect information
       for commercial marketing
     * Use of Computer Cookies
       In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) direction,
       this Web site does not use persistent cookies (bits of information
       placed on a user's computer to track customer use and related
       patterns) on any of its Web-based products. Session cookies may be
       used to provide salient session-related information and to allow
       product-specific functions to be performed, but in no case will
       cookies be used to capture information that might compromise or
       threaten personal privacy.
       For products that require a customer profile to accomplish business
       transactions, such as automated notifications or directed
       distribution of recurring information within a predefined set, this
       site may retain voluntarily-submitted customer data; however,
       persistent cookies will not be used for such purpose
     * Security
       This Web site is part of a Federal computer system used to
       accomplish Federal functions. Computer software programs as well as
       other surveillance methods are used to monitor network traffic on
       this Web site for security purposes. By accessing this Web site,
       you are expressly consenting to these monitoring activities.
       Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features; to
       use the system for other than intended purposes; to deny service to
       authorized users; to access, obtain, alter, damage, or destroy
       information; or to otherwise to interfere with the system or its
       operation are strictly prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be
       disclosed to law enforcement authorities and may result in criminal
       prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the
       National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, as
       codified at Section 1030 of Title 18 of the United States Code, or
       other applicable criminal laws.
     * Accessibility
       Persons with Disabilities
       This Web site complies with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act,
       which requires that Federal agencies' electronic and information
       technology be made accessible to people with disabilities,
       including Federal employees as well as members of the public. The
       Bobby evaluation utility, developed by the Center for Applied
       Special Technology (CAST) as a means of evaluating Web sites in
       terms of accessibility, is used to ensure compliance. No
       accessibility warranty or guarantee is made for sites to which this
       Web site links; such compliance is beyond our scope or control.
       This site may contain PDF documents, which require special
       compliance adaptability tools. In those cases, efforts will be made
       to provide conversion utilities that will allow access to persons
       with disabilities; however, no guarantee can be made that all PDF
       documents will be accessible.
     * Disclaimers
       This system is made available by an agency of the United States
       Government. Neither the United States Government nor any agency
       thereof, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or
       implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the
       accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information,
       apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its
       use would not infringe privately owned rights. Reference herein to
       any specific commercial product, process, or service by trade name,
       trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not necessarily
       constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by
       the United States Government or any agency thereof. The views and
       opinions of originators expressed herein do not necessarily state
       or reflect those of the United States Government or any agency
       thereof.
       All Notices apply only to this specific Web site. In an effort to
       provide users a broad base of information and resources, links are
       maintained with Web sites and databases whose administration and
       operation are outside the purview of this site. In cases where this
       site serves as a host to information generated or maintained by
       others, we disclaim any liability for the accuracy of content,
       validity of systems, effectiveness of tools or technologies, or
       adherence to privacy, security, accessibility, or other
       policies. When you follow a link to another site, you are subject
       to the policies of the new site.
