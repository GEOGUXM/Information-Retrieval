   Copiers/Document Automation
   FedSource can assess your agency's copying patterns and design a
   service to fit your needs. When you work with us to develop a
   customized copier management solution, you will enjoy:

     Economies of Scale
     FedSource has nationwide contracts with a variety of vendors. This
     enables us to negotiate the best prices and pass the savings on to you.

     Management, Not Just Placement
     We assess your agency's needs and provide customized solutions.

     Convenience
     Because our relationships are already well established, you avoid the
     hassle and cost associated with generating new contracts. We deal
     directly with our copier vendors and send you just one invoice,
     regardless of how many machines, vendors or brands you use.

     Flexibility
     FedSource relies on a variety of vendors, giving you the opportunity to
     choose from a huge variety of brands, models, pricing schemes and
     technologies. You can select from per-copy pricing, LTOP, flat rate or
     purchase for any volume up to a million copies a month. In addition, we
     can assist you with color copying, digital technology and other
     networking capabilities.
