                       Lecture 1: Particles and Forces
                  Saturday Morning Physics, 5 January 2002
                                 Chris Quigg

                              Suggested Reading

     * Primo Levi, The Periodic Table, translated by Raymond Rosenthal
       (Schocken Books, New York, 1986). An industrial chemist before he
       became a great writer, Primo Levi knows the elements on personal
       terms.
     * George L. Trigg, Crucial Experiments in Modern Physics (Van
       Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1971). This slender (141-page) book
       contains clear, short descriptions of the evidence that shaped some
       of the central ideas in "modern" physics up to about 1930.
       If you can't find this one in a library, look for George L. Trigg,
       Landmark Experiments in Twentieth-Century Physics (Dover
       Publications, New York, 1995).
