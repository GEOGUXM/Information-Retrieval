   The Savings Bond Wizard helps you manage your savings bond inventory on
   your PC. It's a downloadable program that allows you to maintain an
   inventory of your bonds and determine the current redemption value,
   earned interest, and other information. You can also print your bond
   inventory, providing you with an important record if you ever need to
   replace any of your savings bonds.

   The Wizard is a WindowsÂ® application. If you don't have Windows, or if
   you prefer not to download & install a program, try our new online
   Savings Bond Calculator.
