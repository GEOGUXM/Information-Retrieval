   NASA Insignia    aeroCOMPASS Logo Certificate Authority

   The registration system and all portions of the aeroCOMPASS site that
   require a login make use of high encryption. You will need to upgrade
   your web browser if you don't currently have a version that supports
   high encryption. The specific encryption algorithm that is used by
   aeroCOMPASS is known as triple DES. You can download a browser that
   supports this level of encryption from the Netscape or Microsoft web
   sites. Other browser vendors may also support this level of encryption.
   Additionally, some browsers (most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer
   for Macintosh) are unable to import certificates "on the fly." To work
   around this problem, you can pre-load the necessary Certificate
   Authority into your browser. Simply click on the link below to begin
   the process. Once you have imported the Certificate Authority, you
   should be able to make use of the secure portions of the aeroCOMPASS
   site.
