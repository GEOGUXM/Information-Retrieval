            How to View and Download documents from the
            UnderGround-SPR Technology  on-line LIBRARY

   [urbbul1a.gif]

   Clicking on a specified Library link (e.g., "Technical Reports" or
   "SPR Members Only") will take you to the appropriate directory
   (folder) of documents located on our server.
   [urbbul1a.gif]

   Note:  All of the documents in the SPR Members Only directory are for
   limited distribution and are password protected. lock.wmf (8214 bytes)
     You must have
   an assigned "User Name" and "Password" for entry and usage. You will
   be
   prompted for your authorized "User Name" and "Password," as
   appropriate.
   [urbbul1a.gif]

   You can navigate through these directories (folders), e.g., go down a
   level
   to the subdirectories (sub-folders) of organized documents, exactly as
   if
   you are using Windows Explorer or File Manager.
   [urbbul1a.gif]

   For document file selection, you can view a bibliographic listing of
   all
   files contained in each document folder by clicking on and viewing the
   appropriate 1_biblio_***.html file. You can also use the Document
   Search
   button to help find specific documents by specifying appropriate key
   words.
   [urbbul1a.gif] Once you have accessed the desired directory or
   subdirectory of
   documents, you will find a list (bibliography) of documents with
   somewhat
   cryptic names, based on the title of the document. Sandia Technical
   Reports
   will be preceded by the  identifier, SAND**_####_, where ** represents
   the
   year of publication, followed by a unique 4-digit ID number.
   Memos will also have a cryptic title, based on their subject, and will
   be
   followed by _NameYYMMDD.  "Name" is the name of the principal author,
   followed by the date of release, year=YY, month=MM, and day=DD,  e.g.,
   980312 = March 12, 1998.
   [urbbul1a.gif] All documents will have the file extensions of ".pdf"
   (for Adobe portable
   document files), ".html" ( for hypertext documents), and possibly
   others such
   as ".xls" (for EXCEL files), or  ".ppt" (for Power Point
   presentations).
   [urbbul1a.gif] In almost all cases, there will be two entries for each
   document,
   1. PDFmid.gif (204 bytes)   "Document_xx.pdf "  =  full document

   2. html.gif (963 bytes)  "Document_xx.html  =  document abstract or
   summary
       (Note: The date indicated for each file is the date it was uploaded
   to the  server, not the date the original file was created.)
   [urbbul1a.gif] The readily viewable " html.gif (963 bytes) .html"
   files, usually 2-6 kb in size, are intended to
   provide an abstract or brief summary of the document and relevant
   bibliographic information. These files also contain all relevant "key
   words"
   useful for search purposes. For short, several page memos, it may
   contain
   most of the document.
   [urbbul1a.gif] Clicking on the  " html.gif (963 bytes) .html"   file
   will open it in your browser (Netscape, Internet
   Explorer) for immediate viewing. It is suggested that you view the
   relevant
   ".html" file information, to make sure it is the document you want,
   before
   downloading the much larger ".pdf " full document file.
   [urbbul1a.gif] Clicking on the " PDF4.gif (130 bytes) .pdf " document
   (or .xls, .ppt, etc) will start the process of
   downloading that file to your computer, where you can open it and view
   it in
   its entirety. If your computer is properly configured for Adobe Acrobat
   Reader,
   the downloaded .pdf file will open for viewing or printing individual
   pages.
         Click to download the free  getacro.gif (712 bytes)   if needed.
   [urbbul1a.gif]

   In the " PDF4.gif (130 bytes) .pdf " document, you can also copy
   selected text and/or figures
   using Adobe Acrobat Reader.
             (In version 3,  use the "TOOLS" menu,
               then "Select Text" or "Select Graphics")
             (In version 4, use the T icon,   then the "Text Select Tool"
               or the "Graphics Select Tool.")
   .
   (NOTE: If the "TOOLS" menu is not visible in your browser window i.e.,
   in Netscape
   Navigator or Internet Explorer, save the PDF document to your hard
   drive, then open
   it with Adobe Acrobat Reader.)
