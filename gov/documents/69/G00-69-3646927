     * January 15, 2002 -- The draft NIST Special Publication 800-34,
       "Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems" is
       available for public comment. The document provides instructions,
       recommendations, and considerations for government IT contingency
       planning. The information presented in this document addresses
       seven IT platform types and defines a seven-step contingency
       process that an agency may apply to develop and maintain a viable
       contingency planning program for their IT systems. The seven steps
       are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system
       development life cycle. Please provide any comments to Marianne
       Swanson at marianne.swanson@nist.gov by February 15, 2002.
