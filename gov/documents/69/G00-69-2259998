   GREAT AMERICAN CLEANUP
   Spring Cleaning in Washington, D.C.
   March 24 - May 26, 2001
   To all Washington, D.C. Residents:
   Please join your neighbors and other community leaders from across the
   District of Columbia as a member of the "Extreme Clean Team". The
   national and local launch of the 2001 Great American Cleanup is March
   24, with the cleanup effort continuing through May 26. The Great
   American Cleanup is the nation's largest organized litter prevention,
   beautification, and community improvement program. Last year in the
   District over 112 community cleanups were conducted representing over
   6,000 hours of volunteer work.
   We are particularly excited about being selected as one of the national
   launch sites for this year's "Extreme Clean Challenge" Great American
   Cleanup event. The Office of the Mayor and other District agencies are
   working in partnership with Keep Washington, DC Beautiful, Inc. (KWB)
   to make this a successful and fun event. Several activities are being
   planned during the eight-week blitz, including a public awareness
   campaign, neighborhood cleanups and special events such as a poster
   contest, bike ride and roller blade cleanup.
   You are invited to join us for the kick-off celebration and press
   conference on Saturday, March 24, 2001, at 9:30 AM, Jemal Gateway,
   located at North Capitol and P Streets, NE. Mayor Anthony Williams and
   Ray Epson, Executive Director of KAB are members of our city's "Extreme
   Clean Dream Team," along with the North Capitol Area Business
   Association. They along with several business and community
   organizations will be at this kick-off and are participating in cleanup
   efforts as a part of this citywide effort.
   In addition to joining us for the kick-off celebration, we are asking
   you as a community leader to organize a cleanup committee of citizens
   such as yourself who share your passion for this cause to design a
   cleanup project - adopt a park, street, alley or Metro stop. Perhaps
   members of your community would like to create a community garden or
   maintain the tree boxes in your neighborhood. Everyone can do their
   part to create healthier, safe and livable communities.
   The Department of Public Works' Helping Hands Program is available to
   assist in planning and scheduling your community cleanup event during
   this eight-week blitz. They may be reached at (202) 645-7190. To have
   your neighborhood cleanup event listed on the event calendar of the
   Clean City Initiative web site, visit the web site, click Event
   Calendar and follow the directions. The web site address is:
   www.cleancity.washingtondc.gov. The Office of the Clean City
   Coordinator is available to answer questions about the Great American
   Cleanup and Clean City neighborhood initiatives. Call (202) 671-1403 or
   email vincent.spaulding@dc.gov.
   Many thanks in advance for your continued support in making Washington,
   DC the crown jewel of the nation, a more beautiful city in which to
   live and work.
   Vincent Spaulding, Clean City Coordinator
