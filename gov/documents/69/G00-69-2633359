                       FEDERAL MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH
                              REVIEW COMMISSION

                                ABOUT FMSHRC

   The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is an independent
   adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate
   review of legal disputes arising under the Federal Mine Safety and
   Health Amendments Act of 1977 (Mine Act).

   Under the Mine Act, the Department of Labor issues regulations covering
   health and safety in the nation's mines. Federal mine inspectors
   employed by the Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
   (MSHA) enforce these regulations by issuing citations and orders to
   mine operators. The Commission is concerned solely with the
   adjudication of disputes under the Mine Act, including the
   determination of appropriate penalties. It does not regulate mining or
   enforce the Mine Act. The Commission was established as an independent
   agency to ensure its impartiality.

   Most cases deal with civil penalties assessed against mine operators
   and address whether the alleged safety and health violations occurred
   as well as the appropriateness of proposed penalties. Other types of
   cases include orders to close a mine, miners' charges of safety related
   discrimination and miners' requests for compensation after the mine is
   idled by a closure order.

   The Commission's administrative law judges (ALJs) decide cases at the
   trial level. The 5-member Commission provides appellate review.
   Commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the
   Senate. Review of an ALJ decision by the Commission is not guaranteed
   but requires the affirmative vote of two Commissioners. Most of the
   cases accepted for review are generated from petitions filed by parties
   adversely affected by an ALJ decision. However, cases can also be
   accepted based on the Commission's own direction for review. An ALJ
   decision that is not accepted for review becomes a final, non-
   precedential order of the Commission. Appeals from the Commission's
   decisions are to the U.S. courts of appeals.

   Procedures for appealing cases to the Commission are contained in its
   Rules of Procedure published in 29 CFR Part 2700. The Commission also
   publishes these rules in a separate pamphlet. A brochure, entitled "How
   a Case Proceeds Before the Commission" is also available.

   To order documents or inquire about the filing of an appeal or a
   pending case, please contact the Commission's Docket Office at (202)
   653-5629. If a case has been assigned to an ALJ, inquiries should be
   directed to that ALJ. The use of the case docket number will greatly
   facilitate the processing of any request.

   The Commission has three offices. The headquarters office is located in
   Washington, D.C. There are administrative law judge offices in Falls
   Church, Virginia and Denver, Colorado. Currently, the Commission has a
   budget of about $6 million and a staff of 54 employees.
