   Although medical research traditionally has been divided into basic and
   clinical studies, the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Center for
   Cancer Research (CCR) does not make this distinction. The Center
   believes that basic and clinical scientists are complementary to each
   other in pursuing new strategies against cancer and AIDS. As a
   reflection of this team-oriented approach to science, this section of
   our site is organized under the following broad headings:

   Faculties
   We are creating multi-disciplinary faculties to enhance our efforts in
   understanding, preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer and AIDS.

   Branch/Lab Index
   A comprehensive, searchable listing of CCR's research programs,
   branches, and laboratories with links to their home pages

   Investigators Index
   A searchable index of all CCR principal investigators with links to
   each investigator's web pages

   Industry & Technology
   NCI branches and offices that focus on technology transfer

   Scientific Resources
   Links to a wealth of scientific resources available to all NCI
   researchers
   Core Facilities
   Links to all NCI/CCR core facilities and services; both in Bethesda and
   at NCI-Frederick. Cores are unique programs and laboratories that offer
   new technologies and special expertise to assist investigators in their
   research.

   CCR Publications
   An overview of Center publications, including the CCR Annual Research
   Directory; our bimonthly scientific newsletter, CCR Frontiers in
   Science; CCR Press, brief articles highlighting outstanding, innovative
   research; and NCI press releases. There is also online access to the
   CCR monthly manuscript reports.

   Competitive Funding
   All the information an investigator needs to compete for Intramural
   Research Awards (IRAs), Collaborative Project Awards (CPAs), and
   Competitive Supplements (CS)
