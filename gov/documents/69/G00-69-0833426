                     CBO's Current Economic Projections
   _______________________________________________________________________

   CBO's forecasts for the major macroeconomic variables cover 18 to 24
   months. Further projections are extended out to 10 years. CBO does not
   attempt to forecast cyclical fluctuations in the economy more than two
   years ahead; its longer-term projections are based on trends in the
   labor force, productivity, and saving. In preparing its forecasts, CBO
   examines and analyzes recent economic developments and consults the
   major econometric models and commercial economic forecasting services.
   It also relies on the advice of a distinguished panel of advisers. For
   more information about CBO and its economic projections, please see
   About CBO.

   The economic projections presented below are from the CBO publication
   The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update, released on August 28,
   2001. This information will be updated on January 31, 2002, when CBO
   releases The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2003-2012.
