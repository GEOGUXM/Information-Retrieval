   Saluting NOAA from the Middle Keys of Florida...I work in the dive
   industry, between the sancuary mooring balls for divers at Sombrero
   Light and Coffins Patch, and the Long Key & Sombrero Key bouy reports,
   well, the info pays off. Lets keep the anchors off the reef..."They saw
   the works of the Lord, His wonderful deeds in the deep." Psalm 107:24

   My question is ....Why are there no data bouys located within close
   proximity to the Tampa Bay (Pinellas beaches)area. This location is a
   mecca for boaters and fishermen, and we all find it surprising that
   there is not a bouy offshore our area. There are several artificial
   reefs located offshore that could serve as great locations for such a
   bouy. Please let me know how we can facilitate the employment of a data
   bouy in our area..... Thanks, JK

   though, (down in the "3 day WL / MET" data pick), which plots little

   Dear NDBC: Thank you for providing your service. I am a NMFS research
   biologist in Juneau, AK and have been appreciative of of the data your
   provide from Buoy 46083 near the Fairweather Grounds. One of our
   sampling stations (IPB @ 58 12.71', 137 16.97') is adjacent to this
   buoy locality and we have collected data from it over the past five
   years. I was sorry to see this buoy had recently failed, and hope it
   can be reactivated before next spring. Blessings. Joe Orsi is Thank you

   Our group has experienced mixed feelings about the retrieval of good
   ol' 46059 ! Of course, we are relieved that she is back in good hands,
   in a safe harbor. But we kept tabs on her unwarrented sojourn with the
   joys and concerns that a parent feels when their child breaks free from
   the fetters of home life to experience the ebb and swells of life on
   the open ocean. We trust you all will spruce her up and have her back
   as a productive member of society soon.

   away with 180 mile long round trips on spec. to the west coast of

   direction, like you have on Pacific buoys. Guess what, I'm a surfer.

   From s/v RIKAVA we are heading across the Gulf in 6 days to Key West,
   FL., then on to the Bahamas. We use this site alot, along with other wx
   data to plan our crossings. Hope the funding will not get cut any more,
   as WE ALL need this info. ONE QUESTION: When can we expect the wind
   direction trend to change from N to S on the FL. East Coast so we can
   plan to cross the Gulf Stream to the Bahamas with more southerly winds.
   As you may know, any wind direction with a "N" in it in the Gulf Stream
   gives you huge steep seas. Our tenitive plans to cross is mid to late
   January '02. Any help will be greatly appreciated.......Thank You!

   i like the information you provide at the lighthouse at the mouth of
   the mississippi river. being that we go fishing there very often,it is
   helpful to see what the winds are doing with the speeds and direction.
   and the temperature is also a plus. i know that the structure is off
   the water,but its too bad the wave height is not given. hey keep up the
   information and the pictures are awsome really great. keep up the great
   work.

   the water info is wonderful to have available. I also want to thank
   everyone for watching their wake and even slowing down for me to give
   me a smaller wake to deal with. Thanks.

   Funny how everyone is happy with the site except for NJ-NY people.
   Maybe someone should offer some boating/seamanship classes there to
   help everyone figure out how to read the sea, like everyone else does,
   without requesting a buoy be placed in your front yard.

   In Portland,ME, instead of complaining about buoy info, and

   the LNB. It took the bitchin' right out of everything. Maybe other

   Your site is just the best for 'real' wave conditions it takes the
   opinion out of human interpretation. I can track storm swells precisely
   now and determine within an hour or so the time they will arrive at my
   local beach. Keep up the fantastic work. Some suggestions that would
   make the best even better 1. more buoys 2. Wave direction 3. If more
   buoys were available a wave height contour map could be accurately
   computed in real time? Similar to the air pressure charts we are all
   familiar with this would an excellent way to represent swells.

   TPLM2 - Thomas Point, MD On Sunday 10/07/01 at about 1500 we were
   sailing in this area. I sail a 38 FT. sail boat. We had up only a .90%
   jib...no main. We were over canvased for the wind, with several
   occassions of gunnel under water. The boat is heavy and designed for
   the Virgin Islands where the Trade Winds are strong. There were white
   caps with some blowing spray. I estimate winds from the NW (out of the
   South River) at in excess of 30 knots. Your records for Thomas Point
   show wind speeds of 10 Knots. The light house is somewhat sheltered by
   the land for winds from the NW. Most important to someone like me, who
   uses this site to determine sailing conditions, the wind recorded did
   not match what we saw on the Bay. I must say, however, that we really
   appreciate the site. I would rather have the site with some
   inaccuracies than to not have it at all.

   I routinely check Thomas Point Light for wind and sea surface
   temperature. In the fall, the site stops reporting sea surface
   temperature. This infromation is important to those of us who use the
   Bay waters for rowing, [which I do] kayaking or canoeing. Bay water
   tempertature guides us for safety measures, such as wearing automatic
   life vests, and other precautions, e.g. nearshore or open water. Why
   can't Thomas Point report sea surface temperatures year round, like
   they used to do?
