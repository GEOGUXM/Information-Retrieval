200l International Aviation
Training Symposium
by Bill Traylor, AMA-1

   Bill Traylor, AMA-1 When we began the planning and preparation for the
   second International Aviation Training Symposium, the question we asked
   ourselves was, "How could we possibly equal the success of the
   inaugural IATS 1999?" Event sponsorship, recruitment of speakers,
   location and logistics for the event, volunteer support, and
   International participation were just some of the challenges facing the
   team. We had a lot of expectations to live up to, but as usual, the
   Academy team not only met the challenge, they overwhelmingly surpassed
   the challenge!

   Over 330 delegates, exhibitors and speakers from 42 countries met in
   Oklahoma City at the Myriad Convention Center on August 28-31 to
   participate in IATS 2001. Aviation leaders, training specialists,
   airline operations and training management personnel, government air
   transport officials and aerospace industry experts met to address
   global aviation training issues affecting each country at its own level
   of need. The IATS objective was to take advantage of training
   technology, find ways to share resources, fund new training initiatives
   and jointly tackle worldwide aviation training challenges.
