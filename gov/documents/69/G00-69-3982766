   electro-optical sensor designs and sensitivity studies around the globe
   are developing small low-cost microwave remote sensing systems missions
   incorporating new technologies via programs system validation and
   vicarious calibration similar to NASA's New Millennium Program, Earth
   techniques System Science Program, and Instrument Incubator airborne
   simulators Program. At the same time, sensor designs for the next
   sensor test results including calibration and generation of U.S.
   operational weather satellites are characterization being formulated by
   the DOD/NOAA/NASA Integrated data processing, archival, and
   dissemination Program Office (IPO) and the NASA/NOAA GOES systems
   Program. All of these have resulted in the design, on-orbit
