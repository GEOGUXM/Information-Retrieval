   A 7 1998 3 Thanks to JPLers, summer campers have fun with learning
   Students in the Child Educational Center's (CEC)summer camp this year
   have enjoyed the usual arts and crafts, field trips and outings to the
   park. Many of them, however, have also turned their summer activities
   into learning experi- ences, thanks to an outreach program led by
   several JPL employees whose children attend the CEC. Hands On Science,
   supported in part by the National Science Foundation, is a one-hour,
   eight-session, enrichment program for children from pre-kindergarten
   through sixth grade. The goal of the program, said Kay Ferrari of JPL's
   Public Services Office, is to stimulate aware- ness of "science in your
   life" through the fun of active involvement in experiments, games,
   music and projects. The children's hands-on activities include the
   construction of simple materials into learn- ing tools. For example, by
   combining a card- board tube, rubber band and piece of wax paper, they
   learned about the eardrum and how a sound is "felt." Another activity
   taught about the vocal cords through the use of rubber bands and tongue
   depressors. PHOTO BY DUTCH SLAGER / JPL PHOTO LAB The year-round
