   Ecosystem Modeling uses mathematical formulations to represent a
   natural phenomenon or natural systems.

   ATLSS graphic - click to enlarge An essential component of restoration
   planning in South Florida has been the development and use of computer
   simulation models for the major physical processes driving the system,
   notably models of hydrology incorporating effects of alternative human
   control systems and noncontrolled inputs such as rainfall.  The USGS's
   ATLSS (Across Trophic Level System Simulation) Program utilizes the
   outputs of such physical system models as inputs to a variety of
   ecological models that compare the relative impacts of alternative
   hydrologic scenarios on the biotic components of South Florida.  The
   immediate objective of ATLSS is to provide a rational, scientific basis
   for ranking the water management scenarios as part of to the planning
   process for Everglades restoration.  The longer term goals of ATLSS are
   to help achieve a better understanding of components of the Everglades
   ecosystem, to provide an integrative tool for empirical studies, and to
   provide a framework monitoring and adaptive management schemes.
