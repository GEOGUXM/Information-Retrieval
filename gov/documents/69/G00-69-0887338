   Mayor's Priorities
      __________________________________________________________________

      "When I was first elected Mayor, my job was to fix what was broken.
      Now, my job is to build on our success. As I see it, Boston should be a
      city where every child gets a good education, every resident gets a
      good paying job, and every family is part of a strong neighborhood."
      --Mayor Thomas M. Menino, 2001 State of the City Address

      Since Mayor Menino took office in 1993, his leadership has presided
      over Boston's best economic expansion in the city's history. Once
      called the "Urban Mechanic," Mayor Menino has worked hard to address
      quality of life issues in every Boston neighborhood. Today, Boston is a
      better place to live, work, and raise a family.

      "The state of our city is strong," the Mayor said. "But it can be even
      stronger."

      In the new millennium, the Mayor has identified a number of priorities
      that will guide his administration. These include:
        * Reforming the Public Schools so that students get the education
          they need and deserve;
        * Creating more housing that working people can afford;
        * Providing residents with job training and new immigrants with
          English language training;
        * Keeping residents safe and healthy;
        * Reviving residential areas and neighborhood business districts;
        * Building quality of life;
        * And using new technology to reach out to as many people as
          possible.
