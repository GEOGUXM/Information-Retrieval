EEOC Technical Assistance And Training Programs

   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission presents a wide
   variety of fee-based training and technicalassistance programs
   throughout the country geared to employers, employees and organizations
   in the private sector, including small businesses, as well as federal,
   state and local governmental agencies. Training and technical
   assistance available includes:
     * Technical Assistance Program Seminars (TAPS) - one day, half day
       and multi-day (appropriate for the Private Sector, State, Local and
       Federal Agencies)
     * Customer Specific Training Programs - delivered at an employer's
       facility or an organization's meetings or training events
     * Training designed specifically for Federal Sector EEO Issues and
       Complaint Procedures.
     * EXCEL Federal Conference with MSPB and FLRA, August 26-30, 2002
     * Training and Technical Assistance Manuals (available for direct
       purchase)

   Our TAPS and other training courses and programs provide practical,
   "how to" information and assistance to encourage voluntary compliance
   with federal laws prohibiting job discrimination based on race, color,
   religion, national origin, sex, age, disability and retaliation. EEOC's
   training and technical assistance programs and the various manuals,
   workbooks and materials associated with these programs are made
   available under the auspices of the EEOC Education, Technical
   Assistance and Training Revolving Fund Act of 1992 , which authorizes
   the EEOC to charge reasonable fees to cover the costs of providing
   specialized, in-depth education and training on EEO laws.
