   4305 April 2001 Agency Fact Sheet Update: National Listing of Fish and
   Wildlife Advisories Summary The 2000 National Listing of Fish and
   Wildlife Advisories is now available from the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA). States, tribes, and territories report that
   the number of fish consumption advisories issued in 2000 rose by 187, a
   7% increase over 1999. The total number of advisories in the United
   States increased for four major contaminants-mercury, PCBs, dioxins,
   and DDT-but remained the same for chlordane. This is the third year in
   which the number of advisories issued for chlordane has declined or
   remained constant. The increase in advisories generally reflects an
   increase in the number of assessments performed and the improved
   quality of monitoring and data collection methods. The number of acres
   of lakes under advisory increased from 20.4% in 1999 to 23% in 2000, a
   total of 63,288 lakes, while the number of river miles under advisory
   increased from 6.8% in 1999 to 9.3% in 2000. The survey showed that
   100% of the Great Lakes and their connecting waters and 71% of coastal
   waters of the contiguous 48 states were under advisory in 2000. The
   national listing is available on the Internet at:
