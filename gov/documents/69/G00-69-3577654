   The physical facility occupies approximately 8,000 square feet in
   Building 810 on the Denver Federal Center. The main storage area is
   held at -35 degrees C to promote the longevity of the core. The cold
   laboratory area, including a Class 100 clean room, is maintained at -22
   degrees C. Visitors are provided with equipment for routine core
   examination and can ship and set up their own equipment for non-routine
   analyses in the laboratory area. The facility is provided with four
   levels of backups and safety systems in order to insure a
   well-controlled environment for the cores.

   NICL is centrally located at the Denver Federal Center, just south of
   the intersection of Kipling and 6th Avenues in Lakewood, Colorado. The
   lab's proximity to major transportation corridors and to the Denver
   International Airport insures timely shipping and handling of ice cores
   arriving and departing the facility.
