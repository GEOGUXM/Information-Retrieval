   Health Information Database Search
   The Deafness and Communication Disorders Database is one of 16
   databases that have joined together to create a health information
   resource called the Combined Health Information Database, or CHID. The
   databases that make up CHID are sponsored by Federal health institutes
   and agencies. We have a list of prepared searches for you on this site,
   or you can perform your own search. When you use CHID, you can search
   all 16 subfiles, or you can search the Deafness and Communication
   Disorders (DC) subfile individually. Bookmark this page, or use your
   browser's back button to return to the NIDCD Information Clearinghouse

   About Smell [uparrow.gif]
   [smell_b.gif] Smell belongs to our chemical sensing system, or the
   chemosenses. It is estimated that two million adults in the United
   States have had problems with the sense of smell. Some people are born
   with a chemosensory disorder, but most develop them after an injury or
   illness. Upper respiratory infections are to blame for some
   chemosensory losses, and injuries to the head can also cause problems.
   Chemosensory disorders may result from polyps in the nasal cavities,
   sinus infections, hormonal disturbances, or dental problems. Loss of
   smell also can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals, such as
   insecticides, and by some medicines. Many patients who receive
   radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck develop chemosensory
   disturbances. The sense of smell provides an early warning system that
   alerts us to fires, poisonous fumes, leaking gas, and spoiled food and
   beverages.

   About Taste [uparrow.gif]
   [taste_b.gif] The sense of taste, or gustation, is one of the chemical
   senses. Taste plays a crucial role in regulating our ingestion of foods
   and beverages. Taste deficits for sweet, sour, bitter, and salty
   substances present serious problems because they can affect the
   motivation to consume nutrients. For example, a taste deficit may lead
   to an unhealthy dietary habit such as excess salt consumption. In
   addition, abnormalities in chemosensory responses frequently accompany
   and even signal the existence of unhealthy conditions or diseases,
   including obesity, hypertension, malnutrition, diabetes, and some
   neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
