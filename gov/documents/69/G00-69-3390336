   The NASA Evaluation of Space Environment and Effects on Materials
   (ESEM), is a co-operative effort between the NASA Langley Research
   Center (LaRC) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan
   (NASDA). The ESEM experiments are focused on cosmic-dust collection,
   studies of atomic oxygen effects on materials, and space contamination.
   This site addresses the NASA/NASDA Cosmic Dust Collection experiments
   (CDCE), the NASA/NASDA Atomic Oxygen experiments (AOE), and the space
   contamination experiments that were exposed to the space environment on
   space shuttle mission STS-85 in August, 1997.
   The NASA/LaRC Cosmic Dust Collection Experiment utilized aerogel to
   capture debris during the STS-85 shuttle mission. The CDCE was exposed
   to space environment during the entire STS-85 mission and was oriented
   along the shuttle orbital velocity vector for 40 hours. The Cosmic Dust
   Collection Experiment was retrieved after completion of the STS-85
   mission for data analysis.
   The LaRC/NASA Atomic Oxygen Experiment consisted of materials provided
   by The Boeing Company, the College of William & Mary and NASA/Langley
   Research Center. The material samples were exposed to the space
   environment during the entire STS-85 mission and were oriented along
   the shuttle orbital velocity vector for 40 hours. The Atomic Oxygen
   Experiment was retrieved after completion of the STS-85 mission for
   data analysis. The LaRC/NASA atomic oxygen and dust collection
   experiments were also elements of the NASA Space Environments and
   Effects (SEE) Program.
   Information regarding the NASDA ESEM experiment can be found in the
   NASDA ESEM Final Report.
   The LaRC/NASA ESEM Project Manager is Junilla I. Applin. LaRC/NASA ESEM
   Chief Scientist is Dr. William H. Kinard.
