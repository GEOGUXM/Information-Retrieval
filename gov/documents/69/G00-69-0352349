     For all candidate transit cases, complementary follow-up
     observations are made to confirm that the transits are due to
     planets and to learn more about the characteristics of the parent
     stars and planetary systems.

Elimination of non-Planetary Candidates

     White dwarfs have radii similar to that of the Earth and can produce
     a light curve that mimics a transit by a terrestrial planet. Also, a
     grazing eclipse by a stellar companion can mimic a transit. In both
     cases, the stellar companions have masses that are usually >>100
     M[J]. The radial-velocity variations induced by such companions are
     typically >>1 km/s and can easily be detected, such as with the SAO
     Digital Speedometer available to Latham (1992). Thus, transit
     candidates where the companion is stellar can be eliminated.
     Similarly, brown dwarfs (10 M[J] < M < 100 M[J], R~1 R[J]) can be
     distinguished from giant planets.

Detection of Giant Planet Companions

     Radial velocity data also serve to explore or delineate the
     structure of the planetary systems by detecting giant planets not
     seen in transit or by reflected light. Normally, such data only
     yield the quantity, M sini, where M is the planetary mass and i the
     orbital inclination. The presence of transits implies that i ~90Â°,
     which establishes the mass of the planet. By sampling the Doppler
     shift a few times during an orbit, the orbital parameters of those
     planets showing transits are completely determined and the planet
     mass is established to within 3%. The mass (from spectroscopy) and
     planet radius (from photometry) yield the density of the planet.

     Kepler team member Marcy has developed the technique to measure
     velocities to 3 m/s on Keck (Marcy, et. al. 2000). Kepler team
     members also have institutional access to the proven Hamilton
     Echelle (Basri) and to new spectrometers on the Hobby-Eberly
     Telescope (Cochran) and the MMTO (Latham) all with <10 m/s
     capability.

Stellar Mass, Size and Metalicity

     For those stars found to have planets, high-resolution, high signal
     to noise ground-based spectroscopy is performed to clearly establish
     the spectral type and luminosity class. Stellar evolution models are
     used to estimate the mass, radius and metalicity of the parent star
     (e.g., Mazeh et al. 2000). The stellar mass is required to calculate
     the semi-major axis of the orbit and the stellar radius to calculate
     the planet's size. The frequency of planets with respect to spectral
     type and other stellar characteristics can then be established.
     There is now some preliminary evidence that planetary systems may be
     found more often around stars whose spectra show high metalicity
     (Gonzalez 1997, 1998) or depleted lithium (Cochran et al. 1997).
     Firmly establishing the existence of any such trends provides
     extremely valuable constraints on models of planetary system
     formation. Since the Kepler Mission FOV is along a galactic arm at
     the same galacto-centric distance as the Sun, the stellar population
     sampled is indistinguishable from the immediate solar neighborhood.
     Thus, these results can guide target selection for future planet
     searches by SIM and TPF for planetary systems in the very near solar
     neighborhood.

     Additional constraints on the parent star's radius and other
     properties are obtained from p-mode oscillations (e.g., Brown and
     Gilliland 1994) using Kepler's 1-min sampling mode. In the Sun a
     series of modes with periods of about 3 min and equal spacing in the
     frequency domain are excited to a level of about 3 ppm in white
     light. This level of precision requires the detection of at least
     10^12 photons. Kepler provides the necessary photon levels in one
     month for the 3,600 dwarf stars brighter than m[v]=11.4 in the FOV.
     Two members of the Kepler team have considerable experience and
     scientific interest in this type of stellar seismology that can be
     done with Kepler (Gilliland and Brown)

Astrometric Observations

     Where Kepler has found a planet, SIM can be used to find the masses
     (if they are jovian or larger) or set upper limits to the masses of
     the detected planets. SIM data complement the Doppler data since
     Doppler spectroscopy can not be used for stars hotter than F5. SIM
     can also be used to search for additional giant planets in wide
     orbits. For example, SIM can detect a 0.4 M[J] planet in a 4-year
     orbit around a solar-like star at a distance of 500 pc

     Using parallax, the geometric distance to a system at 500 pc can be
     determined to 0.2%, placing all inter-comparisons of discovered
     planetary systems on a very firm foundation. Two of the Kepler team
     members (Latham and Boss) are also members of the SIM key projects
     proposal team for planetary systems studies. The single-pointing
     field-of-regard of SIM of 15 deg. is nearly identical to that of
     Kepler and is a highly efficient use of SIM observing time.

     From infrared measurements with SOFIA or NGST any IR excess or lack
     thereof will indicate the fraction of systems having terrestrial
     planets that are or are not embedded in large amounts of extrasolar
     zodiacal dust.
