                          The Planetary Rings Node

   The Planetary Rings Node is devoted to archiving and distributing
   scientific data sets relevant to planetary ring systems. The two major
   classes of ring data are images and occultation profiles, although a
   variety of additional data types (e.g. spectra, particle absorption
   signatures, etc.) are also of interest. A large fraction of our data
   sets are from the Voyager missions to the outer planets, but
   Earth-based and HST data sets are also represented. The Rings Node also
   performs a variety of services to support research into these data
   sets. These services include developing on-line catalogs and
   information systems, filling orders for data, developing software
   tools, and coordinating special observing campaigns.

   The Planetary Rings Node supports research into all aspects of
   planetary ring systems, including their physical properties (particle
   sizes, composition, ring geometry), dynamical processes (including
   interactions with satellites) and origins. Indirectly, the Node also
   supports studies of other dynamical analogs such as the solar nebula
   and the asteroid belt, where similar physical processes are (or were)
   at work. In addition to supporting research, the Rings Node is
   committed to NASA's broader goal of educating the public about science
   and technology.

   The Rings Node is a cooperative project of NASA Ames Research Center
   and the Center for Radar Astronomy at Stanford University. Facilities
   are managed at Ames by
   Dr. Mark Showalter
