   Mission
   Prevention, Protection, and Permanency
   Philadelphia's Department of Human Services works to protect children
   from abuse, neglect, and delinquency; to ensure their safety and
   permanency in nurturing home environments; and to strengthen and
   preserve families by enhancing community-based prevention services.

   Accessibility
   In partnership with community organizations, DHS provides services to
   strengthen the overall well being of Philadelphia children, youth, and
   families using a customer focused approach that is responsible to
   evolving community needs.

   Integration and Accountability
   DHS develops and implements policies and programs to continuously
   improve, measure, and achieve positive outcomes for children; manage
   public resources efficiently; communicate with customers and the
   general public; and integrate systems in order to effectively deliver
   services to children and families.
