     Ancient observations of solar eclipses from many different cultures
   and civilizations date back to at least 2500 BC in the writings that
   have survived from ancient China and Babylon. To establish an accurate
   luni-solar calendar, people in ancient civilizations observed the moon
   regularly. Lunar eclipses were the first major celestial events that
   astrologers learned how to predict based on local historical
   observation records.
