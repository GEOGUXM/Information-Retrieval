       Product Data Standards for HVAC/R Systems

       Principal Investigator: Kent Reed   Revised:

         __________________________________________________________________

       Objective:

       To develop a standards-based information infrastructure supporting the
       design, analysis, specification, procurement, installation, operation,
       and maintenance of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and
       refrigeration (HVAC/R) systems.

       Problem:

       Heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration systems are
       essential elements of any modern building, plant, or
       ship---generically, any facility. They maintain the comfort and health
       of human occupants and establish the required operating conditions for
       industrial processes and commerce. Increasingly, facility owners are
       striving to optimize not just the performance and reliability but also
       the life-cycle cost of their HVAC/R systems. Over the life of a
       facility, the installed cost of the equipment making up the HVAC/R
       systems is swamped by the system operation and maintenance costs. As
       one example of this problem, in the United States, the manufacturing of
       air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment represents a $22 billion
       per year industry, while the annual U.S. energy bill for
       air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment is approximately $52
       billion. [1993 economic data drawn from NIST Advanced Technology
       Program RFP 96-06.] Beyond the performance and cost goals of individual
       owners, reducing energy consumption is a national goal.
       Complete and timely information must be shared among all the people who
       deal with HVAC/R systems if facility life-cycle goals are to be
       achieved. In addition to the manufacturers of components, these people
       include designers, analysts, specifiers, procurers, installers,
       operators, and maintainers.
       Typically, the information to be shared about HVAC/R systems covers
       mechanical equipment, ducting and piping, power, sensors and controls;
       it must deal with both intrinsic and installed form, fit, function, and
       behavior. This information must be melded appropriately with
       information about the spaces or processes to be conditioned by the
       systems. This information must be sufficiently rich to enable not only
       optimized operation but also automated diagnosis and recovery from
       fault conditions. The emerging demand on the part of facility owners
       for integrated, holistic control of all facility systems means this
       information must be available in a form consistent with other systems.
       The standardization activity in Subcommittee 4 of Technical Committee
       184 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to
       develop STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data) and PLIB
       (Part Libraries) extends naturally to HVAC/R products. Equipment
       manufacturers are increasingly likely to use STEP and PLIB solutions in
       their product realization processes. However, previous efforts to
       sustain system-oriented projects in the AEC Team in SC4 have not done
       well, with the notable exceptions of process plant piping systems and
       ship distribution systems, possibly because the information
       requirements weren't yet sufficiently well understood and agreed upon
       to justify the definition of a standard representation.
       In the general building industry, activity has shifted to the
       International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI), which is developing
       its Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) using STEP technologies such as
       the EXPRESS language, portions of the STEP integrated resources, and
       the clear-text-encoding implementation method for data exchange. By an
       official memorandum-of-understanding between SC4 and IAI, the IFC
       specification is to be submitted to ISO after implementation and
       testing experience show the specification is sufficiently mature. The
       IAI Building Services Domain committee, led by the United States, is
       responsible for work on HVAC/R systems, among others. Several building
       services projects have resulted in a baseline capability in the current
       release, IFC2.X, but a great deal of work needs to be done, especially
       in covering life-cycle activities other than detailed system design.
       Recent activity has focused on the Building Services BS8 project, which
       addresses HVAC system data requirements for building energy simulation
       programs, still primarily for design support.
       Recently, ASHRAE has undertaken projects that make natural partners to
       this project. These include the GPC20P, created to define XML schemas
       for HVAC components and equipment, and Research Project 1025, which is
       compiling and evaluating information sources for HVAC&R systems.

       Approach:

       In prior years, the IAI/Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) were
       evaluated for suitability of use in building simulation scenarios and
       appropriate IFCs were extended as needed to establish a product-model
       representation of information used in the first-generation Virtual
       Cybernetic Building Testbed (VCBT). An experimental IFC-based database
       was constructed and populated. A graphical user interface was developed
       for monitoring the VCBT, integrating static product and dynamic process
       data in an easily comprehended form using VRML97. In FY 2001, the
       issues involved in creating an application program interface (API) to
       the IFC-based database were explored and XML technology was used in
       creating portions of the API suitable for the simulation programs
       running in the second-generation VCBT. Technical papers are being
       prepared to document the work.
       In FY 2002, members of this project will join the BLIS (Building
       Lifecycle Interoperable Software) Coordination Project, a group of
       software implementers developing software based on the IFC2.x
       specification, and will work collaboratively to develop demonstrations
       of work processes related to HVAC systems that can be supported using
       BLIS-compliant software. This project will continue to work
       collaboratively with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and other
       national and international participants in the IAI Building Services-8
       project to develop extensions to the IAI/IFC2.X and to create the
       baseline capability needed in the IFC3.0 to represent HVAC systems
       fully. This project will collaborate with ASHRAE projects as
       appropriate. As a specific contribution to these efforts, this project
       will work collaboratively with the Mechanical Systems and Controls
       group to develop a technical basis for describing the composition and
       characteristics of Variable Air Volume Boxes that can be used in either
       XML- or IFC-based representations. Members of this project will
       collaborate with other participants in the Systems Integration for
       Manufacturing Applications (SIMA) program to elaborate the concept of
       the NIST-wide Software Interoperability Testbed and develop a prototype
       testbed in the technical context of this project.
       In following years, the work will be extended to include control
       algorithms and other dynamic functional and behavioral information, and
       to deal with fault detection and diagnostic applications. As it
       matures, this project will also provide a competent basis for exploring
       appropriate information interfaces with emerging electronic commerce
       technologies, which will enable the direct access and use of
       manufacturer's information about HVAC/R components throughout the
       facility life cycle.
