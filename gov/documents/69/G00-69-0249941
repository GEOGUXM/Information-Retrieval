   Advanced and Emerging Technologies
   Evaluations that provide reliability assurance data and guidelines for
   emerging technologies such as MEMS, photonics, organic semiconductor
   devices, novel NVM, deep sub-micron CMOS and SOI, mixed-mode
   (analog/digital) system on a chip, ultra long life electronics and very
   high speed RF. These technologies will provide orders of magnitude
   higher performance combined with ultra-low size, weight and power
   dissipation, and have acceptable levels of radiation hardness suitable
   for future NASA missions.
