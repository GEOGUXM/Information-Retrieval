508 Coordinators

   Successful implementation of Section 508 requires the support of each
   and every federal employee who is involved in the design, development,
   procurement, or use of electronic and information technology (EIT). All
   federal employees should understand the requirements of Section 508 and
   how they may apply to their business operations and processes. Federal
   agency Section 508 Coordinators are responsible for organizing and
   supporting the implementation of Section 508 within their respective
   departments and agencies, and have been appointed by their
   department/agency as the central point of contact for information
   concerning accessibility issues and solutions. To learn more about your
   role in Section 508 and how your agency is affected, contact your
   Federal Agency Section 508 IT Coordinator(s).
