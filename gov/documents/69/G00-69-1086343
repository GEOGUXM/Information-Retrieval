                  Ergonomics workshop set for Wenatchee employers

   TUMWATER - The Department of Labor and Industries will conduct a
   half-day workshop in Wenatchee next week to assist construction
   industry employers comply with requirements of the state’s ergonomics
   rule.

   The no-fee workshop will be held from 8 a.m. to noon, Wednesday at
   L&I’s East Wenatchee Service Center, 519 Grant Road. The four-hour
   session is intended to help construction employers identify
   caution-zone jobs and analyze these jobs using the criteria in the
   rule. Participants will review several case studies to identify
   construction-specific examples of hazards and solutions.

   Anyone interested in attending the workshop is asked to register by
   telephoning 1-800-574-2829.
