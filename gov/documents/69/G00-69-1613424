   Background top

   Unlike more traditional deep space missions, surface roving missions
   must be operated in a reactive mode, with mission planners waiting for
   an end of day telemetry downlink, including critical image data, in
   order to plan the next dayÂ’s worth of activities. Communications time
   delays over interplanetary distances preclude simple 'joysticking' of
   the rover. A consequence of this approach to operations is that the
   full cycle of telemetry receipt, science and engineering analysis,
   science plan generation, command sequence generation and validation,
   and uplink of sequence, must typically be performed in twelve hours or
   less. Yet current rover sequence generation is manual, with limited
   ability to automatically generate valid rover activity sequences from
   more general activities/goals input by science and engineering team
   members.

   Problem top

   Because it is a largely manual process, rover engineers are not able to
   perform "what-if" analysis on their daily activity sequences.  This
   limits what activities the rover can perform.

   Impact top

   Enabling goal-driven commanding of planetary rovers by engineering and
   science personnel greatly reduces the requirements for highly skilled
   rover engineering personnel and Rover Science Team time. This in turn
   greatly reduces mission operations costs. In addition, goal-driven
   commanding permits a faster response to changes in rover state (e.g.,
   faults) or science discoveries by removing the time consuming manual
   sequence validation process, allowing rapid what-if analyses, and thus
   reducing overall cycle times.

   Description top

   This system is a proof-of-concept prototype for automatic generation of
   validated rover command sequences from high-level science and
   engineering activities. This prototype is based on ASPEN, the Automated
   Scheduling and Planning Environment. This AI-based planning and
   scheduling system will automatically generate a command sequence that
   will execute within resource constraints and satisfy flight rules.
   Commanding the rover to achieve mission goals requires significant
   knowledge of the rover design, access to the low-level rover command
   set, and an understanding of the performance metrics rating the
   desirability of alternative sequences. It also requires coordination
   with external events such as orbiter passes and day/night cycles. An
   automated planning and scheduling system encodes this knowledge and
   uses search and reasoning techniques to automatically generate
   low-level command sequences while respecting rover operability
   constraints, science and engineering preferences, and also adhering to
   hard temporal constraints.

   Significance top

   Automated planning/scheduling technologies have great promise in
   reducing operations cost and increasing the autonomy of rover
   operations. By automating the command sequence generation process and
   by encapsulating the operation specific knowledge, ASPEN will enable
   rover commanding by a small operations team without subsystem experts.
   It will also provide scientists with immediate, more informed feedback
   on the feasibility of their science requests.
