                      Americans with Disabilities Act/
                              Olmstead Decision
     __________________________________________________________________

   In July 1999, the Supreme Court issued the Olmstead v. L. C. decision.
    The Court's decision in that case clearly challenges Federal, state,
     and local governments to develop more opportunities for individuals
     with disabilities through more accessible systems of cost-effective
                          community-based services.

      The Olmstead decision interpreted Title II of the Americans with
      Disabilities Act (ADA) and its implementing regulation, requiring
    States to administer their services, programs, and activities "in the
        most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified
                       individuals with disabilities."

   Medicaid can be an important resource to assist States in meeting these
   goals. However, the scope of the ADA and the Olmstead decision are not
      limited to Medicaid beneficiaries or to services financed by the
      Medicaid program. The ADA and the Olmstead decision apply to all
         qualified individuals with disabilities regardless of age.

     The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), formerly the
   Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has begun consultation with
   States and with people with disabilities. CMS plans to review relevant
   Federal Medicaid regulations, policies and previous guidance to assure
   that they are compatible with the requirements of the ADA and Olmstead
   decision, and facilitate States' efforts to comply with the law. CMS is
     working closely with other involved Federal agencies to ensure that
    these reviews are consistent with the requirements of the statute and
           are focused on the needs of persons with disabilities.

     The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Civil
   Rights, and CMS have formed a workgroup to address continuing questions
    and issues involving the implementation of the Olmstead decision and
       the ADA. We invite all States and stakeholders to submit policy
      questions and recommendations to the workgroup. Answers to these
     questions, as they are developed, will be posted on this web site.
