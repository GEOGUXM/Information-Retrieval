   Fool Irradiation: A Potential Unwanted Byproduct of Food Irradiation?*

   Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352-0999; daniel.j.strom@pnl.gov) Abstract
   What is the rate of fatal or serious accidents at industrial
   irradiators? The numerator of this rate is surprisingly high: in the
   past 30 years there have been at least 8 serious accidents with
   sterilizers: Norway, 1982 (40 Gy); Israel, 1990 (15 Gy); Italy, 1975
   (14 Gy), Peoples Republic of China, 1980 (8.3 and 3.2 Gy); El Salvador,
   1989 (5.3 Gy); New Jersey USA 1974 (4.1 Gy); New Jersey USA 1977 (2.1
   Gy); and Peoples Republic of China 1987 (1.35 Gy). There have been at
   least 50 serious accidents involving sealed sources of all kinds. In
   too many cases, safety procedures were foolishly violated or safety
   systems intentionally defeated and we have had "fool irradiation." For
   food irradiation to be acceptable, acute radiation deaths or injuries
   of food irradiation workers must not be substituted for the rare
   consumer death attributable to E coli 0157:H7. The recent IAEA review
   "Lessons Learned from Accidents in Industrial Irradiation Facilities,"
   and the ICRP Publication 76, "Protection from Potential Exposures:
   Application to Selected Radiation Sources" show the way to prevent
   future "fool irradiation," thereby making possible the benefits of food
   irradiation. Introduction There has been a gradual regulatory
   acceptance of food irradiation, both internationally (World Health
   Organization 1994) and nationally (Animal and Plant Health Inspection
   Service 1989, Food and Drug Administration 1985, 1986a, 1986b, 1989,
   1990a, 1990b, 1995a, 1995b, 1997, Food Safety and Inspection Service
   1992); concurrently, there has been consumer resistance based on the
   fear that irradiated food is unhealthy and that food irradiation is
   hazardous to workers (see, for example,
   http://www.pure-food.com/food.htm , http://www.kilima.com/bill62.html
   ,or, http://www.nfpa-food.org/Editorial/editNov97.html ). Part of the
   concern for worker safety is based on isolated incidents in which a few
   workers have died or been irradiated. As part of a project for the U.S.
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), researchers at Pacific Northwest
   National Laboratory (PNNL) began compiling data on accidents with
   sealed sources (Strom et al. 1994b; Strom et al. 1994a). This database
   has been incorporated into an ongoing project entitled Quantitative
   Evaluation of Contamination Consequences (QECC) (Strom et al. *Revised
   from Strom, D.J.; Watson, C.R. Fool Irradiation: A Potential Unwanted
   Byproduct of Food Irradiation? PNNL-SA-30251. pp. 167-171 Hylko, J.M.;

   Irradiation? DJ Strom & CR Watson, rev. 2/17/99 p. 1 of 6 1998). More
   information about QECC is available at http://qecc.pnl.gov. Data on
   industrial irradiator accidents were compiled by the U.S. Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission (Trager 1989) and the IAEA (1996). For other
   accidents, data have had to be combed from the scientific literature
   and government reports, including the IAEA (1998). The accident data
   represent "numerator data" in the sense that we have been unable to
   locate the number of irradiators in use as a function of time, and the
   numbers of workers at irradiators. These two kinds of information are
   needed to compute rates of irradiator accidents in units of accidents
   per person-irradiator-year. Such rates could be used for trends and
   projections. Measures of the Severity of An Irradiator Accident The
   number of people killed or seriously injured or highly irradiated is,
   of course, the highest level outcome of an accident. In the case of
   accidents with sealed irradiator sources, the number of persons
   involved has usually been one. It is difficult to compare these
   accidents because of differences in radionuclide, source strength,
   facility design, and operating procedures. Traditional comparisons are
   anecdotal and focus on "lessons learned" We propose a different kind of
   measure-the time-and-proximity factor-which removes radionuclide and
   source strength from the description of the person's interaction with
   the source. For an unshielded point source, dose equivalent H depends
   on exposure time t (hours), distance r (meters), source strength A
   (activity in Ci) and isotope (through + in rem/hr m2/Ci or Sv/h m2/Bq):
   H Hdt P + A dt P r(t)2 + A t . r 2 For each individual exposed in an
   incident for whom the dose equivalent HE is known, the source isotope
   and activity are known, one can calculate a time-and-proximity factor
   for the incident. This factor is independent of both source strength
   and radionuclide involved. The outcome measure time-and-proximity
   factor, ftime & prox, for external irradiation of an individual by a
   source of activity A (Bq) is H 1012 H f E(Sv)×1h/3600s E(Sv) time&prox
   (h m 2) . (2) + (Sv m 2s 1Bq 1) A(Bq) + (mSv m 2h 1GBq 1) A(Bq) Fool
   Irradiation: An Unwanted Byproduct of Food Irradiation? DJ Strom & CR
   Watson, rev. 2/17/99 p. 2 of 6 where + is the specific effective dose
   equivalent rate constant (in SI units) and +* is the same quantity is
   common units as tabulated in QECC. For this outcome measure, HE is the
   observed dose that an individual received during an incident, and ftime
   & prox the number of "hours at a meter from the source" that the
   individual would have had to spend to receive that HE. The collective
   time-and-proximity factor, ftime & prox, for external irradiation of N
   individuals by a source of activity A (Bq) is N N M HE, (Sv)×1h/3600s
   1012 (Sv) i M HE,i f i 1 i 1 time&prox, coll (h m 2) . (3) + (Sv m 2s
   1Bq 1) A(Bq) + (mSv m 2h 1GBq 1) A(Bq) Individual and collective
   time-and-proximity factors are useful in risk analyses to determine the
   probable distribution of individual and collective doses from a
   specified source in a particular accident or incident scenario.
   Distributions of time-and-proximity factors can then be applied to
   similar accidents to determine external exposures, even those involving
   a radioactive source of different isotope and activity. One simple
   definition of ftime & prox is the number of hours one would have to
   spend at one meter from the source to receive a dose equivalent of HE.
   If the source remained partially or wholly shielded, then an additional
   factor should be introduced: H f E time&prox t . F s +A Fsr 2 where Fs
   is the fraction transmitted through a shield, a number less than 1. Fs
   can be taken as the dose rate at 1 m from the source (in its shield) to
   the unshielded dose rate at 1 m. When sources are sub-divided, the full
   activity is still used in the calculations because the human
   interaction is what we want to characterize, not the immediate source.
   So doses from the 1983 Mexican accident, for example, are attributable
   to the entire source. Theoretical Limits Are Not Useful The theoretical
   upper limit on ftime & prox is 1 lifetime , (very close)2 where (very
   close) represents a small distance from the source, e.g., 0.01 m2. For
   a weak source, Fool Irradiation: An Unwanted Byproduct of Food
   Irradiation? DJ Strom & CR Watson, rev. 2/17/99 p. 3 of 6 this
   represents about 109 to 1010 hours at one meter, a quantity so large as
   to be useless. However, in tens of historical accident cases, a person
   (too often a child) has found an industrial radiography source and put
   it in a "hip pocket." In many cases, the "very close" is 1 cm or so,
   and exposure times have been up to several months. When large sources
   are involved, such as industrial radiography sources, these cases
   result in local radiation burns. The ratio of the average bone marrow
   dose to the dose at the site of the radiation burn is dependent on "how
   far the bone marrow is away from the hip pocket." In many cases, the
   bone marrow to burn site dose ratio is over 100, sometimes over 1000.
   In other words, one needs to look at truly potential exposures which
   may result in a high dose, but are realistic. Summary of Data Table 1.

   c <= 30 people involved in accident A current search of the QECC
   database yields 55 accidents with sealed sources, involving 5121
   individual time-and-proximity factors in QECC (Table 1). The QECC
   classification, "Irradiator" combines medical instrument sterilization
   facilities with food irradiation facilities. The average time and
   proximity factor for the irradiator category was 0.13, and that for the
   4 out of 13 irradiator accidents resulting in fatalities was 0.02.
   Summary Study of past accidents can help predict future rates of
   accidents with industrial irradiators if there is no improvement in
   radiation protection! Food irradiation will be unacceptable to the
   public if serious irradiation accidents continue to occur at a
   relatively high rate. Following the Fool Irradiation: An Unwanted
