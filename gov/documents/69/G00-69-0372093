   [dv_mrb_blu2.gif]

   NASA space borne sensors help to monitor global climate changes. NASA
   scientists study seasonal-to-interannual climate anomalies, such as El
   Ni単o, which have far reaching ecological and economical impacts. This
   home page provides updated information on NASA's contribution in
   monitoring the evolution of El Ni単o and its climatic consequences.
   The variations of surface wind, sea level, and sea surface temperature
   along the equator and the west coast of the American continents are
   presented under the section on Oceangraphic Observations.  Linkage to
   observations of outgoing long wave radiation, upper tropospheric water
   vapor, atmospheric precipitable water, precipitation, and surface
   temperature are provided under the section on Atmospheric
   Observations.  The variation of ocean biological productivity will be
   presented under the section on Biological Observations. In addition to
   figures of spatial and temporal sections to summarize the variations,
   computer animations are also available to browse through the large
   number of maps.  An introduction to the hypotheses of El Ni単o may also
   be helpful to those who are not familiar with the subject.
