                     Update and Redirect with ASP Sample

   This sample references an Active Server Page containing a Version
   Management control in order to perform the AnalyzeUpdateAndRedirect
   method. The form names below do not link directly to their related HTML
   files; instead, clicking the hyperlink directs you to
   UpdateControls.asp.
   UpdateControls.asp accepts the name of an HTML file in the current
   directory as a parameter, then sets the Version Management control's
   FormURL property and ExecuteMethod property to call the
   AnalyzeUpdateAndRedirect method once the control activates. Your form
   object versions will be checked and updated as necessary before
   proceeding to the requested form.
   Click on a form name below to test this functionality. View the source
   code of UpdateControls.asp, located in the Forms folder in the
   directory where you installed the FormFlow 99 Server Components, to see
   how this sample works.

   Memorandum A single page memorandum that automatically places the
   current system date on the form. This form also contains a large
   multiple-line field for data entry.
   Leave Request A leave request form used to request a leave of absence.
   This form illustrates field formatting, basic field calculations, radio
   buttons and drop-down list boxes.
   Purchase Order A requisition form that uses formatting for dates and
   currency fields, calculations to determine the totals and taxes, radio
   buttons, and drop-down list boxes.
