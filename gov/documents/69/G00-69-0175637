   This is how the Office of Surface Mining will handle information we
   learn about you when visiting our Web site. The information we receive
   depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

   If you read or download information, such as brochures, reports, or
   press releases:

          We collect and store only the following information about you:
          the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
          example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
          account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton
          University's domain); the date and time you access the pages;
          and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked
          directly to our site. We do not store any personal identifiers.
          This information is not stored in any particular fashion, but is
          part of a systems log file.


          For site management, information is collected for statistical
          purposes. This government computer system uses software programs
          to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes
          as assessing what information is of most and least interest,
          determining technical design specifications, and identifying
          system performance or problem areas. We use the information we
          collect to measure the number of visitors to the different
          sections of our site, and to help us make our pages more useful
          to visitors. This information is only used internally, does not
          contain personal identifiers, and will only be used for internal
          management purposes.

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail message or filling out a
   form:

          You also may decide to send us personally-identifying
          information, for example, in an electronic mail message
          containing a complaint, requesting printed materials be mailed
          to you, or completing a Citizen Request for Inspection of an
          Active Coal Mine form. We use personally-identifying information
          from customers only to accomplish the requested activity. Any
          information that we collect via a questionnaire or form may be
          subject to disclosure; but, will be handled in accordance with
          the requirements of the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information Act,
          and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to ensure the
          greatest protection of personal privacy in the face of any
          required disclosure.

   We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying
   information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
   provide such information to us. Except as might be required by law, we
   do not share any information we receive with outside parties.

   If you have any questions or comments about the Office of Surface
   Mining Privacy Policy presented here, please contact Michael Wright,
