   December 1938

          Two German scientists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman,
          demonstrated nuclear fission. They found that they could split
          the nucleus of a uranium atom by bombarding it with neutrons,
          the uncharged part of atoms. As the uranium nucleus split, some
          of its mass was converted to energy.

          News of the discovery spread through the scientist community.
          Other physicists noticed the fission of uranium gave off extra
          neutrons which could in turn split other uranium atoms, starting
          a chain reaction. In theory, this energy could be harnessed to
          make a powerful bomb.



          August 1939

          On August 2, Albert Einstein sent a letter to President
          Roosevelt informing him of German atomic research and the
          potential for a bomb:

          "Some recent work ... leads me to expect that the element
          uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy
          in the immediate future ... that it may become possible to set
          up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which
          vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like
          elements would be generated ... This new phenomenon would also
          lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable though
          much less certain-that extremely powerful bombs of a new type
          may thus be constructed, A single bomb of this type ... might
          very well destroy the whole port together with some of the
          surrounding territory."

          Einstein drafted the letter with the help of Hungarian physicist
          Leo Szilard, one of many scientists who had fled Europe to
          escape Nazi and Fascist repression, Szilard was a vocal advocate
          of a U.S, program to develop bombs based on the latest findings
          in nuclear physics.

          In the letter, they encouraged Roosevelt to fund American atomic
          research. This letter prompted Roosevelt to form a special
          committee to investigate the military implications of atomic
          research. Roosevelt approved uranium research in the United
          States in October 1939.

          This was the first decision among many that led to establishment
          of the Manhattan Project. (see September 1942).
