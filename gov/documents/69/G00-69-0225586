   Welcome to the

                          Nutrient Requirements and
                            Functions Laboratory

                 Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center

   Focus of the research:

   NRFL has four CRIS projects coded to Human Nutrition NP 107 that focus
   on three main research areas:

   (1) Determine human requirements, functions, and basic mechanisms of
   action for specific vitamins and minerals.

   (2) Develop methodology for assessment of mineral and vitamin nutrition
   in humans.

   (3) Develop cost-effective cellular, molecular, and immunological
   methods for evaluating micro-nutrient requirements and functions, and
   the effect of nutritional status on immune function.

   A multidisciplinary research team investigates vitamins, minerals, and
   other components of the diet as they affect the health and well being
   of the U.S. population. Special emphasis is placed on how nutrients
   interact to provide maximum benefit to the immune system. New criteria
   are established to quantify requirements for specific micro-nutrients
   and to define their mode of action through studies that include the use
   of animal models. Cooperative research programs with other laboratories
   and various institutions and organizations within and outside the U.S.
   are established.
