   Vendors' Frequently Asked Questions

      Does the USFA supply test data?
      No, Vendors must create their own test data.
      __________________________________________________________________

      How do I check edits?
      Vendors must use the Design Documentation and related documentation
      posted on the Design Documentation web page to design their software
      and check relational edits. Registered Vendors may download the Vendor
      Validation Tool version 4.03 to validate their flat files. For further
      information about the go to the Vendor Software Development Procedures
      page.
      __________________________________________________________________

      Some fire departments have data in the 4.1 format. Can they use a
      vendor's conversion utility to convert 4.1 data to 5.0 format?
      4.1 Data converted with vendor software can be processed and stored at
      the fire department and state level only. For imports to the National
      Database, 4.1 data must be converted to 5.0 format with the USFA
      software. Fire Departments must follow their state's policy on
      converting 4.1 data.
      Refer to the NFIRS 5.0 News Page for complete information.
      __________________________________________________________________

      How do I obtain a Vendor ID? How do obtain a Software ID?
      When a Vendor Registers on the NFIRS Vendor Registration Form and the
      registration is submitted, a page will be returned noting the Vendor
      ID. This Vendor ID is used to login to the Vendor site and this ID MUST
   be entered in the second record of the Transaction files.
   For further information on Vendor and Software Identification, refer to
   the Design Documentation.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Is there a naming convention for the data files?
   The suggested naming convention is: stateFDIDdate.txt (example:
   MD565650300). If the .txt file extension is not used, a conventional
   three character file extension is suggested.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Must fields be formatted to be adjustable or variable in length?
   Each coded field in the system can expand 1 extra digit to accommodate
   the Plus One Codes. These fields have a fixed maximum size to handle
   the potential extra digit but will be always that size or one less
   which is the default National standard size for the field. They are not
   variable length in the traditional sense.

   For example, the Property Use field will always be 3 characters in
   length unless the plus one code is used by the state or the department
   to categorize the entry at a more specific level, in which case it will
   be 4 characters in length. It can never be any length other than 3 or 4
   characters.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Does the file need to be comma delimited?
   No. The first record in the file contains the delimiter that is used.
   Please see the description of the Flat File Transfer Format in the
   NFIRS 5.0 Design Documentation on the Design Documentation page.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Is the file required to be sorted by Incident Number or Record Type?
   The file must be sorted by the NFIRS 5.0 header key fields. These
   include:

     FDID

     State

     Alarm Date

     Incident Number

     Exposure Number

     Record Type

     Transaction Type

   See the description of the Flat File Transfer Format 1000 Record Type
   in the Design Documentation.

Miscellaneous Questions

   Should the clients only be submitting incidents one month at a time?
   No, they can submit transactions as often as they like. They should,
   however, submit at least once a month.
   If a Fire Department has had no incidents during the month, a 'No
   Activity' report should be submitted monthly.
   __________________________________________________________________

   How far back can clients go for reporting changes and deletes?
   The USFA does not impose a limit on how far back one can post changes
   and deletes using the NFIRS 5.0 system; however, some states do.
   Vendors must take into consideration that clients will report according
   to their state's policy and that software must provide for them the
   capability to do so.
   __________________________________________________________________

   If a call is Action Taken = Cancelled Enroute, how should it be coded?
   Should it be handled like a stand-by incident? Should I just not run an
   audit on it at all and thereby not transmit it?
   This situation should be coded as an Incident Type 611 - "Dispatched
   and cancelled enroute." These incident types should be transmitted just
   as all other incident types are transmitted.
   __________________________________________________________________

   If Mutual Aid was given, does the user only report the required
   information through G1 on the Basic Module? If so, do we have to
   include Apparatus Records Types (2020) if the Apparatus Used box is
   checked on the form or module?
   Yes, completion through G1 is all that is required and/but completion
   of the rest of the Basic and other modules is optional. Any modules
   completed optionally for Mutual Aid given beyond the G1 block should be
   kept locally for department use only and not passed on via transaction
   file.
   __________________________________________________________________

   When is the Arson form required?
   The Arson/Juvenile Firesetter Fire module is always optional; users are
   never required to complete it. When the proper conditions exist, the
   Arson Module becomes active and may be completed if desired. Otherwise,
   the module is not active and cannot be completed. The user cannot
   complete the Arson module if the fire was clearly not something
   arson-related or juvenile-firesetter related.

   For the Arson Module to become available for the user to compete it,
   the conditions below must be in effect (Relational edit rule #148):

   [The Arson Module] is active only if the Cause of Ignition field in the
   Fire Module is equal to 1,2,5, or U or if the Wildland Fire Cause is
   equal to 7. (If the Wildland Module is used instead of the Fire
   Module.) If the Fire Module's Cause of Ignition is equal to 2, then
   only Block A and Block M fields are allowed and active.
   __________________________________________________________________

   When validating the Fire Department Header transaction (Record Type
   2000), the Validation Tool generates the message:

        Coded Field Invalid^Critical^Fire Department FIPS Code^

   How do vendors resolve this error?
   FIPs codes are state-specific. The Vendor Validation Tool does not
   validate state-specific information, therefore the error will be
   generated and exist when using the Vendor Validation Tool even if a
   three character, text entry exists in the FIPs Code field.
