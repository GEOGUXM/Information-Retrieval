   Goals
   Horizontal
   To investigate the applicability of quantum computing (QC) technology
   to information networks and to distributed systems.

   Technical Approach
   Horizontal
     * Develop and instrument a distributed QuIN testbed for experimenting
       with QC hardware and software technology.
     * Prototype quantum key distribution protocols and evaluate their
       performance in QuIN testbed
     * Characterize the performance limitations of an optical quantum
       communication link.
     * Initiate algorithm research to explore optimal q-bit geometries and
       classify problems suitable for QC.

   FY02 Plans
   Horizontal
     * Complete design of the quantum communication system, including
       free-space physical optics, data link layer electronics, computer
       interfaces, and software.
     * Deploy quantum key distribution prototype in QuIN testbed and
       evaluate performance.
     * Integrate QuIN transmission and protocol technologies with
       traditional network and security systems.

   Customers
   Horizontal
     * QC Researchers

   Collaborators
   Horizontal
     * DARPA
     * Lucent, Nortel
     * NIST PL/EEEL
