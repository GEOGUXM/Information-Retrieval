   Introduction

   Because of the temporal and/or spatial resolutions of existing
   satellite imaging systems, it is difficult to capture short-lived
   events, such as dust storms, sediment plumes, or volcanic eruptions, on
   a regular basis. In order to capture various sized dust storms and
   document some of the sources and transport patterns we are using
   digital cameras set up in the field as stand-alone stations.

   Four digital cameras are installed in the Mojave Desert. The cameras
   are controlled by a data logger, which receives information from an
   on-site anemometer (wind velocity sensor). The data logger
   automatically triggers three of the four cameras to collect digital
   photographs when the winds exceed a selected threshold. The data logger
   triggers the fourth camera twice daily to collect photographs for
   visibility change analysis.

   Shown on this page are examples of the digital photographs
   automatically collected by the camera stations and pictures
   illustrating the various components and installation of the camera
   stations.
