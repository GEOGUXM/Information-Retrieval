                                                          Mark Twain quote

   How big is the universe? How old is it? Are there other planets like
   Earth out there among the stars? We have asked these questions around
   campfires and in the halls of universities for centuries. Today, we
   know that the answers lie hidden in the positions and distances of the
   stars and galaxies. And each time scientists have measured these
   positions and distances with greater accuracy, they have gained a
   wealth of new understanding.

   The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), scheduled for launch in 2009,
   will determine the positions and distances of stars several hundred
   times more accurately than any previous program. This accuracy will
   allow SIM to determine the distances to stars throughout the Galaxy and
   to probe nearby stars for Earth-sized planets. SIM will also pioneer a
   technique to block out (null) the light of bright stars to take images
   of the interesting areas close to the star. SIM will open a window to a
   new world of discoveries.

   This breakthrough in capabilities is possible because SIM will use
   optical interferometry. Pioneered by Albert Michelson, who became the
   first American to win the Nobel Prize in physics in 1907, optical
   interferometry can fulfill its full potential only outside the
   distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere. There, it can combine light
   from two or more telescopes as if they were pieces of a single,
   gigantic telescope mirror. Developed for use in space with SIM, this
   technique will eventually lead to the development of telescopes
   powerful enough to take images of Earth-like planets orbiting distant
   stars and to determine whether these planets sustain life as we know
   it.

   SIM is being developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under contract
   with NASA and in close collaboration with two industry partners,
   Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space in Sunnyvale, California, and TRW
   Inc., Space and Electronics Group in Redondo Beach, California.
