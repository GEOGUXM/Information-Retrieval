                                General Uses:

     * Generation of radiographic images magnified up to 50x.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Examining pinch welds of small-bore tubing.
     * Determining depth of penetration of weld on thin stainless steel
       bellows.

                                Test Samples:

       Samples are limited to small objects or small volumes of larger
                                  objects.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Limitations:

        Penetration is limited to about 5 cm of steel or equivalent.
   Cross-sectional area covered at one time is usually no more than 2 or 3
                  cm, but larger objects could be scanned.

                         Estimated Evaluation Time:

   Alignment is more critical than in conventional radiography and can be
       assisted by Real-time Radiography. Less radiation is available;
   therefore, exposures tend to be longer, up to an hour on occasion. Film
                          processing is 11 minutes.

                                 Principle:

   The x-rays used for microfocus radiography are generated by bombarding
      a target (usually tungsten) with a focused beam of electrons. The
     electron spot size can less than 40 microns in diameter providing a
   very small x-ray source. The sample is placed close to the source thus
   magnifying the image geometrically while maintaining focus. The distace
      between the sample and the film also significantly reduces image
         degradation caused by scattered radiation from the object.
   Magnifications of up to 100x can be occasionally obtained, depending on
                          sample size and geometry.
