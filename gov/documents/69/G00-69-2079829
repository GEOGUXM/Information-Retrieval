   Answers:

      Q1. How old must I be to get a job?
      In most cases, you must be at least 14 years old before you can work at
          a real job.  Of course, if you are younger than 14, you can work
          around your home, baby-sit on an informal basis, and deliver
          newspapers.

      Q2. Why cant I work now, I am big enough and strong enough to do the
      same work as grownups?
      You already have a full time job - to attend school and get a good
          education, without letting part-time work or other things interfere
          with your schooling.  That is why State laws require young people
          to attend school until a certain age, usually 16.  The child labor
          laws for 14- and 15-year-olds were designed with those school
          attendance requirements in mind -- to keep kids healthy and safe --
          and to make sure there is time to study, play and do other things
          with family and friends.

      Q3. How and why did child labor laws come into being?
      From the mid 1800s to the early part of this century, many young
          children were employed in what we now call sweatshop conditions.
          These children spent many hours working hard at dangerous jobs
          instead of going to school and getting a good education.  Many
          factories and other firms hired kids because they could be paid
          less than adults.  Many children were overworked and underpaid,
          often working 16 hours a day, six days a week, and earning only
          pennies an hour.  Kids often were injured or killed while working
          under these brutal conditions.  The child labor laws came into
          being to stop these abuses and help young people obtain schooling.

      Q4. Why didnt somebody do something about this sweatshops if they were
      so bad?
      Over the years many tried to improve these conditions for kids.
          Finally, the Fair Labor Standards Act was signed into law by
          President Franklin Roosevelt on June 25, 1938.  This important law
          limits the conditions which children may work to those that protect
          their health and safety and do not interfere with their education.

      Q5. Why dont the child labor laws prohibit children from doing chores
      at home?
      Before the child labor laws can apply, there must be what is known as
          an employment relationship.  Most tasks done in the home by family
          members do not create this employment relationship, and children
          are permitted to do the normal household chores such as
          baby-sitting their brothers and sisters, doing the dishes, cleanup
          work, keeping their room neat, mowing the lawn and raking leaves.

      Q6. What types of work can I do if I am at least 14-years-old?
      You can perform most jobs in offices and some jobs in retail stores,
          restaurants and fast food places.  Office work may include cleaning
          the office and the use of office machines.  The number of hours you
          may work each week is carefully limited, and you may not work
          during those hours your school is in session.

      Q7. What jobs are prohibited for me?
      Fourteen and 15-year-olds cannot work in manufacturing, mining,
          construction, transportation, around machinery or in 17 unsafe jobs
          that are banned for all youths under age 18.  You also may not be a
          cook or baker in restaurants, work on ladders or scaffolds, or do
          other dangerous work.

      Q8. How many hours in a workweek can an employee my age be required to
      work?
      There are limits on both the number of hours and the time of day that a
          14- or 15-year old can work.  They may not work during school
          hours.  They may work up to three hours on a school day, eight
          hours on a nonschool day, and 18 hours a week during a school
          week.  They may work no more than forty hours in a week that school
          does not meet.  There are also periods of time which 14- and
          15-year-olds may not work.  They may not work before 7:00 a.m. or
          after 7:00 p.m., except between June 1 and Labor Day when the end
          of day standard is 9:00 p.m.

      Q9. If my parents, brothers or sisters or I have questions concerning
      their pay, child labor or some other work issue, how can I get these
      questions answered?
      Contact the local Wage and Hour Office in your area.  That office is
          listed in your telephone directory in the Federal Government
          section under the heading Department of Labor.

      Q10. Why are kids younger than me allowed to work in factories in
      foreign countries?
      Other countries have different child labor laws or may not be as
          willing to enforce their existing laws.  In some places in the
          world, families are so poor that children must work to put food on
          the table.  This is unfortunate.  Many organizations, including the
          United States Government, are working to end oppressive child labor
          throughout the world and help all children obtain an education.

      Q11. What is being done about sweatshops in foreign countries?
      The Department of Labor outlined ten steps that need to be taken to
          eliminate illegal child labor around the world.  Last summer the
          Department helped to launch a campaign called FoulBall which makes
          sure that soccer balls are stitched by Pakistani adults and not
          children who should be in school.  The Department is also
          cooperating with such international groups as the United Nations
          and the International Labor Organization.  For more information on
