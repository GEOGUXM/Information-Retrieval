                    ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN PROGRAM VISION

     The purpose of the APAP is to provide AL Management with
     recommendations on issues involving employees with Asian-Pacific
     American ancestry. Some of these issues include training and
     promotion opportunities, recruitment, and the academic scholarship
     for graduating high school and college undergraduate students. The
     APAP also promotes Asian-Pacific American awareness to all
     employees. This home page has also been designed to provide links to
     all other Special Emphasis Programs (SEPs) and the Office of Equal
     Opportunity at DOE/AL.

     We will recognize, maximize and promote the value of diversity in
     the DOE AL workforce and in our local community, affording all
     individuals the opportunity to be fully productive team members in
     accomplishing the Department's missions.

     The Asian Pacific American Program (APAP) home page has been
     designed to provide you with the latest information and news
     involving the APAP at the Department of Energy, Albuquerque
     Operations Office (AL). The AL is located on Kirtland Air Force
     Base.

      If you have any questions or comments concerning the APAP, please
               contact the manager by E-mail: PChimah@doeal.gov
