   The QuikSCAT mission, with SeaWinds as the sole science instrument, was
   launched on 19 June 1999 and has been returning high-quality data since
   19 July 1999. A second SeaWinds will be launched in late 2001 as part
   of the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan's ADEOS-II
   mission. QuikSCAT is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created
   by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the
   satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997. The SeaWinds
   instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar
   that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather
   and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans. In addition to its primary
   role in acquiring wind field measurements, the QuikSCAT SeaWinds will
   also obtain measurements over land and ice.

   MISSION OBJECTIVE:


   [bull.gif]

   Acquire all weather, high-resolution measurements of near surface winds
   over global oceans.
   [bull.gif]

   Determine atmospheric forcing, ocean response, and air-sea interaction
   mechanisms on various spatial and temporal scales.
   [bull.gif] Combine wind data with measurements from scientific
   instruments in other disciplines to help us better understand the
   mechanisms of global change and weather pattern
   [bull.gif] Study both annual and semi-annual rain forest vegetation
   changes.
   [bull.gif] Study daily/seasonal sea ice edge movement and
   Arctic/Antarctic ice pack changes.
