Financing Types Debt from Personal Resources, Family & Friends for Start-Ups

   Are you all in?

The fact remains that the most common sources of funding for start up, small
businesses and entrepreneurs are from personal investment and funds generated
through family and friends.

   September 23rd, 2001

   Entrepreneurs are reminded to look first at their own personal savings
   and the leverage of personal assets, such as home equity or
   investments. Many small business owners get access to additional
   capital by borrowing from or pledging assets owned by family and
   friends.

   Most professional capital providers first look to see that the
   entrepreneur is "all in" and that those closest to the entrepreneur are
   backing the venture before he will consider an investment or loan.


   Document the transaction

   Although the initial funds may be generated from those closest to you,
   it is recommended that you treat the transaction professionally.

   For example, to avoid family strife and miscommunication, any capital
   infusion should be identified as to whether it is debt or equity, when
   and how it will be repaid and what the interest rate or return is.
   Simple loan agreements can be purchased at a local office supply store
   in the "Forms" section.


   A return on the investment is required

   Even transactions between family and friends require a minimum interest
   rate, which is determined and published monthly by the IRS. When less
   than the minimum rate is charged, the difference may be imputed as
   additional income to the lender, which may be taxable. The borrower has
   a like amount of additional interest expense which, depending upon the
   nature of the interest, may or may not be tax deductible.


   Many lenders neglect to charge interest on a loan to family and
   friends. Unfortunately, unless an IRS exception applies, the paper
   income and resultant tax could put a strain on a personal relationship.


   Other personal loans & credit cards

   Many entrepreneurs utilize personal credit lines and credit cards to
   purchase business basics such as supplies, meals, travel, even computer
   or telecommunications equipment.


   When possible, track the credit between personal and business needs by
   using separate cards. Begin to document the repayment and resulting
   business credit history by using company checks.


   Creative use of family resources

   By being creative, the entrepreneur can establish credit for the
   business early and maintain productive assets based on family financial
   objectives.


   For example, some entrepreneurs have access to family assets, such as
   certificates of deposit or stock which may be pledged as collateral for
   a bank loan instead of being lent or invested directly (in)to the small
   business. This tactic usually requires an established deposit
   relationship with the bank and projections that show that the loan will
   be repaid through cash flow, not by liquidating the collateral.
