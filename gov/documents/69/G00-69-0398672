                              T-10 Software Tools

   The following computational tools are distributed by T-10.
     * [rindicon.gif] RIND
       Description: RIND stands for Reconstructed Independence. Given an
       alignment of protein sequences, rind computes a maximum-likelihood
       estimate of the number of times each residue was replaced into each
       position. Rind averages over several of the most likely phylogenies
       it is able to find using a user-specified distance-based method
       such as neighbor joining. The program can also make local changes
       to the topology when these will improve the likelihood. The
       evolutionary model used throughout the computation allows for
       different residue frequencies in each position, but ignores the
       genetic code.

     * Weighbor
       Description: Weighbor is a weighted version of Neighbor Joining
       that gives significantly less weight to the longer distances in the
       distance matrix. The weights are based on variances and covariances
       expected in a simple Jukes-Cantor model. The criterion for which
       pair is joined is based on a likelihood function on the distances.
       The resulting trees are less perturbed by adding distant taxa
       compared to Neighbor Joining, and negative branch lengths are
       avoided. The method does not suffer from long branch attraction as
       maximum parsimony and other methods do. The method is much faster
       than maximum likelihood, usually faster than maximum parsimony, and
       a lot slower than Neighbor Joining.
