      The Ulysses/Voyager Project office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
       (JPL), in Pasadena, California is piloting a teach-one-teach-many
      program. We would like to invite your school to participate in this
                unique project. The goals of this program are:

      * To provide an opportunity for students to learn about space
        science, mission operations, spacecraft design, and project
        management through interviews with science and engineering staff
        working on the missions.
      * To help students share the information they have learned by
        teaching classes at their local schools.
