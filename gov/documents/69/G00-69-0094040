               Nonindigenous Bryozoan Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bryozoans (Phylum Bryozoa or Ectoprocta) are colonial, sessile animals
   that are usually encased in a protective covering with an opening for
   the animal's protruding tentacles. Each individual is very small and
   measures only several millimeters in length. They are usually found in
   marine environments, although some species are found in fresh water.
   Standard methods of introduction include ship fouling or transportation
   in ballast water of ocean-going vessels. Potential impacts include
   competition with native species for suitable substrate and effects on
   organisms to which they attach. An example of a nonindigenous bryozoan
   is the lacy-crust bryozoan, Membranipora membranacea (pic 139k), which
   has been introduced to the coast of New England. Within three years of
   its introduction it had become the dominant kelp epiphyte off the
   coasts of New Hampshire and Maine. Kelp encrusted with this introduced
   bryozoan are more susceptible to breakage during storms. As a result
   the lacy-crust bryozoan has apparently contributed to the defoliation
   of the kelp beds in this region. The reduction in the kelp beds
   resulted in a dramatic decline of the sea urchin. The lacy-crust
   bryozoan has also been found to competitively exclude the native
   encrusting animals in New England for suitable substrate.
