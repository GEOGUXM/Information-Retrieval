ROOTEDGE

   ROOTEDGE is a computer program written for MS-DOS machines that
       measures areas, perimeters, lengths, and widths of objects in
       binary images. ROOTEDGE uses a new algorithm for perimeter
       measurement, the Edge Chord Algorithm, which is more accurate than
       older algorithms, and less affected by the orientation of the
       objects in the image.

FLOWDATA

   FLOWDATA software was written for SAS and was developed to process,
       calculate, and graphically display infiltration and hydraulic
       conductivity data collected with automated tension and ponded
       infiltrometers and dataloggers.
