   One of NASA's most exciting and rewarding science enterprises is the
   exploration of our own world, Earth. How does our Earth system work?
   How do the oceans, land, and atmospheric processes affect each other?
   What role does humanity play in the future of our environment? For
   better or worse, we are part of the Terran ecosystem! Looking down from
   NASA's space platforms gives NASA's Earth Science researches a
   perspective that allows analysis of global issues. As fact replaces
   belief, knowledge will grow.  Science @ NASA brings you
   up-to-the-minute happenings from NASA's Earth Science Program.
