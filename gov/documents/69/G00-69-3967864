      About the Disaster Finder

      If you're looking for the latest links in disaster information, the
      Disaster Finder finds them for you, and even lets you preview your
      selections with brief site descriptions. All sites are clickable from
      the Disaster Finder's category screens. The Disaster Finder also allows
      you to perform quick or detailed searches of its links database.

      Disaster Finder is a service developed and maintained by the NASA Solid
      Earth and Natural Hazards Program (Code YO), NASA Headquarters,
      Washington, D.C., USA. This service was created for the disaster
      community at-large so that the best links in disaster information could
      be found quickly and easily.

      Links are categorized within the Disaster Finder database according the
      Disaster services section of the Taxonomy of Human Services: A
      Conceptual Framework with Standardized Terminology and Definitions for
      the Field. This taxonomy provides a classification system that allows
      organizations maintaining human services databases to index and access
      community resources based on the specific types of disaster services
      they provide. This structure, which was developed as part of the NERIN
      (National Emergency Resource Information Network) project, is used to
      organize the Disaster Finder's links database to valuable and timely
      disaster resources on the Internet and WWW.

      Even though web sites constantly change, NASA is committed to
      revisiting and re-evaluating sites for their usefulness to the disaster
      community. You can help us keep the Disaster Finder up-to-date by
      telling us about disaster sites you come across on the Net or perhaps
      you would like to submit your own site. The goal of the Disaster Finder
      is to become the site on the Net for finding disaster information.
      Please let us know what you think of our site. Come back often and
      enjoy!
