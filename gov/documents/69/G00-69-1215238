  Fast Camera movies of NSTX plasmas.

   The image resolution is 192x239 pixels on the CCD and the digitization
   is 8 bit deep. The system is triggered at t=0, the frame rate is 1000
   frames per second, and the time during the shot is shown on each frame,
   in seconds.  Bold shot numbers call up clips with the vessel and center
   stack added.

   The original TIF images recorded by the KODAK digital camera (i.e.,
   "raw data") are available from:
