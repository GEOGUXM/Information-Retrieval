  PREFACE

   This guide has been designed for one purpose -- to assist you, the
   prospective contractor, in doing business with the U.S. Department of
   Education. Our intent is to explain who we are and what we buy. Most
   importantly, we want to help you in marketing your product or services
   to this agency.

   Your ability, potential and willingness to participate are important to
   the accomplishment of the Department's mission. We are eager to know
   who you are and what you do. We welcome your inquiry and hope that your
   efforts will be profitable to both of us.

  INTRODUCTION

   Doing Business with the U.S. Department of Education is intended to
   provide businesses and other organizations with basic information about
   contracting opportunities at the Department of Education (ED).

   This publication is an overview of the mission of ED and its programs
   and procedures and emphasizes business opportunities for the following
   types of organizations:

   * small businesses

   * small disadvantaged businesses (including 8(a) firms)

   * small and small disadvantaged subcontractors

   * women-owned businesses

   This publication is issued by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer
   (OCFO) / Contracts and Purchasing Operations (CPO), and by the Office
   of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU). The latter
   office is responsible for implementing the Department's activities on
   behalf of small and small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned
   businesses in accordance with Public Law 100-656 and Executive Order
   12138. The guide is divided into three chapters:

   Chapter 1 outlines the major mission and offices of ED;

   Chapter 2 gives general contracting information and marketing help;

   Chapter 3 explains the preferential acquisition programs available.

   Attachment A contains ED Solicitation Mailing List Instructions for
   completing SF 129, which may be easily removed from the centerfold.

   In this electronic version of the Doing Business with the Department of
   Education pamphlet, the instructions for the ED Solicitation Mailing
   List and the Mailing List form (form requires Adobe Acrobat Reader,
   which is available free, to view or print) have been removed. Also
   mentioned in this document is the Guide to Programs at the U.S.
   Department of Education.
