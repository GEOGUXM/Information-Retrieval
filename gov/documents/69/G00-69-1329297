   Introduction

   The Microgravity Research Program is part of the NASA's Office of
   Biological and Physical Research (OBPR). The Microgravity Research
   Program is leading the nation in furthering the development of the
   space frontier by investigating the physical, chemical, and biological
   effects of the microgravity environment of space. Microgravity research
   is a natural extension of traditional Earth-based laboratory science,
   in which experiments performed benefit from the stable, long-duration
   microgravity environment.


   Vision

   We are recognized as a leader in inspiring and achieving world-renowned
   advancements in fluid physics using the unique attributes of the space
   environment.


   Our Mission

   To facilitate and conduct the best possible fluid physics research
   using the space environment, make this knowledge available to the
   scientific community and the public at large, and promote its
   application to space exploration and improvement of processes and
   products on Earth.



                               Go Back Forward
