   Executive Order 13224 blocking Terrorist Property and a summary of the
   Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (Title 31 Part 595 of the U.S. Code of
   Federal Regulations), Terrorism List Governments Sanctions Regulations
   (Title 31 Part 596 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations), and
   Foreign Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations (Title 31 Part
   597 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations)

   EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 - BLOCKING PROPERTY AND PROHIBITING TRANSACTIONS
   WITH PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM

   By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
   laws of the United States of America, including the International
   Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the
   National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the
   United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)
   (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of
   United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1214 of December 8,
   1998, UNSCR 1267 of October 15, 1999, UNSCR 1333 of December 19, 2000,
   and the multilateral sanctions contained therein, and UNSCR 1363 of
   July 30, 2001, establishing a mechanism to monitor the implementation
   of UNSCR 1333,

   I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that
   grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign
   terrorists, including the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania,
   and the Pentagon committed on September 11, 2001, acts recognized and
   condemned in UNSCR 1368 of September 12, 2001, and UNSCR 1269 of
   October 19, 1999, and the continuing and immediate threat of further
   attacks on United States nationals or the United States constitute an
   unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
   policy, and economy of the United States, and in furtherance of my
   proclamation of September 14, 2001, Declaration of National Emergency
   by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks, hereby declare a national
   emergency to deal with that threat. I also find that because of the
   pervasiveness and expansiveness of the financial foundation of foreign
   terrorists, financial sanctions may be appropriate for those foreign
   persons that support or otherwise associate with these foreign
   terrorists. I also find that a need exists for further consultation and
   cooperation with, and sharing of information by, United States and
   foreign financial institutions as an additional tool to enable the
   United States to combat the financing of terrorism.

   I hereby order:

   Section 1. Except to the extent required by section 203(b) of IEEPA (50
   U.S.C. 1702(b)), or provided in regulations, orders, directives, or
   licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding
   any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the
   effective date of this order, all property and interests in property of
   the following persons that are in the United States or that hereafter
   come within the United States, or that hereafter come within the
   possession or control of United States persons are blocked:

   (a) foreign persons listed in the Annex to this order;

   (b) foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in
   consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney
   General, to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of
   committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S.
   nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the
   United States;

   (c) persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in
   consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to
   be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of those persons
   listed in the Annex to this order or those persons determined to be
   subject to subsection 1(b), 1(c), or 1(d)(i) of this order;

   (d) except as provided in section 5 of this order and after such
   consultation, if any, with foreign authorities as the Secretary of
   State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the
   Attorney General, deems appropriate in the exercise of his discretion,
   persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation
   with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General;

   (i) to assist in, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or
   technological support for, or financial or other services to or in
   support of, such acts of terrorism or those persons listed in the Annex
   to this order or determined to be subject to this order; or

   (ii) to be otherwise associated with those persons listed in the Annex
   to this order or those persons determined to be subject to subsection
   1(b), 1(c), or 1(d)(i) of this order.

   Sec. 2. Except to the extent required by section 203(b) of IEEPA (50
   U.S.C. 1702(b)), or provided in regulations, orders, directives, or
   licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding
   any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the
   effective date:

   (a) any transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the
   United States in property or interests in property blocked pursuant to
   this order is prohibited, including but not limited to the making or
   receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for
   the benefit of those persons listed in the Annex to this order or
   determined to be subject to this order;

   (b) any transaction by any United States person or within the United
   States that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or
   avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in
   this order is prohibited; and

   (c) any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth
   in this order is prohibited.

   Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:

   (a) the term "person" means an individual or entity;

   (b) the term "entity" means a partnership, association, corporation, or
   other organization, group, or subgroup;

   (c) the term "United States person" means any United States citizen,
   permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United
   States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United
   States; and

   (d) the term "terrorism" means an activity that —

   (i) involves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life, property,
   or infrastructure; and

   (ii) appears to be intended —

   (A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

   (B) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or
   coercion; or

   (C) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction,
   assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking.

   Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type
   specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by
   United States persons to persons determined to be subject to this order
   would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency
   declared in this order, and would endanger Armed Forces of the United
   States that are in a situation where imminent involvement in
   hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and hereby
   prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
   Furthermore, I hereby determine that the Trade Sanctions Reform and
   Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106387) shall not
   affect the imposition or the continuation of the imposition of any
   unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction on any
   person determined to be subject to this order because imminent
   involvement of the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities is
   clearly indicated by the circumstances.

   Sec. 5. With respect to those persons designated pursuant to subsection
   1(d) of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in the exercise of
   his discretion and in consultation with the Secretary of State and the
   Attorney General, may take such other actions than the complete
   blocking of property or interests in property as the President is
   authorized to take under IEEPA and UNPA if the Secretary of the
   Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney
   General, deems such other actions to be consistent with the national
   interests of the United States, considering such factors as he deems
   appropriate.

   Sec. 6. The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and
   other appropriate agencies shall make all relevant efforts to cooperate
   and coordinate with other countries, including through technical
   assistance, as well as bilateral and multilateral agreements and
   arrangements, to achieve the objectives of this order, including the
   prevention and suppression of acts of terrorism, the denial of
   financing and financial services to terrorists and terrorist
   organizations, and the sharing of intelligence about funding activities
   in support of terrorism.

   Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
   Secretary of State and the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to
   take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations,
   and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA as
   may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary
   of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers
   and agencies of the United States Government. All agencies of the
   United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate
   measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this
   order.

   Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued
   effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other
   forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect
   heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly
   terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.

   Sec. 9. Nothing contained in this order is intended to create, nor does
   it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural,
   enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies,
   officers, employees or any other person.

   Sec. 10. For those persons listed in the Annex to this order or
   determined to be subject to this order who might have a constitutional
   presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to
   transfer funds or assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons
   of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these
   measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to
   be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this
   order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made
   pursuant to this order.

   Sec. 11. (a) This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
   time on September 24, 2001.

   (b) This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in
   the Federal Register.
