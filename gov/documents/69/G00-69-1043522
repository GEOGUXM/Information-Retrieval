THERE WERE 15 NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC
BASIN DURING 2001.  OF THESE...8 BECAME HURRICANES AND 2 BECAME
MAJOR HURRICANES...CATEGORY 3 OR HIGHER ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON

IN 2001 THAT FAILED TO REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THERE WAS
ONLY ONE LANDFALL...JULIETTE...WHICH BROUGHT HURRICANE CONDITIONS TO
THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.

INDIVIDUAL STORM SUMMARIES...

ADOLPH WAS THE STRONGEST MAY HURRICANE ON RECORD IN THE BASIN.
THE CYCLONE DEVELOPED ON THE 25TH...BECAME A TROPICAL STORM THE
NEXT DAY AND A HURRICANE ON THE 27TH.  AFTER MEANDERING A COUPLE
HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF ACAPULCO MEXICO...ADOLPH TURNED NORTHWESTWARD
LATE ON THE 27TH AND THREATENED TO BRING TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS
TO THE SOUTHERN COAST OF MEXICO.  HOWEVER...THE HURRICANE TURNED
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND EDGED AWAY FROM LAND WHILE STRENGTHING TO
CATEGORY 4 INTENSITY ON THE 28TH.  THE PEAK INTENSITY OF 125 KT WAS
REACHED EARLY ON THE 29TH.  ADOLPH CONTINUED TO MOVE GENERALLY
WESTWARD AWAY FROM LAND WHILE WEAKENING.  ADOLPH WEAKENED TO A
TROPICAL STORM ON 1 JUNE A FEW HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF CABO SAN LUCAS
MEXICO.  IT CONTINUED TO TRACK SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...AND
DISSIPATED OVER WATER LATER THAT DAY ABOUT 400 N MI SOUTH-SOUTHWEST
OF CABO SAN LUCAS.

BARBARA...WHICH MOVED ON A STEADY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK
THROUGHOUT ITS LIFETIME...FIRST FORMED AS A DEPRESSION ON 20 JUNE
ABOUT 115 N MI WEST-SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS.  THE DEPRESSION
STRENGTHENED AND BECAME A TROPICAL STORM LATER THAT DAY.  BARBARA

ABOUT 330 N MI SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO MEXICO.  THE DEPRESSION MOVED
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND REACHED TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER THAT
DAY ABOUT 425 N MI SOUTH OF CABO SAN LUCAS.  ITS PEAK INTENSITY OF
40 KT WAS REACHED LATE ON THE 13TH...AFTER WHICH COSME WAS WEAKENED
BY WIND SHEAR.  IT WEAKENED BACK TO A DEPRESSION LATE ON THE 14TH
ABOUT 400 N MI SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS...AND DISSIPATED EARLY ON
THE 15TH.

DALILA MOVED ON A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK AT FORWARD SPEEDS VARYING
FROM 5 TO 15 KNOTS FROM ITS FORMATION ON 21 JULY TO ITS DISSIPATION
ON THE 28TH.  THE TRACK PARALLELED THE PACIFIC COAST OF MEXICO.  THE
CENTER CAME WITHIN 150 N MI OF THE COAST FROM THE 22ND TO THE
24TH...AND A TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND HURRICANE WATCH WERE ISSUED
FOR PORTIONS OF MEXICO.  DALILA BRIEFLY BECAME A HURRICANE ON THE
24TH WHILE MOVING AWAY FROM THE MAINLAND.  DALILA PASSED DIRECTLY

WATER...WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ON THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER
...AND DISSIPATED ABOUT 200 N MI WEST OF CENTRAL BAJA CALIFORNIA ON
THE 2ND.  MOISTURE FROM FLOSSIE MOVED OVER SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA AND
