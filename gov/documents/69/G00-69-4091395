                              Data Requirements
          ________________________________________________________

   Accurate documentation and verification of Shuttle and payload
   design/configuration is critical to maintaining the high level of
   safety and mission success that is expected by the Shuttle Program.

   Each payload customer is required to submit data that is used to build
   products or perform analysis. The data is used to document
   configurations and operational requirements, and to perform analysis
   that ensures compatibility of payloads with the orbiter and with each
   other.

   This section describes the requirements for data submittals and
   documentation, and provides links to the applicable reference material.
   See the Payload Integration Flow section for more information on the
   products and the process for developing them.
