   The fundamental physics research program sponsors research that
   explores the physics governing matter, space, and time and that seeks
   to discover and understand the organizing principles of nature,
   including the emergence of complex structures. Pursuit of this research
   will not only expand understanding of our world and the universe, but
   will also lay the foundation for scientific breakthroughs of the
   future. In addition, as experiment instrumentation is developed that
   allows more sophisticated study of fundamental principles, these
   technologies are often transferred to use in other applications such as
   those related to medicine or computing capabilities.

   Research in this field conducted in microgravity allows scientists to
   test many basic principles of fundamental physics that have been either
   difficult or impossible to test accurately on Earth. For some types of
   experiments, longer observation periods are possible in microgravity;
   for others, the space environment provides isolation from disturbances,
   such as vibrations, or provides improved sample uniformity. For still
   others, microgravity is the only environment in which a particular
   phenomenon can be observed. The fundamental physics research program
   currently supports research in three areas: gravitational and
   relativistic physics, laser cooling and atomic physics, low temperature
   and condensed matter physics. A fourth research area, high-energy
   physics, is being considered for support in the future.
