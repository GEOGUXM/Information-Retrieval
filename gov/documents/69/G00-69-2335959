                          Information on Regulations

     The Department of Health Services (DHS) is in the process of
     building a website to display regulations proposed for public
     comment, as required by Government Code 11340.8. We expect that the
     web site will be operational by June 30, 2001.
     * To find out what public notices have been issued for all California
       agencies, including the Department, and what public comment periods
       are open, please go to the California Regulatory Notice Register.
       The URL is:
       http://www.osp.dgs.ca.gov/default.asp?mp=../Publications/crnr/crnr_
       toc.asp. This Register is published weekly, on Fridays. Please
       check each weeks edition for items of interest to you and your
       organization. This register contains a summary of each regulation
       package, who to contact for a copy, and other relevant information.
       It also contains notices of general public interest submitted by
       all state agencies, including DHS.

     * Requests for information regarding DHS regulation packages that are
       open and available for public comment may be directed to
       regulation@dhs.ca.gov, or call (916) 654-0381. Comments on proposed
       regulations also may be directed to this address, or faxed to (916)
       657-1459.

     * A business or person submitting a comment on a proposed regulation
       or proposed amendment or repeal of a regulation has the right to
       request a copy of the final statement of reasons. Please use the
       contacts in the paragraph above to request this information.

     * To view the text of regulations that are published in the
       California Code of Regulations (CCR), please go to ccr.oal.ca.gov.
       DHS regulations are typically found in Title 17 or Title 22 of the
       CCR.

     * To read about changes that take effect on January 1, 2001 to the
       Administrative Procedure Act (which governs how regulations are
       proposed, noticed, adopted, amended, and repealed), go to the
       Office of Administrative Laws homepage at www.oal.ca.gov.

     If you or your organization have questions regarding the
     implementation of a current programs regulations, please direct
     your inquiries to the specific program responsible; please go to the
     DHS home page and check under "Organization" for the program
     information you are seeking.
