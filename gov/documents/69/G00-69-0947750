         WASHINGTON, Jan. 18, 2002--The U.S. Department of Agriculture

   position tremendous experience in agriculture."

        Venosdel, from Elk Grove, Calf., has worked the past six years for
   the California Farm Bureau. His responsibilities included helping
   develop positions on federal legislation and regulations pertaining to
   farm programs, budget and taxation issues. Venosdel also developed a

   Science degree in agricultural business from California State
   University in Fresno.
