Science

   The Science Directorate at NASA's Marshall Center generates new
   scientific knowledge for the Nation and for NASA. Its goals include
   answering basic questions like "What's out there?", "Are we alone?",
   "How does the Earth work as a system?", and "What is the role of
   gravity in physical and biological processes?"

   The Directorate conducts science research with state-of-the-art
   resources, such as the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, ground-based
   telescopes, Earth-observing satellites, and the International Space
   Station. It also helps develop and construct these resources and
   peforms experimental and theoretical research for NASA. That research
   also helps Marshall do work for NASA focused on improving the quality
   of life in society.

   These assignments for NASA also include leading and participating in
   research that involves partnerships with schools, colleges,
   universities, businesses, and industries.

   Gathering new scientific knowledge is important to Marshall . But so is
   sharing that knowledge. That's why Marshall makes it a priority to
   share what it learns with the taxpayers, students, the general public
   and other scientists.

   Marshall invites you to explore further and learn more about its
   research.
