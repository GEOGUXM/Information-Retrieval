   FBI Chats began in August 2000 and has since developed into a weekly
   program run by the Office of Public and Congressional Affairs.
   Representatives from the FBI answer questions sent from the public via
   the Internet. The person or people answering questions are directly
   involved in work relating to the chat topic.

   Chats typically take place on Thursday afternoons, from 1 - 2 pm,
   Eastern Time. At the conclusion of a chat, its transcript is placed on
   the FBI Chats archive page where it can be reviewed or printed.
