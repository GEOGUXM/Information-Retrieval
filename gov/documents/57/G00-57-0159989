                             ABOUT the IMAGERS project

   Who

   This project is a collaborative project between NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center and USGS Biological Resources Division. The site will
   also be accessible through NBII- National Biological Information
   Infrastructure. Additional funding for the site is provided by MU-SPIN,
   through the Tennessee State University NRTS program.

   What

   The Adventure of Echo the Bat is a program with both online and
   classroom components. It teaches "understanding light" and the
   "electromagnetic spectrum" as a foundation for Remote Sensing. The unit
   on Remote Sensing includes the Adventure of Echo the Bat which is an
   interactive web site allowing students to follow Echo the Bat as he
   migrates through Arizona. The adventure offers a directed and
   investigative approach to how land features look from space, what the
   colors mean in a landsat image, and an introduction to identifying
   habitats in a false color landsat image. Students go on to identify
   features in other satellite images using both images off the web site
   and other textual resources. This is followed up by a unit on
   biodiversity covering topics such as food chains, food webs and the
   NatureMapping program. The site is supported with a teacher's guide
   that includes lesson plans, classroom activities, and reproducibles.
   The units can also be utilized outside the program as replacement units
   within a teacher's curriculum.

   Why

   The objectives are to teach fundamental concepts behind Remote Sensing
   and NatureMapping to students in Grades 5-8. This project led to the
   development of an interactive adventure using an interface comprised of
   satellite imagery. The characteristics of remotely sensed imagery
   present an optimal medium for referencing interdisciplinary content.
   The ADVENTURE OF ECHO THE BAT is an interactive adventure which brings
   together content relating to Biodiversity, Ecology, Remote Sensing, and
   the Electromagnetic Spectrum with supporting classroom activities.

   In order to reach students in the classroom setting, a guide was
   developed to help teachers use this content. The Teacher's Guide
   contains classroom activities and lesson plans that provide a structure
   to integrate the interactive adventure into the classroom. The lesson
   plans are organized according to the 5-E constructivist model. The
   activities introduce concepts basic to the understanding of remote
   sensing including understanding light and the introduction to the
   electromagnetic spectrum. The Adventure engages students in exploring
   concepts of remote sensing and biodiversity. After completing the
   Adventure, these concepts are reinforced back in the classroom with
   hands-on activities provided in the Teacher's Guide.

   When

   The Echo the Bat project started in May of 1997 and was completed in
   February 1998. Throughout 1998, numerous revisions and updates were
   made to the site as a result of pilot testing and peer review
   processes.

   The Pigeon Adventure is the second in this series and is set to begin
   development in January 2000. The program should be available for
   testing in Fall 2000.

   How
   The IMAGERS (Interactive Multimedia Adventures for Grade-school
   Education using Remote Sensing) project is developed upon a framework
   which allows for the incorporation of new content, geographic location,
   and storyline using satellite imagery as the foundation. The design
   process highlights the specifics about this site's development.


         Join Echo the Bat as he migrates through Arizona and learn about
       Arizona's diverse geography, wildlife and biomes. Go to The Adventure
