      Tips For Searching

      At its simplest, a query can be just a word or a phrase. But with the
      tips on this page, you can expand the focus of your query to give you
      more complete results. These tips will get you started with basic query
      language and acquaint you with the full power of Microsoft Index
      Server.
        * Look for words with the same prefix. For example, in your query
          form type key* to find key, keying, keyhole, keyboard, and so on.
        * Search for all forms of a word. For example, in the form type
          sink** to find sink, sinking, sank, and sunk.
        * Search with the keyword NEAR, rather than AND, for words close to
          each other. For example, both of these queries, system and manager
          and system near manager, look for the words system and manager on
          the same page. But with NEAR, the returned pages are ranked in
          order of proximity: The closer together the words are, the higher
          the rank of that page.
        * Refine your queries with the AND NOT keywords to exclude certain
          text from your search. For example, if you want to find all
          instances of surfing but not the Net, write the following query:
          surfing AND NOT the Net
        * Add the OR keyword to find all instances of either one word or
          another, for example:
          Abbott OR Costello
          This query finds all pages that mention Abbott or Costello or both.
        * Put quotation marks around keywords if you want Index Server to
          take them literally. For instance, if you type the following query:
          "system near manager"
          Index Server will literally look for the complete phrase system
          near manager. But if you type the same query without the quotation
          marks:
          system near manager
          Index Server searches all documents for the words system and
          manager.
        * Use Free Text Queries if you want to enter queries using natural
          language. Index Server will examine your query, extract nouns and
          noun phrases and construct a query for you. With free text queries
          you can enter any text you want, from a proper question, to a
          string of words and phrases, without worrying about the query
          language. For example, if you type in the following query:
          "How do I use the Index Server administration snap-in?"
          Index Server will create a query for you automatically and begin
          the search. Note that when you're using free text queries, the
          regular query language features are disabled and keywords such as
          AND, OR, and NEAR are interpreted as normal words.
