   [1.jpg] Washington is a place to discover the energy of sophisticated
   cities, and all the culinary, cultural and arts experiences for which
   Seattle and Tacoma are famous.

   But then what? We recommend you gear up and get out! Out into
   Washington's great outdoors, just like the locals do.

   Whether you prefer leisurely soft adventures or more high stakes
   thrills, Washington's variety gives you many options: the high desert,
   the rain forest, alpine wilderness, the inland waters of Puget Sound,
   pristine islands, famous mountains, rivers large or intimate, and much
   more.

   We can help rivet your story focus whether it's day tripping in forests
   on the [press_pass_sm.jpg] edge of Seattle or driving into the heart of
   Washington's wine or volcano country, taking a float plane out to the
   islands, or llama-trekking in the high country.

   You will find many useful resources for your preliminary research on
   this site. We are here to help make your work as a travel writer or
   journalist easier. Please review our specialized media services and
