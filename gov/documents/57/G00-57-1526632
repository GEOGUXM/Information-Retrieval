   THE TECHNICAL PROGRAM OF THE 28TH IEEE PHOTOVOLTAICS SPECIALISTS
   CONFERENCE

   The schedule of the Technical program is available through the links
   below. The program is divided into six areas as follows: 1. Silicon
   Devices and Materials; 2. II-VI Materials and Devices; 3. Amorphous and
   Nanostructured Devices; 4. Space Cells, Space Systems, and III-V
   Devices; 5. Terrestrial Modules and Balance of System Components; 6.
   Terrestrial Systems and Applications.

   The opening general plenary will have a paper from each of the six
   areas providing highlights of some of the most exciting recent results
   described in the context of a review of the current state-of-the-art in
   related technology. Plenary sessions are in the Cook Ballroom of the
   Egan Convention Center.

   The large number of quality submissions has necessitated the scheduling
   of three sessions in parallel, including both oral and poster formats.
   A new format in oral session replaces the Area Plenary Sessions used in
   previous PVSCs. Each session opens with an extended presentation to
   provide both background for subsequent speakers and the author's own
   results. The remaining oral presentations of the session are allocated
   15 minutes each including questions. This format allows oral
   presentation of approximately 40% of the papers. Oral sessions are in
   the Hilton Aleutian Ballroom and Denali Ballroom and the Cook Ballroom
   in the Egan Center.

   Poster sessions are scheduled to allow substantial time to discuss each
   presentation with the authors. Each session opens with brief oral
   previews (2 minutes each/3 overhead transparencies) by the authors.
   Poster Preview sessions are in the Egan Center Cook Ballroom and Summit
   Ballrooms. Following the oral poster previews the authors will be
   available at their poster in the Egan Center Summit Ballroom for
   one-to-one discussions. In order to facilitate mobility between
   sessions, the time schedule will be closely followed. Each paper in the
   program has been assigned a session and number corresponding to the six
   areas and numerical position in the published Conference Proceedings.

   follows. These events will be held in the Egan Center.
