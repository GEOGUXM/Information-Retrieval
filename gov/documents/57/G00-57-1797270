   OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE SECTION 301(H) REPORT TO CONGRESS January 23, 1996
   -- December 31, 1996 INTRODUCTION The Congressional Accountability Act
   (CAA) generally applies provisions of eleven federal labor and
   employment laws to over 20,000 covered congressional employees and
   employing offices. The CAA establishes the Office of Compliance
   (Office), an independent agency in the legislative branch of
   government, to administer and enforce the CAA and provide a process for
   speedy, confidential resolution of workplace disputes. Section 301(h)
   of the CAA requires that the Office of Compliance: "... compile and
   publish statistics on the use of the Office by covered employees,
   including the number and type of contacts made with the Office, on the
   reason for such contacts, on the number of covered employees who
   initiated proceedings with the Office under this Act and the result of
   such proceedings, and on the number of covered employees who filed a
   complaint, the basis for the complaint, and the action taken on the
   complaint." This first report provides the information for the period
   from January 23, 1996 through December 31, 1996. Future reports will be
   issued soon after the end of each calendar year, beginning in January
   1998. The report begins with a summary of the authority and
   responsibilities of the Office of Compliance. OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE
   AUTHORITY & RESPONSIBILITIES The CAA establishes the Office of
   Compliance with a Board of five members, who serve on a part-time
   basis, and four statutory appointees: the Executive Director, Deputy
   Executive Director for the Senate, Deputy Executive Director for the
   House, and the General Counsel. The Office is charged with providing
   alternative dispute resolution procedures, as well as adjudicative
   hearings and appeals, for covered legislative branch employees and
   education and information on the CAA to members of Congress, other
   employing offices, and employees of the legislative branch. The Board
   is required to adopt substantive regulations for implementation of
   certain provisions of the CAA. The Executive Director is required to
   adopt rules governing the procedures of the Office. The Office of the
   General Counsel enforces the provisions of sections 210 and 215,
   relating to health and safety and public access requirements, including
   investigation and prosecution of claims under these sections, and
   periodic inspections to ensure compliance. Additionally, the General
   Counsel investigates and prosecutes unfair labor practices under
   section 220 of the CAA. The CAA applies the rights and protections of
   provisions of the following eleven labor and employment statutes to
   covered employees within the legislative branch: title VII of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,
   title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the
   Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,
   the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Employee Polygraph Protection
   Act of 1988, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,
   chapter 43 of title 38 of the U.S. Code (relating to veterans'
   employment and reemployment), the Americans with Disabilities Act of
   1990 relating to public services and accommodations, the Occupational
   Safety and Health Act of 1970, and chapter 71 of title 5 of the U.S.
   Code (relating to federal service labor-management relations). On
   January 23, 1996, key provisions of the law took effect covering the
   House of Representatives, the Senate, the Capitol Guide Service, the
   Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the
   Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the
   Office of Compliance, and their employees. On October 1, 1996, section
   220, the labor management section of the CAA, took effect, as did the
   OSHA and ADA sections on January 1, 1997. USE OF THE OFFICE OF
   COMPLIANCE Section 301(h) of the Congressional Accountability Act
   mandates that the Office of Compliance: "... compile and publish
   statistics on the use of the Office by covered employees, including the
   number and type of contacts made with the Office, on the reason for
   such contacts, on the number of covered employees who initiated
   proceedings with the Office under this Act and the result of such
   proceedings, and on the number of covered employees who filed a
   complaint, the basis for the complaint, and the action taken on the
   complaint." The following statistics provide this data on the use of
   the Office by covered employees from January 23, 1996, when the CAA
   generally took effect, to December 31, 1996. (Given the statutory time
