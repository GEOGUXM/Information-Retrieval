   Geologic Map                     Topography of the US
                    Topographic Map
   Through computer processing and enhancement, we have brought together
   two existing images of the Nation's lower 48 states into a single
   digital tapestry. Woven into the fabric of this new map are data from
   previous U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps that depict the topography
   and geology of the United States. The resulting composite is the most
   detailed and accurate portrait of the U.S. land surface and the ages of
   its underlying rock formations yet displayed in the same image. The new
   map resembles traditional 3-D perspective drawings of landscapes with
   the addition of a fourth dimension, geologic time, which is shown in
   color. In mutually enhancing the landscape and its underlying temporal
   structure, this digital tapestry outlines the geologic story of
   continental collision and break-up, mountain-building, river erosion
   and deposition, ice-cap glaciation, volcanism, and other events and
   processes that have shaped the region over the last 2.6 billion years.
