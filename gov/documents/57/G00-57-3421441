      In the past, information regarding individual states were combined into
      monthly updates. These reports are still available by month/year.
      However, to make this site more user friendly, state updates will now
      posted by state (i.e. Oregon news articles, under Oregon, etc) We hope
      you find this new indexing method helpful.
