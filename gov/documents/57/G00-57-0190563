                             Business Financing

   Unfortunately VA does not have loans or grants for the startup or
   expansion of a small business. The Small Business Administration is the
   agency that has been tasked with helping small businesses, for which
   they have several loan programs established. You can learn more about
   the SBA program by logging onto the SBA site at http://www.sba.gov.
   You can acquire a listing of their preferred lenders at
   http://www.sba.gov/gopher/Local-Information/Certified-Preferred-Lenders
   /.
   Some states have micro loan programs that will help in the development
   of a new business venture. To find out if your state has a program you
   can contact the Small Business Development Centers in your state. They
   are usually affiliated with a university. The development centers can
   help you establish a business plan and will be aware of any of the
   state programs. You can acquire a listing of all the centers in our
   state by going to
   http://www.sba.gov/gopher/Local-Information/Small-Business-Development-
   Centers. Other sites you may find useful are:
