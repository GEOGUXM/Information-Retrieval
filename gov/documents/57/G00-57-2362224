   Since the 1970s, BPHC has supported and promoted the concept of
   school-based health centers. Healthy Schools, Healthy Communities
   (HSHC) was established in 1994 to encourage the development of new,
   comprehensive, full-time, school-based primary care programs that serve
   high risk children. It is the first Federal program to support the
   creation of school-based health centers. The BPHC continues to support
   school-based health centers as a significant vehicle to accomplish the
   BPHCÂ’s mission of Improving and Expanding Access to Health Care for all
   Americans Nationwide.
