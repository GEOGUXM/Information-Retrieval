   MEETINGS -- The Trustees' quarterly public briefings on the damage
   assessment and restoration planning process are typically held on the
   second Tuesday of each calendar quarter. The agendas for the public
   briefings consist of update reports for the injury and restoration
   activities of the past quarter and a question/answer session. There may
   be additional workshops and meetings during the course of the year.
   Those meetings will be posted here when they have been scheduled.
   Please contact DARC/NW for additional information.

   The schedule for the Year 2002 quarterly briefings is as follows:
     * January 8, 2002
     * April 9, 2002.
     * July 9, 2002
     * October 8, 2002

                         BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION

   Commencement Bay is the harbor for Tacoma, Washington, located at the
   southern end of Puget Sound. Beginning in the early 1900's, intertidal
   areas and tideflats of the Puyallup River delta were filled in and
   meandering streams were channelized, resulting in the present
   configuration of eight waterways (Hylebos, Blair, Sitcum, Milwaukee,
   St. Paul, Middle, Thea Foss, and Wheeler-Osgood) leading into the Bay.

   Industrial and commercial activities are located on or adjacent to each
   of the waterways, and include pulp and lumber mills, shipbuilding and
   ship repair facilities, shipping docks, marinas, chlorine and chemical
   production, concrete production, aluminum smelting, oil refining and
   food processing plants, automotive repair shops, railroad operations,
   and numerous other storage, transportation, and chemical manufacturing
   companies. Contaminants originate from both point and non-point
   sources. In all, a total of 763 drains (pipes), seeps, open channels
   and other point and non-point discharges have been identified, although
   only a fraction of the 400-odd storm drains that discharge to the Bay
   have been associated with sediment contamination (Commencement Bay
   Nearshore/Tideflats Record of Decision (ROD), EPA 1989).

   The nearshore area and waterways of Commencement Bay are used
   extensively as rearing and feeding habitat by numerous marine species,
   and the Bay itself serves as a migratory pathway for salmonids. Three
   hatcheries annually stock approximately four million chinook, coho, and
   chum salmon and steelhead trout juveniles into the Puyallup River
   watershed. Many fish species feed on small epibenthic and benthic
   organisms before migrating offshore. NOAA's concerns about the
   Commencement Bay area involve the adverse effects to its trust
   resources caused by the release of hazardous substances in the Bay and
   its waterways, with consequent contamination of sediments on the bottom
   of the Bay.

   EPA's ROD for the Nearshore/Tideflats Superfund Site treats each of the
   contaminated waterways as a distinct operable unit. EPA is addressing
   remedial action on a waterway-by- waterway basis, while the Trustees
   are addressing damage assessment and restoration on a Bay-wide basis.
   EPA has identified over 150 Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) for
   the Nearshore/Tideflats Superfund Site.

   In October 1991, the Trustees formally initiated the damage assessment
   and restoration planning process by issuing a Preassessment Screen,
   Determination to Perform Assessment, and Notice of Intent to Perform
   Assessment. Since that time the Trustees, occasionally in conjunction
   with several PRPs, have been compiling existing data, conducting
   studies of injuries to natural resources resulting from exposure to
   hazardous substances, and planning and carrying out projects to restore
   injured resources and habitats.
