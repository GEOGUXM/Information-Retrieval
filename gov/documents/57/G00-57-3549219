   The Everglades ecological system not only contributes to South
   Florida's water supply, flood control, and recreation, but serves as
   the habitat for diverse species of wildlife and plant life.  The system
   is unique in the world and one of Florida's great treasures.  The
   Everglades ecological system is endangered as a result of adverse
   changes in water quality, and in the quantity, distribution, and timing
   of flows, and, therefore, must be restored and protected."

   "The Everglades ecosystem must be restored both in terms of water
   quality and water quantity and must be preserved and protected in a
   manner that is long term and comprehensive."
