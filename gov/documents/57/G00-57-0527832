Residential Fire Sprinklers
     __________________________________________________________________

   In 1996, more than 3,000 people in the United States died due to fires
   in their homes. Residential fire sprinkler systems have proven
   themselves to be effective life safety systems. BFRL, with support from
   the U. S. Fire Administration, conducted experiments to quantify the
   effectiveness of residential sprinkler systems designed in accordance
   with NFPA 13D.

   An example of these experiments is the following comparison of a
   "living room" fire, with and without residential sprinklers. Two rooms,
   each 3.7m (12 ft) X 2.4m (8 ft) high, were built in the Large Fire
   Research Facility at NIST. Both of the "living rooms" were furnished
   with a sofa, love seat, end table, lamp and carpeting. Room A had a
   smoke detector installed and Room B had both a smoke detector and a
   residential sprinkler system. A match was used to ignite the sofa.
   Within 40 seconds after ignition, the smoke detectors in each room
   activated. The fires in both rooms continued to grow. At 85 seconds the
   residential sprinkler activated in Room B.

   As a result of the water spray from the sprinkler in Room B, the fire
   is suppressed and safe conditions are maintained. The fire in Room A
   continues to grow. Flash over occurs in Room A, 195 seconds after
   ignition, with temperatures exceeding 600 ^oC (1100 ^oF).

   Times are in seconds from ignition. Select a picture to view a larger
