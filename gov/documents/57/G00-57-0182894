           Washington Disadvantaged Students 'GEAR UP' for College

     Washington State has received a five-year, $15.6 million grant to
     help students from disadvantaged backgrounds attend college.  The
     grant, which was awarded by the U.S. Department of Education, will
     be administered by the Washington State Higher Education
     Coordinating Board, in partnership with the University of
     Washington.

     The new grant program, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
     Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), offers grants to states, school
     districts, or higher education institutions to increase enrollment
     of low-income students, who traditionally are less likely to pursue
     higher education.  Gov. Gary Locke personally asked the Secretary of
     Education to fund the Washington effort as another step in the
     state's comprehensive education reforms.
