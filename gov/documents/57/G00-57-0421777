Whitewashing Agriculture

                               [k9134-1i.jpg]
   Last year, Michael Glenn held the Big Apple in the palm of his hand . .
                    . and he was far from New York City.

        In the orchards of ARS' Appalachian Fruit Research Station in
      Kearneysville, West Virginia, the severe drought of 1999 revealed
      another advantage of covering apple and pear trees with a white,
    reflective film of specially processed kaolin, a type of clay. Empire
      apples harvested from treated trees were an average of 17 percent
   larger than fruit from trees left naked to withstand the heateven from
    trees that were irrigated. And there was no decline in the number of
                                   apples.

    Sekel pears reacted a little differently. The protected trees yielded
   twice as many pears as the naked treeswith no loss in fruit size, says
               Glenn, a soil scientist and plant physiologist.

                               [k9133-1i.jpg]
    On the West Coast, the stark-white particle film, now sold under the
     trade name Surround WP, prevents sunburn on apples and walnuts, he
                                    adds.

    Yes, fruit can suffer sunburn too, and the damaged areas are perfect
   places for rot organisms to multiply. So packers pay bottom dollar for
   produce with blemished skin or shells, or they reject it altogether. In
     studies here and in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New
    Zealand "the kaolin-based product has cut sunburn damage on apples in
                             half," Glenn says.

   That reduction gives growers an economic advantage, says Jim McFerson,
   manager of the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission. He notes that
    several Washington apple growers are using kaolin to prevent sunburn
     alone. In his collaborative studies with Glenn, the coating has not
     increased tree vigor or yield nor improved the color of the state's
                        apples as it has in the East.

                               [k9130-1i.jpg]
                                Cooler Crops

     As nomads crossing the desert wear white robes to reflect the sun's
     rays, trees wearing the specially processed kaolin coat reflect the
   heat-producing infrared wavelengths, as well as the burning ultraviolet
   rays. In fact, it's the ability to keep the tree cooler under a blazing
                          sun that increases yield.

      "The reflective kaolin helps to improve the tree's environment by
      reducing leaf temperature and heat stress," explains Glenn. As a
  result, the leaves keep their tiny portalsstomatesopen, allowing more
     carbon dioxide to enter. This gives the leaves more raw material to
                   photosynthesize into food for the tree.

   "The tree doesn't have to abort as much fruit, and there's more carbon
     for its own growth and maintenance," explains Glenn. The result: a
   healthier, happier tree that can support higher yields year after year.

                               [k9132-1i.jpg]
       In the Kearneysville orchards last summer, kaolin-coated trees
     photosynthesized up to 30 percent faster than uncoated trees, says
     Glenn. He measures the rate of photosynthesis by covering the whole
    tree with a clear balloon through which he forces air with a fan. His
     instruments read how much carbon dioxide enters the balloon at the
      bottom and how much exits the top. The difference is a measure of
                               photosynthesis.

   A multiyear drought ongoing in Israel has parched farmland, forcing the
    country to import fresh water from Turkey for irrigation. So Israeli
   horticulturist Amnon Erez, who recently retired from the Volcani Center
   in Bet-Dagan, spent 4 months in Kearneysville last year learning about
      the film's stress-reducing potential. Now back in Israel, Erez is
      overseeing a wide range of crop studies to demonstrate Surround's
    ability to help plants and trees thrive under extreme heat and water
                                   stress.

   "He had never seen anything that affects a tree's microclimate as much
   as Surround does," says Peter Barrows, project manager with Surround's
    producer, Engelhard Corporation of Iselin, New Jersey. Robin Matson,
     western field representative for Engelhard, says Surround improves
      color and raises the sugar content of Arizona-grown lemons, while
     preventing the trees from shutting down under the hot temperatures
   common in the Southwest. And Surround-coated grapes reach the desirable
     sugar contentknown as brixa little sooner than those left bare.

                             It All Began . . .

       About 8 years ago, while looking for a way to reduce the use of
      synthetic chemicals in orchards, Glenn conceived of using kaolin
    particles as a physical barrier that would repel insects and prevent
   disease organisms from digging in. He approached Engelhard, one of the
       largest producers of kaolin, about doing cooperative research.

    Among its many uses, kaolin gives paper its whiteness and is used in
    paint, pottery, and cosmetics. And it's safe to ingest. A tiny bit of
     kaolin is already in aspirin and some other tablets. (See "Particle
   Films: A New Kind of Plant Protectant," Agricultural Research, November
                              1998, pp. 16-19.)

   But agricultural uses were uncharted waters. Early studies by Glenn and
      ARS entomologist Gary J. Puterka showed that the physical barrier
    controlled insect damage well. The type of kaolin Glenn had selected
      for the studies transmitted visible light and gases necessary for
   photosynthesis while reflecting ultraviolet and infrared bands. But the
    film was difficult to spray on the trees because it didn't suspend in
      water. So Engelhard, under a cooperative research and development
      agreement with ARS, removed the waterproofing additive, improving
      kaolin's ability to mix with water. What's more, leaving out the
             additive dramatically cut the cost of the product.

         That started what may prove to be one of the most versatile
     agricultural products ever to hit the market (see box on page 17).
     Surround Crop Protectant went commercial in 1999. This year it was
      upgraded to a wettable powder formulation called Surround WP Crop
                                 Protectant.

   Barrows says Engelhard priced the product to compete with insecticides.
      Since it is a physical barrier, it must be reapplied to cover new
      growth or after a heavy rain, he says. The cost of three to four
      applications of Surround is about equal to one application of the
              insecticide pear growers use against pear psylla.

        It was this tiny but devastating insect that boosted Surround
      commercially last year. "We had intended to have a year of trial
    usage," says Barrows. But entomologists found pockets of insecticide
   resistance. "When it became known that Surround controlled pear psylla
       as well as it does, we had to make and ship a lot more than we
                                anticipated."

    Glenn stresses that "specially formulated kaolin has the potential to
   greatly reduce pesticide use on conventionally grown crops. The Organic
     Materials Review Institute has listed Surround WP for organic food
                                production."

                     Insects Don't Like Biting the Dust

     After several years of testing, the product is proving its prowess
   against all shapes and sizes of insects. The white leaves keep insects
   from recognizing their favorite hosts, and the tiny particles ensure a
   lack of hospitality. Just as people don't like climbing into a bed full
    of sand, insects don't like crawling on a plant or tree covered with
      kaolin. It sticks to their wings, legs, and mouth parts, so they
    quickly leave to find a more comfortable place to feed and lay eggs.

      In studies around the country, codling moths, apple maggots, plum
   curculio, leafhoppers, Japanese beetles, rose chafer, thrips, and rust
   mitesnot to mention pear psyllahave fled whitewashed crops in search
   of greener pastures. Even glassy-winged sharpshootersthe transmitter
   of Pierce's disease, which threatens to devastate southern California's
    grape vineyardsavoid kaolin-treated lemon trees. And early results
           suggest they'll stay away from treated grapevines too.

    ARS' Puterka says the specially formulated kaolin particles "have the
    potential to work against almost any insect. The key is getting good
     coverage of the crop. If you can get it to stick and stay, it will
      control most insects." One crop that has failed the stick test is
    cabbage, so Surround doesn't control cabbage loopers and other worms.
   And because it's eventually washed off all crops by rain, areas of low
        rainfall are most adaptable to this technology, Puterka adds.

      Don Gallagher of Gallagher Vineyards in Manteca, California, was
     pleased with the early results of Surround on 12 of his 57 rows of
   grapes. "When I put it on, there were a lot of mealybugs on the vines.
     But I can't find one of them now. I don't know where they've gone."
            Gallagher did, however, find a couple of mealybugs on
   insecticide-treated vines, he says, noting that he's finding a similar
                    pattern for leafhoppers on the crop.

   Jay Brunner, professor of entomology at Washington State University in
    Wenatchee, is looking at Surround's clout against insect pests of the
    state's apple orchards. His results have been mixed. "It's as good as
    many selective insecticides for controlling Lacanobia fruit worms and
    leafrollers," he says. But it proved only fair for codling moths and
      variable for stinkbugs. Plus, it seems to interfere with helpful
     parasitic insects that hang around the orchard and keep leafminers
                        under control, Brunner adds.

    In insect control, as in comedy, timing is everything. So Brunner and
     other entomologists are working to determine the optimum timing and
     application rates to control specific pests without disrupting the
    biological control of others. "I think Surround will have a place in
     certain pest-management programs where growers are trying to avoid
                         pesticides," says Brunner.

    Todd DeKryger, agricultural research specialist with Gerber Products
     Company in Fremont, Michigan, sees potential for Surround to fit in
   with conventional methods to control specific pests on specific crops.
       "It eliminates residues of conventional pesticides and helps us
            maintain a stable supply of produce," says DeKryger.

   This year, Gerber growers are trying it on pears, apples, peaches, and
      carrots. DeKryger says it appears to work better in the dry West
   because more of the film stays on the foliage. "The jury's still out on
   its feasibility east of the Rockies," he says, noting that May 2000 was
                   the wettest May on record in Michigan.

                             Fungi Dodge It, Too

    While the potential for insect control got brighter, the outlook for
     controlling orchard diseases didn't look very promising . . . until
    last summer. After some trial and error, Glenn believes he has hit on
    the right formula by adding other minerals to Surround. The minerals
   make the film more alkaline (raise the pH), he says, and that seems to
                       prevent fungi from taking hold.

    In the middle of July, Glenn's untreated apple leaves were contorted
    under the stress of powdery mildew infection. Not so with the treated
   trees. Leaves lay flat and looked healthy. And 90 to 95 percent of the
      fruit were disease free. The mixture also controlled apple scab.

      "We still get the same insect control," says Glenn. "The mineral
                     combination adds a new dimension."

                        And That's Only the Beginning

      Uses for kaolin films don't end here. Glenn and Puterka also see
   kaolin's potential as a carrier for just about any chemical used on the
  farmpesticide, fungicide, herbicide, pheromoneyou name it. "It can be
    used as a matrix to hold chemicals on the plant or soil and get more
   even distribution," Puterka says. Such improved delivery would benefit
      the environment, farm workers, and consumers. "You may be able to
      reduce the active ingredient by 50 percent or more," he says. The
     latest patent application jointly filed by ARS and Engelhard covers
                             this use of kaolin.

     A water-repelling kaolin formula may have other applications. Tests
    show that this hydrophobic film protects tender plants and trees from
   frost damage. Normally, when the temperature drops below freezing, ice
     crystals forming on a wet leaf penetrate the surface and freeze the
   leaf tissue. Frost damage can cost U.S. growers hundreds of millions of
                              dollars annually.

   But the waterproof kaolin keeps water from direct contact with the leaf
   surface. And it makes water bead up, which further reduces the surface
        area of the droplet resting on the leaf, says ARS' Michael E.
     Wisniewski, a plant physiologist at Kearneysville. In his tests in
     environmental chambers, kaolin-treated tomato and bean plants have
   withstood temperatures as low as 21°F (-6°C). They normally die when
                   the thermometer drops to 28°F (-2°C).

        Wisniewski says Mick Fuller, professor of horticulture at the
      University of Plymouth in England, is getting similar results on
    citrus, potato, and grape plants in his environmental chambers. "His
         findings are particularly impressive for citrus," he adds.

    In addition, other researchers are beginning to look at the potential
    of kaolin-based products to address several other needsagricultural
   and otherwise. Kaolin's agricultural uses "have opened a whole new area
      of science," says Puterka. So far, they have spawned four patents
    jointly owned by ARS and Engelhard Corporation, and five more patent
    applications are either pending or being prepared.By Judy McBride,
