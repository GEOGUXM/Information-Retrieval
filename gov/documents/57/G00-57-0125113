The XMM-Newton Observatory

   A project of the European Space Agency XMM-Newton, the X-ray
   Multi-Mirror Mission, is the second cornerstone of the Horizon 2000
   program of the European Space Agency (ESA). XMM-Newton was launched on
   December 10 1999 at 14:32 GMT (09:32 EST). The observatory consists of
   three coaligned high throughput 7.5m focal length telescopes with 6 arc
   second FWHM (15 arc second HPD) angular resolution.

   XMM-Newton will provide images over a 30 arc minute field of view with
   moderate spectral resolution using the European Photon Imaging Camera
   (EPIC), which consists of two MOS and one PN CCD arrays.
   High-resolution spectral information (E/dE~300) is provided by the
   Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) that deflects half of the beam on
   two of the X-ray telescopes. The observatory also has a coaligned 30cm
   optical/UV telescope called the Optical Monitor (OM). More detailed
   information on the instruments can be found under Focal Plane
   Instrumentation in these pages and in the XMM-Newton Users' Handbook
   (GSFC or VILSPA links).

   Participation by U.S. astronomers in the XMM-Newton guest-observer
   program is welcomed and supported by the Guest Observer Facility (GOF)
   at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The GOF provides a
   clearing house for project-generated technical information and analysis
   software as well as user and proposal support on the U.S. side of the
   Atlantic.
