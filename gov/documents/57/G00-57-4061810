   State applauds Qwest's plan to withdraw from sharing customers' private
   information
   OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Officials of the Washington Utilities and
   Transportation Commission (WUTC) expressed satisfaction on hearing that
   Qwest is ending its attempt to share and sell its customers' account
   information. The three-member commission had earlier sent Qwest a
   sharply worded letter criticizing the phone company's actions and its
   inadequate notice to customers. See Privacy page for more history and
   information.
   "I'm glad Qwest has decided to do the right thing," said Chairwoman
   Marilyn Showalter. "Customers expect that sensitive information, such
   as the phone numbers they call, will not be released to anyone without
   their express permission. I also think Qwest is doing the right thing
   for itself, by reversing a position that was becoming a public
   relations nightmare."
   Qwest had successfully challenged in federal court a federal rule,
   similar to a state rule, that required customers to provide express
   permission ("opt in") before a telecommunications company could share
   customer account information. As a result, the federal rule was
   temporarily modified to allow the information to be shared unless the
   customer expresses an objection ("opt out"). The state commission had
   indicated that it, too, would have to re-examine its rule, in light of
   the court decision.
   "We still need to look at our rule and make sure it can withstand a
   court challenge, since our rule applies to more than just Qwest," said
   Commissioner Dick Hemstad. "Also, even Qwest is giving no guarantees
   past the FCC's adoption of its final rule. We don't know what the FCC
   will ultimately do, so we need to review the extent of our own state
   authority." Verizon, the state's second largest local
   telecommunications provider, has issued "opt-out" notices similar to
   Qwest's in all states except Washington and Oregon.
   The commission had already undertaken two public meetings, gathering
   public comments on the "opt-in" and "opt-out" approaches, and on
   appropriate notice requirements. "It's clear to me that citizens feel
   very passionately about protecting the privacy of information held by
   the phone company," said Commissioner Patrick Oshie. "They want control
   over whether this information is used, and they want to understand what
   information is at stake and what the phone company is proposing to do
   with it."
   The commission held two public meetings last week in Bothell and Fife
   to listen to the public's views on the phone companies' plans to use
   and distribute a customers' personal account information. The WUTC has
   received more than 600 e-mails, telephone calls, and letters from the
   public on the subject in the last three weeks â€” an indication of a very
   high level of interest.
   Denver-based Qwest is the largest local phone provider in the state,
   serving about eight of 10 residential and business customers. Qwest
   serves Seattle, Bellevue, Issaquah, Auburn, Kent, Vancouver, Tacoma,
   Spokane, Moses Lake, Yakima, Walla Walla and Olympia.
