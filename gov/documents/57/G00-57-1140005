   *1.    Introduction. Public Service Awards (exhibit I-80-1) are made to
   provide suitable recognition for individuals (other than National
   Weather Service (NWS) employees) or organizations who have rendered a
   notable public service to the NWS or others. This chapter contains the
   basic instructions concerning this awards program.

   1.1    Relationship to Other Awards. The instructions in this chapter
   pertain only to the Public Service Award shown in exhibit I-80-1. Other
   types of public service awards are described elsewhere.

   organizations are eligible for an award when, in the judgment of NWS
   officials, their actions have assisted the NWS in fulfilling its
   responsibility for public safety in weather services. The action must
   have a relationship to weather or be weather-oriented. Examples of
   actions for which this award could be conferred are:

                             DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

       b.     Unusual courage or competence in an emergency.

       c.     Extremely competent performance in presenting NWS forecasts,
   warnings, and other weather or hydrological information to the public
   over an appropriate period of time. This item is applicable to radio,
   television announcers, and newsmen, as well as to broadcasting stations
   or newspapers.

       d.     Timely and/or unusual action in furnishing severe weather
   and flood reports to the NWS, community warning center, law enforcement
   agency, or other appropriate mass dissemination media.

       e.     Actions which result in saving of life or property.

       f.     Outstanding efforts in promoting community preparedness
   planning.

       g.     Consistent or unusual service rendered to a local weather
   service office or the NWS in general.

       h.     Any other service of equivalent significance.

   *3.    Nominations for Public Service Awards. Nominations for Public
   Service Awards are normally made by the MIC/OIC in whose county area of
   responsibility the service action occurred or by the HIC for his
   hydrologic area of responsibility. However, nominations may be
   submitted by any NWS employee through the appropriate MIC/OIC/HIC.

   *3.1    Data Required in Nominations. Nominations for awards include
   the following information:

       a.     Name and mailing address of nominee. Extra special care is
   to be taken to provide the correct spelling for the letter and
   certificate and proper mailing information. For organizations, include
   the name of the owner or manager who will accept the award for the
   organization.

       b.     Description of the outstanding accomplishment and how it
   exceeds normal performance. Documentary evidence, such as letters of
   commendation from other agencies, individuals, or organizations and
   newspaper clippings, is to be included. Since a letter of commendation
   and press releases are prepared from this information, it must be as
   accurate and complete as possible.

       c. Endorsement of nomination. Submission of the nomination by the
   MIC/OIC/HIC infers endorsement. However, if the nomination is submitted
   by an NWS employee, the MIC/OIC/HIC adds an endorsement or appropriate
   comments. With a negative endorsement by the MIC/OIC/HIC, the
   nomination is returned to the NWS employee for revisions, additional
   documentary evidence, or with reasons for rejection on the merits of
   the ease.

   *3.2    Forwarding of Nominations. Award nominations are forwarded to
   the appropriate regional headquarters. If originated at a WSO, the
   appropriate WSFO is sent an information copy of the nomination.

   *3.3    Regional Headquarters Actions. Upon receipt of the nomination,
   regional headquarters reviews and processes the nomination in the
   following manner:

       a.     If the Regional Director concurs with the nomination, a
   draft letter of commendation is prepared for signature of the Director,
   NWS. The letter of commendation must be as brief as possible, yet
   contain .sufficient information to describe the service rendered
   (exhibit I-80-2).

       b.     The letter of commendation, substantiating information, and
   regional headquarters' endorsement is sent to the Chief, Community
   Preparedness Staff, National Weather Service Headquarters, (Wx5).

       c.     If the regional headquarters doesn't concur with the
   nomination, it's returned to the originator along with the reasons for
   rejection. No information need be sent to NWS Headquarters on such
   cases.

   *3 4    National Weather Service Headquarters Procedures. The Chief,
   Community Preparedness Staff, coordinates approvals of the awards with
   other appropriate Headquarters offices or divisions and also with NOAA
   Office of Public Affairs, to determine whether nationwide publicity of
   noteworthy cases is required. When fully coordinated, the approval and
   signature of the Director, NWS, is obtained on the letter and
   certificate and then returned to the regional headquarters for
   presentation.

   If National Weather Service Headquarters doesn't concur with the
   recommendation, all the information received is returned to the
   regional headquarters along with the reason(s) for its rejection.

   3.5    Press Releases and Press Notifications. Further coordination
   with regional headquarters staff as well as with NOAA Office of Public.

   Mr. Don Neville, Radio Officer
   Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)
   209 Longwood Drive SW
   Huntsville, Alabama 35801 (SAMPLE)

   Dear Mr. Neville:

   The importance of the role RACES played in communicating essential
   information during the April 3, 1974, outbreak of tornadoes cannot be
   over-estimated and is very deserving of special recognition. By working
   from the Huntsville Weather Office and gathering reports from fellow
   radio operators in north Alabama, RACES made a real contribution to
   holding down loss of life during this disaster.

   These fine efforts and your continuing service to the public have been
   brought to my attention by the National Weather Service's Southern
   Region. In recognition of this work, I'm pleased to present RACES the
   National Weather Service's Public Service Award.

   Sincerely,

   /s/

   (type name)
   Director, National Weather Service

   Affairs is necessary if national publicity is planned or when
   headquarters presentation is appropriate. Distribution of any
   nationwide press release coincides with the presentation of the Public
   Service Award and is coordinated with the appropriate regional
   headquarters. All other publicity releases are prepared by regional
   headquarters.

   4.    Presentation of Award. Usually, the presentation is made by the
   MIC/OIC/HIC in whose area the service act occurred. If deemed
   advisable, a regional headquarters representative makes the
   presentation or attends the ceremony.

   Presentation of the award is made as soon as possible after the event
   for which the award is given. Where feasible, presentation is made
   before some local civic group with invitations extended to the news
   media to attend. Press releases are distributed to all news media in
   the area.
