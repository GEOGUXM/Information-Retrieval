   Light is scattered and attenuated by molecules, aerosols (dust), and
   cloud (water or ice) particles in the atmosphere. The sky can be clear
   and blue or hazy and white. Red sunsets are a beautiful manifestation
   of the scattering and attenuation of sunlight. Clouds can appear white,
   grey, or dark depending on conditions. The rainbow and ice-particle
   displays like sundogs and light pillars are less frequent. Light
   scattering and attenuation can be used to investigate the atmosphere
   using a remote-sensing instrument called a lidar.

   A lidar system uses laser pulses to measure atmospheric constituents
   such as aerosol particles, ice crystals, water vapor, or trace gases
   (e.g. ozone). Profiles of these atmospheric components as a function of
   altitude or location are necessary for weather forecasting, climate
   modeling, and environmental monitoring.

   lidarpic200.gif - 10.10 K A lidar transmits short pulses of laser light
   into the atmosphere. The laser beam loses light to scattering as it
   travels. At each range, some of the light is backscattered into a
   detector. [Fig. 1a] Because the light takes longer to return from the
   more distant ranges, the time delay of the return pulses can be
   converted to the corresponding distance between the atmospheric
   scatterer and the lidar. The end result is a profile of atmospheric
   scattering versus distance. [Fig. 1b] Analysis of this signal can yield
   information about the distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere. The
   amount of backscatter indicates the density of the scatters. This can
   be used to measure cloud base height or track plumes of pollution.

   Other properties of the atmosphere can also be deduced from the lidar
   return signals. A frequency shift in the light because of the Doppler
   effect permits measurement of wind speeds. By detecting the amount of
   depolarization, one can discriminate between liquid droplets and
   nonspherical ice particles. Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) uses
   absorption, as evidenced by reduced backscatter from greater distances,
   to measure the concentration of atmospheric gases. A Raman lidar
   detects particular atmospheric components (such as water vapor) by
   measuring the wavelength-shifted return from selected molecules.
