   RECITALS WHEREAS, on July 21, 1998, the AHERF Estates commenced
   bankruptcy reorganization proceedings subsequently consolidated under
   the caption In re AHERF, Bankruptcy Case No. 98-25773 MBM through
   98-25777, before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western
   District of Pennsylvania (the "Bankruptcy Court") and the United States
   District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the "District
   Court"); CO-1086785v38 5 WHEREAS, the Committee and the Trustee were
   subsequently appointed in connection with these consolidated actions;
   WHEREAS, SDN is a company formed by certain of AHERF's former officers;
   WHEREAS, claims or potential claims have been asserted by the Trustee,
   the Committee or other Settling Claimants against the Settling
   Directors and Officers, Mellon and/or the Settling Insurers; WHEREAS,
   the Settling Directors and Officers and Mellon have denied liability in
   connection with these claims or potential claims; WHEREAS, the Settling
   Insurers have either denied coverage or reserved rights to deny
   coverage in connection with these claims or potential claims; WHEREAS,
   the Settling Insurers have either raised or have reserved the right to
   raise rescission and other coverage defenses in connection with the
   AHERF Policies (as that term is defined in Section 3.a below); WHEREAS,
   in addition to the Settling Parties, there are other trustees,
   directors, officers and employees of the AHERF Entities and the AGH
   Entities and other organizations and individuals who may fall within
   the definition of "insured persons" under the AHERF Policies, who have
   not been named in any claims, but whose coverage may be affected by
   this settlement; WHEREAS, the litigation of these claims or potential
   claims and of insurance issues related to those claims or potential
   claims would involve numerous complex issues of fact or law, the
   outcome of which is uncertain; WHEREAS, the policy limits in each of
   the AHERF Policies are reduced by payments by the Settling Insurers of
   defense costs and the tremendous costs of continued litigation of these
   claims in these highly complex cases threatens to exhaust all insurance
   policy limits without regard to payment of claims; WHEREAS, the
   Settling Parties desire to settle these disputes in the manner set
   forth herein to avoid the substantial costs, risks and uncertainties of
   litigation; WHEREAS, this settlement affords significant benefits to
   the Settling Parties and certain individuals and entities receiving
   releases, including the Additional Releasors/Releasees, as that term is
   defined in Section 4.j, below; WHEREAS, the Settling Parties desire to
   liquidate any future coverage obligations under the AHERF Policies and,
   with respect only to AHERF Claims (as that term is defined in Section
   3.c below), under any Ancillary Policies (as that term is defined in
   Section 3.d below); CO-1086785v38 6 WHEREAS, nothing in this Settlement
   Agreement shall be deemed to limit or to impair any rights, claims or
   defenses that the Settling Insurers, the Mellon Companies or Cahouet
   may have under or in connection with any policies of insurance issued
   to any of the Mellon Companies; WHEREAS, the AHERF Entities and the AGH
   Entities provided certain protection for officers, directors, trustees
   and others in the form of insurance and corporate indemnification in
   connection with their service on behalf of the AHERF Entities and the
   AGH Entities, the exact scope and nature of which was a subject of
   dispute among the parties; WHEREAS, the Settling Parties recognize that
   the payments contemplated by this Settlement Agreement can only be
   achieved through a settlement that affords continued protection to the
   Settling Directors and Officers, the Mellon Companies, the AGH
   Entities, and the Settling Insurer Companies for costs that might
   otherwise accrue in the future in connection with AHERF Claims or the
   Settled Policies (as that term is defined in Section 3.e); WHEREAS,
   achieving such a resolution depends upon obtaining appropriate orders
   from both the District Court and Bankruptcy Court to carry out the
   purposes of this Settlement Agreement; WHEREAS, the affected parties
   wish to preserve certain claims as specified in this Settlement
   Agreement, including but not limited to the Claims identified on
   Schedule 5B; and WHEREAS, all Settling Parties acknowledge that the
   amounts paid pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, and its terms and
   conditions, including but not limited to, the releases exchanged
   pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, are part of a global resolution
   of complex legal and factual issues, the outcomes of which are
   uncertain, and constitute good and valuable consideration for this
   Settlement Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
   and the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, and for
   other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
   all of which consideration are hereby acknowledged and agreed by each

   Effective Date has occurred, and, if such petition is filed, nothing
   herein shall prevent any Settling Party from objecting to the entry of

   dollar the obligation of the Settling Insurers under the AHERF
   Policies, and such advancements will be made without prejudice to any
   of the Settling Insurers' rights with respect to coverage under the
   AHERF Policies or applicable law. b. The Settling Parties recognize and
   agree that the Committee Settlement Amount (as that term is defined in

   Burstein defendants that are made in the same action or a related
   indemnity or contribution action, and based on the same nucleus of

   Each of the Settling Insurers, each of the Settling Directors and
   Officers, Mellon, the Committee and the Trustee acknowledges that each
   is aware of the effort to develop the list of pending lawsuits
   identified on Schedule 3.b(ii), which is intended to contain all known
   pending lawsuits that are AHERF Claims against an AHERF Insured, and
   any pending lawsuits against any Settling Insurer that would be
   encompassed by Section 8, including but not limited to lawsuits
   asserting bad faith or other improper handling of Claims. Each of the
   Settling Insurers, each of the Settling Directors and Officers, Mellon,
   the Committee and the Trustee, respectively, represents and warrants
   that, in responding to this effort, he/she or, in the case of a
   corporate entity, the person(s) who responded to this effort on its
   behalf, in identifying pending lawsuits against or by him/her/it for
   this list has not intentionally withheld the identity of any such
   lawsuit from any Settling Party that would be obligated to provide
   indemnity for such lawsuits in accordance with this Settlement
   Agreement and that is reasonably unaware of the identity of any such
   pending lawsuit. With respect to the Settling Insurers, Mellon, and the

   determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction over disputes arising
   from this Settlement Agreement to have intentionally breached such
   representation and warranty, provided that the failure to conduct any
   inquiry or investigation shall not constitute a breach of this
   representation or warranty, such Settling Party in breach shall be

   existence of the lawsuit for the hold harmless obligations incurred or
   loss suffered by that Settling Party because of the failure to disclose

   indemnification for that undisclosed Claim under Section 7 if such

   Pennsylvania Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, 1951, July 19,
   P.L. 1130, as re- enacted by the Act of 1976, July 9, P.L. 586 (42 P.A.
   C.S.A. §§8321 et seq.) (the "UCATA"), and without limiting the scope of
   the releases identified in Sections 4.i(i) and 4.i(ii), it is the
   intent of the Trustee, the Committee and the AGH Affiliates that the
   releases set forth in this Section 4.i as between each other shall and
   do provide the broadest possible releases permitted by law and that
   such releases are specifically intended to be joint tortfeasor
   releases, pursuant to the UCATA and the Pennsylvania Comparative
   Negligence Act, 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 7102 (the "CNA"). As such, in the event
   that any AGH Affiliate is determined to be a joint tortfeasor under the
   laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with respect to any Settled
   Policy Claim and/or any AHERF Claim initiated, maintained or prosecuted
   by the Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be, whether following
   joinder as a third-party defendant in such action or otherwise, then
   there shall be a reduction in any judgment or award in favor of the
   Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be, in such Claim or action
   to the extent of either (A) the total pro-rata share of liability of
   the AGH Affiliate to the Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be,
   in such Claim or action, or (B) the total share of liability of the AGH
   Affiliate to the Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be, in such
   Claim or action determined pursuant to the UCATA and/or the CNA,
   whichever is the least amount required to extinguish any such Claims
   against the AGH Affiliate by any defendant in such Claim or action that
   both (1) arise from the same transactions or occurrences or common
   nucleus of operative facts as such Claim or action and (2) seek to
   allocate, apportion to or recover from the AGH Affiliate some or all of
   the liability to the Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be, in
   such Claim or action, whether or not such Claim or action seeks
   contribution and/or indemnity under the UCATA, the CNA, or otherwise
   (hereinafter an "AGH Covered Claim"). The releases provided in Sections
   4.i(i), 4.i(iii) and 4.i(iv) (collectively, the "AGH Joint Tortfeasor
   Release") are expressly intended and shall be construed to release and
   protect the AGH Affiliates from all such AGH Covered Claims and to
   require that each of the Committee or the Trustee, as the case may be,
   shall reduce any judgment or award obtained in any such AGH Covered
   Claim by the minimum amount necessary to ensure that, subject to
   Section 4.i(viii) below, no AGH Affiliate shall have any obligation to
   pay any amount to any person on account of such judgment or award. This
   provision in no way constitutes an admission of liability by any AGH
   Affiliate. (iv) It is further agreed that if the UCATA does not apply
   in any AGH Covered Claim and the CNA does apply, then if any AGH
   Affiliate and any CO-1086785v38 34 other defendant in such action are
   adjudged jointly liable, in whole or in part, for damages in that
   action, this AGH Joint Tortfeasor Release shall operate to satisfy all
   liabil
