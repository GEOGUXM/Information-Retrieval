   EHR Mission:

   The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) is responsible
   for the health and continued vitality of the Nation's science,
   mathematics, engineering, and technology education and for providing
   leadership in the effort to improve education in these areas. EHR has
   five major long-term goals.
     * To help ensure that a high quality school education in science is
       available to every child in the United States and that it is
       sufficient to enable those who are interested, to pursue technical
       careers at all levels, as well as to provide a base for
       understanding by all citizens.
     * To help ensure that the educational pipelines that carry all
       students to careers in science, mathematics, and engineering yield
       numbers of adequately educated individuals who can meet the needs
       of the U.S. technical workplace.
     * To help ensure that those who select a career in a science or
       engineering discipline have available the best professional
       undergraduate and graduate education and that opportunities are
       available at the college level for interested nonspecialists to
       broaden their scientific backgrounds.
     * To encourage the development of a cadre of professionally educated
       and trained teachers to ensure excellence in school education for
       every student and learner.
     * To support informal science education programs and to maintain
       public interest in and awareness of scientific and technological
       developments.

   These goals provide the focus for the various activities of the
   directorate's seven divisions and offices.
