             NIMH Genetics Research Branch (GRB) Grant Portfolio

   A listing of the principal investigators, abstracts, and budgets for
   research projects and programs suported by the GRB can be obtained from
   the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP)
   biomedical database system.

   The CRISP database is updated weekly. Retrieval of scientific
   information for each project is made available by project title,
   principal investigator's abstract, and term descriptors assigned by the
   NIH Center for Scientific Reviews (CSR). Thus, it is not possible to
   select only GRB-supported grants. A search of the Gopher index for the
   keyword "genetic" will display NIH-funded grants with this specified as
   a keyword or mentioned in the title or abstract. Multiple keywords may
   be specified, e.g., "genetic AND autism".
