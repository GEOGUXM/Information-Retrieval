     2001 here.


     The Muon (g-2) Experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory  is
     stringently testing the Standard Model by measuring the Anomalous
     Magnetic Moment of the Muon to unprecedented precision.

     The experiment is run by an international collaboration of more than
     60 physicists from 13 institutes in the United States, Germany,
     Russia and Japan.
