     The 11th International Snow Science Workshop (ISSW'98) was held in
                    Sunriver, Oregon in the Fall of 1998.

   Registration and opening night presentation began on Sunday, September
   27, with four days of presentations and posters running from September
   28-October 1 (Monday-Thursday). As in the past, the focus of the
   workshop was on "A Merging of Theory and Practice", with a variety of
   snow science topics shared between field practitioners and researchers.
   A full slate of social events was also enjoyed by participants,
   including a gala banquet on Wednesday night, September 30  (Ed
   LaChapelle and Norm Wilson combined forces for an entertaining keynote
   address), an optional Field trip to nearby Mt. Hood and Timberline
   Lodge, and the first ever ISSW Golf Tournament.  Also, a slide & video
   night was enjoyed by many in attendance Tuesday evening, September
   29...with many participants bringing and sharing interesting videos or
   slides.

   Spectacular scenery and abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation
   surrounded the Sunriver Resort and Conference Center with rolling
   meadows and the Deschutes River just outside the workshop door, and
   several volcanic peaks of the nearby Cascade Range within easy reach.
   Participants enjoyed biking, running, hiking, roller blading, climbing
   (at nearby Smith Rocks), tennis, canoeing and kayaking, just to name a
   few activities.  Camping was also available at several sites within the
   Deschutes National Forest (541-388-2715)
