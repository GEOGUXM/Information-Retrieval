                           Weaving Common Threads

   [tribe_wkshp1.jpg] Native Ways of Learning joined with contemporary
   science research as educators and others from more than a dozen U.S.
   Tribal Colleges engaged in a science education session this month
   hosted by Northern Arizona University, Haskall Indian Nations
   University, and The GLOBE Program.

   The sessions were titled "Weaving Common Threads" to reflect both the
   native ways of learning of various Tribes and the GLOBE science and
   education protocols now used by thousands of schools across the country
   and on all seven continents. [tribe_wkshp2.jpg] The colleges' intent is
   to incorporate GLOBE science education into their training of K-12
   teachers.

   Colleges represented include Stone Child, Dine'-Shiprock, Little Big
   Horn, Salish Kootenai, Dull Knife, Blackfeet Community, Fort Peck, and
   Fort Belknap Colleges of Montana; Crownpoint Institute of Technology of
   New Mexico, Haskell Indian Nations University of Kansas, and White
   Earth Tribal & Community College of Minnesota. The Challenger Learning
   Center of Alaska, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, the Institute of
   Tribal Environmental Professionals at NAU, and the Hawaii Department of
   Education also took part in the sessions at Northern Arizona University
   in Flagstaff near the San Francisco Mountains sacred to regional
   Tribes.

   Tribal elders and other American Indian experts on Traditional
   Ecological [tribe_wkshp3.jpg] Knowledge spoke on issues such as the
   Significance of the Atmosphere in Traditional Ways of Knowing, and
   Exploring the Knowing the Natural World in Traditional Ways.

   GLOBE personnel provided instruction in use of various instruments and
   methods to measure air, water and soil temperatures, precipitation,
   soil characteristics, ground cover, water chemistry, and more, and how
   to use the Program's interactive Web site for data submission and
   analysis.
