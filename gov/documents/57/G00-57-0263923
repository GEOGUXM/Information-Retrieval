   Environmental Restoration Project WASTE MINIMIZATION AWARENESS PLAN 1.0
   INTRODUCTION Waste minimization is an inherent goal within all the
   operating procedures of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (the
   Laboratory). The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Laboratory are
   required to annually submit a waste minimization plan to the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with the
   Laboratory's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit. This document represents
   the waste minimization and pollution prevention (WMin/PP) awareness
   plan for the Laboratory's Environmental Restoration (ER) Project. This
   plan supports the ER Project's WMin/PP goals and describes its program
   to incorporate waste reduction practices into ER activities and
   procedures. The plan was prepared by the ER Project Office, in the
   Environmental Science and Waste Technology (E) Division, pursuant to
   the requirements of Module VIII, Section B.1 of the Laboratory's
   Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (NM0890010515-1). This plan is specific
   to the ER Project and should be considered a companion document to the
   Laboratory's May 1997 site-wide plan, "Site Pollution Prevention Plan
   for Los Alamos National Laboratory," and the annual certification
   document "Los Alamos National Laboratory 1999 Environmental Stewardship
   Roadmap." 1.1 Background The mission of the Laboratory's ER Project is
   to protect human health and the environment by identifying risks posed
   by inactive and surplus DOE facilities and contaminated areas, and by
   remediating sites and facilities as necessary in the most
   cost-efficient and responsible manner possible in order to provide for
   potential future beneficial use. In completing this mission, ER
   activities have the potential to generate large volumes of waste that
   may require special handling, treatment, storage, and disposal. Because
   the contamination is already present in the environmental media or
   facility (as a result of past DOE activities), the ER Project is not
   the original generator of the waste. However, the ER Project generates
   waste in the conduct of site cleanups and thus is faced with the
   responsibility and the challenge to minimize the amounts of waste that
   will require subsequent management or disposal. Minimization is
   necessary because of the high cost of waste management; the limited
   capacity for on-site or off-site waste treatment, storage, or disposal;
   the desire to minimize the associated liability; and the need to
   protect the environment from future off-site releases caused by
   improper waste management practices. In 1990, Congress passed the
   Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), which changed the focus of
   environmental policy from "end-of-pipe" regulation to encouraging
   source reduction or eliminating waste prior to treatment, storage, or
   disposal. Under the PPA and other institutional requirements for
   treatment, storage, and disposal of wastes, all waste generators must
   certify that they have a waste minimization program "in place." The
   elements of this program are further defined in the May 1993 EPA
   interim final guidance, "Guidance to Hazardous Waste Generators on the
   Elements of a Waste Minimization Program." The program guidance lists
   what EPA considers the minimum level of infrastructure and effort which
   must be expended to have an acceptable program. This includes top
   management support, process evaluation, technology exchange, waste
   minimization employee training, and waste generation tracking and
   projections. ER2000-0708 1 December 2000 Waste Minimization Awareness
   Plan The DOE Office of the Secretary also requires a pollution
   prevention program as outlined in the 1996 Pollution Prevention Program
   Plan. The DOE Plan has specific program requirements for every waste
   generator, which include evaluating waste minimization options as early
   in the planning process as possible. The DOE Plan also places
   responsibility for WMin/PP implementation with the waste-generating
   program. The DOE has set an annual 10% reduction goal for all wastes
   generated from facility decommissioning and site stabilization
   activities; the Laboratory's approach to achieving this goal is
   addressed later in this document. 1.2 Purpose and Scope The purpose of
   this plan is to document the ER Project's approach for minimizing the
   wastes it generates. This plan discusses the goals, methods, and
   activities that will be routinely employed to prevent or reduce waste
   generation in fiscal year 2001 (FY01), and it reports historical waste
   generation quantities and significant waste minimization
   accomplishments for FY00. This plan also discusses the ER Project
   Program Manager's commitment to WMin/PP, provides a discussion of
   specific program elements of the ER WMin/PP program, and presents the
   barriers to implementation of further significant reductions. This plan
   is designed to fulfill the waste minimization requirements in Module
   VIII, Section B.1. of the Laboratory's Hazardous Waste Facility Permit,
   and of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). This plan
   addresses all waste types generated by the ER Project during the course
   of planning and conducting the investigation and remediation of
   environmental media funded by the DOE Office of Environmental
   Restoration (EM-40). Wastes generated by ER include "primary" and
   "secondary" waste streams. Primary waste consists of contaminated
   material or environmental media that was present as a result of past
   DOE activities prior to any containment and restoration activities. It
   includes contaminated building debris or soil from investigations and
   remedial activities. Secondary waste streams consist of materials that
   were used in the investigative or remedial process, such as
   investigative-derived waste (e.g., personal protective equipment [PPE],
   sampling waste, drilling cuttings); treatment residues; wastes
   resulting from storage or handling operations; and additives used to
   stabilize waste. Types of wastes generated vary on a site-by-site basis
   and may include low-level radioactive waste (LLW); low-level mixed
   radioactive waste (LLMW); transuranic radioactive (TRU) waste; chemical
   wastes (which include RCRA hazardous, Toxic Substances Control Act
   (TSCA) toxic, and New Mexico special wastes); and/or solid waste. The
   scope of a WMin/PP effort for an individual ER project will be
   dependent on the primary and secondary wastes expected and the
   feasibility of waste reduction for those waste types. 1.3 Requirements
   of the Operating Permit Module VIII, Section B.1, of the Laboratory's
   Hazardous Waste Facility Permit, requires that a waste minimization
   program be in place and that a certified plan be submitted annually to
   the administrative authority. The specific requirements of the permit
   are listed in Table 1.3.1 along with the corresponding section of the
   plan that addresses the requirement. December 2000 2 ER2000-0708 Waste

   STATEMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT The Laboratory's ER Project Program
   Manager, Focus Area Leaders, and other Project personnel are committed
   to preventing or reducing the generation of waste from ER Project
   activities, as much as is technically and economically feasible and
   consistent with the ER Project mission. The Laboratory's support for
   pollution prevention and waste minimization programs is documented in
   the Laboratory Implementation Requirement (LIR) 404-00-02.3, "General
   Waste Management Requirements." The ER Project additionally mandates
   waste minimization techniques in several of its standard operating
   procedures. In addition, the E Division Environmental Stewardship
   Office (ESO) is tasked by DOE and the Laboratory to champion and
   implement an aggressive waste minimization and environmental
   stewardship program for the entire facility. The ER Project fully
   supports the Laboratory's and Environmental Science and Waste
   Technology (E) Division's written WMin/PP policies, programs, and
   commitments. The ER Project will support the goal of waste reduction by
   giving preference to source reduction, improved segregation and
   characterization, and environmentally sound recycling practices
   regarding waste treatment and disposal techniques, to the maximum
   extent practicable. Evidence of the ER Project commitment is
   demonstrated by this plan, as well as by the documentation of past
   waste reduction efforts within the ER Project (Section 5.4). The ER
   Project will allocate sufficient resources to pursue the goals and
   approaches established by this plan and will coordinate with the
   Laboratory's ESO, as necessary. ER2000-0708 3 December 2000 Waste

   have oversight responsibilities and provide annual review of the
   Laboratory-wide WMin/PP program goals and performance. * The E Division
   has primary responsibility for the Laboratory-wide WMin/PP program,
   including the ER Project. * The E/ESO has been delegated by the E
   Division to develop and manage the Laboratory-wide WMin/PP and
   environmental stewardship program. The ESO provides oversight for
   WMin/PP implementation; a base of technical knowledge and resources for
   WMin/PP practices; assistance with identifying waste generation trends
   and WMin/PP opportunities; recommendations for WMin/PP solutions and
   applications; support in tracking and reporting waste generation trends
   and WMin/PP successes; assistance in preparing funding applications and
   proposals for WMin/PP projects; and facilitation of actions to overcome
   WMin/PP implementation barriers. December 2000 4 ER2000-0708 Waste
   Minimization Awareness Plan * The ER Project Focus Area Leader has
   primary responsibility for developing and implementing WMin/PP programs
   and strategies for all ER projects that result in waste generation, as
   described in this plan. The ER Project must allocate sufficient
   resources to facilitate the successful attainment of the goals and
   approaches identified in this plan. The ER Project is responsible for
   establishing and submitting an annual WMin/PP plan to the
   administrative authority, establishing WMin/PP goals and performance
   measures, and coordinating with the ESO, as necessary, to implement
   WMin/PP activities and to report success stories. * The ER Project
   Regulatory Compliance Focus Area Leader is the focal point for planning
   and implementing waste minimization activities and reporting waste
   minimization successes for the ER Project. * ER Project Focus Area
   Leaders report to the ER Project Program Manager. Focus Area Leaders
   are responsible for identifying and incorporating WMin/PP practices
   into project plans and field activities, as much as technically and
   economically feasible. * The ER Project Waste Management and
   Minimization Coordinator is responsible for coordination of waste
   minimization activities, coordinating proposals for waste minimization
   implementation projects, advising project leaders on WMin technologies
   and techniques, recommending ER Project-wide policy, and compiling
   waste generation and minimization data. 4.0 GOALS AND PERFORMANCE
   MEASURES The overall goal of the ER WMin/PP strategy is to increase the
   routine implementation of WMin/PP practices in the planning and
   execution of ER activities to avoid or reduce the generation of waste
   requiring subsequent handling or disposal. Performance measures for the
   WMin/PP effort include * increased cognizance of WMin/PP within the ER
   Project; * reduced or avoided volume of waste; * recyled or reused
   volume of material; and * documentation of WMin/PP successes. The DOE
   Headquarters established an annual DOE complex-wide 10% reduction goal
   for the ER Project based upon the overall waste projections.
   Additionally, the University of California FY01 contract performance
   measures with DOE includes an 18% reduction goal for sanitary ("solid
   waste") wastes. The ER Project will quantify the reduction goals for
   FY01 based upon completion of the work-planning baseline in November
   2000. The ER FY01 WMin/PP approach will focus on * integrating waste
   minimization principles into the remedial planning process; * recycling
   and reusing materials; * developing subcontractor waste minimization
   incentives through contract specifications; * dedicating waste
   minimization resources to assist with large remedial actions; and *
   tracking, projecting, and analyzing waste data to improve waste
   management economies of scale. ER2000-0708 5 December 2000 Waste
   Minimization Awareness Plan Figure 4.1 shows the environmental
   hierarchy for ER wastes. Although source reduction is preferred, the ER
   WMin/PP approach recognizes that there may be limited opportunity for
   source reduction of primary wastes because much of the waste already
   exists and potential environmental and health concerns may require
   removal. When appropriate, source reduction of primary wastes will be
   accomplished through the application of risk-based cleanup criteria,
   land-use scenarios, and the consideration of in-situ or non- intrusive
   remediation technologies during project planning and negotiation
   stages, and improved characterization and segregation during the
   execution of field activities. Source reduction of secondary wastes
   will be accomplished through proper planning; improved housekeeping,
   segregation and characterization; and application of WMin/PP criteria
   during technology selection, design and construction activities.
   Recycling and reuse practices will be considered for all primary and
   secondary wastes. Volume reduction, including size reduction,
   compaction, and optimal packaging, will be considered for all primary
   and secondary wastes that cannot be avoided or recycled. SEGREGATION

   Environmental Management Hierarchy within Environmental Restoration The
   WMin/PP approaches outlined above are consistent with the waste
   reduction priorities established by the Laboratory's site-wide waste
   minimization plan, which recognizes the severe limitations of on-site
   disposal capacity for LLW and on-site storage capacity for LLMW. In
   addition, the approach was adopted to address the variable and
   non-recurring nature of wastes coming from ER activities. 5.0 SITUATION
   ANALYSIS The FY00 activities which resulted in waste generation
   included remedial actions and site investigations. These types of
   activities are anticipated to continue through the life of Laboratory's
   ER Project. It should be noted that the majority of FY00 waste
   generation was the result of RCRA clean closure activities at Material
   Disposal Area P. The FY01 planned activities include additional deep
   groundwater monitoring and intermediate well installation, completion
   of the Material Disposal Area P clean closure, generation of waste from
   an interim action at a high-explosives site, remediation of several
   radioactive releases, and other small site investigations and
   corrective action projects. December 2000 6 ER2000-0708 Waste

   ER Project is subject to many environmental regulations. The key
   drivers for the WMin/PP program are listed below. A complete
   description of these regulations may be found in the LANL Waste

   of Hazardous Materials ER Project activities currently introduce only
   small amounts of hazardous materials into field and support operations.
   During the past years, most usage of hazardous materials has been
   substituted with less hazardous alternatives in an effort to reduce the
   generation of secondary hazardous or mixed waste. These efforts include
   the following list. * Decontamination Solvents - The use of the
   hazardous solvents has been eliminated in the ER Project. *
   Scintillation Cocktails - The routine use of scintillation cocktails
   media which results in a RCRA hazardous/mixed waste has been
   discontinued at the Laboratory. * Analytical Processes - Some of the
   sample analyses required for site characterization may involve the use
   of hazardous substances as prescribed by EPA analytical procedures,
   SW-846. ER2000-0708 7 December 2000 Waste Minimization Awareness Plan
   These analytical processes have been evaluated by EPA, private
   companies, and universities for potential alternative processes and
   material substitution. The use of hazardous substances in the analysis
   is currently viewed as necessary. 5.3 FY00 Waste Generation Summary The
   ER Project FY00 waste generation and waste minimization summary is
   listed in Table 5.3.1. Waste projections and reduction goals will be
   finalized upon completion of activity planning in November and December

   TSCA, and NM Special. 5.4 Waste Minimization Accomplishments FY00
   WMin/PP was an integral part of the FY00 ER planning activities and
   field projects through recycling, reuse, contamination avoidance,
   risk-based cleanup strategies, and many other practices. Waste
   reduction benefits are typically difficult to track and quantify
   because the data to measure the amount of waste reduced (as a direct
   result of a WMin/PP activity) are often not available and are not
   easily extrapolated. In addition, many waste minimization practices
   employed during previous years are incorporated into standard operating
   procedures and no longer reported. Operating expenses of $50,000 are
   provided annually to evaluate source reduction and recycling options.
   High volume waste streams resulting from ER activities include
   contaminated soil and demolition debris such as metal and concrete. The
   WMin/PP techniques used in FY00 to reduce these high volume waste
   streams led to the following accomplishments: * At Material Disposal
   Area P, 780 cubic meters of steel was decontaminated, segregated, and
   sent to a commercial steel recycling facility; * At Material Disposal
   Area P, 1,600 cubic meters of decontaminated concrete was reused
   on-site at the Laboratory as fill; * At Material Disposal Area P, 740
   cubic meters of rock was reused on-site for storm water controls;
   December 2000 8 ER2000-0708 Waste Minimization Awareness Plan * At
   Material Disposal Area P, 4,398 cubic yards of soil was sent to the
   Laboratory's TA-54 "Area J" for use as fill material in site closure
   preparation; * At Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 00-019, a drum of
   contaminated lead was decontaminated and recycled. 6.0 WASTE
   MINIMIZATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS Listed below are program elements of the
   Laboratory's ER Project waste minimization program for FY01. Several of
   the elements are currently in place; however, several are in the
   planning stages. The elements which are listed as planned will be
   implemented if economically and technically feasible. 6.1 WMin
   Coordinator The WMin/PP coordinator will have a primary role in FY01
   for developing and implementing programmatic elements of the ER WMin/PP
   program by conducting the following activities: * Improve WMin/PP
   awareness and information exchange within the ER Project. * Provide
   technical reviews and WMin/PP input to ER documents and procedures,
   such as corrective measures studies, sampling and analysis plans, or
   other project work plans and provide working examples of "model"
   documents that incorporate WMin/PP elements. * Assist with an ER
   Project Equipment Sharing Program to identify equipment needs that may
   be served by use of equipment that is currently available at other DOE
   facilities, thus reducing the purchase or lease of new equipment. *
   Provide technical assistance and consistency among focus areas to
   formalize standard approaches for WMin/PP in ER Project plans and
   procedures and institutionalize the use of design reviews, WMin/PP
   checklists, or value engineering for WMin/PP applications. * Assist in
   developing WMin/PP language for ER subcontractor documents and project
   specifications so as to provide incentives and measurable goals for
   waste reduction. * Pilot test or demonstrate site-specific waste
   reduction activities with a high potential for immediate return on
   investment. The WMin coordinator(s) will provide WMin/PP tools and
   practices to the ER Project. The specific application and waste
   reduction potential of a tool will be dependent on the specific ER
   project and left to the judgment of the individual project leaders. The
   common Wmin/PP tools for use in the ER Project are summarized in the
   list that follows. * WMin/PP tools for the Negotiations and Planning
   Phases Negotiate with regulators to recognize and implement WMin/PP
   where appropriate Write WMin/PP into ER program documents Include
   WMin/PP in budgets and contracts Integrate WMin/PP into construction
   team activities Train ER personnel on WMin/PP and build WMin/PP

   WMin/PP and build WMin/PP awareness 6.2 WMin Planning WMin/PP is best
   integrated during the project planning, design, and engineering phases.
   WMin/PP strategies incorporated during the planning (and negotiations)
   phases are some of the few opportunities for "source reduction" because
   they have the potential to avoid or reduce the generation of
   contaminated soil and building debris, which represent a significant
   waste volume within the ER Project. Well-defined agreements (with
   regulators and stakeholders) regarding land-use scenarios, cleanup
   performance standards and risk and pathway scenarios are highly
   effective in avoiding or reducing these primary wastes (e.g., soil,
   building debris) and secondary wastes. 6.3 Employee Training and
   Awareness Plan Waste minimization implementation is most effective when
   all employees consider WMin/PP part of their job responsibilities. To
   accomplish this, a planned approach to building waste minimization
   awareness has been developed. The goals of the awareness program are to
   * improve recognition among employees that WMin/PP practices apply to
   ER activities; * educate employees about successful implementation at
   the Laboratory and within DOE; and * improve documentation of WMin/PP
   accomplishments. December 2000 10 ER2000-0708 Waste Minimization
   Awareness Plan In addition to awareness activities, the following
   training is mandatory for ER waste-handling personnel. It addresses
   various topics including waste minimization: * "Waste Management
   Coordinator Requirements" * "Waste Generator Overview" * "Waste
   Documentation Forms" * "Waste Packaging, Shipping, and Materials
   Handling" In addition to the above classes, each focus area's waste
   management coordinator (WMC) is required to attend quarterly WMC
   meetings as ongoing training in issues important to performing the
   duties of a WMC. 6.4 Information and Technology Introduction The
   introduction of new technologies for WMin/PP and waste management
   approaches is important to minimizing wastes. To support technology
   exchange, the waste minimization coordinators are available to research
   technologies or WMin/PP tools for ER Project Focus Area Leaders, as
   necessary to attain information on technical or economic feasibility.
   They are also available to train project personnel on the access and
   usage of several large information sources such as * DOE, Remedial
   Action Project Information Center, Oak Ridge, TN * DOE, EPIC (the DOE
   Pollution Prevention Information Clearinghouse), Pacific Northwest
   Labs, Richland, WA * EPA, Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation
   (SITE) Database 6.5 Tracking and Reporting The routine collection of
   waste minimization accomplishments data was established in FY96.
   Project managers are asked to provide a list of accomplishments as they
   occur, with a formal quarterly data consolidation effort. 6.6 Sort,
   Decontaminate, and Segregate This task is currently implemented and is
   designed to sort and decontaminate LLW materials from decommissioning
   operations for the purpose of eliminating their disposal at TA-54 as
   low-level radioactive waste. Typical sorting practices include
   collection of all metal debris (including steel, lead, etc.) in
   separate boxes destined for shipment to a decontamination facility or
   commercial smelter for metals recovery. Decontamination work will
   involve the removal of surface radioactive contamination on equipment
   to allow for its reuse either at Los Alamos or other DOE facilities.
   Additionally, many sites containing heterogeneous radioactive
   contamination will place emphasis on proper segregation at the source
   to attain the maximum recycling and waste classification advantages.
   ER2000-0708 11 December 2000 Waste Minimization Awareness Plan 6.7
   Compaction The ER Project plans to improve implementation of this
   process by utilizing the compaction unit at TA-54 on suitable waste
   prior to final disposal. The compactor at TA-54 has a higher compaction
   yield than other equipment available in the past. 6.8 Survey and
   Release Past practices have conservatively classified nonindigenous
   investigative-derived waste (PPE, sampling materials, decontamination
   water) as contaminated, based on association with contaminated areas.
   New policy within the Laboratory allows the ER Project to develop
   procedures to survey and release these materials as nonradioactive.
   This will have a dramatic impact on the volume of low-level waste
   buried at Area G from ER activities. Waste management coordinators will
   be trained in the Laboratory Implementation Requirement (LIR)
   402-704-01.2, "Contamination Control." 6.9 Risk Assessment Human health
   risk assessments are routinely conducted for ER projects, as prescribed
   in the Laboratory's Installation Work Plan (LANL 1998, 62060). Risk
   assessments allow the ER Project to plan remediation activities on the
   basis of the future risk to health and the environment. Often the risk
   assessment may determine that it is adequately protective and
   appropriate or beneficial to leave the material in the ground, thus
   avoiding the generation of waste. Properly designed land-use agreements
   and risk-based cleanup strategies can provide flexibility to select
   remedial actions (or other technical activities) that may avoid or
   reduce the need to excavate or conduct other actions that typically
   generate high volumes of remedial waste. This is one of the few
   opportunities for source reduction. 6.10 Incentives Programs The ER
   Project participates in the Laboratory-wide "Waste Minimization/Waste
   Generation Set-aside Tax" system. This system charges the ER Project
   based on the volumes and toxicity of wastes generated from the program.
   This financial burden is an incentive for ER Project managers to reduce
   waste generation to lower total project costs. The ER Project is
   actively soliciting Return on Investigation (ROI) proposals for WMin/PP
   projects that are eligible for funding through this tax. 6.11
   Lead-Handling Procedures The ER Project does not routinely procure or
   use lead or handle excess lead. The inventory and decontamination of
   existing lead at the Laboratory has been conducted as part of a
   milestone of the Laboratory's Federal Facilities Compliance Act
   agreement and is out of the scope of the ER Project. ER activities will
   manage and minimize the amount of lead-contaminated waste using the
   following approaches. * Projects will specify a preference to avoid the
   procurement or use of lead, when possible, giving preference to the use
   of steel in place of lead. * Projects will specify the use of
   strippable or washable coatings for any lead materials that must be
   used and have the potential to become contaminated. December 2000 12
   ER2000-0708 Waste Minimization Awareness Plan * Projects will plan for
   the decontamination of lead materials, when economically feasible,
   using blast grit, carbon dioxide blast (or other nondestructive blast),
   or chemical decontamination techniques. Preference will be given to
   decontamination techniques that minimize the generation of secondary
   waste (from the treatment process). * Projects that handle
   noncontaminated lead waste as a primary waste from the removal action
   or decommissioning activity will make efforts to recover and
   redistribute the lead for use at the Laboratory or at another DOE
   facility. * Projects will coordinate with the Laboratory's Solid Waste
   Operations Group for the appropriate handling and disposition of
   radioactively contaminated lead that cannot be decontaminated or
   redistributed. 6.12 Equipment Reuse The reuse of equipment and
   materials such as plastic gloves, sampling scoops, plastic sheeting,
   and PPE will produce significant waste reduction and cost savings in
   FY01. In addition, the Laboratory has initiated an equipment-exchange
   program, which attempts to identify surplus or inactive equipment for
   use. This not only saves capital equipment dollars by not purchasing
   the equipment, but it also delays the eventual disposal of the
   equipment when no longer needed. 7.0 BARRIERS TO WASTE MINIMIZATION
   IMPLEMENTATION In some instances, existing regulatory requirements
   created situations where actual levels of waste minimization could not
   meet those potentially achievable based on site conditions. For
   example, at one ER Project site (Material Disposal Area P), a closure
   plan, submitted to regulatory agencies, required clean-closure of the
   disposal area. Some materials from the disposal area, upon sampling and
   segregation, could be proven to be within acceptable cleanup criteria
   and left on-site for use in final site grading. However, because of the
   closure plan requirements, this material is being shipped off-site as
   waste. Future remedial plans will ensure that acceptable materials may
   be reused on-site to the maximum extent practicable, pending regulatory
   concurrence. REFERENCES "Guidance to Hazardous Waste Generators on the
