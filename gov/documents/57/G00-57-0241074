   The California Integrated Waste Management Boards Buy Recycled programs
   promote the State of Californias policy to buy environmentally
   preferable products. The programs support the Department of General
   Services (DGS), all other State agencies, and local governments in
   establishing policies and practices for purchasing recycled-content
   products (RCP), as well as support activities that promote waste
   reduction and management.

Program Overviews

   State Agency Buy Recycled Campaign (SABRC). The SABRC is a joint effort
   between the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) and
   DGS to implement State law requiring State agencies and the Legislature
   to purchase products with recycled content.

   Recycled-Content Product (RCP) Database. The RCP database provides
   access to information on RCPs as well as the manufacturers,
   distributors, reprocessors, mills, and converters that manufacture or
   supply these products or the recycled materials to make them.

   Green Building. The Governors Executive Order D-16-00 sets forth the
   sustainable building goals of his administration. The CIWMB is a leader
   in supporting green and/or sustainable building practices, seeking
   opportunities to use our resources efficiently while creating healthier
   buildings that improve human health, build a better work environment,
   and provide cost savings.

   Newsprint Program. Californias newsprint law mandates the use of a
   specified amount of recycled-content newsprint by printers and
   publishers located in California. These newsprint consumers must
   certify the amount of recycled-content newsprint consumed annually to
   the CIWMB.

   Plastic Trash Bag Program. Californias trash bag law requires plastic
   trash bag manufacturers to use a specific amount of plastic
   postconsumer material to produce the trash bags sold in California.

Other Buy Recycled Activities

   Rigid Plastic Packaging Containers (RPPC). The Board oversees the Rigid
   Plastic Packaging Container Act of 1991, which requires that RPPCs meet
   one of several criteria designed to reduce the amount of plastic being
   landfilled. The Board maintains a manufacturers certification program,
   encourages market development, and conducts outreach activities
   promoting recycling of plastics.

   Organics/Composting. The Board supports outreach and education efforts
   promoting composting, mulching, grasscycling, and other actions
   relating to the management and use of organic resources.

   Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling. The Board works with the
   industry to identify ways to reduce building construction and
   demolition debris going to landfills and meet Californias mandated
   diversion goal of 50 percent.

   Recycled Paper Coalition (RPC). The Board supports this innovative
   group of major organizations representing a unique effort to rethink
   traditional business practices regarding office paper purchase and
   usage.

   Cooperative Recycled Paper Purchasing. The Board supports activities to
   disseminate information about this coalition, which provides
   opportunities to purchase recycled paper at a discounted cost through
   cooperative purchase agreements.
