   National Water Information System Web Site (NWISWeb)

   As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) program of disseminating
   water data to the public, the USGS maintains a distributed network of
   computers and fileservers for the storage and retrieval of water data
   collected through its activities at approximately 1.5 million sites
   around the country. This system is called the National Water
   Information System (NWIS). Many types of data are stored in this NWIS
   network, including: site information, time-series (flow, stage,
   precipitation, chemical), peak flow, ground water, and water quality.
   The NWISWeb provides access to water-resources data collected at
   approximately 1.5 million sites in all 50 States, the District of
   Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Online access to Water Resources of West
   Virginia data is organized around the categories listed below:
