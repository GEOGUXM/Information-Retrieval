   K20 Masthead K 20 Contracts

      Washington legislators in 1996 recognized that schools would need more
      information technology to prepare students for the 21^st century. They
      wanted to make sure the state's educational institutions would work
      together to develop access to information technology and to avoid
      duplicating costly facilities and services at taxpayer expense. The
      result is the K-20 Educational Telecommunications Network, which
      debuted in September 1997 is being hailed as the harbinger of a true
      education system in the state.
