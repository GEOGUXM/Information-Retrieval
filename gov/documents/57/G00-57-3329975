   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's core mission is to deliver
   environmental science and technology in the service of the nation and
   humanity. Through basic research we create fundamental knowledge of
   natural, engineered, and social systems that is the basis for both
   effective environmental technology and sound public policy. We solve
   legacy environmental problems by delivering technologies that remedy
   existing environmental hazards, we address today's environmental needs
   with technologies that prevent pollution and minimize waste, and we are
   laying the technical foundation for tomorrow's inherently clean energy
   and industrial processes. We also apply our capabilities to meet
   selected national security, energy, and human health needs; strengthen
   the U.S. economy; and support the education of future scientists and
   engineers.
   This mission is in line with the U.S. Department of Energy's Strategic
   Plan and Strategic Laboratory Mission Plan, where Pacific Northwest is
   designated as a principal laboratory in the environmental quality
   mission, a major contributing laboratory in both science and technology
   and energy, and a participating laboratory in national security.
   The mission is also consistent with the technical work carried out at
   our Laboratory. Fully two-thirds of the Laboratory's work is in
   environmental science, environmental technology, or both. Further, our
   projects in support of DOE's national security and energy missions
   often draw heavily on capabilities we have developed in support of our
   environmental mission.
