   This World Wide Web site -- mpa.gov -- provides information on marine
   protected areas (MPAs) as required by Executive Order 13158. This site,
   managed jointly by the Departments of Commerce and the Interior, will
   report on our collective progress in implementing the Executive Order.

   The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall
   establish and jointly manage Web site for information on MPAs and
   Federal agency reports required by this order. They shall also publish
   and maintain a list of MPAs that meet the definition of MPA for the
   purposes of this order. (Executive Order 13158, complete text)

   The United States has embarked on a major ocean conservation initiative
   to protect important natural and cultural resources from loss and
   degradation. Following the vision laid out in Executive Order 13158,
   the Department of Commerce (represented by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)), the Department of the Interior and
   other federal agencies " . . . will (a) strengthen the management,
   protection, and conservation of existing MPAs and establish new or
   expanded MPAs; (b) will develop a scientifically based, comprehensive
   national system of MPAs representing diverse U.S. marine ecosystems,
   and the Nations natural and cultural resources; and (c) avoid causing
   harm to MPAs through federally conducted, approved, or funded
   activities."

   To that end, this site will present the evolving vision of the national
   MPA system, and will make accessible the scientific information,
   technical tools and management strategies needed to design and
   effectively manage MPAs. It will also consolidate a variety of
   information on marine protected area literature and developments. This
   site is intended to actively promote the free exchange of information
   on MPAs and efforts to implement Executive Order 13158. It is designed
   to be a gateway for government agencies, institutions, groups and
   individuals to participate in this national endeavor. It is our hope
   that the site will be used regularly by people in government, Congress,
   academia, conservation, industry, and the general public.

   How to Find Specific Information

   The site is organized in three main sections as seen on the Home Page.

   The first section presents general descriptive information on MPAs:
   What are they? What are their benefits to the nation? What are the
   challenges to implementing the Executive Order? Additional themes will
   be addressed in the months ahead.

   The second section presents specific services or tools to users in the
   scientific, conservation, maritime and user communities. At present,
   these include: (a) an inventory of federal, state and local sites that
   will be used to develop a list of MPAs called for in the Executive
   Order; and (b) a library of MPA literature and organizations. Although
   these services are just beginning, they will be supported and enhanced
   regularly. We will also provide other services as the national
   initiative matures.

   The third section describes three critical components called for in the
   Executive Order: (a) an MPA Center that will develop a framework for a
   national MPA system, and disseminate information, tools and strategies
   in support of the national system; (b) an MPA Advisory Committee that
   will provide NOAA, DOI and other agencies with expert advice from
   nonfederal marine scientists, resource managers and others; and (c)
   annual reports by federal agencies on their activities to achieve the
   vision laid out in Executive Order 13158.

   The Road Ahead

   Developing a more coordinated national network of MPAs will take time,
   and various elements of the Executive Order will be implemented
   throughout the coming year. This Web site will keep you informed as the
   federal advisory committee is formed, as an inventory of our nations
   existing federal, state and local MPAs is completed, as the new MPA
   Center is established, and as other new milestones are reached or new
   issues arise. We invite you to visit this site frequently and review
   new offerings.
