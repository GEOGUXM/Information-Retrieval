                     Office of District Superintendents
                     New York State Education Department

   The Office of District Superintendents is responsible for ensuring that
   the 38 BOCES District Superintendents have the necessary information,
   assistance and support to: (1) function effectively as the
   Commissioners representative in the field; and (2) effect changes in
   school districts, school buildings, and ultimately, classrooms in their
   supervisory regions that result in improved student performance.
   Because the Office of District Superintendents works directly with the
   District Superintendents, who are also Department staff, it plays a
   very unique role in the policy development and implementation process.

   The Office of District Superintendents:
     * Facilitates communication between the Department and the 38 BOCES
       District Superintendents throughout the State;
     * In collaboration with Elementary, Middle, Secondary and
       Continuation Education Senior Managers, analyzes and develops broad
       policy issues and provides policy clarification/interpretation to
       District Superintendents;
     * Provides oversight and coordinates the work of the District
       Superintendents as the Commissioners representatives;
     * Advises the Deputy Commissioner regarding policies affecting the
       District Superintendents/BOCES in relation to Regents and
       Department priorities;
     * Manages BOCES legislative proposal(s); and,
     * Arranges the monthly meetings of the District Superintendents.

   Who are the District Superintendents?

   District Superintendents are both Chief Executive Officers of the local
   BOCES, and representatives of the Commissioner in the field.

   The mission of the District Superintendents is to be vigorous agents
   for reform, effectively advocating for educational excellence and
   equity on behalf of all learners in New York State. Doing this requires
   collaboration and leadership at the regional and state level in
   partnership with the Commissioner of Education, the Board of Regents
   and local school districts.

   Each District Superintendent is expected to provide forceful
   educational leadership in implementing the new standards, leading local
   school improvement, engaging the community to support improvement, and
   detecting, reporting and resolving problems. As Chief Executive Officer
   of the BOCES, the District Superintendent is expected to use BOCES
   resources effectively, to support local reform efforts, to improve cost
   effectiveness, and to make each BOCES a model of high quality and cost
   effectiveness.
