   Terra Engineering Competition

Results Are In!

   Four high school teams from Maryland and one team from Connecticut
   squared off on April 21 in NASA's Applied Engineering Competition. This
   year, the teams were tasked with solving two real-world problems
   involving the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship satellite, Terra,
   launched December 18, 1999. The student participants demonstrated
   amazing creativity and analytical skills throughout the intense
   competition. read more...
