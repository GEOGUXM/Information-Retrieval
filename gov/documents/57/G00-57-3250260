   Mars Meteorite Meteorites from Antarctica are a relatively recent
   resource for study of the material formed early in the solar system;
   most are thought to come from asteroids but some may have originated on
   larger planets. In 1969, the Japanese discovered concentrations of
   meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the
   ice sheet in the last one million years. They seem to be concentrated
   in places where the flowing ice, acting as a conveyor belt, runs into
   an obstacle and is worn away, leaving behind the meteorites. Compared
   with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the
   Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved. The collection and
   curation of Antarctic meteorites is a cooperative effort among NASA,
   the National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution. The
   meteorites are collected by NSF science teams camping on the ice. Since
   1977, the still-frozen meteorites have been returned to Johnson Space
   Center for curation and distribution. Some of the specimens are
   forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution, but JSC scientists curate
   over 4000 meteorites for more than 250 scientists worldwide and eagerly
   await the arrival of the several hundred new meteorites each year.

   Subdividing a Meteorite This large collection of meteorites allows a
   better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar
   system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of
   meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites
   are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. Because
   meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time
   elapsed since the meteorite impacted the Earth can be determined from
   laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial
   residence age, of a meteorite represents additional information that
   might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.
