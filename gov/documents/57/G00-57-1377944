                            Main Hawaiian Islands

   The following are Digital Elevation Models for the Main Eight Hawaiian
   Islands derived from USGS 7.5' Quads.

   Individual quad DEM's were converted to a common projection, datum, and
   vertical unit, then mosaicked together. The projection for the DEM
   mosaics is as follows:

   Projection - Universal Transverse Mercator
   Datum - NAD83
   Spheroid - GRS80
   Vertical and horizontal units - meters
   Zone - 4 for all the Islands except for Hawaii which is Zone 5

   The cell size for the DEM's is 10 meters. The DEM's can be imported
   into ArcView and converted to grids by selecting File - Import Data
   Source - USGS DEM when the Spatial Analyst Extension is active.
