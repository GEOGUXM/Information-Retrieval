Alternative Financing Types for Start-Up Businesses

   Do you need to purchase assets for your new business but dont have
   three years of profitable financial statements?

Many small businesses have difficulty getting access to capital when they do
not have three years of profitable financial statements, sufficient equity in
the business due to start up issues or some related challenge. Yet, these
types of capital resources, asset-based lenders, leasing companies, factors
and others, have made a niche out of servicing these business needs. Dont
dismiss the opportunity without exploring the options. These hard money
capital providers may be just what you need to get you through the tough
times.

   Asset-Based Lenders include household and commercial finance companies,
   which may advance funds according to traditional loan to value ratios
   (50 80%, or those which may loan more than 100% of the value of the
   collateral. Of course, the higher the risk, the higher the interest
   rate. These lenders will always require collateral such as real estate,
   cars, equipment, accounts receivable etc.


   Factors are companies, which actually buy your accounts receivable from
   you, rather than loan against them. In factoring, your financial
   condition is not as important as the financial statement of your
   customer. The factor will advance funds, based on a formula, then
   collect the entire amount from your customer. The factor earns a fee of
   between 3 and 6% per month, until the account is paid in full. Upon
   payment, the factor deducts what was previously advanced, plus any fees
   then gives the company the remaining amount.


   Leasing Companies are also a common way of accessing capital for assets
   needed in the business. You name it, from ovens, to automobiles, to
   forklifts, some leasing company will write an agreement on it. Leasing
   is attractive because it does not require a big down payment. However,
   the entrepreneur should consider not only the leasing costs, but
   additional expenses such as insurance with higher coverage and
   replacement costs. A "closed end" agreement provides you with the
   option of owning the equipment with a lump sum payment. In an "open
   end" agreement you may owe a lump sum, but still not own the equipment.
