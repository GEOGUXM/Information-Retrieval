                         Cal-Vet Properties for Sale



                         Listing by County and City


     These pages contain a list of properties that are owned by the
     Department and are currently for sale. All of the properties listed are
     repossessions and may include single family residences, condominiums
     and planned unit developments, farms, land, mobile homes on land, and
     mobile homes in parks. There are no multiple unit properties, as the
     Department does not lend on them.

     You may access the list of properties for sale by either clicking on
     the county name or the city name that you wish to search. If a county
     or city name does not appear in the list, there are currently no
     properties available in that location.

     For most of these properties we have entered into an exclusive listing
     agreement with a local real estate agent. Please contact the real
     estate agent via the address or phone number below the property
     listing. Occasionally some of these properties are sold directly by
     Cal-Vet.

     All properties are subject to prior sale. These properties are
     available for purchase by anyone (you do not have to be a veteran).

     Please read our additional information if you are considering
     purchasing one of these properties. You may also contact the Cal-Vet
     property agent listed or call Cal-Vet at (800) 952-5626.
