                    E.J. Friedman-Hill's Java Course

                  Java Programming in Five Easy Lessons

                                                       Java

   These are the slides for a five-session course on Java programming I
   teach. The course assumes a background in C programming, but not
   necessarily C++. The slides are Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
   converted into HTML via export to RTF and the Internet Assistant Word
   plug-in. The converted HTML is tweaked only a little, just enough to
   make it legible. As a result, it's kind of ugly; sorry (please don't
   write to me to tell me about the PowerPoint Internet Assistant - it
   converts to HTML by making a JPEG of every slide!)

   New! I'm completely redoing the course from scratch. The notes will
   appear here on a weekly basis, just like the first set did, oh so long
   ago. This time, there are definite reading assignments from a text:
   O'Reilly's Java in a Nutshell.
     * The first lecture introduces you to Java's history, basic syntax,
       and other particulars.
     * The second lecture discusses exception handling, introduces you to
       classes, shows how to implement some familiar data structures, and
       discusses the notion of encapsulation.
     * The third lecture introduces you to inheritance and Java
       interfaces, and teaches you how to build simple graphical user
       interfaces using the Abstract Window Toolkit.
     * This week we look at Threads and Java I/O.
     * In the final lecture, we look under the covers at the Java Virtual
       Machine, and talk about Java Beans, Java RMI, and JDBC (these last
       three topics not online here.)

   My old Java course is still available.
