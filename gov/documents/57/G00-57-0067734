               High Tech Moths on Mars: Biomimetics and Planetary Exploration

                                        The Hawkmoth

           In the future, the Mars program may be turning to insects for help in
           the exploration of the red planet. Researchers with the NASA Institute
           for Advanced Concepts are attempting to develop robotic fliers based on
           terrestrial insects in order to efficiently traverse the surface of
           Mars. These robots may be able to fly in the thin Martian atmosphere,
           using their unique abilities to land, take off, hover, and carry small
           payloads to help scientists collect soil samples and extend the
           effective exploration range of current landers.

                                                                      Read more...



           A Conversation with Dr. Eilene Theilig, Jupiter Explorer
           With a career spanning the early exploration of Mars to our evolving
           knowledge of Jupiter, Dr. Eilene Theilig knows her way around the Solar
           System.

                                                                       Read more..

           Studying Extremes in Antarctic Streams

           Dr. Alberto Behar, chief engineer on the NASA Jet Propulsion
           Laboratory's (JPL) Antarctic Ice Borehole Probe Project, spent three
           months in subzero temperatures studying the dynamics of the West
           Antarctic ice sheet.

                          Exploring ice caves near McMurdo Station


           Studies show that significant changes in glacier melting and flow rates
           could considerably impact sea levels and global warming.

                                                                       Read more..


           Earth: The Water World

           We don't yet know if there is life in the ocean of Europa or the
           aquifers of Mars but we know the waterworld on Earth is teeming with
           life.

                                                                    View the Movie

                                         Scuba Diver
            Johnathan Trent is an Astrobiologist at the NASA Ames Research Center
            in Mountain View, California. For nine years Johnathan was among the
           small group of marine scientists exploring the open ocean using SCUBA.
