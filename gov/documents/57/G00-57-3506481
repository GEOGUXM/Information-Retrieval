   Alaska Water Quality Data (QW Data)
        __________________________________________________________________

   Water Quality Retrieval

        * National information on Water Quality
        * Index of water-quality data for Alaska (list of types and dates of
          water-quality data for streams and lakes)

        To request information on Alaskan water quality and data from the
        USGS data base, please supply as much information as possible.

        Water quality samples have been collected at streams, springs,
        lakes, and ground-water wells throughout the state.

        Methods for retrieval of information:

        * Radial - with the latitude and longitude of one point, we can
          retrieve water quality information within 1/4 mile or up to 100+
          miles.
        * Latitude/Longitude "Box" - with 4 points of latitude/longitude we
          can retrieve all water quality information within an area.
        * Stream, lake, gaging station name or ground-water well ID.
        * Drainage basin name.

        Types of information needed:

        * Location and type of request {radial, latitude/longitude, stream
          name, station name, drainage basin name.}
        * Water quality information type
             + Chemical, biological, or sediment.
             + Continuous temperature or other property
             + Specific properties or constituents
             + Time period
        * Your...
             + Name
             + Physical mailing address
             + Phone number
