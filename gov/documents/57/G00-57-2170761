   Interactive Stereo Electron Microscopy Enhanced with Virtual Reality
   (LBNL-48336), W. Bethel, S. J. Bastacky and K. Schwartz. Discussion of
   techniques needed to enable use of virtual measuring tools on 3D
   objects perceived in stereo image pairs obtained from a scanning
   electron microscope. In Proceedings of IS&T/SPIE Photonics West,
   Conference on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology, the
   Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality, San Jose CA, January 2002.

   Using High-Speed WANs and Network Data Caches to Enable Remote and
   Distributed Visualization (LBNL-45365). W. Bethel, B. Tierney, J. Lee,
   D. Gunter, S. Lau. Visapult is a prototype application and framework
   for remote visualization of large scientific datasets. We approach the
   technical challenges of tera-scale visualization with a unique
   architecture that employs high speed WANs and network data caches for
   data staging and transmission. This architecture allows for the use of
   available cache and compute resources at arbitrary locations on the
   network. High data throughput rates and network utilization are
   achieved by parallelizing I/O at each stage in the application, and by
   pipelining the visualization process. On the desktop, the graphics
   interactivity is effectively decoupled from the latency inherent in
   network applications. We present a detailed performance analysis of the
   application, and improvements resulting from field-test analysis
   conducted as part of the DOE Combustion Corridor project. In
   "Proceedings of SC00", November 2000.

   Visualization Dot Com (LBNL-44871), W. Bethel. This article examines
   the seemingly well-worn subject of remote visualization, and presents
   an overview of a prototype system used for distributed, shared
   rendering use to do remote visualization of tera-scale scientific data.
   To appear in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, May/June 2000.

   Implementing a Visualization Tool for Adaptive Mesh Refinement Data
   using VTK (LBNL number in process) (pdf), (postscript), (m/s word), T.
   Ligocki. This paper describes the issues surrounding the visualization
   of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data and then documents the work done
   implementing at tool, ChomboVis, using VTK to visualization data from
   an AMR library, Chombo, being developed by the Applied Numerical
   Algorithms Group (ANAG) at LBNL/NERSC. VDE 2000 Workshop Proceedings,
   PPPL, Princeton, NJ. April 27-28, 2000.

   Measurement of Perceived Objects (LBNL-43446), W. Bethel and S.J.
   Bastacky. An experimental prototype system is used to perform point
   measurements between objects perceived as being three dimensional from
   stereo image pairs. IEEE Visualization 99, Late Breaking Hot Topics.

   Implementing Virtual Reality Interfaces for the Geosciences
   (LBNL-38618), W. Bethel (LBL), J. Jacobsen (LBL), A. Austin (BP
   Exploration), M. Lederer (BP Exploration), T. Little (Western Atlas
   Software). Overview of work done in integrating VR into a visualization
   and computing environment, with a focus on geoscience applications.
   Presented at "Virtual Reality in the Geosciences," Halden, Norway, June
   1996. A report on work done under the ACTI Project. June 1996.

   Modular Virtual Reality Visualization Tools (LBNL-36693), W. Bethel.
   Paper describing ongoing work integrating Virtual Reality with AVS.
   Published in Proceedings of AVS '95, February 1995.

   Methods of Constructing a 3D Geological Model from Scatter Data, J.
   Horsman and W. Bethel, Obstacles encountered and tools used in using
   visualization packages and other software when constructing a 3d
   geological model from "scatter" data. Published in Proceedings of AVS
   '95. February 1995.

   Chemical Flooding in a Virtual Environment - A Survivor's Guide to VR
   Development (LBL-35262), W. Bethel. A description of extending AVS to
   handle Virtual Reality. Published in the Proceedings of AVS 94, May
   1994. Lots of AVS-specific stuff. February 1994.

   Site Remediation in a Virtual Environment (LBL-34865), W. Bethel, J.
   Jacobsen and P. Holland, A description of steps taken to combine a
   simulation with a dataflow-based visualization system. Less
   AVS-specific than the AVS94 paper. Published in the Proceedings of the
   SPIE, February 1994. January 1994.

   Site Characterization at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, W. Bethel and P.
   Holland, Study of geology on LBNL site, use of visualization and
   visualization tools. Published in AVS Network News, Spring 1993.
   Visual Recipes. A case study of visualization applied to an Earth
   Sciences project. This appears in the book titled Visual Cues, Keller
   and Keller, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1993. This (pre-edited version
   of the) article contains a discussion of different visualization
   techniques applied to complex multivariate data.
