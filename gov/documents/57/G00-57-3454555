   CourtWeb is a free opinion retrieval service developed by Richard
   Seidel from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and is hosted
   by the Southern District of New York.  CourtWeb provides information on
   selected recent rulings of those judges
   of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas
   who elect to
   make information available.  When a ruling is posted to CourtWeb by
   chambers, the description that appears will typically include the
   caption, case number, date,  judge's name, a brief summary of the
   ruling, and the www link or location for the full text of the document
   if it is available.

   We are currently adding selected opinions from January, 1995 to the
   present.  In the coming months, we will expand this service to include
   those judges who wish to participate.  Check back often.
   William G. Putnicki, Clerk of Court



   Note: Members of the public are advised that not all rulings, even by
         participating judges, are necessarily posted to CourtWeb.   Moreover,
         the order or other paper filed with the Clerk of the Court is the
         official court document.  In the event of any discrepancy between a
         report of a ruling in CourtWeb and the official court document, the
         official court document controls. Interested persons therefore are
         cautioned to rely only on the official court documents.
