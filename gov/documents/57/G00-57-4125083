     __________________________________________________________________

              Office of Chief Counsel for Export Administration
     __________________________________________________________________

   The mission of the Office of Chief Counsel for Export Administration
   ("OCC") is to provide legal counsel to the Bureau of Export
   Administration ("BXA"). BXA protects U.S. national security and foreign
   policy interests by controlling exports and protecting the U.S
   industrial base while minimizing negative impact to our economic
   prosperity. The office is managed by a politically appointed Chief
   Counsel who is assisted by a career Deputy Chief Counsel and two senior
   career attorneys who serve as division chiefs.

   The work performed by OCC is best understood by first describing what
   BXA does: it administers the Export Administration Act ("EAA") by
   developing export control policies, issuing export licenses, and
   prosecuting violators, including enforcing and implementing the EAA's
   anti boycott provisions; it enhances the defense industrial base and
   assists U.S. defense firms which have felt the impact of reduced
   defense spending; and it helps other countries develop export control
   systems comparable to ours and has assisted enterprises in the
   republics of the former Soviet Union in converting to civil production.
   BXA has also been delegated the responsibility for enforcing the
   Fastener Quality Act. BXA is divided into two principal operating units
   called Export Administration and Export Enforcement.

   Like BXA, OCC's attorneys and staff are divided into two divisions, the
   Regulation and Licensing Division and the Enforcement and Litigation
   Division, depending upon whether they provide counsel on regulatory,
   licensing, and defense industrial base issues to Export Administration
   or assist Export Enforcement investigate suspected violations, and
   develop and prosecute those cases. A summary of specific functions
   performed by OCC is as follows:
