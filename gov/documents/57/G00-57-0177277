NIST Switch Home Page

   This is the NIST Switch home page. NIST Switch is a label switching
   development package that runs (or will, eventually) on Linux and
   FreeBSD.

  New! Version 0.2 released! (10 May 2000)

   Version 0.2 of NIST Switch is now available. This version runs with
   FreeBSD 3.3 and ALTQ-2.0, and includes new functionality.

  Version 0.1 released! (9 July 1999)

     This is to announce the release of the preliminary version 0.1 of
     our multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) research platform, NIST
     Switch. NIST Switch implements quality of service and explicit
     routing through label switching. It uses proposed extensions to RSVP
     to signal QoS requests and distribute labels.

  NIST Switch functionality

   NIST Switch version 0.2 implements functionality described in a number
   of Internet Drafts:
     * draft-ietf-mpls-arch-05.txt - MPLS architecture
     * draft-ietf-mpls-label-encaps-04.txt - Label stack encoding
     * draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-00.txt - RSVP-mediated label exchange
     * draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-lsp-tunnel-04.txt - RSVP-mediated lsp tunnel
       creation
     * draft-rosen-mpls-lan-encaps-00.txt - "Shim" LAN label encapsulation
     * draft-srinivasan-mpls-lans-label-00.txt - "MAC" LAN label
       encapsulation (receive only)

   NIST Switch runs over Ethernet (10Mb and 100Mb) and ATM. It is based on
   commodity PC hardware running on freely-available operating systems
   (currently, FreeBSD 3.3) (Linux 2.2.X versions to come).

   As an experimental platform, NIST Switch is designed to be easily
   altered. Each of its key components (queueing algorithms, label
   databases and distribution, routing algorithms, device support
   routines, QoS policies) are independently configurable modules which
   are readily replaceable.

   NIST Switch is free, public domain code. (More precisely, while our
   implementation is public domain, it is based in part on other code
   which is covered by BSD-style copyrights.)
