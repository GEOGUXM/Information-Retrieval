     TENURE TRACK OPENINGS
       __________________________________________________________________

     The tenure track has been created to provide an opportunity for
     outstanding junior scientists who have completed research training to
     demonstrate their creativity and productivity as independent
     scientists. Successful tenure-track candidates become permanent
     intramural investigators. Tenure-track positions are accompanied by
     support for salary, positions, space, and research budget. All such
   positions are advertised nationally and fellows completing NIH training
   may wish to consider competing for them.

     NIA is searching for a chief for its Laboratory of Cellular and
     Molecular Biology. He or she will be responsible for conducting and
     coordinating research on basic mechanisms of aging, response of cells
     to damaging environmental agents, factors in cellular senescence and
     proliferation, and age-associated diseases and disabilities. An
     interest in interventions to alleviate or prevent aging-related
     deficits would be valuable. The Chief, LCMB, is responsible for a large
     intramural lab with at least five other independent tenured and
     tenure-track principal investigators. Current members study cellular
     response to stress and gene expression, neurodegenerative mechanisms in
     aging and Alzheimer's, signal transduction, molecular genetics of
     ovarian cancer, and aging and T lymphocyte activation. The ideal
     candidate will have demonstrated interest in study of aging and/or
     age-related diseases or processes and a proven record of excellence in
     lab and/or clinical research demonstrated by publications in the best
     peer-reviewed journals, invited participation in international
     meetings, and research awards. Also, an established track record of
     success in mentoring scientists is desirable. For further information,
     call 410-558-8116. Applicants should send a C.V., bibliography and two
     letters of recommendation to: Gerontology Research Center, NIA, 5600

     Diagnostic Radiologist
       Entry ID: TN-293

     NCI's Center for Cancer Research is seeking a Diagnostic Radiologist
     with certification in diagnostic radiology or nuclear medicine with
     extensive clinical, research, and management experience to head a new
     Diagnostic and Molecular Oncology Imaging program. The program's
     director will establish a new program and recruit staff to coordinate
     existing imaging technology and develop advanced experimental imaging
