   Interactive Visualization
   TMI Image

   For interactive visualization of satellite data, the Passive Microwave
   ESIP Information System utilizes the Space Time Toolkit (STT) client
   software developed by the VisAnalysis Systems Technologies (VAST) team
   at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Through this interface the
   Passive Microwave ESIP data sets may be retrieved from distributed data
   servers and interactively displayed and manipulated based on the
   perspective of the satellite platforms.

   The STT interface may be run as a Java applet in the web browser, or as
   a stand-alone application on the user's workstation. If multiple, long
   visualization sessions are expected then the user should strongly
   consider installing the software directly on their workstation.
