   JPL and NASA's return to Mars began at 8:02 a.m. Pacific time on
   Saturday, April 7, as the 2001 Mars Odyssey begins with spacecraft
   roared into space onboard a Delta II launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral
   Air Force Station, Fla. About 53 minutes later, at 11:55 a.m., JPL
   flight controllers received the first signal from the spacecraft
   through the Deep Space Network perfect station in Canberra, Australia
   indicating that all was well aboard the orbiter. "I've never seen a
   more spectacular launch," said David A. Spencer, launch Odyssey's
   mission manager at JPL. "The spacecraft seems to be per- forming
   beautifully, and we're right on our timeline. This gives us a terrific
   start on our odyssey to Mars." Among those who packed von K 치 r m 치 n

   known? why this has been truly life-changing for me. 4 Congressman Adam
   Schiff and members of his Washington, D.C. and Pasadena staffs toured
   JPL March 23 as part of a two-day staff retreat. The group was hosted
   by Space and Earth Sciences Director Dr. Charles Elachi and Deputy C o
   n g re s s m a n Director Larry Dumas, and was briefed on JPL's
   history, S c h i ff missions and operations; the mission control
   center; the latest results from the Galileo Millennium Mission; the
   Extra- visits Lab Terrestrial Materials Simulation Lab; and the field
   integrated and design operations (FIDO) rover. Schiff represents the
   27th congressional District, which includes JPL. At left, Elachi shows
   Schiff a model of Mars Global Surveyor. L TABLE, dinette, square glass
