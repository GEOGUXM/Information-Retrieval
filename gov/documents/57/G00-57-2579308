  Your EEO - so much more than resolving complaints

   We work with the Diversity Council to sponsor education on diversity
   with many programs throughout the year.

   The NIEHS Human Resources Management Branch has many programs to assist
   you as well. Their job vacancies page lists openings and programs to
   advance your career at NIEHS.

   Education is the great equalizer. Below are some outside links that may
   be of interest.
         Note: These outside links will cause you to leave our web page:
     * Adult Distance Education Internet Surf Shack - This page is the
       most complete listing of Internet educational opportunities here
       and around the world we have found. Some are free; some cost fees;
       but they all offer to increase your knowledge, skills and
       abilities, so important in qualifying for the position you desire.
       These courses range from High School completion to College credit.
     * Another job-education link we think will help you is the Department
       of Labor's Education Training Administration (ETA) with their many
       links to job opportunities and training.

   Additional outside links on various topics of interest are: Veteran's
   Information, the Health and Human Services Department workforce
   profile, HHS Diversity Initiative, and the NIH Work and Family Life
   Center.
