   EST Lab Logo Testing Fe-Air Battery
   The Energy Storage Technologies Laboratory offers controlled testing on
   batteries, fuel cells, ultra-capacitors, and mechanical flywheels under
   conditions typical of electric vehicle applications. Tests can be
   performed on small storage components as well as large multi-component
   storage systems. Additional testing functions include vibration
   testing, altitude chamber tests, gas rate tests, and impedance
   determinations. Test data are stored by the laboratory data acquisition
   system which is a real-time, multi-user, multi-tasking, and networked
   operating environment. The equipment available in the laboratory are:
   load bank, cycler testers, chargers, storage technology simulators,
   environmental chamber, shaker table, and video equipment.
