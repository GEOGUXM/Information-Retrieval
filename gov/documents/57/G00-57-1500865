   FCC APPROVES REORGANIZATION PORTION OF REFORM EFFORT
   Media, Wireline Competition, and Consumer and Governmental Affairs
   Bureaus Established; International Bureau Realigned
   Washington, DC - As part of its reform plan to make the FCC more
   effective, efficient and responsive, the Commission yesterday formally
   approved the reorganization of several of the agency's bureaus.

   The National Treasury Employees Union Local 209 has approved the
   reorganization. These changes are subject to Congressional notification
   before they become effective.

   In making these changes the Commission was guided by the following
   principles: develop a standardized organizational structure across the
   bureaus; move toward a functional alignment; reflect changes in
   regulation and workload; recognize that dynamic industry change will
   continue; and use the reorganization to improve the technical and
   economic analysis in decisionmaking.

   Changes under the reorganization include:
     * Media Bureau will be responsible for the policy and licensing
       programs for media services, including cable television, broadcast
       television and radio. It will handle matters pertaining to
       multichannel video programming distribution, broadcast radio and
       television, direct broadcast satellite service policy, and
       associated matters. It will conduct rulemakings, resolve waiver
       petitions and adjudications, and process applications for
       authorization, assignment, transfer and renewal of media services,
       including AM, FM, TV, the cable TV relay service, and related
       matters.
       The Bureau will be comprised of staff and functions from the
       current Mass Media Bureau and Cable Services Bureau and will
       consist of the following organizational units: Management and
       Resources Staff; Office of Communications and Industry Information;
       Policy Division; Industry Analysis Division; Engineering Division;
       Office of Broadcast License Policy; Audio Division; and Video
       Division.
     * Wireline Competition Bureau will be responsible for the policy
       programs of communications common carriers and ancillary operations
       (other than wireless telecommunications services). It will conduct
       rulemakings, resolve waiver petitions and adjudications, determine
       the lawfulness of carrier tariffs, act on applications for
       authorizations, administer accounting requirements for incumbent
       local exchange carriers, review carrier performance, and administer
       reporting requirements.
       The Wireline Competition Bureau will be comprised of staff and
       functions from the current Common Carrier Bureau and have the
       following organizational units: Administrative and Management
       Office; Competition Policy Division; Pricing Policy Division;
       Telecommunications Access Policy Division; and Industry Analysis
       and Technology Division.
     * Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau will be responsible for
       the consumer and governmental affairs policies to enhance the
       public's understanding of the Commission's work and to facilitate
       the FCC's relationships with other governmental agencies. It will
       conduct rulemakings, interact with the public, federal, state,
       local, tribal and other governmental agencies, oversee the
       Consumer/Disability Telecommunications Advisory Committee and the
       Local and State Government Advisory Committee, handle informal
       complaint resolution, handle consumer outreach and education, and
       maintain FCC filings.
       The Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau will be comprised of
       staff and functions from the current Consumer Information Bureau,
       Cable Services Bureau and Common Carrier Bureau, and will also
       handle cable services information functions currently performed in
       the Cable Services Bureau and some related rulemaking functions
       currently handled in the Common Carrier Bureau. It will have the
       following organizational units: Administrative and Management
       Office; Systems Support Office; Information Access and Privacy
       Office; Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division; Policy
       Division; Disabilities Rights Office; Consumer Affairs and Outreach
       Division; and Reference Information Center.
     * International Bureau will be realigned along functional lines, with
       consolidation of the international policy and spectrum rulemaking
       functions, and intergovernmental and regional leadership and
       planning functions, which are currently distributed throughout the
       Bureau. The International Bureau will have the following
       organizational units: Management and Administrative Staff; Policy
       Division; Satellite Division; and Strategic Analysis and
       Negotiations Division.
     * Other Organizational Changes: The Enforcement Bureau will handle
       pole attachment complaints and some multichannel video and cable
       television services complaints currently handled in the Cable
       Services Bureau. It will also handle common carrier audit
       functions. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau will handle
       instructional television fixed services and multipoint distribution
       services matters currently handled in the Mass Media Bureau. The
       Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs will be renamed
       the Office of Legislative Affairs.

   Action by the Commission January 16, 2002, by Order (FCC 02-10).
   Chairman Powell, and Commissioners Abernathy, Copps and Martin.
