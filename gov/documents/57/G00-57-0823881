    About SWPAO

   Approximately 20 million Californians depend on the State Water Project
   for at least part of their water needs. The State Water Project
   Analysis Office, or SWPAO, helps to ensure that they get that water. To
   deliver that water, we perform many administrative and financial
   functions, including:
     * Determining the costs of operating the State Water Project and
       billing the appropriate contracting agencies
     * Administering 29 long-term water supply contracts, including
       allocating water through various programs included in those
       contracts
     * Acquiring electrical power necessary to transport water
       Negotiating the use of State Water Project facilities by federal
       agencies, cities, and private companies who aren't long-term water
       supply contractors
     * Participating in various Department-related activities designed to
       facilitate the administration and operation of the State Water
       Project--developing cost-accounting systems or computer systems for
       compiling and tracking data on water deliveries, for example
