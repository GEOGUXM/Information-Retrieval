   STUDENT EXPERIMENTS FLY HIGH THANKS TO NASA

   A NASA education program will give high school students from across the
   country the opportunity for their dreams to literally take flight when
   experiments designed by the students fly on either a Space Shuttle or
   sub-orbital rocket.

   The four Space Shuttle and four rocket experiments were selected in a
   nationwide competition called the NASA Student Involvement Program
   (NSIP). NSIP is a national program of five competitions for grades 3 -
   12 that link students directly with NASA's exciting missions of
   exploration and discovery.

   Lynn Marra, NSIP Officer at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, said,
   The flight opportunities portion of this program provides for high
   school students to take their experiments beyond the classroom and into
   space. In addition, students work with an experiment throughout its
   life span from proposal, fabrication and flight through data analysis.

   The winning entrees were:
   Space Shuttle experiments
   Mechanical Resonators in SpaceAgoura High School, Agoura, Calif.
   Artemia Space Launch Experiment DuVal High School, Lanham, Md.
   Aeroponics: Food Cultivation in Space Glenbrook North High School,
   Northbrook, Ill. Laminar Fluid Flow in Microgravity The Northwest
   School, Seattle, Wash.
   Suborbital Rocket experiments
   Environment Glenbrook North High School The Effects of High G Forces on
   Electric Motors The Northwest School Testing for Global Warming and
   Ozone Depletion Through Space Flight Opportunities Laramie Senior High
   School, Laramie, Wyo. Sub-orbital Film Radiation Exposure Experiment
   Lafayette High School, Brooklyn, N.Y. .

   In addition to flying their experiments, the student teams and an
   advisor will journey to the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia
   for one week in June. During the week they will work with NASA
   engineers and technicians to make the final preparations for flight and
   see the operations at the countrys oldest established launch range. In
   addition, rocket experiment students will take part in pre-launch
   reviews and, weather permitting, view their experiment lofted into
   space aboard an Orion suborbital rocket.
