                                SVS Projects

   At any particular time, the Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS) is
   involved in providing visualization products, systems, and expertise to
   various NASA projects and missions. This page briefly describes our
   current activities, with links to more information.

                       Earth Science Enterprise (ESE)
                             Informal Education

   Through this project, the members of the SVS create animations and
   imagery explaining current NASA missions and scientific results. For
   each visualization product, a team of scientists, writers, and
   animators work together to create products that can be used by the TV
   and print media, educators, museums, the public, and anyone else who
   might need to explain some NASA result. Most of the actual
   visualizations found on this web site are products of this project.

                    HPCC Earth and Space Science Project

   For the last decade, NASA has been a part of the Federal High
   Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program, fostering
   research and development in high performance information technology.
   The HPCC Earth and Space Science Project at Goddard works to facilitate
   the use of these technologies within the Earth and Space Science
   research community. The SVS supports this project by providing
   expertise in visualization to the researchers funded by the project and
   by investigating visualization technologies that can enable use of HPCC
   technologies in research. The SVS also creates a video production
   describing the project each year for the Supercomputing conference.

                             GLOBE Visualization

   Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) in
   an international program whose purpose in to involve the school
   children of the work in environmental monitoring and education. The SVS
   created the original on-line visualization system used by GLOBE
   students to investigate their data. A separate group was spun off to
   update and maintain this system and this group maintains close ties to
   the SVS.

                                 Earth Today

   Earth Today is an award-winning exhibition located in the Rocketry and
   Space Flight gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington
   DC. This exhibit continuously collects and displays animations of
   current data about the Earth. Members of the SVS created the animations
   and the software system used in the display. Work is in progress to
   generalize this system for use in other museums and public sites and to
   create a Digital Earth Data Server to serve the data to the distributed
   systems.

                                Digital Earth

   The Digital Earth Initiative seeks to enable the creation of a global
   environment for the interchange and dissemination of geo-referenced
   information about the Earth. Members of the SVS created and maintain
   the Digital Earth Workbench, which was one of the early technologies
   that fostered the Digital Earth concept. Both the GLOBE Visualization
   system and the Earth Today system are Digital Earth systems in that
   they comply with emerging Digital Earth standards and protocols.

                                  Missions

   The SVS directly supports individual NASA missions by creating specific
   visualization products and systems. At this time, the SVS is working
   with the following projects:
   The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM): The SVS produces
   precipitation maps and three-dimensional storm flybys from TRMM data.

   The Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA): The SVS is visualizing the
   surface of Mars from MOLA topography data. Final visuals will be
   available in 2001 when the MOLA dataset is released to the public.

   The NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project (NSIPP): The SVS is
   developing methods for visualizing the multi-variable three-dimensional
   data that results from the NSIPP coupled land-ocean-atmosphere model.
