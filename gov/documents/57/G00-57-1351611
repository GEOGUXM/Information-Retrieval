  Background

   Regional, national and international leaders in business and government
   will attend The Chattanooga Summit May 28-31, 1996 at the Chattanooga
   Trade Center. The Summit is an economic development conference
   sponsored by Chattanooga's U.S. Congressman Zach Wamp. The Summit
   encompasses the World Congress on Zero Emissions, held last year in
   Tokyo, an international scientific meeting on natural resource
   productivity in manufacturing. Summit presentations on manufacturing,
   environment, strategic conferencing and research will highlight
   Chattanooga's successful initiatives and announce new commitments that
   will move the community forward in each area. Several hundred attendees
   are expected from throughout the U.S. and from abroad, with several
   thousand more expected to participate in the World Congress over the
   Internet.

  Summit At A Glance

  Vision

   East Tennessee's "Technology Corridor" is forging the model for
   America's 21st Century economy. From Chattanooga to Oak Ridge/Knoxville
   to the Tri-Cities, working partnerships between the public and private
   sectors of the region are sharing resources to create jobs and
   opportunity. Setting the example, East Tennessee is clearly the place
   to live and do business.

  Mission

   The Summit will demonstrate Chattanooga's entrepreneurial leadership in
   the "Technology Corridor", build regional relationships, focus on
   linking the resources of East Tennessee to the world, and showcase the
   model for sustainable communities.
