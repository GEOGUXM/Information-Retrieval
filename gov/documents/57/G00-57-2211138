Welcome, Educators

   Welcome to the NASA, Office of Space Science, Sun-Earth Connection
   Education Forum!

   You probably got here because someone mentioned a great web site for
   finding new classroom resources about the Sun and Earth system. You may
   also have found our web address on any of a number of printed resources
   we have distributed to educators over the last few years. We at SECEF
   are dedicated to making your stay with us a fast and easy means of
   getting the latest, high-quality classroom resources that are available
   anywhere within the entire NASA organization.

   At this site, you will find our extensive--and growing--Resource
   Directory, containing hundreds of "ready-to-go" classroom activities
   and products that have been extensively field tested and evaluated. You
   will find the web sites of all NASA missions that study the Sun and
   Earth's space environment. You will find an active "Ask a Scientist"
   sites from participating NASA missions, as well as collections of
   images, movies and artwork that will enhance and update your classroom
   learning environment.

   Please visit SECEF and our participating NASA missions to learn about
   the latest discoveries in solar-terrestrial science, and how you can
   use them to excite your students.
