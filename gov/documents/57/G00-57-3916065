                     The Office of Hearings and Appeals
                       Will Handle Dispute Resolution

   On November 24, 1999, the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, signed
   a final rule establishing the Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention
   Program. The rule creates Part 850 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal
   Regulations. Under section 850.5, the Office of Hearings and Appeals
   will resolve disputes that arise under the program. This section
   appears on page 68906 of the Federal Register notice, which you can see
