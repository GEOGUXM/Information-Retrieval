   Canada's Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) Program has announced
   the availability of some new summary publications. MEND has produced
   about two hundred technical reports and workshop notes since 1987.
   These reports are available in paper format from the MEND Secretariat
   in Ottawa. Abstracts for many of the reports are available on the
   MEND2000 website.

   The MEND Manual (Report 5.4.2) is now available for distribution in
   hard copy format. The objective of the manual was to summarize work
   completed by MEND in a format that would provide practitioners in
   Canadian industry and government with a manageable single reference
   document. The document is not a "How to" manual. It is a set of
   comprehensive working references for the sampling and analyses,
   prediction, prevention, control, treatment and monitoring of acidic
   drainage. The document provides information on chemistry, engineering,
   economics, case studies and scientific data for mine and mill
   operators, engineering design and environmental staff, consulting
   engineers, universities and governments.

     MEND 5.4.2a Volume 1 - Summary, March 2001.
     MEND 5.4.2b Volume 2 - Sampling and Analyses, January 2001.
     MEND 5.4.2c Volume 3 - Prediction, December 2000.
     MEND 5.4.2d Volume 4 - Prevention and Control, March 2001.
     MEND 5.4.2e Volume 5 - Treatment, December 2000.
     MEND 5.4.2f Volume 6 - Monitoring, December 2000.
