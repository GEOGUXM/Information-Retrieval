   Engineering Technology Reports

   The FY00 Engineering Technology Reports describe work performed in
   Engineering. Each report is a journal-like article reflecting different
   projects and research in five technology areas: communication
   technology, precision engineering, accelerators and high-energy
   physics, computations and numerical simulation, and complex systems and
   information technology.

   The reports are organized into two volumes: Laboratory Directed
   Research and Development (Volume 1) and Technology Base (Volume 2).
   File sizes for the two volumes are 3.33 MB for Volume 1 and 11.08 MB
   for Volume 2.
