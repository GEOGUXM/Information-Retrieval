                              ABOUT  THIS  SITE

   The focus of this gateway is to provide information on the hundreds of
   services and programs that are available from Federal, City of Chicago
   and State of Illinois agencies. There are even some references to
   County agencies in the collar counties.

   Our goal is to compile information about specific program/service areas
   and present helpful information by cutting across agency and
   governmental lines. We hope that this will provide quick and easy
   access to the information you need.

   This project is sponsored by the Chicago Federal Executive Board with
   the cooperation and assistance of the City of Chicago and State of
   Illinois. The Chicago Federal Executive Board is composed of the heads
   of the various Federal agencies and departments located in the Chicago
   area.

   The concept of Federal Executive Boards was introduced by President
   John F. Kennedy in 1961. Today, twenty-eight Federal Executive Boards
   exist to provide closer coordination among Federal agencies outside
   Washington, D.C. As regional hubs for all government activity, their
   work relates to five mission themes:
     * COMMUNICATE: Inform member agencies of each other's initiatives and
       successes, and inform the local community of national policies and
       priorities.
     * REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY: Bring together agencies with
       common goals so that their efforts are complementary.
     * FACILITATE SERVICE DELIVERY: Draw together agencies with common
       clients so that government services are convenient for the
       customers.
     * PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS: Partner with community groups to
       solve problems.
     * COORDINATE EMERGENCY SERVICES: Stand ready to marshal resources of
       the entire federal community, whether to aid a member agency in a
       crisis, or to assist the citizenry in a public emergency.

   This site is administered as a public service by the web development
   team at the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board. Please send any comments on
   how we can improve this site, or if you encountered any problems.
