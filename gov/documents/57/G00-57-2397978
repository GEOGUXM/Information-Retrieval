   Disaster Unemployment Assistance
   Purpose
   Disaster Unemployment Assistance provides financial assistance to
   individuals whose employment or self-employment has been lost or
   interrupted as a direct result of a major disaster declared by the
   President of the United States. Before an individual can be determined
   eligible for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, it must be established
   that the individual is not eligible for regular unemployment insurance
   benefits (either State or Federal benefits). The program is
   administered by States as agents of the Federal government.
   Eligibility
   Disaster Unemployment Assistance is available to unemployed U.S.
   nationals and qualified aliens who worked or were self-employed if
   they:
     * worked or were self-employed in or were scheduled to begin work or
       self-employment in an area declared as a Federal disaster area.
     * can no longer work or perform services as a direct result of a
       disaster.
     * establish that the work or self-employment they can no longer
       perform was their primary source of income.
     * do not qualify for regular unemployment insurance benefits from any
       State.
     * can not perform work or self-employment because of an injury or
       because they were incapacitated as a direct result of the disaster.
     * became the breadwinner or major support of a household because of
       the death of the head of the household.

   Suffering a monetary loss due to damage of property or crops does not
   automatically entitle an individual to Disaster Unemployment
   Assistance.
   Benefits
   Disaster Unemployment Assistance is available to individuals for weeks
   of unemployment beginning after the date the major disaster began and
   for up to 26 weeks after the major disaster was declared by the
   President, as long as their unemployment continues to be a result of
   the major disaster.
   The maximum weekly benefit amount is determined under the provisions of
   the State law for unemployment insurance in the State where the
   disaster occurred.
   Filing a Claim
   Claims should be filed in accordance with the State's instructions
   published in announcements about the availability of Disaster
   Unemployment Assistance, or contact the State Unemployment Insurance
   agency.
