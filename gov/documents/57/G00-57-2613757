   An international research consortium has taken a substantial short cut
   to the biologically important information embedded in the human genome
   with the completion of a draft sequence of the genome of the Japanese
   pufferfish Fugu rubripes. The Fugu draft sequence will be announced at
   the 13th International Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference in San
   Diego, California on October 26th.
   Although the Fugu genome contains essentially the same genes and
   regulatory sequences as the human genome, it carries those genes and
   regulatory sequences in approximately 365 million bases as compared to
   the 3 billion bases that make up human DNA. With far less so-called
   junk DNA to sort through, finding genes and controlling sequences in
   the Fugu genome should be a much easier task. The information can then
   be used to help identify these same elements in the human genome. This
   Fugu draft sequence is the first public assembly of an animal genome by
   the whole genome shotgun sequencing method.
   The consortium which sequenced the Fugu genome was led by the US
   Department of Energys Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in Walnut Creek,
   California, and the Singapore Biomedical Research Councils Institute
   for Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB). Also part of the consortium are
   the MRC UK Human Genome Mapping Resource Centre (HGMP-RC), in
   Cambridge, England, the Cambridge University Department of Oncology,
   and the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington. The
   consortiums sequencing efforts were bolstered by two US companies,
   Celera Genomics of Rockville, Maryland and Myriad Genetics, Inc. of
   Salt Lake City, Utah.
   The Fugu genome project was initiated in 1989 by Sydney Brenner in
   Cambridge, England, along with his colleagues Greg Elgar, Samuel
   Aparicio, and Byrappa Venkatesh. Brenner is known for his work in
   molecular genetics and for the establishment of C. elegans (the worm)
   as a model organism. Formed in November 2000, the International Fugu
   Genome Consortium represents one of the largest international
   genome-sequencing projects since the historic Human Genome Project. The
   goal of the consortium is to sequence, assemble, annotate, and
   ultimately finish the Fugu genome, and disseminate the information to
   the greater research community.
   Brenner, now a Distinguished Professor at The Salk Institute for
   Biological Studies in San Diego and Board Director of the Singapore
   Biomedical Research Council, said, This represents the culmination of
   more than a decade of work in Cambridge and Singapore. Without JGIs
   initiative and Singapores strong support, the project would have
   languished. We already know that it will illuminate the human genome
   sequence and help us to understand it.
   All organisms are related, said Trevor Hawkins, Director of the Joint
   Genome Institute, which is one of the largest publicly funded genome
   sequencing centers in the world and itself a consortium operated
   jointly by the three University of California-managed DOE national
   laboratories, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos.
   Although the Fugu genome is only one-eighth the size of our human
   genome, it has a similar complement of genes. Yet we know very little
   about the structure of those genes and how they are turned on and off.
   Thats why were sequencing genomes of microbes, sea squirts and now
   Fugubecause these comparative genomics programs are key to
   understanding the biology of the human genome.
   A whole genome shotgun strategy was employed to sequence the Fugu
   genome. We first chopped the genome up into pieces that are small
   enough to sequence, said Dan Rokhsar, Associate Director for
   Computational Genomics at the JGI. The challenge was then to
   reassemble the genome by putting together nearly four million of these
   overlapping fragmentsin the same way that youd put together a giant
   jigsaw puzzle. Solving this puzzle was made possible by a new
   computational algorithm, JAZZ, that has been developed at JGI to handle
   large genome sequencing projects. This method has also been implemented
   at the DOEs National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center
   (NERSC)the worlds largest supercomputer dedicated to unclassified
   research.
   Chris Tan, founding Director of IMCB, says that the draft Fugu genome
   will yield much more accurate estimates of the gene repertoire in
   humans. We will also now be able to refine many of the features of the
   non-coding regions that may prove to have regulatory control over genes
   expressed in the human genome. Singapore IMCB is already leveraging
   the genome sequence through the creation of a live Fugu genome
   bioinformatics analysis pipeline producing annotations and comparisons
   for the community. Tan anticipates that over the next few years the
   Singapore group and the Institute for Systems Biology will finish
   selected regions of the genome, based upon their biology programs. Tan
   added, The IMCBs participation in the Consortium and contribution to
   this important project is testimony that Singapore has a key role to
   play in the international biomedical sciences scene.
   The Consortium intends to publish an initial analysis of the draft Fugu
   genome early next year. Up to date Fugu sequence information can be
   freely accessed via JGIs web portal at http://Fugu.jgi-psf.org, at the
   IMCB website http://www.fugu-sg.org, and at the MRC UK HGMP Fugu site
   http://fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk. Additional Fugu information can be found at
   http://www.jgi.doe.gov/programs/fugu.htm and in the Fugu Fact sheet.
