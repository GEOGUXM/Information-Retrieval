Guide to Popular USGS Geospatial Data Products
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here's a list of some of the most popular digital geospatial data set
   collections from USGS:

  Mapping Data

   USGS DEM's Digital Elevation Models (DEM's). Digital records of terrain
              elevations for ground positions at regularly spaced horizontal
              intervals which are derived from 7.5-minute, 15-minute, 30- by
              60-minute, and 1-degree (1:250,000-scale) quadrangle maps.

   USGS DLG's Digital Line Graphs (DLG) Digital representations by points,
   lines and areas of planimetric information derived from 7.5- and
   15-minute scale topographic quadrangle maps (large-scale); 30- by
   60-minute intermediate scale maps; and 1:2 million-scale (small scale)
   sectional National Atlas maps.

   USGS Digital Satellite Images Digital Satellite Images. Digital images
   of the United States from the Earth Resources Observation System (EROS)
   Data Center, including Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
   useful for tracking vegetation growth on a regional basis. Also LANDSAT
   Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS) digital data.

   USGS Maps Maps. Guide to the major map series offered by USGS,
             including the popular topographic maps and geologic maps.

  Geologic Data

   USGS Geologic Data Geologic Data. Earthquake, volcano, and landslide
   hazards research, geologic framework and process studies, global change
   research, marine and coastal geologic surveys, and mineral and energy
   resource surveys.

  Water Resources Data

   USGS Water Data Hydrologic Unit Maps. Digital maps delineating the
                   hydrographic boundaries of major river basins and showing
                   identification codes assigned to each river basin.

   USGS Water Data Water Resources Information. How to find water data,
                   plus maps of rivers and reservoirs.

  Biologic Resources Data

   USGS Biologic Data National Biological Information Infrastructure
   (NBII) Metadata Clearinghouse. The NBII Metadata Clearinghouse is an
   initiative to help locate, evaluate, and access biological data and
   information from a distributed network of cooperating data and
   information sources.

   USGS Biologic Data USGS - NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. To obtain
   uniform, consistent baseline data on the composition and distribution
   of vegetation cover types for each of the National Park Service (NPS)
   units in the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program.

   USGS Biologic Data GAP Analysis Program. A geographic approach to
   planning for biological diversity. The purpose of the Gap Analysis
   Program is to provide broad geographic information on the status of
   species and their habitats in order to provide land managers, policy
   makers, and others with the information they need to make
   better-informed decisions.

   USGS Biologic Data Land Use History of North America (LUHNA). Learning
   from the past in order to manage our future environment. The goal of
   the LUHNA program is to understand the relationship between human land
   use and land cover change, and incorporate this understanding into an
   assessment of implications for future land management decisions.

   USGS Biologic Data Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends
   (BEST). The BEST Program evaluates environmental contaminants and their
   effects on lands and species under the stewardship of the Department of
   the Interior.

   USGS Biologic Data North American Breeding Bird Survey. The BBS Home
   Page is a source of information about distributions and population
   trends of North American birds. It is also a tool for learning about
   birds in general.

   USGS Biologic Data Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program. A national
                      information resource for accurate and spatially referenced
                      biogeographic accounts of nonindigenous aquatic species.

  Special Regional Studies

   USGS Regional Studies Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri Data Base.
                         Used for studying the "Great Flood of '93!"
