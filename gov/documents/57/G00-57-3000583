Publications

   The South Florida Ecosystem program has a variety of publications
   available to you on our site. We have three different forms of
   publications: fact sheets, open file reports, and posters. Fact Sheets
   communicate a wide variety of information about South Florida Ecosystem
   programs, projects, and data, and how they address issues of public
   interest and concern. The Open-File Report series is designed for
   release of basic data, preliminary reports, and a wide range of
   scientific documents on SFEP investigations and research. Posters
   usually convey more specific information, such as maps of various data
   collection areas.

   Please use the links below to explore South Florida Ecosystem
