                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAII
                      INFORMATION ON FILING BANKRUPTCY
                             WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY

   The Bankruptcy Court receives numerous calls from persons asking for
   information about filing bankruptcy cases without an attorney. This
   pamphlet answers some of the most frequently asked questions.
   Is bankruptcy the best way to deal with financial problems? The
   Bankruptcy Code provides relief for persons with financial problems,
   but no one should file a bankruptcy case without exploring other
   options for dealing with these problems. Bankruptcy may not be an
   effective method of dealing with certain types of debt [e.g., taxes,
   student loans or other types of non-dischargeable debt] and a
   bankruptcy filing could have a severe impact on your ability to get
   credit for many years in the future. Therefore, it is important to
   consult with credit counseling professionals before making the decision
   to file a bankruptcy case. Credit counseling services are available
   from many sources. Attorneys and credit counseling centers can give
   advice on dealing with financial problems. Credit counseling services
   may be provided without charge, and some credit unions offer free
   counseling to their members. Members of the military and their
   dependants should check with the family service center or legal affairs
   office to determine what counseling assistance is available. In
   general, bankruptcy should be considered as a last resort after other
   methods of dealing with financial problems have failed.
   Is it possible to file a bankruptcy case without an attorney? Yes.
   Current law permits individuals to file their own cases and to
   represent their own interests in bankruptcy proceedings. However, it
   may not be wise to do so. Any bankruptcy case can become a complicated
   matter requiring both knowledge of the law and experience before the
   court to successfully complete. In order to fill out the forms required
   to file a case, you will need to know (among other things) the
   differences between the types of bankruptcies which can be filed, the
   types of exemptions which can be taken and the differences between
   secured and unsecured debts. As a case progresses through the court
   many other areas of law and knowledge may be involved. Decisions made
   without an understanding of basic bankruptcy law can have serious
   consequences including the loss of property and legal rights. Only an
   attorney may file a bankruptcy for a partnership or corporation. Even
   if an individual is the sole shareholder or the managing partner, that
   person may not represent the corporation or partnership before the
   bankruptcy court.
   Can the Bankruptcy Court help me? The staff of the court is prohibited
   from giving legal advice. This means that we cannot assist you in
   completing forms or deciding the type of bankruptcy you should file. If
   you decide to file a bankruptcy case without an attorney, you will be
   on your own. The court will expect you to follow the same rules and
   procedures as attorneys are required to follow.
   What types of bankruptcies are available to an individual debtor? An
   individual may file a chapter 7, 11, 12 or 13 case. Chapter 7 is the
   most common and is the type of bankruptcy with which most people are
   familiar. A trustee is appointed in a chapter 7 for the purpose of
   selling property of the debtor which is not exempt under federal or
   state law. The trustee then pays the money to creditors. Anyone
   thinking of filing a chapter 7 case should learn which types of
   property can be exempted under state and federal law. Chapter 13
   permits debtors who have a regular source of income to file a plan for
   payment of some or all of their debts over a period of 3-5 years.
   Chapter 13 is often used to cure defaults on mortgages in order to save
   a house, and it may be used to pay some debts which are not
   dischargeable under chapter 7. When payments under the plan are
   completed, the debtor receives a discharge of the balance of the
   pre-petition debts. Chapter 11 is used primarily by operating
   businesses and is almost never used by an individual consumer debtor. A
   chapter 11 case is much more complicated and much more expensive than
   the other types of bankruptcy. The filing fee alone is $830.00. There
   is more detailed information about how each of the bankruptcy chapters
   in bankruptcy work. Click on the hyperlinks below for:

   Where can I get more information? Books are published which attempt to
   explain the bankruptcy process to people who wish to file cases without
   attorneys. These do-it-yourself guides usually explain the differences
   between the types of bankruptcies, and they discuss the issues to be
   considered when filing a case. They contain samples of forms which can
   be used to solve various problems. These guides are available in most
   bookstores and many public libraries. Since the bankruptcy law changes
   often, it is important to read books which are current. Do not depend
   upon information in any book which was not published within the last
   few years. There is a major revision of the Bankruptcy Code being
   considered. If these changes are passed by Congress, all books and
   other resource materials published before the revisions will be out of
   date. None of these books can supply you with the experience, knowledge
   or skill of a bankruptcy professional.
   Where can I get the forms to file a case? You can download the forms
   from this web site. See the information in the next section. If this is
   not possible then you can buy the forms at some stores. Office supply
   stores often sell legal forms. These stores stock packages of
   bankruptcy forms which include the petition, schedules and other forms
   necessary to file a case. Volunteer Legal Services Hawaii sells forms
   for filing chapter 7 cases only [Call 808-528-7046 or 1-800-839-5200
   from out islands]. Fisher Hawaii sells packages of forms [7 and 13] at
   the stores at 450 Cooke St. and 1025 Alakea St. [524-8770]. Forms, Inc.
   sells forms which they will mail to you from the mainland [Call
   800-854-1080]. Forms packages usually cost less than $10.00. There will
   be forms in these packages that you should not use. See the checklists
   for filing cases. The bankruptcy court neither stocks nor sells the
   petition, schedules or the statement of affairs.
   Will the package of forms that I buy have all of the necessary forms
   and instructions for filing a case in Hawaii? Probably not. We have
   local rules for preparing the mailing matrix which you must submit with
   your case. We require that you use our local form for a chapter 13 plan
   and we have many local rules concerning preparation of chapter 13
   cases. We require pro se debtors [i.e., debtors who are not represented
   by an attorney] to use a local reaffirmation agreement and we require
   that such debtors file a motion for approval of these agreements. We
   have suggested procedures and forms to use when amending a petition or
   amending schedules to add creditors. We also have checklists for filing
   cases which will tell you the number of copies of each document to send
   to the court when you file a case. Click on the hyperlinks below to
   access the documents which you need. These are .pdf files and you will
   need Adobe Acrobat to open the files. If you do not have this on your
   computer you can download Adobe Acrobat Reader.

   Where do I file a bankruptcy case? You may file a case in person by
   bringing the completed forms to 1132 Bishop St., Suite 250 L, Honolulu,
   HI. You may also mail the forms to the court. If you mail the forms be
   sure that you go over the checklist for the appropriate case [see
   above] and send the court the documents required with the number of
   copies stated on the checklist.
   Must all the documents be filed together? The court will accept a
   bankruptcy filing without the Schedules [A-J], Statement of Affairs, or
   the Chapter 13 Plan. These documents are due 15 days from the date on
   which you filed the petition. If you do not file these documents on
   time, the court may dismiss your case and may also bar you from filing
   another bankruptcy petition for 180 days. The Statement of Intentions
   is due 30 days after the petition is filed.
   Must all assets and debts be listed in the schedules and statement of
   affairs? The bankruptcy process requires debtors to disclose all assets
   and debts. Severe penalties are imposed on debtors who refuse to
   cooperate with the trustee or the court and who are dishonest in
   disclosing necessary information. Actions taken by a debtor to hide
   assets or to transfer property to friends or relatives may result in
   either a denial of the debtor's discharge or attempts by the trustee to
   recover the property for creditors. Attempts to hide property from the
   trustee may also result in a criminal prosecution. Do not file a
   bankruptcy case unless you plan to be totally open and honest about all
   aspects of your finances.
   Are there any sources of free legal assistance? Yes, but not to
   everyone. Legal Aid Society of Hawaii will represent persons who meet
   their income guidelines. Most debtors are given assistance in preparing
   their own petitions through workshops [call 536-4302 on O'ahu] but full
   representation is available in some instances. Volunteer Legal Services
   Hawaii also conducts workshops on filing bankruptcies. They refer some
   indigent persons to attorneys who will provide free legal services.
   [Call 528-7046 or 1-800-839-5200 from outer islands] The Honolulu
   Lawyers Referral Service [537-0140] gives callers the names of several
   attorneys who have indicated an interest in bankruptcy law. The fees
   charged by these attorneys are not regulated by the Service and are
   likely to be the standard fees charged by each attorney.
   What about using a Petition Preparer? There are a number of individuals
   in Hawaii who run businesses which assist debtors in filing bankruptcy
   petitions and other forms for a fee. These people will help debtors by
   taking information supplied by the debtors and creating the forms
   necessary for filing a bankruptcy case. They often create well executed
   forms and they are often helpful in explaining general procedures. They
   are not attorneys and are not allowed to give legal advice as part of
   their services. They cannot represent debtors in court.
   How much does it cost to file bankruptcy? The filing fee for a chapter
   13 is $185.00, and the fee for a chapter 7 is $200.00. Filing fees may
   not be waived at this time. The filing fee in a chapter 7 case may be
   paid in 4 (or less) installments over 120 days if an application to pay
   by installments is filed with the case. This form is available in the
   forms section of our web page. Only individual debtors may pay fees in
   installments. Applications to pay fees in installments in chapter 12
   and 13 cases are not usually granted. The filing fees are in addition
   to any legal fees charged by a professional for services in preparing a
   bankruptcy case and for legal advice.
   Will filing a bankruptcy stop creditors from collection actions and
   from calling me? The filing of a bankruptcy action will stop almost all
   acts to collect debts which were due at the time of filing, including
   law suits, repossessions and foreclosures. However, some creditors may
   request the bankruptcy court to allow them to proceed with an eviction
   or a repossession or a foreclosure after the case is filed. The
   bankruptcy law may permit such actions to continue even after the case
   is filed.
   How are creditors notified of the bankruptcy? When a bankruptcy is
   filed, the debtor gives the court a mailing matrix which is used by the
   court to notify creditors of the filing of the bankruptcy. A notice is
   mailed by the court which informs creditors of the date for the meeting
   of creditors. It is usually received by creditors within a week of the
   filing of the petition.
   Are there any debts which are not discharged by a bankruptcy? Yes. The
   Bankruptcy Code makes alimony, child support, criminal fines and
   penalties, judgments resulting from death or personal injury against a
   person who was driving while impaired and most taxes non-dischargeable.
   These debts are still owed after the bankruptcy case has ended. Most
   guaranteed student loans are not discharged unless the debtor files a
   separate legal action seeking a hardship discharge of these loans. In
   addition, certain creditors can ask the bankruptcy court to find their
   debts not dischargeable if the debts were incurred due to the fraud or
   misrepresentation of the debtor [and for other reasons stated in
   Section 523 and 727 of the Bankruptcy Code]. You should be aware that
   the filing of a bankruptcy case may not prevent a mortgage foreclosure
   or repossession of a car. If you are filing a bankruptcy to prevent a
   secured creditor from taking such actions, you should not do so without
   getting legal advice on how the bankruptcy will affect these actions.
   What is a discharge? The goal of most people who file bankruptcy is to
   get a discharge of some or all of their debts. In a chapter 7 case all
   debts which can be discharged (see discussion above) will be discharged
   approximately four months from the time the case is filed. In a chapter
   13 case, those debts which were not paid under the plan will be
   discharged when all payments have been made as required by the plan.
   Will the bankruptcy affect my credit rating? Yes. The record of your
   bankruptcy may appear on your credit report for as long as 10 years
   after the date on which the bankruptcy was filed. It may be very
   difficult to borrow money as long as this information appears on the
   report.
