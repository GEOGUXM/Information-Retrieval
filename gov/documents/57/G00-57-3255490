   NDBC has compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ)
   posed to NDBC personnel
   by the many users of NDBC data. If the answer provided does not
   completely answer your question,
   or if your question is not listed, please contact the Webmaster.

    Station Locations

     * What are C-Man stations?
     * Can you describe the moored buoys?
     * How are the stations' ID numbers created?
     * What are PSOS stations?

    Sensors and Measurements

     * Do NDBC's meteorological and oceanographic sensors measure data for
       the entire hour?
     * What is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)?
     * Does NDBC measure ocean current velocities?
     * Are the sensors used at NDBC sites periodically calibrated?
     * What are the sensors reporting, sampling, and accuracy readings?
     * At what heights are the sensors located on Moored Buoy and at C-MAN
       sites?
     * Have the characteristics of our measurements changed through the
       period of record?

    Wind Measurements

     * What are "continuous wind" measurements?
     * What averaging procedures are performed on the wind measurements?
     * How does NDBC adjust C-MAN and buoy wind speed observations to a
       standard height?

    Wave Measurements

     * How are spectral wave data derived from buoy motion measurements?
     * How are significant wave height, dominant period, and wave
       steepness calculated?
     * At what stations do we measure directional waves?
     * How are estimates of wind-seas and swell made from NDBC wave data?
     * How have the wave measurements changed through the period of
       record?

    Data Transmission and Quality Control

     * How do the measured data get from the buoy or C-MAN site to the
       various users worldwide?
     * Are the data quality controlled at any point in the process?
     * How do you decode real-time data?
     * How can we hear NDBC observations over the phone?
     * What are the alternate sources of real-time marine observations?

    NDBC Programs and Information

     * What is NDBC?
     * What is NDBC's Mission?
     * What is NDBC's History?
     * What are some recent developments at NDBC?
     * Who may I contact at NDBC for answers to my questions?
     * Where can I find statistics about this web site?
