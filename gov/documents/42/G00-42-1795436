   Geotechnical Engineering and Research (EES-7)
   Group Leader: Mark T. Peters | Group Members
   Description

   EES-7, a group of 17 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support
   staff, is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Group activities center around
   efforts related to the DOE Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
   (YMP), and many activities take place directly at the Yucca Mountain
   site, approximately 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The EES-7 Test
   Coordination Office (TCO) team is responsible for planning and
   coordinating all YMP field and laboratory tests, which are conducted
   under a fully qualified DOE Quality Assurance Program and an M&O safety
   and health plan, following the principles of Integrated Safety
   Management.

   Planning by the TCO is documented using field work packages (FWPs), in
   which specific responsibilities for each test are assigned. These
   responsibilities include facility design and construction interfaces,
   management roles and responsibilities, requirements, ES&H controls, and
   field activity budget and schedules. Currently, there are over thirty
   active FWPs that control and implement surface-based and underground
   testing activities being conducted at Yucca Mountain by scientists from
   the National Laboratories, universities, and the U.S. Gelogical Survey.
   The TCO is a unique team of multidisciplinary individuals ranging from
   physicists and chemists to engineers and technicians, all of whom have
   a thorough understanding of the YMP scientific program. They apply
   their knowledge to the test-planning process, closely coordinating
   their work with design engineers, construction personnel, and
   experimentalists.


   Programs and Projects at Yucca Mountain
   Thermal Testing - The Drift Scale Test (DST) is a large-scale, in-situ
   thermal test to be conducted over nearly a decade in the ESF. The
   overall objective of the DST is to acquire a more in-depth
   understanding of the physical processes that will occur in the rock
   surrounding the emplaced waste. There are four principal processes of
   concern: thermal, mechanical, hydrological, and chemical. These
   processes will be intensified because of the decay heat from the
   emplaced waste and the interaction or coupling. An understanding of
   these coupled processes is essential for the assessment of the
   long-term performance of the repository.

   Exploratory Studies Facility - The ESF is approximately 5 miles (7.877
   km) long and 25 feet in diameter. Excavation of the ESF tunnel began in
   April 1993, and a tunnel boring machine was used to complete excavation
   in April 1997. Our responsibilities during ESF construction included
   maintaining a design-to-construction-to-testing interface, which
   allowed complex testing activities to be fielded in a construction
   environment.

   Enhanced Characterization of the Repository Block - The east-west
   cross-drift tunnel is located off the left rib of the ESF north ramp,
   1,992 meters from the ESF north portal. The cross drift is 16 feet in
   diameter and approximately 2,700 meters long. Studies include
   monitoring drift convergence; mapping geologic features; collecting
   rock samples; coring, logging, and instrumentation of boreholes to
   monitor moisture penetration in the rock mass; and hydrologic and
   thermal testing in alcoves and niches. EES-7 is responsible for
   coordinating testing activities throughout the excavation.

   Surfaced-Based Drilling and Coring Operations - Researchers conducting
   surface-based activities collect and analyze data from hydrologic,
   geologic, and geochemical studies to understand the natural processes
   under ambient conditions. Surface-based testing is performed primarily
   in boreholes but also includes surface pits/trenches, outcrop mapping,
   and seismic monitoring. Core-science data collection and long-duration
   testing results formed the scientific basis for the YMP Viability
   Assessment and the upcoming Site Recommendation.

   Busted Butte Test Facility - The properties and behavior of the
   unsaturated zone at Busted Butte, Nevada, are being investigated in the
   context of siting a high-level radioactive waste disposal facility at
   Yucca Mountain. An underground transport test facility has been sited,
   designed, and constructed in Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site (NTS),
   approximately 8 km southeast of the potential repository area. The test
   involves the use of radionuclide and colloid analogs consisting of a
   mix of conservative and reactive tracers and polystyrene microspheres.
   Electrical-resistance tomography, ground-penetrating radar, and neutron
   logging are used to determine the saturation state of the block before
   and during testing.

   Recent Accomplishments

   During this reporting period we have managed a number of field tests
   and other activities. Our major responsibilities include managing (1)
   drilling/testing of a 2800 foot-deep-surface borehole in the potential
   repository block; (2) testing and post-test characterizing of the
   underground Busted Butte facility; (3) post-test drilling and
   characterizing of the Large Block Test location: (4) drilling and
   testing of surface boreholes for Nye County, Nevada; (5) constructing
   and testing of engineered barrier system options for the YMP Repository
   Design and Performance Assessment groups at the North Las Vegas DOE
   Facility: (6) continuing operation and maintenance of a
   six-thousand-channel data acquisition system to support the Drift Scale
   Test and smaller data collection systems for other YMP tests; and (7)
   planning activities for the future deployment of alcoves/niches and
   continued testing in the East-West Cross Drift constructed off the
   Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) one line from RHs.

   Underground testing in the ESF began in November 1992, with a testing
   program designed to support TBM construction-phase activities (mapping,
   drift stability, construction monitoring, sample collection) and
   in-situ hydrologic and thermal tests in seven alcoves and four niches.
   Similar alcove/niche construction and testing is being conducted in the
   east-west cross drift. Quarter-scale testing of engineered barrier
   system options at the North Las Vegas Facility began in 1998, and the
   testing results are providing key information to the ongoing design
   process and engineered barrier system process models. Data from the
   testing program are an integral component of the process models and the
   Total System Performance Assessment that will support the upcoming
   Yucca Mountain Site Recommendation in FY 2002. Descriptions of some
   major tests and facilities at Yucca Mountain follow.

   Vision for the Future
   EES-7 will continue to focus on test management and coordination to
   support field and laboratory testing at Yucca Mountain. We expect to
   continue to expand our leadership of saturated-zone modeling at Yucca
   Mountain, project management in the NTS Environmental Restoration
   program, and geotechnical/mining engineering in NTS underground
   activities. We will also focus on obtaining and maintaining a
   leadership position in the long-term performance confirmation program
   at Yucca Mountain and pursue opportunities in underground technology to
   support repository science and national-security thrusts.
