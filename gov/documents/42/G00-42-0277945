      2001 Regional Transportation Plan

   Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)

                          See related studies and reports

      At its monthly meeting on Dec. 19, 2001, MTC adopted the 2001 Regional
      Transportation Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area, which specifies how
      some $87 billion (2001 dollars) of anticipated federal, state and local
      transportation funds will be spent in the nine-county Bay Area during
      the next 25 years. The resolution approved the plan under the
      provisions of state law. Further action is expected in January 2002 to
      adopt the plan under the provisions of federal law, including a
      determination of the plan's conformity with federal air quality
      regulations.

      The plan sets aside nearly $11 billion for major new rail and bus
      projects that will improve mobility and enhance connectivity for
      residents throughout the region. This component of the plan is known as
      the Regional Transit Expansion Policy Program of Projects. Included are
      a BART extension from Fremont to San Jose and Santa Clara; a "Central
      Subway" that would extend the San Francisco Muni's Third Street light
      rail line to Chinatown; a BART connector to the Oakland Airport;
      electrification of the Caltrain route and extension of the line to
      downtown San Francisco; a significant downpayment on BART extensions or
      other rail improvements to Livermore and Antioch; the addition of
      several new regional express bus services; the replacement of the
      Transbay Terminal in San Francisco; and AC Transit rapid bus service
      linking Berkeley, Oakland and San Leandro.
      The Regional Transit Expansion Policy is the successor to MTC's
      Resolution No. 1876, which was adopted by the Commission in 1988 and
      delivered such critical projects as the BART extensions to
      Pittsburg/Bay Point and Dublin/Pleasanton, the Tasman light-rail
      extension in Silicon Valley, and the BART extension to the San
      Francisco International Airport, which is scheduled to open next year.
      Among the other initiatives that will receive funding through the plan
      are a Lifeline Transportation Network that will enhance low-income
      residents' access to the region's transit systems during both peak
      commute periods and off-peak hours; a two-year pilot program through
      which MTC will provide up to $1.73 million to subsidize bus passes for
      low-income students in the region; the TransLink® universal fare card
      now being tested on several Bay Area transit systems; the Freeway
      Service Patrol that assists motorists in distress on the region's
      freeways; rideshare programs that set up carpool/vanpool ride matches;
      and the TravInfo® traveler information service -- with a single
      regionwide phone number (817-1717) -- to provide up-to-the-minute
      traffic information and connect to transit agencies.

      The new Regional Transportation Plan provides funding for dozens of
      congestion relief projects on Bay Area freeways as well. These include
      a fourth bore for the Caldecott Tunnel; widening U.S. 101 from the
      Novato Narrows in Marin County to Windsor in Sonoma County;
      reconfiguring the Interstate 80/Interstate 680/Route 12 interchange in
      Fairfield; adding a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane to Interstate 680
      over the Sunol Grade; and widening U.S. 101 from Metcalf Road in San
      Jose to Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill. The plan also includes new
      bicycle and pedestrian trails around the Bay Area.
      While focused on mobility investments, the Regional Transportation Plan
      also triples funding for MTC land use-oriented initiatives such as the
      Transportation for Livable Communities program and the Housing
      Incentive Program that promote transit- and pedestrian-oriented
      development. These programs signify the plan's commitment to "smart
      growth" principles designed to address urban sprawl.
      Of the total $87.4 billion in transportation revenues that MTC
      anticipates coming to the Bay Area during the next quarter century, 77
      percent ($67.7 billion) is devoted to maintaining and operating the
      region's existing road, highway and transit network. The remaining 23%
      ($19.7 billion) provides for new projects or system expansion. Roughly
      77 percent of the total funding outlined in the plan will go to public
      transit--for operations, rehabilitation and expansion.
      The Regional Transportation Plan also includes a "Blueprint" section
      that envisions what could be accomplished if more money becomes
      available. One potential new source of funding is Proposition 42, which
      will appear on the statewide ballot in March 2002. The proposed state
      constitutional amendment would permanently dedicate 100 percent of the
      existing state sales tax on gasoline for transportation investments.
