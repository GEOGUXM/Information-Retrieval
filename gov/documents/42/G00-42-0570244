   Overview
        __________________________________________________________________

      The Bureau of Labor Statistics produces some international data and
      provides training for professionals and managers from the statistical
      offices of foreign countries and international agencies.

      Import and Export Prices

      The International Price Program measures changes in the prices of
      imported and exported goods and some services traded between the United
      States and the rest of the world.

      Foreign Labor Statistics

      The Foreign Labor Statistics program publishes comparative data on
      labor, compensation, productivity, consumer prices, and union
      membership in other countries.

      International Technical Cooperation

      The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a comprehensive program of
      training in statistical methods and practices for people from other
      countries who wish to emulate BLS practices for survey sampling, data
      collection, aggregation, estimation, and dissemination.

      At one time, the Bureau produced data on Foreign Direct Investment, but
   that program was discontinued.  Please visit the website of the Bureau
   of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce for more
   information.
