       Court of Appeals Case Searches
   Search All U.S. Court of Appeals Opinions on the Internet
       The collections of judicial opinions which this search engine
       searches are not maintained by the LII (or any other single
       institution or organization). As a result there is great variation
       in the extent of the collections from site to site; for example,
       the 5th Circuit collection extends back to 1986, whereas it is
       unusual for others to go back much further than 1995. File formats,
       titling practices, layout, and typography all vary widely and there
       may be significant gaps in some collections. Cornell updates the
       index regularly. The updating process takes about three days,
       because of the high volume of data which must be checked. Very,
       very recent cases will probably not appear in your search results.

   Federal Court Prison Litigation Project Revised Handbook
       This is a handbook for attorneys appointed by the United States
       District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to represent
       prisoners in litigation filed pro se. The Illinois Institute for
       Community Law, in conjunction with the District Court, has revised
       this handbook to provide information regarding correctional
       policies and procedures and the substantive and procedural rights
       of incarcerated persons, including several recent fundamental
       changes that have occurred since the last revision of the handbook.
       The handbook is intended to be of assistance to attorneys
       unfamiliar with prison procedures and prisoner litigation. However,
       as with any work of this type, attorneys should determine that all
       citations, statutes, and other information are correct as of the
       time the handbook is used. (Northern District of Illinois)

       List of links to city codes. Because this is one of the publishers

       an example, the city code for Fort Wayne, Indiana is on the city
