   Please complete and return this information as soon as possible so it
   may be approved and so that the broadcasters in your local FCC Area can
   order the appropriate EAS equipment. The SECC will write the COOs that
   constitute your plan and your part of the State EAS Plan. YOU DO NOT
   NEED TO WRITE A PLAN. The latter is the sum of its parts. Only your
   prompt completion of ALL parts of this questionnaire will make this
   possible! You are one of 25 Local Area committee chairs. The State Plan
   cannot be completed without your data. Your own Area EAS operation
   cannot be approved until your part of the State Plan is approved by the
   SECC.

    If replying by email, you may eliminate the "pencil in answer" lines
   and type in your reply. You may also delete any answers that do not
   apply, leaving only that which does apply.

    A. LP-1/LP-2 STATIONS

    1. You may be assigned multiple LP1 designations if there is one
   common EAS control point so that EAS messages may be transmitted
   simultaneously from one EAS decoder-encoder-receiver terminal to more
   than one station that is owned by the owner of the EAS terminal. If
   this applies to your LP1 station(s), be sure to complete all of the
   following:

    4. All other AM, FM TV stations and cable television companies shall
   monitor any two (2) stations: an LP1 and an LP2 listed above. If you
   have any exceptions or special circumstances that should be noted,
   please attach a separate explanation. Broadcast stations and CATV firms
   may receive other EAS audio inputs in addition to the two required
   broadcast stations. Stations bordering adjoining Local Areas are
   encouraged to monitor one of their (100% participating) stations and
   broadcast their EAS activations.

    B. TYPES OF EAS ACTIVATION FOR THIS LECC AREA

    1. All must carry the following (non-elective) EAS events:

    EAN National Emergency Activation Notification
   EAT National Emergency Action Termination
   NIC National Information Center
   NPT National Periodic Test
   RMT Required Monthly Test
   RWT Required Weekly Test

    2. Broadcast stations and CATV will carry the following (elective)
   events unless listed in an attachment labeled "ATTACHMENT B-2." Circle
   one:  YES NO

   If NO, identify which stations in ATTACHMENT B-2. i.e., identify any
   station that will not definitely carry all the weather and local
   emergencies selected by this Committee.

    EVI Evacuate Immediately!

    CEM Civil Emergency Message (Note: Until additional codes are approved
   and adopted in a SECC Communications Operations Order (COO), a CEM will
   apply to any local civil emergency; i.e., 9-1-1 system failure, hazmat,
   Nuclear Power Plant emergency, wild fire, potential or actual threat to
   life and property.)

    3. We agree to carry both of the following as "MUST CARRY." Line out,
   however, any that your LECC elects not to carry:

    TOR Tornado Warning
   FFW Flash Flood warning

    4. COASTAL Areas (only) shall also carry the following events. If
   there are no coastal counties in this LECC, skip to Item 5. Again,
   however, line out any that the LECC has chosen not to carry:

    TSW Tsunami Warning
   TSA Tsunami Watch

    5. The following circled events are adopted by our LECC as "MUST
   CARRY" and for "automatic carry" (loop through) by those stations
   programmed for automatic retransmission.

    The event codes below marked with an asterisk (*) have been adopted by
   LECC returns to date as "MUST CARRY." Note that you will receive any
   and all messages for your county, even if you line them out. You are
   simply stating for the plan those event codes you deem to be in your
   "MUST CARRY" category.

    TOA Tornado Watch
   SVA Severe Thunderstorm Watch
   SVR Severe Thunderstorm Warning *
   SVS Severe Weather Statement
   SPS Severe Weather Statement
   FFW Flash Flood Warning *
   FFA Flash Flood Watch
   FFS Flash Flood Statement
   FLA Flood Watch
   FLW Flood Warning
   FLS Flood Statement
   WSA Winter Storm Watch
   WSW Winter Storm Warning
   BZW Blizzard Warning
   HWA High Wing Warning
   HUA Hurricane Watch
   HUW Hurricane Warning
   HLS Hurricane Statement

    6. The following event codes are not for public consumption:

    DMO Practice/Demonstration Message
   ADR Administrative Message

    C. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

    1. Who is authorized to activate the EAS for a civil emergency. List
   as many as apply in the following format. Note: We suggest this list be
   as small as possible. Verification controls can be achieved by using
   both the callback procedure and authenticator codes. One major
   metropolitan 9 county Local Area lists only 9 county OES agency
   administrators; they, in turn, may delegate the activation to an
   (unlisted) person and assume the responsibility for so doing. They deem
   the callback and authenticator codes provide them adequate protection.

    Name (optional)
   Title or position
   Name of agency
   Direct callback telephone number(s)

    2. Will an authenticator list and procedure be required (optional)?

    Circle one: YES NO

    If YES, do you want it prepared by the SECC? YES NO

    Or, if YES, will you prepare your own? Attach. YES NO

    D. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE

    How will the National Weather Service activate the EAS if (a) there is
   no NWS radio serving this area or (b) if and when the NWS radio
   transmitter goes off the air?

    E. CABLE TELEVISION COMPANIES

    List each CATV company and information in an ATTACHMENT E and in the
   following format. This information should be tasked to your Vice-Chair
   or Co-Chair for CATV.

    1. Company name
   _______________________________________________________

    Direct line telephone number at the control point __________________

    Telephone number(s) ________________________________________________

    E-mail address _____________________________________________________

    Name/title of principal official ___________________________________

    Two (or more) radio sources to be monitored ________________________

    ____________________________________________________________________

    2. Name of the one LECC vice-chair for CATV _______________________

    Address ____________________________________________________________

    Telephone number ___________________________________________________

    FAX number _________________________________________________________

    E-mail address _____________________________________________________

    F. COORDINATED MONTHLY TEST

    1. An end-to-end test is the best and only viable test of government
   officials, broadcast station personnel, and the EAS equipment. The LP1
   shall not use the State EAS RMT as its Local Area RMT. All Local Areas
   shall avoid the first Tuesday of any month as its daytime RMT and the
   day of any adjoining Local Area RMT. Coordinate this carefully with
   your neighboring LECCs. Will your daytime coordinated monthly tests
   (RMT) originate from the/an operational area EOC or Communications
   Center? Circle one:

    YES NO

   If "YES" and the RMT programming will not originate at the LP1 station,
   give all of the particulars so that an appropriate Communications
   Operations Order may be prepared for your identified participants:

    2. What day of the month for the daytime test?
   _________________________

    3. What time for the daytime test?
   _____________________________________

    4. What day of the month for the nighttime test?
   _______________________

    5. What time for the nighttime test?
   ___________________________________

    6. Where will the nighttime test originate? Check one:

    ____EOC ____Comm Center ____LP1 station ____NWS ____Other
