   Linux. The class material from prior classes is available.


   More Workstations and Desktops & Laptops

   The number of Linux Workstations and Desktop machines is growing
   rapidly at Fermilab. In an effort to provide the best support possible
   we make several recommendations to what type of hardware to buy, who to
   buy from, and where to get general information on how to operate your
   Linux system. Even though we do not support laptops information about
   laptops can be found at our laptop page

   More Linux Security at Fermilab including Kerberos

   Internet security is a major issue for any organization that is
   connected to the internet. Fermilab is no exception. We place the
   utmost priority on security and make every attempt possible to create a
   secure and stable environment for our users. For informational
   purposes, we have created the Fermi Linux Security Page for
   disseminating information on what steps we have taken to create a
   secure Fermi Red Hat Linux distribution.  There is also info about
   kerberos on Fermi Linux there. For more information about kerberos on
   Fermi Linux send mail to kerberos-users@fnal.gov .

   More Linux at the Lab

   Fermilab is now officially supporting the Linux operating system for
   desktop scientifc workstations & Farms computing. See the January 1998
   issue of the Computing Divison Newsletter for more information.

   More Linux Support Policy

   In January, 1998, Fermilab announced that Linux would be one of the
   officially supported operating systems at the lab. Several restrictions
   apply to this policy, the most important being that only distribution
   and hardware platform supported are Red Hat on Intel PC's. A short but
   comprehensive document was issued which is available online.

   More Linux Application Support Policy

   FUE (Fermi Unix Environment) is the means by which the Computing
   Division provides application software to our customers. A full
   statement of this policy can be found here. FullFue bootstrap is
   included in the default Fermi Linux installation and upgrade for
   workgroups which have selected this service. See our workgroups page
   for information on which workgroups have selected this.
