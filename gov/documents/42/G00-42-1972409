Installation using PPP

   The camera server supports the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) which is a
   mechanism for creating and running the Internet Protocol and other
   network protocols over a serial link. This can be either:
     * a direct serial connection that uses a null-modem cable, or
     * a connection established using modems and telephone lines
       (including digital lines such as ISDN).

   PPP can transport any IP based protocol and allows the camera server to
   be remotely accessed almost as if it were directly connected to the
   network. However, the major difference between PPP and an Ethernet
   connection is of course speed. A standard Ethernet connection operates
   at 10 Mbps (maximum theoretical throughput), whereas an analog modem
   only operates at speeds up to 56 kbps.

Configuration of camera server

   You need to enable PPP support in your camera server. By default the
   serial port is disabled.
    1. Use a Web browser to view your camera server's home page over
       Ethernet, (such as http://mycam). You can do this even if you do
       not have access to Ethernet, look here.
    2. Click on Settings at the bottom of the picture.
    3. Select Host Mode in the Serial Mode pop-up on the Modem page.
    4. Select Autodetect Modem in the Modem Type pop-up.
    5. Choose a baud rate, 19200 or 38400 is recommended.

  UNIX users

   Simply treat the camera server as any other remote PPP host. No userid
   or password is required. You can also assign the camera server a
   temporary IP address for the duration of the connection.

  Limitations

   The currently known limitations in the PPP support:
     * When used with a GSM/cellular phones, always set the baud rate to
       9600.
     * The product is optimized for US Robotics(tm) modems, since these
       are the most common. It will work with other modems as well, but
       for best result we recommend the use of US Robotics(tm).
     * From Windows there is no method of setting the remote IP address.
       This is a limitation in the Windows PPP implementation. If you
       install a camera server on a remote site, make certain to set the
       IP address in advance. If you forget the address, while at a remote
       location, you can use a terminal to call the camera server, and
       issue the 'ip' command on the camera server's console.
