  How do I obtain Case Copy Request Information

   To view or obtain copies from a Bankruptcy case file, come to the
   Bankruptcy Clerk’s Office of the respective Division. Copies are .50
   cents per page. Since the Clerk’s Office does not accept copy requests
   over the telephone, by e-mail or fax, we will accept your request in
   writing with your check or money order, made payable to the U.S.
   Bankruptcy Court, with a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Make sure
   the request reference the Bankruptcy Case Number you are inquiring
   about. If you can not obtain or determine the exact number of pages of
   the document(s) you are requesting copies of, write on your check "not
   to exceed $$$ amount of dollars".

  Closed and Archived Bankruptcy Case Information

   Bankruptcy cases closed prior to mid year 1998 are stored at the
   National Archives Center in Chicago, Illinois. To obtain copies, there
   are two (2) options in which to retrieve and copy the case file. You
   can come to the Clerk’s Office with the $35.00 retrieval fee. We will
   then order the file for you and in approximately ten (10) days after
   receipt of the case file will make copies for .50 cents per page.

   To obtain copies directly from the National Archives Center, go to the
   DOCUMENTS page and print the CHICAGO RETRIEVAL FORM then call the
   Bankruptcy Clerk’s Office at the appropriate District to obtain file
   location information. Without the file location numbers, the National
   Archives Center will be unable to locate and process your request. The
