Gravitational Research Branch

Introduction

   The charter of the Gravitational Research Branch is to conduct state of
   the art research that is relevant to NASA's needs, to serve as facility
   scientists for the Center for Gravitational Biology Research, to serve
   as science consultants to projects and to the Division as required, and
   to advocate space research and its opportunities to the community at
   large. Branch members respond to competitive research announcements to
   obtain funding, publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals,
   maintain academic positions as representatives of NASA, mentor students
   and participate in educational and training activities, serve as
   members of intramural and extramural committees and editorial boards,
   and participate at national and international scientific research
   meetings.
