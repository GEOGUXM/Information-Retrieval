      Washington. It is published monthly or bimonthly.
      A hard copy of the BULLETIN is available for an annual subscription fee
      of $25.00. If you would like to subscribe to the BULLETIN, please send

   Forms

      Forms available from the Division of Banks in PDF format include:
        * Bank Branch Application Form (PDF)
        * Consumer Complaint Form (PDF)
        * Public Records Request Form (PDF)

      The Consumer Complaint Form is also available in an online format that
      can be filled out and submitted directly to us on the Web. The area
      where you are asked to "briefly describe the problem or complaint" will
      hold a considerable amount of text. We suggest that you print out the
      complaint form first, fill in the blanks, then use your text editor or
      word processor to "cut and paste" your answers into the appropriate
      boxes in the online complaint form.
      Once you have filled out the form, simply click on "Submit," and your
      complaint will be sent to the Division of Banks.
