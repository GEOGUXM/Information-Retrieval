   PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES FOR PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 CASES IN THE UNITED
   STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK I. GOALS
   . The purpose of this document is to establish uniform guidelines for
   com- mencing and administering "prepackaged Chapter 11 cases" in the
   United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
   (the "Court"). Specifically, this document defines "prepackaged Chapter
   11 case" and attempts to provide bankruptcy practitioners with help in
   dealing with practical matters which either are not addressed at all by
   statute or rules or are addressed indirectly in a piecemeal fashion by
   statutes, general rules, and/or local rules that were not enacted
   specifically with prepackaged Chapter 11 cases in mind. Although each
   case is different, many issues are common to all prepackaged cases.
   Judicial economy, as well as procedural predictability for debtors and
   creditors, will be enhanced by promulgation of uniform guidelines to
   deal with these common issues. The guidelines are advisory only; the
   Court retains the power to depart from them. In order to ease the
   burden on practitioners and the Court, Chief Judge Tina L. Brozman
   convened a committee of judges, attorneys, clerk's office staff and the
   United States Trustee to assist in developing a uniform set of
   procedures applicable to prepackaged Chapter 11 cases filed in the
   Southern District of New York. Those meetings resulted in a general
   order adopted by the Court on February 2, 1999, after a vote of the
   Board of Judges, which established the following procedural guidelines
   for prepackaged Chapter 11 cases. II. DEFINITION OF PREPACKAGED CHAPTER
   11 CASE . For purposes of these guidelines, a "prepackaged Chapter 11
   case" is one in which the Debtor, substantially contemporaneously with
   the filing of its Chapter 11 petition, files a Confirmation Hearing
   Scheduling Motion For Prepackaged Plan in substantially the form
   annexed hereto as Exhibit A and satisfying the criteria set forth in
   Part III.A. below ("Prepack Scheduling Motion"), plan, disclosure
   statement (or other solicitation document), and voting certification.
   III. CRITERIA FOR PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 CASE; CONTENTS OF PREPACK
   SCHEDULING MOTION. A. Content of Prepack Scheduling Motion. The Prepack
   Scheduling Motion shall: (i) represent that (x) the solicitation of all
   votes to accept or reject the Debtor's plan required for confirmation
   of that plan was completed prior to com- mencement of the Debtor's
   Chapter 11 case, and that no additional solicitation of votes on that
   plan is contemplated by the Debtor, or (y) the solicitation of all
   votes to accept or reject the Debtor's plan required for confirmation
   of that plan has been deemed adequate by the Court pursuant to Part
   III. C.(ii) below such that no addi- tional solicitation will be
   required; 2 (ii) represent that the requisite acceptances of such plan
   have been obtained from each class of claims or interests as to which
   solicitation is required except as provided in Part III.A.(iii) below;
   and (iii) with respect to any class of interests that has not accepted
   the plan whether or not it is deemed not to have accepted the plan
   under §1126(g), represent that the Debtor is requesting confirmation
   under §1129(b); and (iv) request entry of an order scheduling the
   hearing (x) on confirma- tion of the plan and (y) to determine whether
   the Debtor has satisfied the require- ments of either 11 U.S.C. §
   1126(b)(1) or 11 U.S.C. § 1126(b)(2), for a date that is not more than
   ninety (90) days following the petition date. B. Confirmation Pursuant
   to 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(C). A Chapter 11 case may constitute a
   "prepackaged Chapter 11 case" for purposes of these guidelines
   notwithstanding the fact that the Debtor proposes to confirm the Plan
   pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b)(2)(C) as to a class of interests. C.
   Filing of Petition After Solicitation Has Commenced But Before
   Expiration of Voting Deadline. Unless the Court orders otherwise, if a
   Chapter 11 case is commenced by or against the Debtor, or if a Chapter
   7 case is commenced against the Debtor and converted to a Chapter 11
   case by the Debtor pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 706(a), after the Debtor has
   transmitted all solicitation materials to holders of claims and
   interests 3 whose vote is sought but before the deadline for casting
   acceptances or rejections of the Debtor's plan (the "Voting Deadline"),
   (i) the Debtor and other parties in interest shall be permitted to
   accept but not solicit ballots until the Voting Deadline; and (ii)
   After notice and a hearing the Court shall determine the effect of any
   and all such votes. D. Applicability of Guidelines To Cases Involving
   Cramdown of Classes of Claims and Interests and "Partial Prepackaged
   Chapter 11 Cases." The Court may, upon request of the Debtor or other
   party in interest in an appropriate case, apply some or all of these
   guidelines to (i) cases in which the Debtor has satisfied the
   requirements of Part III.A.(i) above but intends to seek confirmation
   of the plan pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1129(b) as to a class of (a) claims
   which is deemed not to have accepted the plan under 11 U.S.C. §
   1126(g); (b) claims or interests which is receiving or retaining
   property under or pursuant to the plan but whose members' votes were
   not solicited prepetition and whose rejection of the plan has been
   assumed by the Debtor for purposes of confirming the plan; or (c)
   claims or interests which is receiving or retaining property under or
   pursuant to the plan and which voted prepetition to reject the plan, as
   long as no class junior to such rejecting class is receiving or
   retaining any property under or pursuant to the plan; and 4 (ii)
   "partial prepackaged Chapter 11 cases" -- i.e., cases in which
   acceptances of the Debtor's plan were solicited prior to the
   commencement of the case from some, but not all, classes of claims or
   interests whose solicitation is required to confirm the Debtor's plan.
   IV. PREFILING NOTIFICATION TO UNITED STATES TRUSTEE AND CLERK OF THE
   COURT . A. Notice of Proposed Filing to United States Trustee. At least
   two (2) business days prior to the anticipated filing date of the
   prepackaged Chapter 11 case, the Debtor should (i) notify the United
   States Trustee of the Debtor's intention to file a prepackaged Chapter
   11 case and (ii) supply the United States Trustee with two (2) copies
   of the Debtor's plan and disclosure statement (or other solicitation
   document). B. Notice of Proposed "First Day Orders" to United States
   Trustee. If possible, drafts of all First Day Motions (as defined in
   Part VI.A. below), with the proposed orders attached as exhibits,
   should be furnished to the United States Trustee at least one (1) and
   preferably two (2) business days in advance of the filing of the
   petition or as soon as practicable after the filing of an involuntary
   petition. C. Notice of Proposed Filing to Clerk of Court. At least two
   (2) business days prior to the anticipated filing date of the 5
   prepackaged Chapter 11 case, counsel for the Debtor, without disclosing
   the name of the Debtor, should contact the Clerk of the Court to
   discuss the anticipated filing, the amount of the Debtor's assets,
   number and type of creditors, procedures for handling public inquiries
   (i.e., the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons to
   whom such inquiries should be directed), procedures for handling claims
   and proofs of claim or interest, whether the Debtor will request the
   Court to set a last date to file proofs of claim or interest, and
   related matters. On request, the Clerk of the Court will reserve a last
   date to file proofs of claim or interest for the Debtor. The Clerk of
   the Court will not assign the case to or discuss the case with a judge
   until the petition is filed. V. FILING OF PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 CASE.
   A. Electronic Case Filing Via the Internet. The Court has established
   and requires electronic filing of all Chapter 11 cases on the Internet.
   Information on electronic filing procedures, including a user's manual
   (copy annexed as Exhibit "E") and registration form, is available at
   the Court's world wide web site at: http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov In
   electronically filing a prepackaged Chapter 11 case, the Debtor should
   file the petition(s) first, followed by the affidavit pursuant to Local
   Rule 1007-2 and the motions and proposed orders, and should file
   lengthy documents, such as the disclosure statement (or other
   solicitation materials) 6 and plan, last. Electronically filing lengthy
   documents last will expedite the filing process. (See electronic filing
   instructions). B. Proposed Orders as Exhibits to Electronically Filed
   Motions. All "First Day Motions" (as defined in Part VI.A. below) shall
   have attached as an exhibit a copy of the proposed order sought to be
   signed. C. Paper Copies Furnished to Assigned Judge. As soon as
   practicable following filing of a prepackaged Chapter 11 case, the
   Debtor shall furnish to the judge assigned to the case a paper copy of
   the plan, the disclosure statement (or other solicitation document),
   "First Day Motions" (with proposed orders attached as exhibits), any
   other filed motion and any Order To Show Cause on which the Court's
   signature is requested. Proposed Orders should be presented on a 3.5
   inch disk in WordPerfect or other Windows-based format. (See electronic
   filing instructions). To the extent that documents filed by the Debtor
   at or following the commencement of the Debtor's Chapter 11 case differ
   in substance from the versions supplied to the United States Trustee
   under Parts VI.A. and IV.B. above, the Debtor shall furnish to the
   United States Trustee two (2) paper copies of any such documents that
   have been modified, preferably blacklined to show changes. D. Abeyance
   of Local Rule 1007-2(e). 7 Notwithstanding Local Rule 1007-2(e), a
   proposed case conference order need not be submitted to the Court
   unless the confirmation hearing is delayed until a date that is more
   than ninety (90) days following the petition date. VI. FIRST DAY
   ORDERS. A. Motions for Request for Entry of Immediate Orders. "First
   Day Orders" are orders which the Debtor seeks to have entered by the
   Court on or shortly after the filing of the petition. The request for a
   First Day Order should be made by motion (a "First Day Motion"), and a
   copy of the proposed First Day Order should be filed with and attached
   as an exhibit to the First Day Motion. First Day Motions may request a
   waiver of the requirement under Local Rule 9013-1 to file a separate
   memorandum of law only if the legal authority for the relief being
   sought is set forth in the First Day Motions. B. Purpose of First Day
   Orders. Generally, the purpose of First Day Orders is to deal with
   administrative matters ("Administrative Orders") and to ensure that the
   Debtor's business and operations are stabilized and conducted in a
   manner consistent with past practice and the proposed plan, pending
   consideration of confirmation of that plan ("Operational Orders").
   While the Court recognizes the necessity and desirability of
   entertaining appropriate 8 First Day Motions, the terms and conditions
   of First Day Orders (particularly Operational Orders) necessarily will
   depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case, the terms of the
   plan, the notice given, and related factors, and will take into account
   the needs of the Debtor and the rights of other parties in interest. C.
   Typical First Day Motions and Orders. First Day Orders typically
   entertained by the Court on or within one (1) business day of the later
   of the petition date or the date of filing of the First Day Motions
   include (but are not limited to) the following: 1. Prepack Scheduling
   Motion, setting forth the information required in Part III above.1 2.
   Motion for order directing joint administration of Debtors' cases if
   more than one case is commenced. 3. Motion for order authorizing Debtor
   to mail initial notices, including the notice of meeting of creditors
   under 11 U.S.C. § 341(a). 4. Motion for order (i) dispensing with the
   requirement of filing any or all schedules and statement of financial
   affairs in the event the Debtor is not seeking to bar and subsequently
   discharge all or certain categories of debt or (ii) 1In the event
   solicitation has not been completed prior to the petition date, an
   alternative first day motion should be submitted consistent with
   sections III.A.(i) and III.C. 9 extending Debtor's time for filing
   schedules and statement of financial affairs to a specified date. 5.
   Motion for an order setting the last date for filing proofs of claim or
   interest if the Debtor has determined that a deadline should be set. 6.
   Applications to employ appropriate professionals, which may include: *
   attorneys * accountants * financial advisors. If accountants,
   investment advisors, vote tabulators, solicitation agents or similar
   non-legal professionals were retained prepetition and are not seeking
   any payment in connection with the plan or the case in addition to
   payments that they received prior to the filing of the petition
   ("Additional Post-Petition Payments"), such professionals need not be
   retained pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 327 and may continue to provide
   services to the Debtor with respect to the plan and the case (e.g.,
   testifying at the confirmation/disclosure adequacy hearing); provided,
   however, that the post-petition services provided by accountants and
   financial advisors who have not been retained pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §
   327 shall not include any work of a substantive nature, such as, for
   example, the preparation of new financial data, even if such
   accountants and financial advisors are not seeking any Additional
   Post-Petition Payments. 10 7. Motion for order authorizing employment
   and payment without fee applications of professionals used in ordinary
   course of business, not to exceed a specified individual and aggregate
   amount. 8. Motion for order establishing procedures for compensation
   and reimbursement of expenses of professionals. 9. Motion for order
   authorizing Debtor to maintain existing bank accounts and cash
   management system, and to continue using existing business forms
   (including checks) without "debtor-in-possession" designation. Any
   motion should describe the proposed cash management system and, in
   cases where money will be transferred between Debtors or from a Debtor
   to a non-debtor affiliate, represent why such transfers are desirable
   from the Debtor's perspective, that the Debtor(s) will maintain records
   of all postpetition intercompany transfers of funds and describe what
   repayment terms exist. 10. Motion under 11 U.S.C. § 363 for interim
   order authorizing Debtor's use of cash collateral on an emergency
   basis, pending a hearing, and providing adequate protection. 11. Motion
   under 11 U.S.C. § 364 for interim order authorizing Debtor to obtain
   postpetition financing on an emergency basis, pending a hearing. 12.
   Motion under 11 U.S.C. § 345(b) for order authorizing Debtor to deviate
   from enumerated permitted investments set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 345. 11
   Motion should disclose the amount of funds which the Debtor proposes to
   invest outside the statute's enumerated permitted investments and the
   proposed types of investments to be made. If the Debtor proposes to
   invest or deposit money in or with an entity that has not satisfied the
   requirement of 11 U.S.C. § 345 (b) (a "Non- Qualified Entity") the
   First Day Motion should demonstrate and explain why such an investment
   or deposit is necessary and, to the extent known, why the Non-Qualified
   Entity cannot or has not satisfied the requirements of 11 U.S.C. §
   345(b). 13. Motion for order authorizing Debtor to pay (i) prepetition
   wages, salaries and commissions (including vacation, severance and sick
   leave pay) earned by an individual in an amount not to exceed specified
   per employee and aggregate amounts, which amounts shall be set forth in
   the Motion. If the Motion requests authority to pay amounts in excess
   of $4,300 (or such higher amount as is subsequently determined in
   accordance with 11 U.S.C. § 104(b)) per employee, then a list of the
   names and position/job titles of all employees as to whom those pay-
   ments will be made shall be attached. However, the propriety of those
   requests shall be considered on a case by case basis. The Motion also
   shall state whether, and the extent to which, the claims proposed to be
   paid constitute priority claims under 11 U.S.C. § 507 ("Priority
   Claims") and, if such claims are not Priority Claims, the Motion should
   explain why those claims should be afforded the treatment requested in
   the Motion. The Motion may also ask the Court to direct banks to honor
   12 prepetition checks for such amounts and authorize the Debtor to
   replace prepetition checks that have been dishonored. 14. Motion for
   order authorizing Debtor to pay claims for contribu- tion to employee
   benefit plans in an amount not to exceed a specified amount, which
   amount shall be set forth in the Motion. If the Motion requests
   authority to pay amounts in excess of the amounts set forth in 11
   U.S.C. § 507(a)(4) (as modified by 11 U.S.C. § 104(b)) then a list of
   the names and position/job titles of all employees as to whom those
   payments will be made shall be attached. However, the propriety of
   those requests shall be considered on a case by case basis. The Motion
   also shall state whether, and the extent to which, the claims proposed
   to be paid constitute Priority Claims and, if such claims are not
   Priority Claims, the Motion should explain why those claims should be
   afforded the treatment requested in the Motion. 15. Motion for an order
   authorizing Debtor to reimburse employee business expenses in an amount
   not to exceed a specified amount per employee and not to exceed a
   specified aggregate amount, which amounts shall be set forth in the
   Motion. The Motion also shall state whether, and the extent to which,
   the claims proposed to be paid constitute Priority Claims and, if such
   claims are not Priority Claims, the Motion should explain why those
   claims should be afforded the treat- ment requested in the Motion. 13
   16. Motion for an order authorizing Debtor to pay creditors whose
   prepetition claims will be paid in full in cash on consummation under
   the Debtor's plan, not to exceed a specified aggregate amount, which
   amount shall be set forth in the Motion. The Motion should disclose the
   types of claims that the Debtor proposes to pay (e.g., trade creditors
   supplying goods; trade creditors supplying services; professionals
   involved in the routine, day-to-day operations and business of the
   Debtor). The Motion also shall state whether, and the extent to which,
   the claims proposed to be paid constitute Priority Claims and, if such
   claims are not Priority Claims, the Motion should explain why those
   claims should be afforded the treat- ment requested in the Motion. 17.
   Motion for an order authorizing Debtor to honor prepetition customer
   claims (e.g., refund of deposits, lay-a-way plans) and warranties, not
   to exceed specified aggregate and per claimant amounts, which amounts
   shall be set forth in the Motion. The Motion also shall state whether,
   and the extent to which, the claims proposed to be paid constitute
   Priority Claims and, if such claims are not Priority Claims, the Motion
   should explain why those claims should be afforded the treatment
   requested in the Motion. 18. Motion for an order authorizing continued
   performance without assumption under key executory contracts, including
   payment of prepetition amounts due and owing thereunder in an amount
   not to exceed specified aggregate and per 14 claimant amounts. The
   Motion shall list and state all contracts subject to the motion and
   whether, and the extent to which, the claims proposed to be paid are
   believed to be Priority Claims and, if such claims are not Priority
   Claims, the Motion should explain why those claims should be afforded
   the treatment requested in the Motion. 19. Motion for interim order
   prohibiting utilities from altering, refusing or discontinuing service
   on account of prepetition claims and establishing procedures for
   determining requests for additional adequate assurance. 20. In a case
   involving a sale of any or all of the Debtor's assets, Motion for order
   authorizing and scheduling auction at which the Debtor may sell its
   assets free and clear of claims and interests and approving auction
   procedures and related matters. D. Request for Related Relief Need Not
   be Filed in Separate Motions. Motions for related relief under First
   Day Orders referred to above need not be filed as separate motions. For
   example, in a given case it may be appropriate to combine cash
   collateral and financing motions, or deal with all employee-related
   matters in a single motion. VII. VOTING PERIOD; BALLOT; MULTIPLE VOTES;
   NOTICE PRESUMPTIONS. A. Voting Period Guidelines. Fed.R.Bankr.P.
   3018(b) requires the Court to consider whether "an unreasonably short"
   time was prescribed for creditors and equity security holders to 15
   accept or reject the plan. Under ordinary circumstances, in determining
   whether the time allowed for casting acceptances and rejections on the
   Debtor's plan satisfied Fed.R. Bankr. P. 3018(b), the Court will
   approve as reasonable : 1. For securities listed or admitted to trading
   on the New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange or any
   international exchanges quoted on NASDAQ, and for securities publicly
   traded on any other national securities exchange ("Publicly Traded
   Securities"), a twenty (20) business day voting period, measured from
   the date of commencement of mailing. 2. For securities which are not
   Publicly Traded Securities and for debt for borrowed money which is not
   evidenced by a Publicly Traded Security, a ten (10) business day voting
   period, measured from the date of commencement of mailing. 3. For all
   other claims and interests, a twenty (20) business day voting period,
   measured from the date of commencement of mailing. B. Shorter or Longer
   Voting Period. Nothing herein is intended to preclude (i) a shorter
   voting period if it is justified in a particular case, or (ii) any
   party in interest from demonstrating that the presumptions set forth
   above were not reasonable in a particular case. C. Ballot. 16 1. The
   Debtor may, but shall not be required to, use a ballot substantially in
   the form of the Official Form of Ballot For Accepting or Rejecting A
   Plan (the "Prepackaged Chapter 11 Case Ballot Form attached as Exhibit
   `B'") in connection with a prepackaged plan solicitation. 2.
   Prepackaged Chapter 11 Master Ballot Form attached as Exhibit `C'" may
   be used to report voting by beneficial owners of claims and interests.
   3. The ballot may include information in addition to that set forth on
   the Official Ballot Form, and may request and provide space for the
   holder of a claim or interest to vote on matters in addition to the
   plan. By way of example, the ballot may seek and record (i) votes
   relating to an exchange offer, (ii) consents to or votes with respect
   to benefits plans, and (iii) elections provided for in the plan (or
   exchange offer). D. Multiple Votes. If the holder of a claim or
   interest changes its vote during the pre- petition voting period, only
   the last timely ballot cast by such holder shall be counted in
   determining whether the plan has been accepted or rejected unless the
   disclosure statement (or other solicitation document) clearly provides
   for some other procedure for determining votes on the prepackaged plan.
   If a holder of a claim or interest wants to change a vote
   post-petition, Rule 3018(a) requires a showing of cause and Court
   approval. 17 E. Notice Guidelines. Fed.R.Bankr. P. 3018(b) requires the
   Court to consider whether the plan was transmitted to substantially all
   creditors and equity security holders of the same class. In making that
   determination, the Court will take into account (i) whether the Debtor
   transmitted the plan and disclosure statement (or other solicita- tion
   document) in substantial compliance with applicable nonbankruptcy law,
   rules, or regulations and (ii) the fact that creditors and equity
   security holders who are not record holders of the securities upon
   which their claims or interests are based generally assume the risk
   associated with their decision to hold their securities in "street
   name." VIII. ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING; CREDITORS' COMMITTEE. A. After the
   filing of the Chapter 11 petition, the Debtor shall notify creditors of
   the date, time and place of the meeting of creditors pursuant to 11
   U.S.C. § 341(a), as well as the other information set forth in Part
   X.B.2 below. The date set for the § 341(a) meeting should be no more
   than forty (40) days after the filing of the petition. B. If a meeting
   of creditors pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 341(a) has not yet been convened
   prior to the date upon which the plan is confirmed, no such meeting
   will be convened if the order confirming the plan or order entered
   substantially contempora- neously therewith contains a provision
   waiving the convening of such a meeting. 18 C. Typically, no creditors'
   committee will be appointed in a prepackaged Chapter 11 case where the
   unsecured creditors are unimpaired. However, where members of a
   pre-petition committee seek to serve as a member of an official
   creditors' committee, they shall demonstrate to the United States
   Trustee their compliance with Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2007(b). IX. LAST DATE FOR
   FILING PROOFS OF CLAIM OR INTEREST. A. A last date to file proofs of
   claim or interest will not be set unless the Debtor seeks an order
   fixing such a deadline for filing proofs of claim or proofs of
   interest. B. As provided in Part IV.C. above, the Debtor should consult
   with the Clerk of the Court in advance of the filing of the case to
   discuss whether a last date to file proofs of claim or interest will be
   sought, the need for appointment of a claims' agent for the Court (at
   the Debtor's expense), and related matters. C. If a claims' agent is
   appointed, such agent shall docket all proofs of claim and proofs of
   interest and deliver to the Debtor complete copies of the proofs of
   claim and interest, along with a complete claims and interest docket,
   not later than five (5) business days after the last date to file
   proofs of claim or interest. D. Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2002(a)(7) requires at
   least twenty (20) days' notice by mail of the last day to file proofs
   of claim or interest. If the notice is being directed to creditors
   whose mailing addresses are outside the United States, the Court may
   extend the period beyond twenty days. 19 E. Paper copies of the notice
   of the last date to file proofs of claim or interest must be mailed as
   required under Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2002(a)(7). X. NOTICE. A. In General.
   Notice of the filing of the plan and disclosure statement (or other
   solicitation document) and of the hearing to consider compliance with
   disclosure requirements and confirmation of the plan must be given to
   all parties-in-interest. Paper copy of a notice must be mailed; service
   of a notice of electronic filing will not suffice. No further
   distribution of the plan and disclosure statement (or other
   solicitation document) beyond that which occurred prepetition is
   required unless requested by a party-in-interest. Parties are advised
   to check General Order M-182 because paper copies of other notices may
   be required. B. Hearing Notice. 1. Where the disclosure statement has
   not been approved by the Court prior to confirmation, the Debtor shall
   prepare and mail paper copies to all parties-in-interest of a Notice of
   Confirmation Hearing and Approval of Disclosure Statement (or other
   solicitation documents) in substantially the form annexed hereto as
   Exhibit "D" (the "Hearing Notice"). The Hearing Notice must: * set
   forth (i) the date, time and place of the hearing to consider compli-
   ance with disclosure requirements and confirmation of the plan, and 20
   (ii) the date and time by which objections to the foregoing must be
   filed and served; * include a chart summarizing plan distributions; *
   set forth the name, address and telephone number of the person from
   whom copies of the plan and disclosure statement (or other solicita-
   tion document) can be obtained (at the Debtor's expense); and * state
   that the plan and disclosure statement (or other solicitation document)
   can be viewed electronically and explain briefly how electronic access
   to these documents may be obtained. 2. Either the Hearing Notice or a
   separate notice must: * set forth the date, time and place of the §
   341(a) meeting and state that such meeting will not be convened if (i)
   the plan is confirmed prior to the date set for the § 341(a) meeting
   and (ii) the order con- firming the plan (or order entered
   substantially contemporaneously therewith) contains a provision waiving
   the convening of such a meeting. C. Service. 1. The Hearing Notice
   shall be served upon (i) record (registered) holders of debt and equity
   securities (determined as of the record date established in the
   disclosure statement or other solicitation document) that were entitled
   to vote on the 21 plan, (ii) record (registered) holders of all other
   claims and interests of any class (determined as of a record date that
   is not more than ten (10) days prior to the date of the filing of the
   petition), (iii) all other creditors listed in the Debtor's schedules,
   unless Debtor is not seeking to bar and subsequently discharge claims,
