                                Sigma0 Blooms

    The WFF TOPEX Team has been investigating a phenomena we refer to as
   sigma-0 blooms. This page summarizes some of the investigation effort.

   In our on-going assessment of TOPEX Altimeter performance, the Wallops
   Flight Facility TOPEX Team has been investigating phenomena we refer to
   as sigma-0 blooms. Using the WFF TOPEX GDR Database, we are able to
   determine the global distribution of these blooms and investigate a
   possible seasonal correlation. A sigma-0 bloom is characterized by
   abnormally high sigma-0 values. Initial investigations revealed a
   direct correlation between the occurrence of blooms and low significant
   waveheights. This led us to theorize that the blooms are the result of
   very strong radar returns from smooth ocean surfaces during periods of
   calm winds.

   Below, 1-per second plots of TOPEX Cycle 117, Pass 054 shows Ku-Band
   sigma-0 and significant waveheight during a pass over the Pacific
   Ocean. Sigma-0 blooms are the three spikes on the sigma-0 plot at
   approximately -27, +8, and +38 degrees latitude. Data at -60 and +60
   degrees latitude are over land and/or ice.

   We use a criteria of sigma-0 greater than 16 dB to identify blooms from
   the 1-minute average GDR Database. The occurrences of the blooms within
   discrete geographic areas are observed to be seasonal, as the presence
   of calm seas is seasonal. Global movement of sigma-0 blooms may be
   viewed by downloading a QuickTime movie (196k) of monthly sigma-0
   blooms from data taken by TOPEX from January 1993 to October 1995.

   An interpretation of the time-related sigma-0 distribution, for
   selected geographic areas, is described below:

   [natlantic.jpg] North Atlantic Ocean
   (latitude +10 to +60, longitude 290 to 345E)

   The maximum number of blooms in the North Atlantic occur in late-summer
   and the minima in early-winter. This is the expected pattern, since the
   seas in the North Atlantic are calmer in the summer.
   [satlantic.jpg] South Atlantic Ocean
   (latitude -10 to -50, longitude 315 to 360E)

   As expected, there is a time-of-year reversal in the South Atlantic,
   when compared with the North Atlantic. The maximum number of blooms
   occur in March, and the minima occur in the June/July time frame.
   [npacific.jpg] North Pacific Ocean
   (latitude +10 to +60, longitude 150 to 240E)

   The North Pacific occurrences of blooms are similar to the North
   Atlantic, greater during the summer and minimized in the winter.
   [spacific.jpg] South Pacific Ocean
   (latitude -10 to -50, longitude 150 to 285E)

   This occurrences of blooms in the South Pacific are similar to the
   South Atlantic. The blooms occur most often in February and occur least
   often in July.
   [indian.jpg] Indian Ocean
   (latitude -10 to +20, longitude 55 to 95E)

   In the Indian Ocean area, the calmest seas (corresponding to the
   largest number of blooms) apparently occur in April. The fewest blooms
   are in July-August, during the peak of the summer monsoon season.
   [equator.jpg] Equatorial Zone
   (latitude -10 to +10, longitude 0 to 360E)

   Near the equator, the largest number of blooms are observed in
   March-April, with the fewest in July-August.
   [indonesia.jpg] Indonesia
   (latitude -10 to +10, longitude 90 to 150E)

   There are very frequent blooms in the vicinity of Indonesia. The
   largest numbers of blooms are in the October-November time frame, with
   a secondary peak during April-May.
   [antarctica.jpg] Antarctica
   (latitude -55 to -66, longitude 0 to 360E)

   The pattern of blooms in the Antarctica area indicates that the
   majority of these blooms are related to the presence of newly-formed
   sea ice. The smallest number of blooms-per-month occur in March when
   the sea ice extent is historically at its minimum. The largest number
   of blooms-per-month occurs in July.
