    SO2 from the Pinatubo Volcano

   Starting within 10 days of launch, and continuing for approximately 2
   months, MLS observed the 3-dimensional distribution and decay of
   residual SO2 injected into the tropical stratosphere by the Mt.
   Pinatubo eruption which occurred about 3 months before launch of UARS.
   These observations [Read et al., 1993] showed the Pinatubo SO2 mixing
   ratio maximum to occur around 26 km altitude with abundances of ~15
   ppbv on 21 September 1991. The observed SO2 decay had e-folding times
   of 29 days at 26 km and 41 days at 21 km, consistent with expectations
   that the primary destruction of SO2 is due to reaction with OH leading
   to formation of stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Projected backward to
   time of eruption, the total amount of SO2 injected by Pinatubo is
   estimated from MLS data to be 17 Mtons, consistent with estimates
   inferred from other measurements. On 21 and 22 April 1993 MLS detected
   SO2 injected into the stratosphere by the South American Lascar volcano
   [unpublished results].

    High-latitude winter chemistry and ozone depletion

   Early results from UARS MLS also included the first global maps of
   stratospheric ClO, the predominant form of chemically-reactive chlorine
   involved in the destruction of stratospheric O3. The initial MLS
   results [Waters et al., 1993a,b; see also Chipperfield, 1993] showed
   the lower stratospheric Antarctic vortex to be filled with ClO in the
   region where O3 was depleted, confirming earlier conclusions from
   ground-based and aircraft instruments that chlorine chemistry is the
   cause of the Antarctic ozone hole. They showed, for the first time,
   that ClO in the Antarctic vortex can become enhanced by June, and that
   O3 destruction by ClO is masked in the early Antarctic winter by influx
   of O3 expected from diabatic descent. These results also showed that
   the Arctic winter lower stratospheric vortex can become filled with
   enhanced ClO, leading to calculated vortex-averaged O3 destruction
   rates of ~0.7%/day. Results from 3D models [Douglass et al., 1993;
   Geller et al., 1993; Lefevre et al., 1994], produced shortly after the
   MLS results were obtained, showed the observed distribution of enhanced
   Arctic ClO was consistent with chemical-transport model predictions. A
   clear relationship was found between predicted polar stratospheric
   cloud formation along back trajectories and enhanced Arctic ClO
   observed by MLS, and sporadic large values of ClO seen by MLS outside
   the vortex were shown to be consistent with that expected to be caused
   by instrument noise [Schoeberl et al., 1993].

   Definitive loss of Arctic ozone due to chemistry associated with the
   enhanced ClO was determined from analyses of combined MLS and UARS
   CLAES data by Manney et al. [1994]. Bell et al. [1994] found the
   expected anticorrelation between enhanced Arctic ClO measured by MLS
   and HCl measured from the ground. Additional confirmation of the
   paradigm of chemical processing by polar stratospheric clouds leading
   to activation of stratospheric chlorine is shown in the analyses of
   northern hemisphere CLAES, MLS and HALOE data by Geller et al. [1995],
   and in southern hemisphere MLS and CLAES data by Ricaud et al. [1995].

   Differences between the Arctic and Antarctic winter vortex conditions
   as deduced from MLS observations are described by Santee et al. [1995],
   and deduced from combined MLS, CLAES and HALOE data by Douglass et al.
   [1995]. Mackenzie et al. [1996] compare lower stratospheric vortex
   ozone destruction calculated from the MLS ClO with the MLS-observed
   change in O3 for the northern winter of 1992-93 and southern winter of
   1993. Additional comparisons between MLS observations and model results
   for polar chemistry are given by Ekman et al. [1995], Chipperfield et
   al. [1996] and Santee et al. [1996a]. Schoeberl et al. [1996a] use MLS,
   HALOE and CLAES data in an analysis of the development of the Antarctic
   ozone hole.

   MLS measurements of Arctic ClO and O3 for the five northern winters
   observed to date are described in the collective papers of Waters et
   al. [1993a,b; 1995], Manney et al. [1994; 1995a,b; 1996a,b,e], and
   Santee et al. [1995, 1996b]. Low ozone "pockets" in the middle
   stratospheric winter anticyclone have been observed in MLS data and
   analyzed by Manney et al. [1995c], who conclude these cannot be
   explained solely by transport. Morris et al. [1996] show that the
   pockets can be explained by chemistry operating on air masses which are
   isolated in the anticyclone.

    High-latitude dynamics

   MLS observations have been used in several studies to provide
   information on vortex and high-latitude dynamics. Early results showed
   the evolution of ozone in the 1992 late winter southern polar vortex
   [Manney et al. 1993; see also Manney et al. 1995a] with suggestions of
   poleward transport associated with episodes of strong planetary wave
   activity, intensification of waves in temperature and ozone when a
   9-day eastward traveling wave 1 becomes in-phase with a stationary wave
   1 with implications for transport [Fishbein et al.1993], and large
   tongues of air peeling off the Antarctic vortex edge and migrating to
   midlatitudes during the breakup of the Antarcic vortex [Harwood et al.,
   1993].

   Lahoz et al. [1993] analyzed northern hemisphere mid-stratosphere
   vortex processed diagnosed from MLS H2O, CLAES N2O and potenital
   vorticity calculated from UKMO data and found descent in the vortex
   with little or no large scale mixing across the vortex edge in the
   middle stratosphere. The three-dimensional evolution of the northern
   hemisphere stratospheric water vapor distribution observed by MLS
   during October 1991 to July 1992 is documented by Lahoz et al. [1994],
   with these distributions showing clear signatures of the effects of
   diabetic descent through isentropic surfaces and quasi-horizontal
   transport along isentropic surfaces, and the organization of the
   large-scale winter flow by the interaction between the westerly polar
   vortex and the Aleutian high. The seasonal evolution of southern
   hemispheric water vapor observed by MLS is described by Lahoz et al.
   [1996b].

   Manney et al.[1995d] simulate the transport of passive tracers observed
   by MLS and CLAES over a 20-30 day period using Lagrangian transport
   calculations, and find the agreement between calculated and observed
   fields is best inside the polar vortices, and better in the Arctic than
   in the Antarctic; however, MLS H2O observations show behavior that is
   inconsistent with the calculationss and with that expected for passive
   tracers inside the polar vortex in the middle-to-upper stratosphere.
   Although there is not always detailed agreement outside the vortex, the
   trajectory calculations still reproduce the average large-scale
   characteristics of passive tracer evolutions in midlatitudes. Similar
   analyses [Manney et al.1995e] show the evolution of ozone in the lower
   stratosphere during early winter to be dominated by dynamics in
   December 1992 in the Arctic, and that ~50% of the chemical destruction
   of Antarctic ozone in June 1992 may be masked by dynamical effects,
   mainly diabatic descent, which bring higher ozone into the lower
   stratosphere vortex; the analyses suggests that dynamical changes
   masked ~20-35% of chemical ozone loss during late February and early
   March 1993 in the Arctic.

   Morris et al. [1995] use trajectory-mapping techniques with MLS, CLAES
   and HALOE data to analyze dynamical wave-breaking events. Orsolini et
   al. [1996] use MLS O3 data to initialize a high-resolution transport
   model and examine ozone laminae along the Arctic polar vortex edge.

    Global distribution and variations of ozone and other species

   An overview of zonal mean O3 results from the first two and one-half
   years of MLS operation is given by Froidevaux et al. [1994]; in
   addition to features observed in stratospheric O3, this work includes
   initial results of examining residual differences between the
   stratospheric O3 column from MLS and the total O3 column from TOMS --
   with information on tropospheric ozone as the ultimate goal. Analyses
   by Ziemke et al. [1996] using these data sets have shown zonal
   asymmetries in southern hemisphere column ozone that have implications
   for biomass burning. Elson et al. [1994] describe large-scale
   variations observed in MLS O3 and Elson et al. [1996] show zonal and
   large-scale variations in MLS H2O.

   Randel et al. [1995] include MLS and HALOE data in analyzing changes in
   stratospheric ozone following the Pinatubo eruption. Dessler et al.
   [1995; 1996a,b] used MLS ClO and O3 data, along with that of other UARS
   instruments, to provide information on various aspects of stratospheric
   chlorine chemistry. The latitudinal distribution of ClO in the upper
   stratosphere [Waters et al., 1996] shows a minimum in the tropics as
   expected from quenching by increased amounts of upper stratospheric CH4
   in the tropics. Jackman et al. [1996] compare zonal mean ClO from MLS
   with model results, which clearly shows a discrepancy in the middle and
   upper stratosphere which has not yet been resolved and which has
   implications for problems in accurately calculating ozone in the middle
   and upper stratosphere.

   Two-day waves in the stratosphere have been analyzed by Limpasuvan and
   Leovy [1995] using MLS H2O data, and by Wu et al. [1996] using MLS
   temperatures. Four-day waves observed in MLS ozone, temperature and
   geopotential height have been analyzed by Allen et al. [1996]. MLS data
   have been used in calculations of stratospheric residual circulation by
   Rosenlof [1995] and Eluszkiewicz et al. [1996]. Pumphrey and Harwood
   [1996] use MLS 183 GHz radiances to explore the distribution of water
   vapor and ozone in the mesosphere and provide information on
   mesospheric dynamics.

    Tropical dynamics

   Kelvin waves observed in MLS tropical data have been analyzed by
   Canziani et al. [1994, 1995] and Stone et al. [1995], and MLS
   observations of the semiannual oscillation by Ray et al. [1994]. Randel
   et al. [1993] describe CLAES and MLS observations of stratospheric
   transport from the tropics to middle latitudes by planetary wave
   mixing. Carr et al. [1995] performed initial analyses of MLS tropical
   stratospheric H2O data, and Mote et al. [1995] found variations in
   these data which could be related to the annual cycle in tropical
   tropopause temperatures. More extensive analyses by Mote et al. [1995],
   greatly aided by the use of HALOE H2O and CH4, confirmed that tropical
   air entering the stratosphere from below is marked by its water vapor
   mixing ratio and retains a distinct memory of tropical tropopause
   conditions for 18 months or more; this analysis implies that vertical
   mixing is weak and that subtropical stratospheric "transport barriers"
   are effective at inhibiting transport into the tropics. Schoeberl et
   al. [1996b] also use MLS and other UARS data to estimate the dynamical
   isolation of the tropical lower stratosphere.

    Upper tropospheric water vapor

   Although not designed specifically for this measurement, UARS MLS is
   sensitive to upper tropospheric water vapor when the field-of-view of
   its ClO spectral band is scanned down through the troposphere which
   happens once per minute on each limb scan. Important features of the
   MLS measurement technique for upper tropospheric water vapor are its
   ability to observe through cirrus and to determine vertical structure
   with more than 1300 profiles per day. Upper tropospheric water vapor
   measurements are important for determine feedback effects associated
   with increasing greenhouse gases and radiative forcing of climate.

   Initial results [Read et al. 1995] have demonstrated the ability of MLS
   to sense upper tropospheric water vapor, including (1) its
   insensitivity to cirrus, (2) its ability to observe synoptic-scale
   features, and (3) its ability to see detrainment streams extending from
   tropical convective regions. The preliminary measurements from MLS show
   reasonably good agreement with near-coincident aircraft measurements
   [Newell et al., 1996a] and a distribution in the tropics that is
   consistent with the Walker circulation [Newell et al., 1996b]. Elson et
   al. [1996] show the zonal-mean and wave-variances in these measurements
   seen in the first three years of the UARS mission. Newell et al. [1997]
   found variations in MLS tropical upper tropospheric H[2]O over the
   1991-1994 period to be closely related to sea surface temperature
   variations in the eastern tropical Pacific, including both seasonal and
   interannual components. Stone et al. [1996] have used MLS upper
   tropospheric H[2]O measurements to investigate the structure and
   evolution of eastward-traveling medium-scale wave features in the
   southern hemisphere summertime, and found results consistent with
   paradigms for the structure and evolution of baroclinic disturbances.

   MLS measurements of upper tropospheric water vapor in the tropical
   Pacific show expected correlations with El Nino events. During the
   strong El Nino developing in September 1997 the MLS data show an
   anomalously moist upper troposphere over the eastern tropical Pacific,
   and an anomalously dry upper troposphere over the tropical western
   Pacific.

    Atmospheric gravity waves

   Analyses of the 63 GHz radiances from MLS have produced global maps of
   atmospheric temperature variances associated with gravity wave activity
   in the stratosphere and mesosphere [Wu and Waters, 1996a,b]. These data
   provide information on gravity waves with spatial scales of ~30-100 km
   in the horizontal and ~10 km in the vertical. The mapped variances show
   high correlation with regions of strong background winds which are
   expected to play a major role in determining gravity wave amplitudes in
   the stratosphere and mesosphere. The observed variance grows
   exponentially with height in the stratosphere, and saturates in the
   mesosphere as expected from wave breaking and dissipation at the higher
   altitudes. The data also show some correlation with surface topography
   features and regions of tropospheric convective activity which are
   expected sources of gravity waves. The analysis of Alexander [1996]
   indicates that the MLS maps are consistent with model predictions of
   atmospheric gravity wave behavior but that the dominant patterns in the
   maps can be explained, without requiring any geographical variation in
   the sources, by the Doppler-shifting effects of background winds on the
   gravity wave spectrum and the vertical resolution of MLS. The extent to
   which MLS can provide information on atmospheric gravity wave sources
   is a current topic of investigation. Analyses of data taken when the
   MLS FOV was tracking the limb have extended the range of horizontal
   scales to ~15-5000 km [Wu and Waters, 1996c].
