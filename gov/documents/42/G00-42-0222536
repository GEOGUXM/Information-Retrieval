      About CPS - Nimble / Fast / Flexible

      CPS Human Resource Services (CPS) is a California-based governmental
      agency created to help public employers develop and enhance personnel
      programs. We are a self-supporting public agency offering a full range
      of human resource products and services with an emphasis on
      occupational and licensing/certification testing. Over 1,200 public
      agencies are CPS clients because we are:


   Results-oriented
   Recommendations that are practical for today's workplace
   Solution-driven
   Solutions meet your specific objectives and needs
   Cost-effective
   Products and services designed to fit your budget
   Quality-assured
   Client Satisfaction is our top priority

      Originally as a state agency, and now as a Joint Powers Agency, CPS has
      provided testing and human resource management services to public
      agencies for over 60 years. Our highly qualified, professional staff
      provides practical personnel solutions for state agencies, boards and
      commissions, cities, counties, special districts, school districts,
      colleges and universities, federal agencies, and non-profit
      organizations throughout the United States and Canada.

      Because we are a governmental agency, contracting for our services does
      not require competitive bidding and time consuming requests for
      proposals. Our public agency, non-profit status means you pay only for
      the services we provide.

      Our network of consultants includes former state and local government
      human resource executives with extensive expertise and hands-on
      experience. We also offer highly skilled psychometricians with
      doctorates in related fields and extensive experience in assessment
      such as occupational analysis and test development. They are focused on
      results, immediately available, and dedicated to your success.
