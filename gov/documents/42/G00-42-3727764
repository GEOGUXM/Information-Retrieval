   Description of research projects:
   The current project I am working on focuses on the mechanisms of
   particle film technology related to disease control and heat stress in
   fruit production. Particle film materials are used to control insects
   and diseases in apple, peach and pear, however there are other
   physiological effects such as reduced sunburn, and fruit cracking and
   the increased fruit yield, size and color that have been correlated to
   these materials. Field and greenhouse studies will identify the
   physiological mechanisms related to these horticultural benefits.
   Controlling diseases such as powdery mildew, apple scab and fireblight
   has been a primary objective of this project and we have identified
   mineral-based materials that are as effective as conventional
   fungicides with less environmental impact.
