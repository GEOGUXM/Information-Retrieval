   What are the impacts of Invasive Species?
     * One study estimates that the total costs of invasive species in the
       United States amount to more than $100 billion each year. (Pimentel
       et al., 1999)
     * Invasive species impact nearly half of the species currently listed
       as Threatened or Endangered under the U.S Federal Endangered
       Species Act.
     * One invasive plant, purple loosestrife, can produce up to 2.7
       million seeds per plant yearly and spreads across approximately 1
       million additional acres of wetlands each year.
     * The brown tree snake, an invasive snake originating in the South
       Pacific and Australia, has exterminated 10 of 13 native bird
       species, 6 of 12 native lizard species, and 2 of 3 bat species on
       the island of Guam.
     * The glassy-winged sharpshooter, an invasive insect recently
       detected in California, carries with it the plant bacterium Xylella
       fastidiosa, a disease that has caused nearly $40 million in losses
       of California grapes. The disease poses a major threat to grape,
       raisin, and wine industries, as well as the tourism associated with
       them. Collectively these are valued at nearly $35 billion annually.
     * Foot and mouth disease, a highly contagious disease of
       cloven-hoofed animals, has caused the United States to ban
       temporarily meat imports from the European Union and Chile. The
       epidemic has already cost British companies $30 billion dollars,
       according to the Institute of Directors. Small businesses have lost
       on average $75,000 and larger ones have lost approximately
       $300,000.

   How are we dealing with the Invasive Species Problem?

   On February 3, 1999, Executive Order 13112 was signed establishing the
   National Invasive Species Council (Council). The Council is an
   inter-Departmental body that helps to coordinate and ensure
   complementary, cost-effective Federal activities regarding invasive
   species. Council members include the Departments of the Interior,
   Agriculture, Commerce, State, Treasury, Transportation, Defense, and
   Health and Human Services, and the Environmental Protection Agency, and
   the U.S. Agency for International Development.

   Together with the Invasive Species Advisory Committee, stakeholders,
   concerned members of the public, and member departments, the Council
   formulated an action plan for the nation. The Council issued the
   National Invasive Species Management Plan early in 2001 to provide an
   overall blueprint for Federal action. The Plan recommends specific
   action items to improve coordination, prevention, control and
   management of invasive species by the Federal agency members of the
   Council.
