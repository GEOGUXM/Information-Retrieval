   Unemployment Insurance
        __________________________________________________________________

   In general, the Federal-State Unemployment Insurance Program provides
   unemployment benefits to eligible workers who are unemployed through no
   fault of their own (as determined under State law), and meet other
   eligibility requirments of State law.
   Unemployment insurance payments (benefits) are intended to provide
   temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers who meet the
   requirements of State law.
   Each State administers a separate unemployment insurance program within
   guidelines established by Federal law.
   Eligibility for unemployment insurance, benefit amounts and the length
   of time benefits are available are determined by the State law under
   which unemployment insurance claims are established.
   In the majority of States, benefit funding is based solely on a tax
   imposed on employers. (Three (3) States require minimal employee
   contributions.)
   You should contact the State Unemployment Insurance agency as soon as
   possible after becoming unemployed. In some States, you can now file a
   claim by telephone.
