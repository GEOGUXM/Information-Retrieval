   Seniors and Computers

   Seniors have become the fastest growing group of Internet users.
   Because of this, a number of websites and organizations cater
   specifically to the computer training and resource needs of senior
   citizens. The following links are a compilation of websites that
   provide computer training, technological news, helpful tips, and
   tutorial resources of interest to seniors.

   Our articles on seniors and computers generated a lot of letters on
   local efforts and commercial and non-profit groups that are bringing
   seniors online. Our special section on Connecting the Senior Citizen
   provides a variety of interesting perspectives.
