   SGS Scientist in the National Wetlands Research Center, LA As the
   Nations largest water, earth, and biological science and civilian
   mapping agency, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) works in cooperation
   with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide
   reliable, impartial scientific information to resource managers,
   planners, and other customers. This information is gathered in every
   State by USGS scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from
   natural disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound
   economic and physical development of the Nations natural resources,
   and to enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological,
   energy, and mineral resources.

   imaging, and hosts of other natural sciences are gathering data,
   integrating it, and demonstrating its application to today's issues.
