   Research Interests:

   My laboratory is interested in structure/function analysis of
   multicomponent enzymatic pathways. Our understanding of the function of
   such pathways is often incomplete because typically individual proteins
   have been studied in isolation rather than in the context of a
   biologically relevant complex. There are two systems that I am focusing
   on; the primary system is the pathway by which DNA double strand break
   (DSB) repair occurs in mammalian cells and the secondary system is the
   electron transfer pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis.

   DSB repair is crucial to the survival of a cell, yet its mechanism is
   relatively poorly understood. It is known that protein:protein
   interactions play a crucial part in the regulation and action of
   repair, and some of the players are already known including DNA protein
   kinase (DNA-PK), Ku70:80, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV.

   Fatty acid desaturation occurs in all mammals and involves the transfer
   of electrons from b5 reductase(B5R)-bound NADH to cytochrome b5. How
   this transfer is achieved is one of the key unanswered questions in
   this pathway. My research centers on obtaining their structures, alone,
   and in biologically relevant complexes.
