        also find resources to other helpful materials. Information on this
                              site is updated daily.

                        The Office of the Inspector General
           The USAID Inspector General heads an independent organization
      responsible for audits and investigations relating to USAID's programs

      Agency development experience documentation and disseminates it to the
