                            What does CM/ECF do?

   CM/ECF allows all documents associated with a court case to be managed
        electronically. It supports the unique interests of different
    communities -- courts, attorneys and the public -- while providing a
    next generation case management system. CM is the replacement for the
   courtâ€™s current BANCAP database to a new case management system that
   will eventually incorporate electronic filings (ECF) by external users
                              into the system.



          What is Case Management /Electronic Case Filing (CM/ECF)?

    CM/ECF is a two-part solution to the judiciary's case management and
    filing needs. It has been motivated by the necessity of replacing an
   aging family of case management application (BANCAP) that will soon be
       unsupportable. At the same time that the judiciary is replacing
    outdated case management systems, today's technology has advanced to
    the point that information can be efficiently and securely exchanged
     electronically. Accordingly, the system includes the capability for
    electronic files, including the ability to accept court filings over
                                the Internet.

                                How and When?
   The new case management system (CM) replaced the current BANCAP system
     on  October 29, 2001. Now that the conversion has taken place, the
     clerk's office will be working toward a date for external users to
                             begin using CM/ECF.
