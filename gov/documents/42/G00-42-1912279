               Wellstone Presses for Aid to Unemployed Workers

           Nearly 30,000 More Unemployed Minnesotans in Past Year;
        Assistance Needed for Laid-off Workers in Struggling Economy
     __________________________________________________________________

   (Washington, D.C.) - Senator Paul Wellstone today pressed for passage
   of an amendment with Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) to the stimulus package
   to expand eligibility and increase benefits for unemployment insurance
   for those out of work in the failing economy.  The amendment would
   provide unemployment benefits to individuals currently ineligible for
   benefits - specifically, low income workers, single mothers with young
   children, and second earners in families desperately trying to make
   ends meet - and temporarily increase the dollar amount of unemployment
   benefits to which a family is entitled.

   "We are in a recession, and workers throughout our country are
   suffering because of it," Wellstone said. "Working families in
   Minnesota are reeling from the impact of this economy.  No matter where
   I travel in Minnesota, I hear from workers who are desperate - they
   have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and their
   unemployment benefits are running out.  They have nowhere to turn.  It
   is essential that we act, and we act now."

   The stimulus package being considered by the Senate today includes a
   13-week extension of  unemployment insurance for workers whose
   unemployment has or will run out sometime after September 11, 2001.
   However, this extension does not include more than half of unemployed
   workers - specifically part-time and low-wage workers, welfare-to-work
   moms and many women who move in and out of the workforce to care for
   their families- even though these workers pay into the unemployment
   insurance program.  The amendment pushed by Wellstone today would
   extend benefits to these workers left out.  In addition, the amendment
   would temporarily increase UI benefits by 15 % or $25 per week
   (whichever is greater) to help these families pay for basic
   necessities.  Wellstone said the amendment, which would put cash into
   the hands of those most likely to spend it, would also serve as a
   crucial part of any sound economic stimulus.

   "Providing unemployment insurance to laid-off workers is not just the
   right thing to do, it is a smart way to stimulate the economy," said
   Wellstone.  "This amendment makes three urgently needed changes to the
   current unemployment program.  Time is of the essence to all of these
   families in Minnesota and around the country.  We must act now."
