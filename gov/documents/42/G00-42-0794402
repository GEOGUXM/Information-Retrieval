   GREEN PAPER Towards a European strategy for the security of energy
   supply EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
   COM(2000) 769 Brussels, 29 November 2000 *UHHQ 3DSHU Towards a European
   strategy for the security of energy supply 1 (;(&87,9( 6800$5< The
   European Union is consuming more and more energy and importing more and
   more energy products. Community production is insufficient for the
   Union's energy requirements. As a result, external dependence for
   energy is constantly increasing. The dramatic rise in oil prices which
   could undermine the recovery of the European economy, caused by the
   fact that the price of crude oil has tripled since March 1999, once
   again reveals the European Union's VWUXFWXUDO ZHDNQHVVHV regarding
   energy supply, namely Europe's growing dependence on energy, the role
   of oil as the governing factor in the price of energy and the
   disappointing results of policies to control consumption. Without an
   active energy policy, the European Union will not be able to free
   itself from its increasing energy dependence. If no measures are taken,
   in the next 20 to 30 years 70% of the Union's energy requirements, as
   opposed to the current 50%, will be covered by imported products. This
   dependence can be witnessed in all sectors of the economy. For example
   transport, the domestic sector and the electricity industry depend
   largely on oil and gas and are at the mercy of erratic variations in
   international prices. Enlargement will exacerbate these trends. In
   economic terms, the consequences of this dependence are heavy. It cost
   the Union some EUR 240 billion in 1999, or 6% of total imports. In
   geopolitical terms, 45% of oil imports come from the Middle East and
   40% of natural gas from Russia. The European Union does not yet have
   all the means to change the international market. The European Union's
   long-term strategy for energy supply security must be geared to
   ensuring, for the well-being of its citizens and the proper functioning
   of the economy, the uninterrupted physical availability of energy
   products on the market, at a price which is affordable for all
   consumers (private and industrial), while respecting environmental
   concerns and looking towards sustainable development, as enshrined in
   Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Security of supply
   does not seek to maximise energy self-sufficiency or to minimise
   dependence, but aims to reduce the risks linked to such dependence.
   Among the objectives to be pursued are those balancing between and
   diversifying of the various sources of supply (by product and by
   geographical region). . The European Union now has to face QHZ
   FKDOOHQJHV characteristic of a period of profound transition for the
   European economy. In the decade to come, LQYHVWPHQWV LQ HQHUJ\ both to
   replace existing resources and in order to meet increasing energy
   requirements, will oblige European economies to arbitrate among energy
   products which, given the inertia of energy systems, will condition the
   next 30 years. The HQHUJ\ RSWLRQV exercised by the European Union are
   conditioned by the world context, by the enlargement perhaps 30 Member
   States with different energy structures, but above all by the new
   reference framework for the energy market, namely the liberalisation of
   the sector and environmental concerns. 2 (QYLURQPHQWDO concerns, which
   are nowadays shared by the majority of the public and which include
   damage caused by the energy supply system, whether such damage is of
   accidental origin (oil slicks, nuclear accidents, methane leaks) or
   connected to emissions of pollutants, have highlighted the weaknesses
   of fossil fuels and the problems of atomic energy. As for the struggle
   against climate changes, this is a major challenge. Climate change is a
   long-term battle for the international community. The commitments made
   in the Kyoto Protocol are only a first step. The European Union has
   reached its objective in 2000, but greenhouse gas emissions are on the
   rise in the Union as in the rest of the world. It is much more arduous
   to reverse this trend than it might have seemed three years ago. The
   return to sustained economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic and
   in Asia and the development of our energy consumption structure, mainly
   of electricity and for transport, which is a consequence of our
   lifestyle, are contributing to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions
   and of carbon dioxide in particular. This situation is a major
   stumbling block to any policy seeking to safeguard the environment.
   What is more, the achievement of the LQWHUQDO HQHUJ\ PDUNHW has given a
   new position and role to energy demand. New tensions are appearing and
   our societies will have to find valid compromises to ease them. For
   example, the fall in electricity prices goes against policies to
   curtail increasing demand and to combat climate change, while the
   competition introduced by the internal market is changing the
   conditions of competitiveness for the different sources of energy
   supply (coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil, renewables). Nowadays the
   0HPEHU 6WDWHV DUH LQWHUGHSHQGHQW both as regards the issue of combating
   climate change and for the completion of the internal energy market.
   Any energy policy decision taken by one Member State will inevitably
   have an impact on the functioning of the market in the other Member
   States. Energy policy has assumed a new Community dimension without
   that fact being reflected in new Community powers. In this context, it
   is appropriate to analyse whether it is worthwhile conceiving a
   European energy policy from an angle other than that of the internal
   market, harmonisation, the environment or taxation. The European Union
   must take better charge of its energy destiny. We are obliged to
   acknowledge that, despite the various crises besetting the European
   economy in the last thirty years, there has not been a real debate on
   the choice of energy sources and even less an energy policy regarding
   security of supply. Now, the twin pressures of environmental concerns
   and the new functioning of the European energy market make this debate
   inevitable. The oil price crisis prevailing since 1999 makes it urgent.
   This debate should take into account that current energy demand is
   covered by 41% oil, 22% gas, 16% coal (hard coal, lignite and peat),
   15% nuclear and 6% renewables. If nothing is done, the total energy
   picture in 2030 will continue to be dominated by fossil fuels: 38% oil,
   29% gas, 19% solid fuels, 8% renewables and barely 6% nuclear. The
   Green Paper sketches out the bare bones of a long-term energy strategy,
   according to which: - 7KH 8QLRQ PXVW UHEDODQFH LWV VXSSO\ SROLF\ E\
   FOHDU DFWLRQ LQ IDYRXU RI D GHPDQG SROLF\ The margins for manoeuvre for
   any increase in Community supply 3 are weak in view of its
   requirements, while the scope for action to address demand appears more
   promising. - With regard to demand, the Green Paper is calling for a
   real change in consumer behaviour. It highlights the value of WD[DWLRQ
   PHDVXUHV to steer demand towards better-controlled consumption which is
   more respectful of the environment. Taxation or parafiscal levies are
   advocated with a view to penalising the harmful environmental impact of
   energies. The transport and construction industries will have to apply
   an active energy savings policy and diversification in favour of
   non-polluting energy. - With regard to supply, priority must be given
   to the fight against global warming. The development of new and
   renewable energies (including biofuels) is the key to change. Doubling
   their share in the energy supply quota from 6 to 12% and raising their
   part in electricity production from 14 to 22% is an objective to be
   attained between now and 2010. If current conditions apply, they will
   stagnate around 7% in ten years. Only financial measures (aids, tax
   deductions and financial support) would be able to buttress such an
   ambitious aim. One way which could be explored is that profitable
   energies such as oil, gas and nuclear could finance the development of
   renewable energies which, unlike traditional energy sources, have not
   benefited from substantial support. The contribution of atomic energy
   in the medium term must, in its turn, be analysed. Among the issues
   which will certainly form part of the debate will be the decision by
   most Member States to relinquish this sector, the fight against global
   warming, security of supply and sustainable development. Whatever the
   conclusions of this reflection, research on waste management
   technologies and their implementation in the best possible safety
   conditions must be actively pursued. As far as oil and gas are
   concerned, imports of which are increasing, a stronger mechanism ought
   to be provided to build up strategic stocks and to foresee new import
   routes. Every form of technological progress will help to reinforce the
   impact of this outline energy strategy. The Commission proposes to
   launch a debate during 2001 around the essential questions which shed
   light on the energy choices to be made. It is not a question of
   proposing a "key in the door" strategy for security of supply, but to
   hold a new and deep and debate on the principal questions which can be
   identified, notwithstanding possible additional ones. 4 &217(176

   ...........82 8 ,1752'8&7,21 This Green Paper is the response to an
   observable IDFW: Europe's growing future energy dependence. Its aim is
   to initiate a debate on the security of energy supply, an issue that is
   still very much alive. The recent tripling in the price of crude oil on
   the international market has served as a grim reminder of the crucial
   role of energy in Europe's economy. Security of supply does not seek to
   maximise our autonomy in energy or to minimise our dependence, but to
   reduce the risks connected to the latter. Energy dependence is not in
   itself an easy problem to solve, however the concept of security of
   supply which appears in the Treaty on European Union (Article 100)
   calls for an exercise of reflection over the diversification of the
   various sources of supply (in products and by geographical areas). The
   European Union is extremely GHSHQGHQW on its external VXSSOLHV. It
   currently imports some 50% of its requirements, a figure that will rise
   to about 70% in 2030, with an even greater dependence on oil and gas,
   if current trends persist. It cost the Union some EUR 240 billion in
   1999, or 6% of total imports and 1.2% of GDP. Security of supply in the
   energy field must be geared to ensuring, for the good of the general
   public and the smooth functioning of the economy, the uninterrupted
   physical availability on the market of energy products at prices for
   all consumers (both private and industrial), in the framework of the
   objective of sustainable development enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty.
   How much importance, then, should the European Union attach to the
   security of its supplies? This question is all the more pressing with
   enlargement imminent and relations with our partners (suppliers and
   transit countries) in the process of being redefined.  Can we afford to
   ignore a dependence of more than 40% on oil imported from OPEC
   countries?  Can we allow erratic increases in the price of oil and gas
   to disrupt our economies and those of the non-producer developing
   countries ?  Is it acceptable for oil and gas transport networks in
   their present form to be a source of instability in the supply chain?
   Investments in energy, both to replace the obsolete infrastructures and
   to meet the growth in demand will be necessary in the next ten years in
   the new energy market context (opening up of the sector to competition
   and environmental concerns). The opportunity should be seized to
   promote a coherent energy policy at the Community level. )DFHG ZLWK

   LQVWUXPHQWV DW LWV GLVSRVDO WR PHHW WKHVH FKDOOHQJHV The present Green
   Paper describes these weaknesses and proposes a reflection about the
   different instruments which could be used. However, energy concerns
   have been a permanent feature since the very beginnings of European
   construction. Two of the three treaties establishing the European
   Communities are about energy: the European Coal and Steel Community
   (ECSC) Treaty and the Euratom Treaty. These two treaties were adopted
   primarily to ensure regular and equitable supplies of coal and nuclear
   energy in the Community. In the Treaty establishing the European
   Economic Community, however, the Member States chose not to lay the
   foundations of a common energy policy. Subsequent attempts to include a
   chapter on energy, during the negotiations on the Maastricht and
   Amsterdam Treaties, ended in failure. Energy receives no more than a
   mention in the preamble to the Amsterdam Treaty. There has thus never
   been a real Community debate on the main lines of an energy policy. As
   a result, the energy problems which have inevitably cropped up since
   the Treaty of Rome was 9 adopted, more particularly after the first oil
   crises, have been approached either through the mechanism of the
   internal market, or from the angle of harmonisation, environmental
   policy or taxation. Security of supply concerns are not, however, alien
   to the Treaty, as scope for action at the Community level to remedy
   supply problems has existed since the Treaty of Rome (e.g. Article
   103). This is the Article on which the decision on oil stocks was
   based. However, since the Maastricht Treaty,1 the implementation of
   such measures requires decisions to be taken unanimously rather than by
   qualified majority as previously (Article 100 of the Treaty on European
   Union). Today, 0HPEHU 6WDWHV DUH LQWHUGHSHQGHQW, both because of
   climate change issues and the creation of the internal energy market.
   Any energy policy decision taken by a Member State will inevitably have
   repercussions on the functioning of the market in other Member States.
   Energy policy has assumed a new, Community dimension. In this context,
   it is legitimate to question the wisdom of uncoordinated national
   decisions on energy policy. As Mr Prodi, the President of the European
   Commission, said in his address to the European Parliament on 3 October
   2000 "You cannot on the one hand deplore the lack of effective and
   united European action and on the other be content with the weakness of
   the instruments available to the Community for carrying out such
   action. The recent petrol crisis is a perfect illustration". The
   analysis in this Green Paper sets out to show, as objectively as
   possible, that the (XURSHDQ 8QLRQ has very OLPLWHG VFRSH to influence
   the energy supply side. It also sets out to show, without bias, that
   the major efforts required to promote renewables will in fact have a
   limited impact in the face of the growth in demand. Conventional energy
   sources will remain indispensable for a long time. (IIRUWV ZLOO KDYH WR

   V .\RWR FRPPLWPHQWV DQG LV PLQGIXO RI VHFXULW\ RI VXSSO\. Apart from
   declarations of principle, what specific measures can be taken? This is
   the issue on which the Green Paper wishes to initiate a debate,
   starting in particular with the 12 questions at the end of the Paper
   which are reproduced below for the reader's convenience. Three main
   points emerge from the Green Paper: - The European Union will become
   increasingly dependent on external energy sources; enlargement will not
   change the situation; based on current forecasts, dependence will reach
   70% in 2030. - The European Union has very limited scope to influence
   energy supply conditions; it is essentially on the demand side that the
   EU can intervene, mainly by promoting energy saving in buildings and
   the transport sector. - At present, the European Union is not in a
   position to respond to the challenge of climate change and to meet its
   commitments, notably under the Kyoto Protocol. In these circumstances,
   the Commission would like the debate on the future strategy to be
   structured around the following principal questions: 1 The new Article
   requires unanimity to "decide upon the measures appropriate to the
   economic situation, in particular if serious difficulties arise in the
   supply of certain products". 10 1. Can the European Union accept an
   increase in its dependence on external energy sources without
   compromising its security of supply and European competitiveness? For
   which sources of energy would it be appropriate, if this were the case,
   to foresee a framework policy for imports? In this context, is it
   appropriate to favour an economic approach: energy cost; or
   geopolitical approach: risk of disruption? 2. Does not Europe's
   increasingly integrated internal market, where decisions taken in one
   country have an impact on the others, call for a consistent and
   co-ordinated policy at Community level? What should such a policy
   consist of and where should competition rules fit in? 3. Are tax and
   state aid policies in the energy sector an obstacle to competitiveness
   in the European Union or not? Given the failure of attempts to
   harmonise indirect taxation, should not the whole issue of energy
   taxation be re-examined taking account of energy and environmental
   objectives? 4. In the framework of an ongoing dialogue with producer
   countries, what should supply and investment promotion agreements
   contain? Given the importance of a partnership with Russia in
   particular, how can stable quantities, prices and investments be
   guaranteed? 5. Should more reserves be stockpiled -as already done for
   oil - and should other energy sources be included, such as gas or coal?
   Should the the Community take on a greater role in stock management
   and, if so, what should the objectives and modalities be? Does the risk
   of physical disruption to energy supplies justify more onerous measures
   for access to resources? 6. How can we ensure the development and
   better operation of energy transport networks in the European Union and
   neighbouring countries that enable the internal market to function
   properly and guarantee security of supply? 7. The development of some
   renewable energy sources calls for major efforts in terms of Research
   and Technological Development, investment aid and operational aid.
   Should co-financing of this aid include a contribution from sectors
   which received substantial initial development aid and which are now
   highly profitable (gas, oil, nuclear)? 8. Seeing that nuclear energy is
   one of the elements in the debate on tackling climate change and energy
   autonomy, how can the Community find a solution to the problem of
   nuclear waste, reinforcing nuclear safety and developing research into
   reactors of the future, in particular fusion technology? 9. Which
   policies should permit the European Union to fulfil its obligations
   within the Kyoto Protocol? What measures could be taken in order to
   exploit fully potential energy savings which would help to reduce both
   our external dependence and CO2 emissions? 10. Can an ambitious
   programme to promote biofuels and other substitute fuels, including
   hydrogen, geared to 20% of total fuel consumption by 2020, continue to
   be implemented via national initiatives, or are co-ordinated decisions
   required on taxation, distribution and prospects for agricultural
   production? 11. Should energy saving in buildings (40% of energy
   consumption), whether public or private, new or under renovation, be
   promoted through incentives such as tax breaks, or are regulatory
   measures required along the lines of those adopted for major industrial
   installations? 12. Energy saving in the transport sector (32% of energy
   consumption) depends on redressing the growing imbalance between road
   haulage and rail. Is this imbalance inevitable, or could corrective
   action be taken, however unpopular, notably to encourage lower use of
   cars in urban areas? How can the aims of opening up the sector to
   competition, investment in infrastructure to remove bottlenecks and
   intermodality be reconciled? 13. How can we develop more collaborative
   visions and integrate the long-term dimension into deliberations and
   actions undertaken by public authorities and other involved parties in
   order to evolve a sustainable system of energy supply. How are we to
   prepare the energy options for the future. 11 3$57 21( %$6,& )$&76

   industrial demand has been relatively stable, as a result of the
   transition to a service-oriented economy, the increased demand for
   electricity, transport and heat from households and the tertiary sector
   has more than made up for this decline. The long-term evolution of
   energy demand in the applicant countries will doubtless track that of
   the Union, even though these states are at present well behind in terms
   of energy conservation. Once the present crisis period is over,
   however, the medium term will inevitably see a rapid surge in energy
   demand, especially since their economies in the period leading up to
   2010 will be growing much faster than those of the Member States (an
   annual rate of between 3 and 6%, as compared to 2-4% for the EU). This
   transition period could provide these countries with the opportunity of
   modernising their systems. E u ro p e -3 0 : F in a l e n e rg y c o n

   Investment in modernisation has enabled European industry to reduce its
   need for energy. A conscious effort has been made to reduce dependence
   on oil (which now represents only 16% 2 This Green Paper examines the
   Union's energy needs in a 20-to-30-year time frame. Over this period it
   is possible the number of Member States may grow to around 30. 3 Mtoe =

   are taken from the forecasts in Part 3 I.B below 12 of total industrial
   energy consumption) and diversify into natural gas and electricity. As
   a result, the sector saw its energy intensity5 decline by 23% between
   1985 and 1998. The stability of consumption between 1985 and 19986 was
   due to the introduction of combined heat and power generation and
   greater technological efficiency, but Europe's transition to a
   service-oriented economy also played a key role. In the applicant
   countries, however, this trend is not yet clearly visible. As they
   recover from their severe recession, the industrial sectors of the CEEC
   countries will probably absorb 2% of annual growth in energy demand
   between now and 2020. 2. Held hostage by oil: households, services and
   the transport sector D +RXVHKROGV WKH WHUWLDU\ VHFWRU DQG WHFKQRORJLFDO
   SURJUHVV In absolute terms, the biggest energy users are households and
   the tertiary sector. To date, their energy use has tended to grow at a
   moderate rate,7 as a decrease in energy intensity was partly offset by
   a systematic rise in levels of material comfort. The result has been
   higher per capita consumption, in particular of electricity. Per capita
   consumption in the applicant countries remains lower, despite weaker
   energy saving efforts. This can be explained by delays in investment
   and economic development. Excluding personal transport, 63% of
   household needs are supplied by oil and gas. Households are the biggest
   consumers of natural gas (1/3 of total gas consumption, supplying 40%
   of household demand) and account for approximately 18% of total oil use
   (1/4 of household demand). E 7UDQVSRUW Transport certainly represents
   the great unknown for the future of energy. With a market entirely
   dependent upon oil (98% of transport consumption, representing 67% of
   final oil demand), this sector has seen consumption rise steeply.
   Between 1985 and 1998 it rose from 203 Mtoe to 298 Mtoe, while the
   number of public and private vehicles in use rose from 132 million to
   189 million, with a parallel explosion in air traffic. The sector's
   energy intensity increased by 10% between 1985 and 1998.8 In the
   foreseeable future, this sector should continue to grow at a rate of 2%
   per annum over the coming decade. Within the European Union, passenger
   transport should increase by 19% by 2010, mainly due to a 16% rise in
   road use and a 90% increase in air traffic. At the same time, goods
   transport is expected to grow by 38%, driven by road (+50%) and
   seaborne (+34%). The efforts undertaken by the automotive industry
   under its agreements with the Commission to reduce CO2 emissions from
   passenger cars will make and important contribution to preventing these
   trends from translating into a corresponding increase in fuel
   consumption. However, this progress will not be sufficient to reduce or
   even come close to stabilising the transport's sector's energy demand.
   These growth factors will have an even greater impact in applicant
   countries. After enlargement, the Union will have to provide mobility
   for an additional 170 million people, while its territory will be
   extended by 1.86 million square kilometres. Given the gap in
   development with the European Union, there will be a lot of catching up
   to do. In one optimistic scenario, applicant countries could see their
   economies grow at an annual rate of 5- 6% over the next decade - that
   is, twice as fast as the existing Member States. If that is the 5

   between 1980 and 1998. 8 The most important factor underlying this rise
   was the increase, especially over the last few years, in
   intra-Community road transport between the Iberian peninsula and the
   rest of the Union, as well as with the Central and Eastern European
   Countries 13 case, then transport demand will inevitably grow even
   faster than the economy. Most of this growth will have to be supplied
   by the road transport sector. Growth in demand, combined with gaps in
   infrastructure and services, especially when it comes to international
   transport and the breakdown of traffic between the different transport
   sectors, will aggravate existing congestion problems (saturated cities,
   road networks, airports). This congestion not only comes at significant
   economic and environmental cost, it also impacts negatively on quality
   of life. In this way, external costs of pollution due to transport have
   been estimated at nearly 2% of GDP. 3. Energy diversification:

   one space = 50GWH) In recent years, demand for electricity has grown
   much more rapidly than for any other type of energy, and will continue
   to track GDP growth closely until 2020. In the applicant countries this
   demand should grow even faster, with electricity increasing by 3%
   annually9 between now and 2020. The EU's installed capacity should
   reach 800-900 GWe10 in around 2020, compared to the present 600 GWe.
   Around 300 GWe of capacity will be installed over the next 20 years
   simply to replace power stations that have reached the end of their
   lives, in addition to the 200-300 GWe that will be necessary to meet
   increased demand. In the absence of any major technological
   breakthrough, excess demand will have to be supplied from already
   available energy sources: natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear and renewable
   energy. At present, electricity is generated from the following
   sources: nuclear (35%), solid fuel (27%), natural gas (16%), hydro and
   other renewables (15%) and oil (8%). New capacity 9 European Energy
   outlook to 2020: figures based on the seven Central European countries,
   excluding Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania. 10 Gwe : Giga watt electric
   14 will be predominantly gas-generated, while the number of oil and
   solid-fuel power stations will continue to decline. At the moment, it
   seems unlikely that nuclear energy will see renewed growth. In the
   long- term, its contribution is linked to the pursuit of policies to
   combat climate change, its competitive position vis-à-vis other energy
   sources, public acceptance and a possible solution to the problem of
   nuclear waste. Given the present political context (decision by certain
   Member States to relinquish this sector), it seems likely that the
   contribution of nuclear energy will change little from now until 2020.
   In the medium-term, possible disenchantment with nuclear could result
   in greater use of thermal power stations, barring new investments.
   However, this forecast could be changed with an enhanced contribution
   of renewable energy and action on the energy demand side. The present
   electricity generation capacity of the applicant countries is difficult
   to assess. Modernisation/replacement of existing generation facilities
   seems certain to proceed at a rapid rate, since a large number of these
   plants are already obsolete. - In theory, existing thermal power
   stations whose capacity is currently in surplus will require extensive
   modernisation. Some of the solid fuel stations may be replaced by gas-
   fired plants. However, were the price of gas on the international
   markets to rise and remain high, investments might be held back. In
   that case, solid-fuel and nuclear would continue to play a significant
   role. Indeed, in the reference scenario,11 higher gas prices could lead
   to a 24% reduction in the growth rate for gas use. - The expansion of
   nuclear generating facilities will depend upon efforts by the states
   concerned to ensure that these facilities are safe. Nuclear power is
   already diminishing as a proportion of energy use in the applicant
   countries, and is forecast to decline from the present 15% to 8.1% by
   around 2020.12 E +HDWLQJ Heating is the largest single user of final
   energy, accounting for about one third of total consumption. The market
   ranges from household heating (including hot water) to steam production
   for industrial uses. The energy balance for heat production is very
   different from that for electricity. Unlike electricity, heat
   production is predominantly decentralised, whether it takes the form of
   individual heating systems, CHP13 or dedicated heat stations with their
   associated heating networks. The latter are more common in the
   applicant countries than in the EU Member States. % &RPPXQLW\ UHVRXUFHV
   DUH OLPLWHG Despite the considerable progress made in tapping
   conventional energy reserves in Europe, their levels remain low and
   they are expensive to extract. In the future, domestic fossil fuel

   the situation is even worse. The Community has eight years of known
   reserves at current consumption rates (assuming no change in
   consumption patterns and/or related technologies). Thanks to the North
   Sea, whose reserves belong mainly to the United Kingdom, the Union
   produces some 158.3 Mtoe (1997), representing scarcely 4.4% of world
   output. Today, the cost of extracting one barrel of oil in Europe
   ranges between USD 7-11, compared to a range of USD 1-3 in the Middle

   223.2 Mtoe were extracted in 1997, representing 12% of world

   ZLOO EH GHSOHWHG depends not only on the extent of known reserves, but
   also on the price of oil and gas on the world market, and on
   technological progress. The higher the price of oil, the more companies
   will invest in prospecting and production. If present oil and natural
   gas prices could be sustained (around USD 30 in 2000), then large
   reserves would be brought into production. Amid such uncertainties,
   however, one thing is clear: if production continues at its present
   rate, North Sea oil and gas deposits will be exhausted within 25 years.
   Enlargement will do nothing to increase internal supply14. Forecasts
   are usually exceeded notably as a result of technological innovation,
   as shown in the graph below. If investment were to pick up, this might
   also help relieve the prevailing pessimistic outlook. New extraction
   technologies may mean that, in time, the recovery rate could rise from
   20- 40% of deposits to 60%. N o rth S e a p ro d u ctio n fo rec asts 1

   HU Ã 2. Decline in mine production D 6ROLG IXHOV In absolute terms, the
   world has substantial reserves of solid fuel - 4-5 times as much as
   oil, or some 200 years' supply. 80% of Europe's fossil fuel reserves
   are solid fuels (including coal, lignite, peat and oil shale). However,
   this optimism has to be tempered by the fact the quality of solid fuels
   is variable and production costs are high. The Community now produces
   1.2 Mtoe of peat a year, 50 Mtoe of lignite and 60 Mtoe of coal (or
   some 5% of world production). After enlargement, the Union's coal
   production will more than double. However, while lignite and peat are
   profitable businesses, European coal is highly uncompetitive compared
   with imported coal. Difficult geological conditions and the rules
   governing social insurance in the European Union cause the average cost
   of producing European coal to be 3-4 times the international market
   price (US$ 150 per Tce compared to US$ 40 per Tce). Given this context,
   European coal cannot compete with that of the major coal exporting
   countries such as the United States, Australia, South Africa or
   Columbia. This gap has led producing countries either to cease all 14
   In 1999, Norway had 1.77 trillion cubic metres of proven gas reserves
   which at current production rates will last 23 years, proven oil
   reserves at around 11 bn barrels are over half Europe's reserves but at
   current production rates will last 10 years. However, there are
   substantial reserves of oil and gas to be exploited in the Barents Sea.
   17 production as in Portugal, Belgium and France (in 2005) or to decide
   to restructure the industry so as to gradually reduce mining activity
   (Germany and Spain) or to make production competitive with that of
   imported coal (United Kingdom). A few years hence, the highly
   uncompetitive European coal industry will be providing only a tiny
   proportion of the Union's energy needs, even after taking enlargement
   into account (Poland, Czech Republic, Romania). Although the applicant
   countries have substantial solid fuel reserves, they will not be able
   to stand up to international competition, and will have to reduce their
   mining activities in line with EU policy. Difficult decisions will have
   to be taken regarding the future of the European coal industry on
   account of its lack of competitiveness. One path to explore could be
   that of maintaining access to certain reserves. To this end, it might
   be possible to envisage maintaining minimal capacity of coal production
   in realistic economic conditions, which would ensure the maintenance of
   the equipment and thus guarantee the continuity of good operation,
   while at the same time allowing European technology to keep its leading
   position in clean-coal mining and consumption. E 8UDQLXP The world has
   two and half million tonnes of known uranium reserves (uranium being
   the only part of the nuclear fuel cycle in which the Union is not
   self-sufficient) at a market price lower than US$ 80 a kilo,
   representing 40 years' demand at present rates of consumption (the
   current market price is around US$ 20 a kilo). Further known resources
   come to about 850 000 tonnes (corresponding to 15 years' demand) at the
   same price and are mainly located in Australia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan
   and Canada. The European Union, for its part, is home to barely 2% of
   the world's natural uranium reserves (i.e. 52 000 tonnes) at a price
   lower than US$ 80 a kilo but production will shut down around 2005 in
   France and Portugal. Europe's uranium mines have closed principally
   because the deposits have been exhausted and it is expensive to extract
   relative to the world price, and because world physical stocks of
   nuclear fuel are very high. 2ULJLQ RI XUDQLXP LPSRUWV XVHG LQ WKH 8QLRQ
   Namibia + Others South Africa EU Canada NIS Australia Gabon+Niger More
   uranium could be made available, but only at a higher price. There are
   in fact non- conventional reserves which would be sufficient in the
   long term. But this would have little impact on the cost of electricity
   per kilowatt/hour, since it would concern only a very small part of
   total production. 18 The recyclable nature of the used fuel accounts
   for the promising outlook for reserves. Nuclear fuel differs from other
   primary energy sources in that fission products can be recycled,
   proportionately reducing import requirements. Once separated from their
   waste products (amounting to around 4%), both recovered uranium and
   plutonium can be used again to generate more electricity. Material
   obtained from the decommissioning of nuclear weapons can also be
   recycled as nuclear fuel. 3. Potential abundance of renewable energy
   Renewable energy sources, such as firewood and hydro-electricity, have
   a modest role in the European economies. They represent more
   significant share in the applicant countries, and in some isolated
   regions, such as islands, are the only source of energy. Nevertheless,
   they have the potential to play a much larger role in both the economy
   and the energy balance. Renewable energy technology, especially at the
   cutting edge, is still in its infancy. However, public support for
   research has led to significant progress over the last few years. Wind
   energy is now widely recognised as a viable option. Photovoltaic
   energy, meanwhile, though promising, is still far from economically
   competitive. Resource levels for renewable energy are a problem only
   for energy forms which are not driven by the elements, such as biomass
   (including biofuel), wood and various kinds of biodegradable waste. Yet
   in theory, as their categorisation as 'renewable' indicates, there are
   not really any supply problems. Household waste is constantly growing
   and provides a significant energy opportunity, as do by-products from
   the timber and agri-foodstuffs industries. However, their use is not
   without environmental impact and can only develop thanks to advanced
   technology due to technological difficulties which still need to be
   overcome. The question of which type of waste can be incinerated will
   require attention. Community resources in conventional primary energy
   cannot, at their current stage of development, form the basis for
   European energy self-sufficiency. Only technology-intensive renewable
   resources can help mitigate the present trend towards increasing energy
   dependence. &RQFOXVLRQ : In 1998, the European Union consumed 1 436
   million toe of energy from all sources taken together, of which 753
   million toe were produced within the Community. Demand was covered by
   16% coal, 41% oil, 22% gas, 15% nuclear and 6% renewables. The CEEC
   countries consumed 285 million toe and produced 164 million toe. 8QOHVV

   *XOOLYHU LQ FKDLQV RU HQHUJ\ VXSSO\ LQ WKH (XURSHDQ 8QLRQ The European
   Union is an important actor on the international market for energy
   products (second largest energy consumer in the world, and the largest
   energy importer16). As such, it is associated with demand on the world

   crisis, the EU also succeeded in reducing its energy dependence over
   this period, from 60% in 1973 to 50% in 1999. Policies focusing on
   demand management (energy conservation), development of internal
   resources (North Sea oil) and diversification (revival of nuclear
   programmes,17 research into renewable energies, etc.) have borne

   long-term growth begins to revive, the overall energy dependence of the
   EU is likely to rise once again, reaching 70% within 20 to 30 years. In
   the case of oil, dependence could reach 90%, for gas 70%, and for coal
   100% dependence is feasible. Enlargement will only serve to reinforce
   this trend. Natural gas imports to the applicant countries may rise
   from 60% to 90% of demand, and oil from 90% to 94%. Meanwhile, those
   countries which are currently net exporters of coal may have to import
   12% of their needs by 2020, under the impact of drastic restructuring
   in this sector. 17 Installed nuclear generating capacity has supported
   the policy of reducing external dependence. From 45 GWe in 1980, it has
   grown to 125 GWe today in the EU. This progress is the result of
   investment decisions made in the wake of the oil crises of 1973 and
   1979. The aim was to replace oil-generated electricity with
   nuclear-generated, so as to reduce the reliance of pro-nuclear
   countries. The resulting savings can be estimated at 200 million toe
   for the year 2000, which is equivalent to a saving of ¼ billion for the
   EU's trade balance. 20 E U 3 0 : D e p e n d e n c e a c c o rd in g to

   will have different effects, according to the Member State concerned,
   and the structure of the international market for the type of energy in
   question. - The impact of instability in energy supply in Member States
   will be in direct proportion to their reliance on external resources.18
   The impact will be greater where the supplier nations are themselves
   vulnerable to geopolitical instability. - Price levels will also depend
   on the degree to which the imported commodity is traded
   internationally. Thus, 57% of oil consumed is traded internationally,
   as against only 20% of natural gas and 15% of coal. - The markets for
   different energy products are structured very differently from one
   another, which also has an effect on prices. For coal, one can talk of
   a competitive international market, for oil of a market dominated by a
   cartel19, and for natural gas markets of a unique situation which might
   be described as regional oligopolies forming functional cartels in
   which prices are effectively determined by the oil market. The most
   acute case of Community dependence is oil, where 76% of demand is met
   from external sources. In the long term, geographic diversification
   will not be as easily achieved as for natural gas, since the world's
   remaining oil reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle
   East.20 In the short term, there is little prospect of increasing
   supply in any significant way, as most oil-exporting countries have no
   spare production capacity. The sole exceptions to this rule are Saudi
   Arabia, Iraq and - to some extent - Russia. 18 Since domestic prices
   are in any case related to international prices, the degree of external
   dependence will not influence prices to the same extent. 19 Some
   economists argue that OPEC cannot be described as a 'cartel', since its
   function is not to fix prices, but to eliminate competition between
   oil-producing countries - a project it has pursued with varying degrees
   of success. 20 Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. 21 At
   present, the EU is moderately dependent on imported natural gas, which
   supplies 40% of consumption. To try and offset the likely increase in
   this dependence (to 70%) over the next 20 to 30 years, the Union has
   several options. There are a number of nearby producer-nations which
   have limited resources (Russia, Norway and North Africa, especially
   Algeria and Libya). It should be noted, moreover, that despite various
   difficulties the USSR and subsequently Russia always fulfilled its
   supply obligations under its long-term contracts with the European
   Union. Further afield, vast amounts of natural gas have been discovered
   in regions where both production and transport costs are now at
   economically viable levels, in particular, Russia (Western Siberia),
   the Caspian region (including Iran), the Near East and Nigeria. The
   Union currently imports more than 50% of the coal it uses. Although
   demand has been consistently decreasing in absolute terms, relative
   dependence on external sources will continue to rise for a number of
   years, to reach more than 70% in 2020. Some analysts even believe that
   the figure could reach 100%, given that Community coal production only
   survives thanks to huge public subsidies. The characteristics of the
   world coal market (geographical and geopolitical spread of supply and
   absence of price tensions) are reassuring in view of growing external
   dependence. In this respect one can speak of a stable economical and
   physical supply. Europe depends on external supplies of uranium for 95%
   of its requirements. However, the European nuclear industry controls
   the whole fuel cycle. The problem of managing waste remains. The
   EURATOM Supply Agency is responsible for ensuring, primarily by
   authorising contracts, that there is a wide range of supply sources and
   for preventing any excessive dependence. Moreover, Europe's nuclear
   operators also have stocks of fuel representing a few years of
   operation for working plants (uranium is easy to store and the costs
   are low). Adopting a policy of geopolitical diversification has not
   been able to free the Union from effective dependence on the Middle
   East (for oil) and Russia (for natural gas). Indeed, a number of Member
   States, and in particular the applicant countries, are entirely
   dependent on a single gas pipeline that links them to a single supplier
   country. 2. Trade in energy products: Europe constrained by its
   geographical location Europe's increasing dependence on external energy
   resources, and the ever-greater distance at which those resources are
   located, are set to increase the burden of both transport costs and
   transit requirements. The challenges posed by the transit problem have
   also been significantly complicated by the emergence of the New
   Independent States (NIS) out of the ruins of the Soviet Union. D 7UDGH
   LQ HQHUJ\ SURGXFWV Growth in energy product transportation is a
   sensitive matter, because of the health and environmental risks it
   poses: oil slicks, leaks from gas and oil pipelines, transport of
   radioactive substances and traffic congestion in a number of transit
   zones, such as the Bosphorus. Seaborne trade is vulnerable to such
   concerns. 90% of world trade in oil and coal, and one quarter of trade
   in natural gas (LNG), is carried by sea. Coal is the only energy
   product which has been removed from the International Maritime
   Organisation's (OMI) list of dangerous products. 800 million tonnes of
   oil and gas are transported through European waters every year, 70% of
   them off the Atlantic coast or through the North Sea and 30% through
   the Mediterranean. 22 The number of maritime accidents is directly
   linked to the age of the ships involved. Of the 77 oil tankers lost at
   sea between 1992 and 1999, 60 were more than 20 years old. The wreck of
   the oil tanker ERIKA in December 1999 revealed a number of serious
   flaws in the way oil is currently shipped. The Commission responded by
   adopting a Communication on the safety of the seaborne oil trade, and
   proposed a number of measures for increasing technical controls. Plans
   were also made to exclude from European waters single hull oil tankers,
   which pose the greatest risk of pollution in case of accident. The ban
   will be enacted in two stages (2010 and 2015), according to the tonnage
   of the vessels concerned. These measures will be followed up by new
   draft legislation prepared by the Commission to increase the
   supervision of ships carrying dangerous or polluting substances and to
   broaden the terms of responsibility for the principal parties involved
   in the seaborne oil trade (in particular, charter companies) in case of
   accidents leading to serious pollution. In this context, the
   construction of new oil terminals which might create environmental
   problems for neighbouring countries needs to be carefully examined. A
   case in point is Russia's project to build a new oil terminal at
   Primorsk in the Gulf of Finland, where the environmental impact on
   states bordering the Baltic Sea should be addressed. 23 *URVV LQWHUQDO

   supplies originating in Russia, the Caspian Sea Basin, North Africa and
   the Middle East, two regions deserve special attention, Eastern and
   Northern Europe on the one hand and the Mediterranean Basin on the
   other. - Russia plays an essential role, providing the Union with 42%
   of its natural gas needs. However, there is also considerable potential
   for oil and gas production in the countries of the Caspian Sea basin.
   As a producer, Russia is the world's leading natural gas exporter. It
   would also like to export more oil, and even electricity, to Europe,
   establishing new transport routes to this end. A range of transport
   routes will also be necessary if the resources of the Caspian Sea Basin
   are to be fully exploited. Particular attention should therefore be
   paid to transit states such as Turkey, the CEEC countries, Ukraine, the
   Baltic States and the Caucasian countries. - North Africa is also an
   important producer region for Europe (Algeria, Libya). In the light of
   their intention to join the Union, Europe should consider what support
   it could give to Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, to develop transit
   facilities for Caspian basin gas and oil,21 in addition to existing
   plans for transporting Russian supplies.22 The natural gas
   interconnection project linking Greece and Turkey opens up the
   potential for European access to new sources of natural gas, providing
   an alternative to seaborne trade. It could also provide an export route
   for Middle Eastern production. The northern, central and Mediterranean
   dimensions of energy policy assume primordial importance in this
   context. 3. The European Union  an actor on world markets Because the
   European Union relies on imported energy, it is dependent on supply and
   demand conditions in the international energy markets. This dependence
   is to some extent re-balanced by the weight of EU exports to countries
   which themselves export energy products. D 7KH 8QLRQ LV D PDMRU SOD\HU
   LQ WKH LQWHUQDWLRQDO PDUNHWV The Union accounts for 14 to 15% of world
   energy consumption, though it is home to only 6% of the world's
   population. In particular it represents 19% of world oil consumption,
   16% of natural gas, 10% of coal and 35% of uranium. The EU imported 16%
   of the natural gas traded on the international markets in 1999 (450
   billion m3), and a quarter of the coal (150 out of 500 Mtce) and oil
   (9.7 out of 40.4 million barrels a day). Enlargement will increase the
   EU's share of these markets yet further, except for coal. 21 The
   Caspian Sea Basin refers to the oil and gas reserves located in
   Southern Russia, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Iran. 22 A transit
   agreement was signed by the Applicant Countries and most of the

   LQIOXHQFH RYHU LQWHUQDWLRQDO SULFHV In the long term, it is the energy
   choices made by the developing countries - and in particular China,
   India23 and Latin America, whose populations and energy demands will
   see the strongest growth - which will have the most decisive and
   lasting influence on the international energy markets. According to
   demographic experts, by 2020 the world's population will have grown to
   8 billion - 2 billion more than in the year 2000. World energy demand
   according to current trends, could rise sharply, and the developing
   nations will account for 90% of that increase. Demand is forecast to
   rise by some 65% over 20 years, from 9.3 billion Toe in 2000 to 15.4
   billion Toe in 2020. This trend may have a substantial impact on
   international fossil fuel prices. However, this trend could be reduced
   by international efforts to promote renewable energy and energy
   efficiency, for example in the fight against climate change. To give an
   example, the number of cars in use world-wide is forecast to double by
   the year 2020. Most of this growth will come from the developing
   countries. In the OECD states, there are already around 6 cars for
   every 10 citizens, whereas in most of the rest of the world, the ratio
   is 2 cars for every 10 persons. Even if the shortfall in supply could
   be partly made up, the pressure on oil prices in the relatively short
   term is likely to be considerable. That is one reason why agreements
   with developing countries have to take the aspect of security of energy
   supply into account.24 Beyond overall market trends, instability in
   energy prices for products traded on the international markets (oil,
   natural gas, coal and uranium) may result from a number of other
   disruptive factors: deliberate actions by exporting countries (such as
   OPEC), geopolitical disputes or the effects of exchange rates. Sudden
   price shifts and the profound crises they can cause are connected to
   intense price volatility, recurring conflicts over prices, the ability
   of our economies to absorb price changes, and their capacity to bring
   pressure to bear on both the market in question and those for
   substitute energy products. While the EU economies are now better able
   to deal with price volatility, they are still unable to control all the
   relevant geopolitical and speculative factors, and have little power to
   determine the future direction of world markets. - On the geopolitical
   level, recent problems with the Middle East peace process, the embargo
   against Iraq and uncertainty over the situations in Iran and Libya have
   all influenced the actions of OPEC, without it being possible to say
   what exactly their effect has been. - On the financial level, the
   impact of speculative capital flows generated by the growing number of
   transactions in the futures markets can cause sudden price movements
   and is also 23 China and India combined consume some 1.115 billion Toe

   27 highly worrying. In such a context, as the Commission has already
   pointed out, strategic reserves may be able to play an anti-speculative
   role.25 Unfortunately, the EU lacks the means of negotiate and exert
   pressure. The Union suffers from having no competence and no community
   cohesion in energy matters. Apart from the powers established by the
   ECSC and EURATOM treaties, there is no explicit mandate for a European
   energy policy. As a result, over the last 40 years, Europe has failed
   to develop a consistent common energy policy (within both the EU and
   the International Energy Agency), as the OPEC countries have today, and
   as other producer groups may in the future. The lack of a real energy
   policy reduces the EU's bargaining power. In the face of powerful
   oil-exporting companies, European importers without co-ordination on a
   market where prices are largely fixed. The development of the single
   market should help to curb the influence of exporting countries, as
   liberalisation and increased trading encourage competition between
   exporting companies, particularly where natural gas is concerned. As
   long as the EU fails to develop means to reduce the influence of the
   international markets, this situation will remain the Achilles' heel of
   the European economy and its ability to influence dialogue at world
   level will remain limited. As a result, the Union will be unable to
   pull its weight in international political debate. As the current
   President of the European Union remarked at the European Council
   meeting in Biarritz, the recent increase in oil prices has alerted
   Member States to the need for a co-ordinated response in times of
   crisis. The EU has failed to establish instruments for co-ordinating
   energy policy along the lines of those it has developed in other areas
   (standards, intervention funds, mechanisms for decision- making and for
   negotiating international agreements, etc.). As a result, in so far as
   an EU energy policy can be said to exist, it can only be defined
   indirectly, by analysing other common policies, such as transport,
   environment or the single market. F $Q LQDGHTXDWH VWUDWHJ\ IRU
   SUHYHQWLRQ Energy security and - insofar as it might be possible -
   self-sufficiency have always lain at the heart of the Member States'
   energy policies. This goal was embodied in the ECSC and EURATOM
   treaties, and was intended to provide the cornerstone of European
   harmony as conceived by the Union's founding fathers. Following the
   first oil crisis, the Member States and the European Union sought to
   minimise their quantitative reliance on external energy sources. The
   result was a raft of measures intended to support domestic production
   that would otherwise be uncompetitive, a deliberate policy of
   stockpiling, and programmes to promote energy efficiency and
   technological development. However, these measures did not go far
   enough to reverse the underlying trend. The coal industry The truth of
   this statement is particularly obvious if we consider the coal mining
   industry. Social and regional considerations argued for mitigating the
   effects of an inevitable decline, rather than examining how the sector
   might make a positive contribution to energy security in the context of
   a well-ordered and efficient international market. Of course, whatever
   credibility such a contribution might once have had has since been
   largely eroded by the rise in European production costs. 25
   Communication from the Commission of 11.10.2000, The European Union's
   oil supply 28 Responding to oil crises World physical supply of oil can
   be disrupted at any moment by events in producer regions and transit
   zones, especially political instability and/or war. Emergency reserves
   and crisis measures, such as those set up by the International Energy
   Agency (IEA) and by Community legislation, provide a partial response
   to this threat. Existing measures should not only be maintained, but
   might be strengthened further. The key decisions regarding strategic
   reserves were taken in 1974 through the Agreement concerning an
   International Energy Programme, the act founding the International
   Energy Agency (IEA). This move came in the wake of the oil embargo
   imposed on a number of industrialised nations by OPEC as a consequence
   of the political climate in late 1973. One of the IEA Member States'
   principal commitments is to maintain reserves of oil and/or petroleum
   products at a level equivalent to 90 days of QHW LPSRUWV, for use in
   case supply should be cut. Most Member States actually maintain their
   strategic reserves at a somewhat higher level. The Union has issued
   three Directives which, together with measures taken by the IEA, govern
   the organisation of Member States' national reserves : - Two
   directives26 impose an obligation on Member States to maintain stocks
   equal to 90 days' FRQVXPSWLRQ for each of three main categories of
   petroleum-based energy products. When reserves fall below this level,
   the Commission must organise consultation with the Member States.27 -
   Under another directive28 Member States must be ready to act, i.e. they
   must establish contingency plans, together with appropriate bodies and
   mandates, in particular for releasing reserves onto the market,
   limiting consumption, ensuring supply to priority customers and
   regulating prices. The same Directive stipulates that should a crisis
   break out, the Commission must organise consultation with the Member
   States to ensure their actions are co-ordinated through an Oil Supply
   Group. The Commission must also ensure that the different national
   systems do not give rise to distortions of competition or obstacles to
   intra- Community trade. These mechanisms are in no way intended to deal
   with circumstances such as the present rise in the price of oil. As a
   result, Community legislation on strategic reserves can have only a
   limited impact on concerns about energy supply. The impact of the
   United States' decision to release 30 million barrels from its crude
   oil reserves in September 2000 only serves to illustrate the fact that
   the mechanisms which exist at the international level to deal with
   crises are severely limited - especially since such crises often have
   more to do with market economics than with physical disruption of
   supply. No one denies the importance of co-ordination between those
   countries which are net consumers of oil. However, the experience of
   negotiations within the IEA demonstrates that effective co- ordination
   and co-operation are extremely difficult to achieve in practice. During
   the Gulf 26 'LUHFWLYH ((& DPHQGHG E\ 'LUHFWLYH (& 27 It should be noted
   that presently several Member States have more than 90 days of stocks.
   This excess can therefore be `released' without triggering Community
   consultation. 28 Directive 73/238/EEC. 29 War, as again today, it has
   been left to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)29 to spearhead
   pro-active intervention in the oil markets. The Community's own
   mechanisms are quite inadequate in view of tensions on the market for
   energy products. For instance, there is no centralised decision-making
   mechanism through which oil could be released onto the market. If oil
   prices were to rise to unreasonable levels, the EU would find it had
   little power to act. In order to reduce the risk of a crisis as a
   result of their dependence on external energy, a number of Member
   States have set up independent inventories or strategic reserves for
   certain energy products. Thus the Netherlands has implemented a policy
   of responsible use of small-scale natural gas reserves, so as to leave
   open the possibility of drawing more heavily on the Groningen reserve
   (estimated at 1 100 m3) as and when necessary.30 In its recent
   Communication on the EU's oil supplies, the Commission declared that it
   intended to look into how it might be possible to increase the
   quantities held in strategic petroleum reserves by reorganising them on
   a Community basis. &RQFOXVLRQ Given the external risk factors present
   (whether related to volumes, prices, investment levels, geopolitical
   factors, etc.), the best guarantee of security of energy supply is
   clearly to maintain a diversity of energy sources and supplies. Present
   forecasts suggest that it will be impossible to arrest the Union's
   growing quantitative dependence. Enlargement will only serve to reduce
   diversity of external supplies. At the same time, the strong fall in
   the price of oil products at the beginning of the 1980's and the
   lacklustre efforts to promote energy savings and renewable energy have
   meant that the Union dependence has remained at high level. Between
   1975 and 1985, the improvement in energy efficiency was 24%, whereas it
   was 10% between 1985 and 1999. This underlines the importance of acting
   on the demand side and assuring a secure energy supply at the Community
   level. ,, /(66 7+$1 3(5)(&7 (1(5*< 237,216 As 2010 approaches, numerous
   Member States, as well as the applicant countries. will have to make
   choices regarding energy investment, primarily in the electricity
   sector. Current channels determine the choice of investment, unless
   there is a major technological breakthrough that changes the energy
   landscape. These changes might centre on decentralised production of
   electricity through mini gas turbines or fuel cells. These options are
   fundamental because over the next 30 to 50 years they will dictate the
   structure of energy consumption. They therefore have to be carefully
   thought through. 29 The United States established the Strategic
   Petroleum Reserve in 1975, after joining the IEA, and two years after
   the first oil crisis. American law lays down that there should be a
   strategic reserve equal to 1 billion barrels of oil, for use in case of
   war or other serious conflict leading to the physical disruption of
   supply. Presently, there are 571 million barrels in the SPR,
   representing an investment of USD 20 billion at today's prices. The SPR
   is located in the Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana and Texas), a region which
   has more than 500 salt caves, thus providing ideal storage conditions.
   The reserve was drawn on in 1991 during the Gulf War, and again a
   second time a few weeks ago, when 30 million barrels were released
   barely equivalent to two days' demand. 30 This policy is combined with
   measures to encourage the exploration of North Sea resources. 30 At the
   end of the 1970s, coal and nuclear energy were thought to be the only
   alternative to oil. The countries participating in the G7 Summit in
   Tokyo (May 1979) undertook to encourage energy saving and the
   production of coal and nuclear energy. Similarly, the Council
   resolution of 1980 set the objective of FRYHULQJ WR RI SULPDU\ HQHUJ\
