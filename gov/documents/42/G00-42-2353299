   There are three fixes in this update

     1) The number of points in a time history has been increased. This
     is to allow editing of the examples, which default to 21 intervals.

     2) Fix a printout error: the size of the fire was reported
     incorrectly in some cases. The calculation was done correctly, but
     the output from Report and ReportSS was incorrect. The problem
     occurs if there are two fires in a compartment, with one of them in
     the upper layer, and one in the lower layer. Once again, the report
     was incorrect, but the value used in subsequent calculations was
     correct.

     3) The workspace for the solver was not dimensioned correctly, so
     CFAST could not do 30 compartments. This has been fixed.

   This update applies to version 3.1.6 of CFAST/FAST which is on the
   distribution disk, dated: November 1, 1999.
