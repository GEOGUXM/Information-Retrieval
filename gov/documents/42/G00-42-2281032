Cleaning Up Meth Labs and Dumps

   Winner of the August 2001 Governors Award for Service and Quality
   Improvement

The Situation

   Communities around the state are at risk from the indiscriminate
   production and dumping of methamphetamine lab waste. When common
   household chemicals are combined to make the illegal drug, toxic gases
   and solutions are created.

   Until 1997, Ecology called in a contractor to clean up meth sites while
   our staff remained on location to oversee their work.

The Innovation

   Beginning in 1997, Ecologys regional spill response teams and
   after-hours responders received training and equipment to clean up meth
   lab wastes and chemicals at the request of law enforcement officials.
   Through hard work and innovation, spill response teams were able to
   respond to more than four times as many meth labs this year compared to
   1997.

Results

     * Through significantly reducing reliance on contractors and
       increasing Ecologys capacity to respond to meth lab clean ups,
       Ecology saved $126,000 in 1997 which was redirected to training and
       emergency response equipment. In 2000, Ecology avoided spending
       $1.9 million in contractor costs.
     * Response time to clean up sites was reduced by having trained
       Ecology teams respond directly to an incident rather than calling
       in contractors for response. In addition, the National Guard has
       been trained to help clean up sites.
     * In some communities, local law enforcement officers have been
       trained to clean up small, simpler sites. The chemicals are
       securely stored for Ecology response teams to pick up and dispose
       of in batches. This saves time and allows Ecology to respond more
       quickly to the larger, complex sites.

Alerting Citizens to Current Air Quality Conditions

   Polluted air can cause or worsen lung-related diseases, such as
   emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma. For citizens suffering from
   such diseases, it is extremely important to know the current day's air
   quality. Ecology monitors air quality on an hourly basis in several
   communities and locations throughout the state. Timely access to this
   information helps citizens plan their outside activities on days when
   the air quality is not good.

   The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency partnered with Ecology, the University
   of Washington, Washington State University and the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency to publish current air quality conditions in a very
   easy to understand format on the Internet. This information is also
   available for use by local television and radio stations in their
   weather reporting.

Results

     * Immediate Internet access to current, local air quality information
       is available to citizens who depend on that information for health
       reasons (the coverage area is from Everett to Tacoma and Bremerton
       to Bellevue).
     * Scientists, meteorologists and communications experts from local
       government, state government, federal government and the academia
       have worked together to translate complex air quality monitoring
       data into vital information for citizens.
     * Duplicative and possible inconsistent reporting is reduced through
       this partnership.

Searchable Clearinghouse of Exceptional Environmental Education Products

   Literally dozens of organizations and governmental agencies produce
   CDs, Web sites, booklets, pamphlets, brochures, videos, guidance
   documents, and entire campaigns and programs encouraging people to
   protect our water quality in rivers, streams, lakes, the Sound and
   groundwater. Finding the right information for a specific need or
   audience can be frustrating and difficult.

   Ecology staff created the Showcase of Exceptional Education Products
   designed to help citizens quickly find information about protecting
   water quality. This tool, primarily for Northwest environmental
   educators, lists exceptional products related to nonpoint water
   pollution (septic tanks, hobby farms, households, landscaping, living
   near water, etc). The products are targeted to audiences such as
   homeowners, specific industries, and K-12 educators.

Results

     * Over 115 products have been reviewed and rated. Only those
       receiving an "Outstanding" rating have been included on the
       Internet site.
     * Currently, 80 products are listed on the Internet site.
     * Information for each product includes; when it was produced, who
       produced it, a description, the intended audience and how to obtain
       the product. The rating for each product (execution, effectiveness,
       relevance and adaptability) is also included.
     * The site has been designed for easy searching for categories of
       interest. This will enable others to model their educational
       materials after products already developed.
     * New products can be nominated for addition to the site.
