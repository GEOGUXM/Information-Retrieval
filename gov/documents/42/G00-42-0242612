       More Info
       The bill was signed into law on January 10, 2002. It does not
       provide funding for advance procurement for modifications to GPS
       satellites.
       The Senate version of the bill passed on December 7. The Senate
       Appropriations Committee approved the $23,760,000 Air Force request
       for advance procurement for modifications to GPS satellites and
       approved the requested level for Global Positioning (Space) at
       $177,719,000.
       The House version of the bill passed on November 28, following
       subcommittee and committee markups on October 10 and November 19.
       The House Appropriations Committee denied the $23,760,000 Air Force
       request for advance procurement for modifications to GPS
       satellites, stating that "the use of advance procurement authority
       is a special exception to the full funding policy reserved almost
       exclusively for procurement of new production items" and is not
       usually used for modifications. The Committee also was dismayed
       that many of the parts appear to be budgeted ahead of need, and
       although they would be delivered within fiscal 2002, they would be
       unused until needed by a modification that is not funded until
       fiscal 2003. The Committee recommended deferring the purchase of
       those parts until fiscal 2003. The Committee reduced the
       $177,719,000 request for Global Positioning (Space) by $25 million
       to $152,719,000. The Committee also recommended $66,358,000 for
       NAVSTAR GPS III, which is $12 million less than the $78,358,000
       request.
     * Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, FY 2002 (P.L.
       107-87)

       More Info
       The bill was signed into law on December 18, 2001.
       The Senate approved the conference report on December 4. It passed
       the House on November 30. The conference agreement provides $6
       million for NDGPS in the Federal Highway Administration account.
       The House had attempted to zero out the program but the Senate
       restored the funds. Previously, NDGPS was funded through FAA.
       The conference agreement includes $43,109,700 for LAAS, $9,000,000
       above the request. The conferees encourage FAA to consider
       installing LAAS at Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport once
       systems are ready for production and "continue to view the LAAS
       procurement as an opportunity for FAA to expedite the cost
       advantageous procurement of precision approach capability through
       an aggressive public-private cooperative acquisition strategy." The
       report sets the following milestones for LAAS in FY02: 1) CAT-I
       contract award by Q4; 2) CAT-II/III integrity and continuity
       allocations between avionics and ground equipment determined; 3)
       finalization of the concept of operations required for FY03
       development of airport procedures; 4) integration of LAAS
       capabilities into a certifiable avionics receiver; and 5)
       development of a data collection plan and initiation of flight
       evaluations for development of complex LAAS approaches. FAA is
       directed to report quarterly to the appropriations committees on
       its progress.
       The conference committee fully funded WAAS at $80,900,000.
       $5,000,000 is provided for initial funds for geostationary
       satellite services. The conferees cite continuing concerns about
       WAAS schedule delays and certification problems. The conferees
       believe the solution to WAAS certification may lie, in part, from
       the use of positioning data from other navigational or
       communication capabilities. The conference report urges FAA to
       assess the possible role of emerging communications, navigation and
       surveillance capabilities to help move WAAS along.
