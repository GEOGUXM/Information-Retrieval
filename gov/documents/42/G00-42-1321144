   Augmented Learning Environment and Renewable Teaching (ALERT) is a
   program targeted to California State University professors who teach
   Earth Science to pre-service and in-service teachers. These professors
   spend two consecutive summers at NASA Ames Research Center or at the
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena where they work with NASA
   researchers on NASA projects. These professors then transfer the
   techniques that they learn to future and current K-12 teachers through
   the University courses that they offer. Contact: Elizabeth Ambos;
   Edward Ng or Jay Skiles
   Education Associates Program (EdAP) provides work study opportunities
   for university students (enrolled in BS, MS, Ph.D.), post docs and
   faculty from any accredited 4 year university in the US. Sponsors at
   Ames who have funds to pay for work study can also visit this site to
   find information on hiring students and faculty. These sponsors can be
   either civil servants or contractors, and can pay with a NASA JO or
   with a direct purchase order from a contractor. Contact: Donna
