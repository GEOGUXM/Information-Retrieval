       California Cooperative Occupational Information System (CCOIS)

                        Occupational Outlook Reports

     These reports are prepared by the CCOIS Local Partners and the
   Employment Development Departments' Labor Market Information Division.
   They contain summarized local information on various occupations. This
   information includes wages, employer benefits, skills, education,
   training and experience requirements, worker supplu and demand
   assessment, advancement potential, occupational projections, employment
   trends and recruitment.

     Occupational Outlook Reports are provided as Portable Document Format
   (PDF) files which require the Adobe Acrobat Reader software. If you do
   not already have a copy of the Reader, you can download a free copy
   from Adobe. Reports are available for most parts of the state and are
   being added as they are developed.

     Once you select a area's Report one of several things may happen,
   depending upon how you have configured your browser's Preferences
   (Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer). If it is configured to view
   the file, the Acrobat Reader will open the Report on screen. If you
   have configured your browser to download the file to disk, the file
   will be saved to your disk for later viewing.
