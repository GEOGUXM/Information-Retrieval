  About the Gateway Return to Top of Page

   Together with our many partner organizations, the Department works on a
   broad array of health and human services. This Gateway for Partner
   Organizations provides an easily navigable roadmap to HHS resources on
   the Web and points of contact off the Web that are of special interest
   to our partners. As such, the Gateway may not offer a comprehensive
   search of all the services and resources offered by the U.S. Department
   of Health and Human Services.

   For more information about your Federal Government, visit the US
   NonProfit Gateway, which offers links to many similar sites at other
   Federal agencies, or the Interactive Citizens' Handbook at the White
   House.
