   is JPL's major cus- tomer, "but our direct customer is the general

   inner-city employees' volunteer efforts. Tom Nolan of the Mission
   Systems Engineering Section, who visited Gratts Elementary School in
   Los Angeles, said kids he most enjoyed the challenge and level of
   interest brought to the kids, to where "they want to discuss it at the
