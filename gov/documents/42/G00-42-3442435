         About the Alaska Science Center - Biological Science Office

   The Alaska Science Center 4/7/00

   Our Mission: Provide biological information and research findings to
                resource managers, policymakers, and the public to support sound
                management of biological resources and ecosystems in Alaska.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Alaska Science Center - Biological Science Office, part of the
   Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, plays a
   pivotal role in conducting research on wildlife and their vast habitats
   in Alaska. Alaskas Federal public lands represent an overwhelming
   landscape (equivalent in size to all of the Eastern seaboard from Maine
   through Florida). Nearly 88% of all National Wildlife Refuges and 65%
   of all National Park lands are in Alaska. As the lead biological
   science agency for the Department of the Interior (DOI) in Alaska, the
   Alaska Science Center - Biological Science Office is responsible for
   research trust lands and waters (including those of the National Park
   Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and
   Minerals Management Service) and DOI trust species (including migratory
   birds, marine mammals, and anadromous fish) in Alaska, providing
   scientific information essential for resource management decisions.

   History
   The Alaska Science Center - Biological Science Office is one of 15
   research centers in the nation that conducts and coordinates research
   for the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey.
   The Center was established in 1986 after staff previously with the
   Alaska Office of Fish and Wildlife Research in the U. S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service united with Service employees from two other research
   centers who were stationed in Alaska. When the National Biological
   Service was formed in November, 1993, the Center ,along with scientists
   from the National Park Service, was moved to this newly created agency.
   In January, 1996, Congress passed legislation to merge the National
   Biological Service with the U.S. Geological Survey, thereby
   consolidating biological and physical scientific research in the
   Department of the Interior. On October 1, 1996 the merger was completed
   with the former National Biological Service becoming the Biological
   Resources Division within the U.S. Geological Survey.

   Research Program
   Research in Alaska addresses important resource issues identified by
   Department of the Interior bureaus. Field--rather than
   laboratory--projects dominate Center activities; however, ongoing
   laboratory studies use DNA analysis for genetic stock identification of
   Pacific salmon, migratory bird, and marine mammal populations. These
   genetic analyses are useful to biologists seeking to understand the
   population structure of native species. Fieldwork in Alaska often takes
   biologists to remote areas for prolonged periods. These biologists use
   floatplanes and helicopters for access to tent camps, and use radios to
   communicate with the Center and their families. Harsh environmental
   conditions and the extreme seasons of the Arctic often restrict the
   methods and timing of research projects. Different languages and
   customs of Native groups throughout the state also influence when,
   where, and how research is conducted. Projects often involve
   cooperative efforts with Native peoples to study fish and wildlife
   resources.

   Research programs investigate:
     * the role of arctic and subarctic environments in maintaining wild
       stocks of nationally important marine and anadromous fish species
     * the ecology of marine mammals and their role and effect as top end
       consumers in arctic and subarctic marine environments
     * the role of arctic and subarctic environments in maintaining
       nationally important migratory bird populations
     * the ecology of terrestrial mammals and the role of top herbivores
       and carnivores in impacting the dynamics of arctic and subarctic
       terrestrial systems

   Current Issues & Problems
     * Impacts of petroleum exploration, development, and pollution on
       terrestrial and marine mammals, migratory birds, anadromous fishes,
       and marine invertebrates
     * Sport and subsistence harvests of declining populations of arctic
       nesting waterfowl
     * Subsistence harvest of polar bear, Pacific walrus, and sea otters
     * Declining populations of marine mammals and migratory birds and
       unknown trends of prey species in the Bering-Chukchi Sea Ecosystem
     * Management of wolves and brown bears and their prey in and around
       Denali National Park and Preserve
     * Declining populations of caribou in Wrangell/St. Elias National
       Park related to subsistence and sport harvest
     * Impacts of hatchery enhancement on wild stocks of Pacific salmon
       and their exploitation by commercial, subsistence, and sport
       fishing interests
     * Effects of commercial Dungeness crab and Pacific halibut fishing on
       Glacier Bay National Park marine ecosystem

   Emerging Issues and Problems
     * Increased impacts of recreational activities on DOI trust species
       in National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks
     * Anticipated natural resource management problems associated with
       change in land status resulting from the mandates of the Alaska
       National Interest Lands Conservation Act and negotiated exchanges
       between the DOI and Regional Native Corporations
     * Potential impacts on industrial pollutants in the Beaufort, Bering,
       and Chukchi seas on DOI trust species
     * Increased responsibility of Federal Subsistence management in
       Alaska
     * Anticipated amendment of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow for
       a regulated spring subsistence harvest of migratory birds in Alaska
       and Canada
     * Renewed government interest in petroleum exploration and
       development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
     * International conflicts in management of Pacific salmon stocks
     * Illegal harvest of shared marine mammal resources in Russia and
       sport harvest of polar bear populations shared with Canada
     * Tour boat and visitation impacts on coastal waters of Alaska
       national parks and preserves
