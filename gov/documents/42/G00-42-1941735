   Principles of Oncology for Cancer Registry Professionals

   July 23-27, 2001
   December 3-7, 2001
   Bolger Center for Leadership Development
   Potomac, Maryland
   Registration fee: $650.00*

   Principles of Oncology is an intensive five-day training program in
   cancer registry operations and procedures emphasizing accurate data
   collection. The training program includes extensive site-specific,
   hands-on case abstracting and coding sessions using both full medical
   records and abstracts that demonstrate the many situations registrars
   may face. This program is endorsed by the National Cancer Registrars
   Association (NCRA) and the North American Association of Central Cancer
   Registries (NAACCR). NAACCR also serves as the fiscal agent for this
   program.

   The program provides approximately 35 hours of classroom and
   individualized instruction on basic registry concepts, such as
   abstracting, staging (summary, TNM and EOD), and ICD-O coding, as well
   as use of resources available to registrars. Attendees will have the
   benefit of lectures as well as a variety of practical exercises. Three
   volumes of training materials prepared especially for this program will
   be provided to registrants, as well as NCRA's Workbook for Staging of
   Cancer, second edition.

   Who Should Attend:
   This program is suitable for oncology program employees (hospital-based
   and central registry) with minimal knowledge of cancer, anatomy,
   physiology, and medical terminology. Cancer registrars with less than
   one year of experience would benefit most from this program, however
   registrars with up to three years experience and registrars preparing
   for the certification examination are welcome to attend. Class size
   will be limited to 25 registrants.

   For additional questions about the training program schedule,
   facilities, and registration fees, please contact April Fritz, RHIT,
   CTR, training program coordinator, by email april.fritz@nih.gov or by
