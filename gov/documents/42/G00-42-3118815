Fill Out Your FAFSA

   You may use this online application to complete and submit the Free
   Application for Federal Student Aid on the Web (FAFSA). You may
   complete and transmit this online form electronically.

   In order to be eligible to receive student financial aid, an applicant
   needs to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid every
   school year.

   First Time Applicants
     * If this is the first time you have ever applied for federal student
       aid, select 'FAFSA' or 'Spanish FAFSA' to begin the application
       process
     * First time applicants will receive a PIN by mail from the U.S.
       Department of Education once their application is processed. The
       PIN can then be used to fill out a 'Renewal FAFSA' application for
       next school year.

   Returning FAFSA Applicants
     * If you are a returning applicant and have a PIN, you can use it to
       access your 'Renewal FAFSA' application by selecting "Fill Out a
       Renewal FAFSA" from the left navigation bar.
     * A PIN is not required to fill out and submit a regular FAFSA on the
       Web application, just select 'FAFSA' or 'Spanish FAFSA' to begin
       the application process.

   If you are applying for a summer session you should check with your
   school to verify which form they need you to complete.
