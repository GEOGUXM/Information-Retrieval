   General description of the project site area:

   The proposed
   project would be located on land currently owned by Mercer Ranches,
   Inc. Consisting of approximately 10,000 acres of land; Mercer Ranches
   produces carrots, sweet corn, potatoes and garlic. In addition, the
   ranch produces significant amounts of wine grapes primarily on the
   slopes of hills that are not suitable for large irrigation circles.
   Cogentrix has an agreement with Mercer Ranches for acquisition of
   approximately 40 acres for the Mercer Ranch Power Project.

   The proposed project site is situated in the midst of large
   agricultural operations on all sides. The project site is located
   approximately 2 miles north of the Columbia River and Crow Butte State
   Park. The towns nearest the project site are Paterson (unincorporated)
   with about 150 residents approximately 11 miles east of the site, and
   Roosevelt (unincorporated) with about 100 residents located
   approximately 18 miles west of the project site. The Benton County
   seat, Prosser, is located approximately 35 miles north of the project
   site. The eastern boundary of the Columbia River Scenic Gorge area is
   located approximately 60 miles to the west.

   Significant features of the proposed facility:

   Generation technology: 3 natural gas-fueled combustion turbines in
   combined cycle configuration with steam turbines and heat recovery
   steam generators. Estimated total capacity would be 850 MW including
   duct-firing capacity.

   Cooling technology: This project will utilize air cooling.

   Emission control technology: The generation plant would use low-NOx
   burners and catalysts for control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Carbon
   Monoxide (CO) emissions to meet or exceed all requirements of
   applicable environmental standards.

   Natural gas supply: Northwest Pipeline crosses the site.
   Interconnection would occur on the project site.

   Electric grid interconnection: A twin 500 kV power line owned by the
   BPA crosses the site. Interconnection would
   occur on the project site.
