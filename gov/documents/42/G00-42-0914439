                   NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)

   J. M. Rowe, Director, Tel. 301-975-6210, e-mail mike.rowe@nist.gov

   The NIST Center for Neutron Research is part of the Materials Science
   and Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology.
   The mission of the center is threefold:
    1. To operate the NCNR safely as a cost-effective national resource.
    2. To conduct a broad program of research using neutron techniques,
       and to develop and apply new neutron measurement techniques.
    3. To operate the NIST Center for Neutron Research as a national
       resource for researchers from industry, university and other
       government agencies.

   The center is comprised of a center office, and three groups whose
   organization reflects this mission:
     * The Operations and Engineering Group,
       headed by Seymour Weiss,
     * The Neutron Condensed Matter Science Group,
       headed by John. J. Rush
     * The Research Facilities Operations Group,
       headed by Patrick Gallagher.

   The permanent staff of the center numbers approximately 90, divided
   almost equally among the three groups.
