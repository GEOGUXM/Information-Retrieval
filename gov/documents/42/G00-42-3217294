                blue ball ATTENTION: Current LandView Status

   LandView 5 will contain the most up-to-date EPA and USGS data,
       computerized street maps based on TIGER/Line® 2000 files and Census
       2000 demographic data from Summary File 1 (SF1). Socio-economic
       data like education, occupation, income and poverty will be
       released in Summary File 3 during the summer of 2002. The Census
       Bureau expects to announce the Census 2000 Urban/Rural delineations
       during the 2nd quarter of 2002. At that time, we plan to issue a
       new version of LandView containing those data.
       Users of previous versions of LandView should note that LandView 5
       will be limited to the information contained in Census 2000 SF1.
       This file includes statistical data on the following population
       items: sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household
       relationship, and household and family characteristics. Housing
       items include occupancy status and tenure (whether the unit is
       owner- or renter-occupied). Sample of LandView 5 data.
       In response to the September 11th terrorist attack, EPA is
       currently reviewing the content of the facility and chemical data.
       When that review is completed, we will make any appropriate
       adjustments and then release a LandView 5 demonstration program for
       New Castle County, Delaware.
       After we post the demonstration program, we will begin creating the
       LandView 5 files on a state-by-state basis. As they pass review,
       they will be released to our Customer Services Center for
       fulfillment of orders via the Custom CD-ROM service. We cannot
       provide an advance timetable or estimate of when any single state
       will be available. After all states, the District of Columbia and
       Puerto Rico have been released, we will then master the DVDs
       containing national data.
