   The GSA FTS Awards Program was initiated in 1993 by the Interagency
   Management Council (IMC) to recognize those individuals and groups who,
   in their use of FTS services (including regional/local
   telecommunications services), have improved the quality and/or cost
   effectiveness of telecommunication services for their agency or the FTS
   program.

   All nominations should be coordinated with your agency's Incentive
   Awards Administrator before submission.
