                               Swiss-PdbViewer

                                  Tutorial

   These examples presuppose that you know the basic manipulation of the
   program; i.e. that you have already read the user guide and completed
   the Basic Tutorial prepared by Prof. Gale Rhodes (cf. below). If you
   are interested, you are also invited to join the "Deep View Discussion
   List" moderated by Gale Rhodes.

   The best way to learn is by practising. Therefore, I have provided some
   practical examples that you should read, not only because I have spent
   so much time making them, but because they illustrate many operations
   that you will probably have to use during your research.

   You will need some PDB files to complete the tutorial. You can download
   them all (except some electron density maps that are available from
   their specific tutorial) in one operation:

     * (.hqx) for Mac (512Kb) or
     * (.zip) for PC (330Kb)

   If you wish to learn the basic manipulation of Swiss-PdbViewer through
   a tutorial, I recommend that you have a look at the one prepared by
   Prof. Gale Rhodes from the University of Southern Maine Portland. This
   tutorial has been prepared specifically for students and gives a lot of
   useful information not only on Swiss-PdbViewer manipulation, but also
   on general protein structure. As Prof. Gale Rhodes has spent a lot of
   time playing with the program, some interesting tips and details
   missing from my main documentation are unveiled.
