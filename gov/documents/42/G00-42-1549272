            NIH CPS NUMERIC RATINGS AND CRITERIA â€“ 1996 TO DATE

   0=Unsatisfactory                 1=Poor
   2=Fair                     3=Good                  4=Excellent
    5=Outstanding

   Quality of Product or Service:

   0         - Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of
   contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources.  Recovery is
   not likely. If not substantially corrected, such performance should
   constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards
   containing similar requirements.

   1         -  Overall compliance requires major Agency resources to
   ensure achievement of contract requirements.

   2         -  Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to
   ensure achievement of contract requirements.

   3         -  There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the
   Contractor has met the contract requirements.

   4         -  There are no quality problems, and the Contractor has
   substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without
   commensurate additional costs to the Government.

   5         -  The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance
   level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and
   is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a
   point to the score.  It is expected that this rating will be used in
   those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds
   the performance levels described as "Excellent".


   Cost Control:

   0  - Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of
   contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources.  Recovery is
   not likely.  If not substantially corrected, this level of ability to
   manage cost issues should constitute a significant impediment in
   considerations for future awards.

   1         -   Ability to manage cost issues requires major Agency
   resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

   2         -  Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency
   resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

   3         -  There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and
   the Contractor has met the contract requirements.

   4         -  There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has
   exceeded the contract requirements, achieving unanticipated cost
   savings to the Government.

   5         -  The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance
   level that justifies adding a point to the score.  It is expected that
   this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor
   performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as
   "Excellent".


   Timeliness of Performance:

   0  - Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements,
   despite use of Agency resources.  Recovery is not likely.  If not
   substantially corrected, such timeliness should constitute a
   significant impediment in considerations for future awards containing
   similar time schedule requirements.

   1  - Delays require major Agency resources to ensure achievement of
   contract requirements.

   2  - Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of
   contract requirements.

   3  -  There are no, or minimal, delays that do not impact achievement
   of contract requirements.

   4  -  There are no delays and the contractor has significantly exceeded
   the agreed upon time schedule.

   5  -  The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level
   that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this
   rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor
   performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as
   "Excellent".


   Business Relations:


   0         -  Response to inquiries, technical/service/administrative
   issues is not effective.  If not substantially mitigated or corrected
   it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for
   future awards.

   1         -  Response to inquiries, technical/service/administrative
   issues is marginally effective.

   2         -  Response to inquiries, technical/service/administrative
   issues is somewhat effective.

   3         -  Response to inquiries, technical/service/administrative
   issues is consistently effective.

   4         -  Response to inquiries, technical/service/administrative
   issues is significantly above the effective level.

   5         -  The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance
   level that justifies adding a point to the score.  It is expected that
   this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor
   performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as
   "Excellent".


   Meeting SDB Subcontracting Requirements:


   0  -  Performance was definitely unacceptable with respect to the
   objectives for SDB participation in the award.  If not substantially
   mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in
   considerations for future awards containing similar requirements/goals.

   1  -  Performance was significantly less than what is expected of the
   contractor, jeopardizing the objectives for SDB participation in the
   award.  The need for remedial attention was indicated.

   2         -  Performance was somewhat less than anticipated achievement
   to date, but not so much as to jeopardize the ultimate achievement of
   the objectives for SDB participation in the award.  Some deficiencies
   in meeting reporting requirements have required corrective actions.

   3         -  Performance was fully in line with expectations for the
   SDB criterion.  No, or minimal, minor deficiencies in reporting
   requirements have been experienced.

   4         -  Performance was substantially above anticipated
   achievement levels.  Reporting requirements were fully achieved.

   5         -  Performance was significantly in excess of anticipated
   achievement levels and is commendable as an example for others.  It is
   expected that that this rating will be used in rare circumstances where
   the contractor performance exceeds the performance level of
   "excellent".
