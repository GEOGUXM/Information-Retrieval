   [badminton1-1.gif] Welcome to Badminton Club at Brookhaven National
   Lab(BNL), Upton, Long Island, New York. This club opens to BNL
   employees and guests only. Players can compete in either a
   challenge-format singles ladder or a season-long doubles tournament.
   The 1998-99 Ladder play will begin Monday, October 5, 1998, and end
   Friday, April 2, 1999. Updated club rosters have been placed on the
   badminton bulletin board in the gym. Please take one so you have
   up-to-date phone numbers. Format and court sign-up is same as last
   year, so I won't bother sending out an announcement. If you want more
   information, call myself or Jay Adams. Ladder standings will be updated
   weekly, both here and on the gym bulletin board.

   Ali Lopez is managing our web page, so any additions or corrections,
   please forward to her. There is a $1.00 membership fee. If there is
   sufficient interest, we will have a party or tournament sometime during
   the year, so let us know. Jay Adams has birds. They are yellow and cost
   $7.50/half dozen. He's in Bldg. 830, Room 7M.

   One schedule note to keep in mind if you are in the process of
   arranging a weekly singles or doubles match: soccer players take over
   the gym at noon on Tuesdays, November through March. Hence, the 12:00
   and 1:00 time slots will be unavailable on Tuesdays come bad weather.

Club Rules Rules

     The general USBA rules for tournament play should be followed. They
     are posted on the badminton bulletin board at the northwest entrance
     to the gym.

Singles Ladder

     Each singles match is scheduled as the result of a challenge. Any
     player may challenge another on the same level of the ladder or on
     the next level above. The weekly standings posted on Monday will
     determine the legitimacy of challenges made that week, whatever the
     standings may be when the match is actually played. If an entrant
     has not already accepted a challenge during a given week he must
     accept the challenge or forfeit the match. No player is required to
     accept more than one challenge per week. Any singles player except
     the player in position 1 will recede one position on the ladder when
     he fails to compete for two successive weeks. A victorious
     challenger will take the position of the defeated player who will
     drop back one position. It is the winner's responsibility to record
     the results of the match and the date on the pad provided.

   Doubles Tournament

     A match will consist of three games played by any four registered
     doubles players in a round-robin fashion, each player playing one
     game as the partner of each of the other players. In order for the
     match to count it must be recorded, with the date, on the forms
     provided. Scoring is based on wins and weeks of participation. See
     Bill Love or Jack Detweiler for the scoring system.

   Court Use

     Two courts are available in the west side of the gym between 11 and
     2 weekdays, and Saturday mornings between 9 and 12. Courts may be
     reserved on the calendar in the gym no more than one week in
     advance. Please limit sign-up to one noon hour and no more than two
     week-day hours per player per week. Doubles play has priority for
     the noon hour. Saturday matches must be scheduled in advance to
     avoid interference with other activities in the gym.
