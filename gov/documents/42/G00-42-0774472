   parents home in Idaho, August, 2000 (photo by Bill Barnes) Gated X-ray
   framing camera images of plasma compressible turbulent mix in direct
   drive cylindrical implosions with low-Atwood number chlorinated marker
   layer (left) and high-Atwood number gold marker layer (right).

   Energetics at the University of Rochester.

   Cris W. Barnes is a ``Senior Research Physicist'' and Staff Member in
   the Plasma Physics group of the Physics Division of Los Alamos National
   Laboratory. He leads experimental programs doing innovative plasma
   physics and diagnostic development research. He has a broad range of
   abilities and interests: fusion devices from tokamaks to spheromaks to
   the National Ignition Facility, diagnostics including spectroscopy and
   fusion products, and issues of plasma confinement, MHD flow physics,
   and hydrodynamic implosions. This includes experience with creating and
   using computer modeling and simulation tools. He is working in
   hydrodynamics of inertial confinement fusion experiments, and has a
   significant interest in science-based stockpile stewardship.

   ``If it's not writen down, it doesn't exist.''

   I'm a firm believer in the published literature. As such, I have
   generated BibTeX bibliographies on various subjects for my use and the
   use of others. Using the LaTeX2HTML tool, I have generated electronic
   versions of some of these bibliographies:

   Spheromak Bibliography of Cris W. Barnes
   Fusion Product Bibliography of H.-Stephan Bosch
   Disruption Bibliography of Caress, Barnes, and Wurden
   Hydrodynamics Bibliography of Cris W. Barnes

   In addition, here is another Bibliography available on the Web:

   Magnetized Targer Fusion Bibliography of Richard Siemon
