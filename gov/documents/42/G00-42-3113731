   The QuikSCAT data posted here is for demonstration and evaluation
   purposes only. NASA/JPL reserves the right to discontinue the access to
   the data via this site at any time. This site is maintained on a "best
   effort" basis and may occasionally be down due to computer maintenance
   or other events.

   The data posted on the ftp site is wind data that is inferred from
   measurements of the SeaWinds scatterometer on the QuikSCAT spacecraft.
   The scatterometer wind data reported may not always be representative
   of the true surface wind. In particular, wind speed is substantially
   underestimated in very high speed wind zones, and wind direction may be
   substantially off due to occasional ambiguity errors. The wind data is
   NOT routinely quality controlled before posting on this site. The user
   is therefore advised to employ these data at his/her own risk.
