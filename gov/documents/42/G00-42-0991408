   Initiatives & Referendums

   The first power reserved by the people is the initiative."
   -- Article II, Section 1(a), Washington State Constitution

   Washington state was among the first states to adopt the initiative and
   referendum process when voters approved it as an amendment to the state
   constitution in 1912. This process, rooted in the state's populist
   beginnings, gives citizens the power to make and remake their laws, and
   to have the final say on the decisions of their Legislature.
