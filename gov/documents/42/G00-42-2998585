The ASTRO-E2 Mission
(January/February 2005 Launch)

                     (Originally launched Feb 10, 2000)

   ASTRO-E2 will be Japan's fifth X-ray astronomy mission, and is being
   developed at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in
   collaboration with U.S. (NASA/GSFC, MIT) and Japanese institutions.
   ASTRO-E2 will cover the energy range 0.4 - 700 keV with the three
   instruments, X-ray micro-calorimeter (X-ray Spectrometer; XRS), X-ray
   CCDs (X-ray Imaging Spectrometer; XIS), and the hard X-ray detector
   (HXD).

   The U.S. ASTRO-E2 Guest Observer Facility (GOF) is located at NASA's
   Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The GOF is part of
   the Office of Guest Investigator Programs (OGIP) in the Laboratory for
   High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA).

   The primary responsibility of the U.S. ASTRO-E2 GOF is to enable U.S.
   astronomers to make the best use of the ASTRO-E2 mission. To fulfill
   this responsibility, the ASTRO-E2 GOF staff performs such activities as
   supporting the U.S. side of the ASTRO-E2 proposal selection process,
   distributing usable data to U.S. Guest Observers, helping Guest
   Observers to analyze their data, and creating the mission archive.

   In addition to the tasks listed above, the U.S. ASTRO-E2 GOF activities
   include the development of software, the compilation and production of
   documentation for that software, and the provision of expert help. All
   of the U.S. ASTRO-E2 GOF's activities involve close collaboration with
   the Japanese ASTRO-E2 team.
