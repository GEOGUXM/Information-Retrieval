   The 2000 aerials are color photographs compressed with the Lizard Tech
   compression technology as SID graphics.  The file size of the SID
   compressed images range from five to seven megabytes. Although the file
   size of the SID compressed files are 1/6 the size of the black and
   white 1997 TIF files, the quality of the SID files are superior to the
   1997 image.

                            Viewer for SID files

   Viewing or printing a SID compressed file requires additional
   software.  Free plug-in for Microsoft's Internet Explorer (  ' Internet
   Explorer plug in'  ) and a free geoviewer (  ' MrSID GeoViewer' ) are
   available from Lizard Tech.

   The 1997 aerial photos are black and white photographs compressed as
   TIF graphics. The file size of the 1997 range from 30 to 38 megabytes.
   The TIF graphics may be inserted into a Microsoft Word file or any
   graphic application capable of  using TIF files.
