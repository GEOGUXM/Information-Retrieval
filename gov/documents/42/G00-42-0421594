   SUBJECT : Use of America's Workforce Network(AWN) Logo

   1. Purpose. To further announce the establishment of the requirement
   that Employment and Training Administration (ETA) grantees, their
   sub-grantees, and selected ETA contractors use the official branding
   logo for America's Workforce Network on their public materials. This
   Notice also provides the AWN Concept Paper, which outlines initial
   thinking on the national branding and marketing campaign and will serve
   as the basis for discussions among the partners regarding the
   development of said campaign.

   2. References. Assistant Secretary Bramucci's letter to all Governors
   dated June 30, 2000.

   3. Background. Over the last six decades, Federal, State and Local
   governments have instituted a wide range of employment and training
   programs to address our Nation's evolving workforce development needs.
   Traditionally, each program has served a distinct purpose, often
   addressing a situational concern at a specific time. Since 1994, ETA
   has worked with state and local entities to build a One-Stop Career
   Center system, which was made permanent by the Workforce Investment Act
   of 1998 (WIA). Although these efforts have made advancements in serving
   customers better, the programs have not fully aligned their service
   delivery efforts with, nor been recognized as part of, the larger
   workforce investment system. Even today, many programs and services
   appear isolated from one another and the workforce investment system
   remains under-publicized. The lack of publicity, and resulting lack of
   awareness of these services by our customers, need to be remedied.

   The intent behind creating the America's Workforce Network brand is to
   recognize the collaboration among the partners' workforce development
   organizations to improve access for the Nation's workers and employers.
   Taking advantage of the recent changes being made through
   implementation of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), this new
   partnership will work collaboratively to develop a more streamlined and
   flexible delivery system and fully establish a comprehensive workforce
   investment network.

   To ensure that our various stakeholders and the public are aware of the
   services available, the U.S. Department of Labor has taken the lead in
   creating a brand identity, America's Workforce Network, which will be
   attached to all federally-sponsored workforce investment activities
   nationwide. The brand identity will be built to recognize that while
   each system partner offers a unique set of services, the system as a
   whole features integrated partner efforts to provide information and
   services to help Americans manage their careers and employers find
   skilled workers.

   4. Requirement to Use AWN Logo. To further help establish the brand,
   ETA will require grantees,sub-grantees and certain contractors to use
   the AWN logo on their public materials. The inclusion of the AWN logo
   on partners' public materials is a co-branding effort that allows
   partners to have their products associated with the national effort
   without losing their individual identities. This requirement will be
   incorporated into existing ETA grants and contracts through
   modifications and will be included as a standard clause in new
   agreements. The new clause language is attached to this Notice.

   As part of the establishment of the brand, the Department of Labor is
   working with our partners to help define the nature and scope of the
   Network, who beyond the mandated partners will participate, and how to
   define for the public the value added that the Network provides. The
   AWN Concept Paper outlines initial thinking about America's Workforce
   Network and the importance of a full-scale branding and marketing
   campaign for the system. This document must be considered a
   stepping-stone to creating a more comprehensive and complete product.
   In consultation with you, our partners and stakeholders, we will
   acquire the necessary perspective and information to develop a focused,
   comprehensive, strategic branding and marketing plan for America's
   Workforce Network.

   Once the brand is established, this effort will be followed by a full
   marketing campaign to ensure that the public and employers are aware of
   the services and products available to them. This marketing effort will
   include nationally-run advertisements, posters, brochures and
   collateral materials, as well as templates for use by partners to
   co-brand their programs as part of AWN.

   To support the marketing effort, DOL is developing a comprehensive
   communications plan for use by States, with the assistance of an
   outside vendor. We will be seeking the input of our partners in the
   preparation of this plan and the development of guidelines,templates
   and collateral materials. Through this collaborative effort, members of
   the AWN will share in creating a strategy that recognizes their efforts
   and adds value to every partner. We anticipate that the branding
   campaign will intersect with the efforts of the Workforce Excellence
   Board, which is working on establishing an independent validation
   process for performance excellence among members of America's Workforce
   Network.

   5. Next Steps. Basic guidelines for the use of the logo will be sent to
   you, along with the grant modification, within the next two weeks. As
   mentioned earlier, we will seek your input in the preparation of more
   detailed guidelines in the near future.

   6. Action Requested. Please share this TEIN with staff in your
   organization who prepare and format all public documents, publications,
   and other materials as well your organization's marketing people.

   7. Feedback. Questions on this TEIN should be directed to the Office of
   Career Transition Assistance, Division of One Stop; attention: Kevin
   Thompson, at 202-693-3045.
