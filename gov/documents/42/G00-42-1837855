Gonio-Photometer

   We use this device to measure the the intensity and direction of the
   light from a lamp or a fixture.

Integrating Sphere

   This instrument allows us to get a fast an accurate measurement of the
   total light output of a lamp. We are not able to determine the
   direction of the light, only the intensity.

Power Analyzer

   We use our power analyzer with the lamps in the gonio- photometer to
   measure input power, harmonic distortion, power factor, and many other
   signals that tell us how well a lamp is performing.

Spectro-radiometer

   This device not only measures the intensity of a light source, but it
   can also measure the intensity of the light at each wavelength.
