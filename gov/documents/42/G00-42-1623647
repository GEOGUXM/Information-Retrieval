      Under the direction of Secretary of State Bill Jones, the Executive
      Office sets and oversees implementation of policy for the agency.
      Some of the programs conducted by Secretary Jones' Executive Office
      include:

     * Legislative advocacy for state and federal election reforms that
       will help encourage 100 percent participation of eligible citizens
       and zero tolerance for fraud.
     * Working with our employees to develop a Business Improvement
       Process in the Business Programs Division that has decreased filing
       turnaround times and backlog for documents from several weeks to a
       matter of days or hours.
     * Improve efficiency by automating the agency with increased use of
       personal computers and modernizing several of the functions that
       used to be performed manually. We have also made improvements to
       the agency's phone system to help our customers save time when
       contacting our office.
     * Improve customer service by providing information to the public via
       the Internet. Items such as voter registration forms, business
       filing forms, corporation searches, live election returns, and
       political campaign contribution and expenditure data are all
       available through this site.

      The Executive Office is divided into various units, including:

     * Legislative and Constituent Affairs
     * Media Communications Office
     * Legal Affairs
