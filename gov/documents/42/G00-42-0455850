           NARA Increases Security; New Procedures in College Park

     New security procedures have been implemented at the National
     Archives in College Park in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New
     York City and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.

     The changes at College Park are similar to those that have been in
     place at the National Archives Building in Washington since May 1,
     2001. Those changes followed a comprehensive review of existing
     practices and are bringing our security procedures in line with
     those at other Federal buildings of similar function and size.

                      National Archives at College Park

     The only access to the public and the staff-only areas of the
     National Archives at College Park will be through doors in the main
     lobby, where an "airport-style" security procedure has been
     instituted. All personnel-agency staff, contractors, and
     visitors-are required to pass through magnetometers. All packages,
     briefcases, and personal belongings must pass through an x-ray
     scanner.

     Researchers and visitors approaching the building from Adelphi Road
     must stop at the first guard station and be prepared to show
     photo-identification. A NARA photo researcher card is the preferred
     form of identification, but a driver's license or other form of
     photo-identification is acceptable.

     The cafeteria remains open for use by the public. The adjoining
     patio is still available for use, but persons cannot re-enter the
     building from the patio and must instead come in through the main
     lobby and the magnetometer.

     These procedures will remain in effect even when the lobby is
     remodeled next year to better accommodate these new security
     arrangements.

     Emergency call boxes on each of the three levels of the parking
     garage are now in service. The blue light on the top of the unit
     identifies the call boxes. Pushing the red button puts the user in
     immediate contact with the guard office.

                  National Archives Building in Washington

     The security arrangements at the National Archives Building in
     Washington, which is now undergoing a renovation, are unchanged from
     those instituted on May 1. Everyone entering the building from
     Pennsylvania Avenue-agency staff, contractors, and visitors-will
     pass through the magnetometer and send personal belongings through
     the x-ray scanner.

     After you have gone through entry screening, a security officer will
     give you an appropriate temporary NARA-issued identification. It
     must be worn at all times. It will indicate the areas of the
     building you are authorized to use for your work or visit.

     Microfilm researchers will get a green ID card; textual researchers
     will get an orange metal disk to clip to clothing; and visitors
     (business or Government agency representatives) will get a red ID
     card.

     Return these IDs to the security desk in the Pennsylvania Avenue
     lobby when you leave.

     The Rotunda is undergoing renovation, and the Constitution Avenue
     entrance is closed.

                           Prohibitions, Cautions

     This entry screening in both Washington and College Park will
     enforce long-standing regulations that prohibit bringing firearms
     (except for law enforcement officers), dangerous weapons,
     explosives, or other prohibited items into a Federal building. A
     permit to carry a weapon issued by a local jurisdiction is not valid
     in a Federal building.

     In addition, NARA also prohibits bringing into the buildings
     self-defense sprays (Mace or pepper spray, etc.) or any other
     aerosol spray that might damage documents.

     Also, if you have a heart pacemaker or other medical device that
     might be disrupted by the magnetometer (or give a false reading),
     ask to be screened with a hand-held wand.

     These are measures to protect you, our staff, the nation's records,
     and these buildings. One of our primary missions is to promote easy
     access to records, and we will make every effort to see that these
     security measures do not unduly interfere with your research or
     visit. Thank you for your cooperation.
