The BeppoSAX Mission
(1996 - present)

   SAX is a program of the Italian Space agency (ASI) with participation
   of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace programs (NIVR). The mission is
   supported by a consortium of institutes in Italy together with
   institutes in the Netherlands , and the Space Science Department of
   ESA.

   The acronym SAX stands for "Satellite per Astronomia X", italian for
   "X-Ray Astronomy Satellite". SAX was launched on April 30 1996 and
   renamed BeppoSAX in honor of Giuseppe Occhialini.

   The BeppoSAX U.S. Coordination Facility (USCF) was established at the
   HEASARC in February 1997 with the main aim to provide a BeppoSAX
   archive in US. This facility works closely with the BeppoSAX Science
   Data Center (SDC) in Rome. In addition it provides basic support to the
   US astronomical comunity for the proposal preparation and exploitation
   of the SAX data.
