The U.S. Blue Pages: Connecting Citizens with their Federal Services and
Agencies

   The U.S. Blue Pages Project connects U.S. citizens with the services
   and agencies of the U.S. federal government through their local
   telephone directories and through its website (www.usBluePages.gov).
   Today, the U.S. Blue Pages project ensures that federal listings appear
   in 400 phone books across the country, reaching about 56 percent of
   U.S. households.

   The U.S. Blue Pages are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
   Listings are organized functionally rather than by agency. For example,
   citizens can look under "T" for tax forms rather than under "I" for
   Internal Revenue Service, or under "M" for Medicare rather than under
   "H" for the Health Care Financing Administration. The U.S. Blue Pages
   format provided to service providers and listings publishers also uses
   icons and colors to help point citizens to the phone numbers they need.

   The parent agency of the U.S. Blue Pages Project is the General
   Services Administration (GSA). The GSA administers the U.S. Blue Pages
   Project through its Federal Technology Service (FTS). The U.S. Blue
   Pages project team is responsible for ensuring federal listing data is
   correct and complete, working with federal agencies to ensure effective
   listings, and negotiating with service providers and telephone book
   publishers to provide low-cost or no-cost federal listings nationwide.

   Listing costs are charged back to federal agencies through Federal
   Telecommunication Service (FTS) user fees. Unit cost is expected to
   drop as new markets are added. The ultimate goal of the U.S. Blue Pages
   Project is to reach 97 percent of U.S. households.

   Citizens can also connect to federal information through the U.S Blue
   Pages website. This website is "Bobby" certified. Bobby is a web-based
   tool that analyzes web pages for their accessibility to people with
   disabilities. The Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) offers
   Bobby as a free public service in order to further its mission to
   expand opportunities for people with disabilities through the
   innovative uses of computer technology. Currently, the website
   highlights key federal listings, including telephone and TTY numbers
   and website links.

   The U.S. Blue Pages project also offers more in-depth help to citizens
   through its actual (phone-based) and virtual (e-mail-based) help desks.
   The help desks may be reached at 1-877-237-3738 and
   questions@usbluepages.gov.
