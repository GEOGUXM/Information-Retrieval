     About The Federal Depository Library Program Electronic Collection

   The Federal Depository Library Program Electronic Collection (FDLP/EC)
   is a comprehensive digital library of U.S.  Government information,
   drawn from a wide variety of sources, and sharing the attributes of
   being of public interest or educational value and produced entirely at
   taxpayer expense.  The FDLP, through its network of depository
   libraries, is identifying, pointing to, acquiring or creating metadata
   for, and in many cases archiving electronic publications from all
   agencies, and will provide ongoing free public access through its suite
   of locator tools and services.  The FDLP/EC is composed of:
    1. Core legislative and regulatory publications which reside on GPO
       servers, available through GPO Access
    2. Products directly managed for other agencies on GPO servers, or
       through formal agreements with other institutions, and available
       through GPO Access
    3. Publications identified, described, and linked to through GPO
       services, but which remain under the control of originating
       agencies, with access through GPO's locator tools and services
    4. Tangible electronic products (such as CD/ROM, DVD, or others)
       distributed to Federal depository libraries.

   Complete information about the FDLP/EC is available in Managing the
   FDLP Electronic Collection: A Policy and Planning Document (GPO, 1998)
