   Incident Type/Module Rules

        * The Basic Module is always required for Incident Types: 100-911
        * If Incident Type = 571 (stand by) and if Aid Given or Received =
          codes 3, 4 or 5, then only the information on the Basic module
          through Block D (Aid Given or Received) need be completed by the
          department giving aid. The rest of the Basic Module and the other
          modules as applicable are optional.
        * If Incident Type = any other Incident Type than 571 and if Aid
          Given or Received = codes 3, 4 or 5, and the "THEIR FDID"
          information in Block D is entered, then only the information on the
          Basic module through block G1 (Resources) and the Fire Fighter
          Casualty Module (when there is a casualty which, including
          additionally Block H1 on Basic) must be completed by the department
          giving aid. The remainder of the Basic module and any other modules
          associated with the incident may be optionally completed but are
          not required. The information not captured by the department giving
          aid will be captured by the department that receives aid for that
          incident.
        * Aid Giving Departments and Aid Receiving Departments always track
          their own Fire Service casualties separately. If a Fire Service
          Casualty occurs in a department giving aid, they should also
          complete the H1 Casualties block on the Basic Module in addition to
          the FS Casualty Module.
        * The department receiving aid is responsible for tracking and
          entering all of the civilian casualty information for the incident.
        * If aid is given (codes 3, 4 or 5), then only the information on the
          Basic module through block G1 (Resources) must be completed by the
          department giving aid unless a fire service casualty also occurs,
          then the giving department must also complete the Fire Service
          Casualty Module. The remainder of the Basic module and any other
          modules associated with the incident may be optionally completed
          but are not required. The information not captured by the
          department giving aid is captured by the department that receives
          aid for that incident.
        * The Fire Module is always required for the following Incident Types
          with no exceptions: 110-112, 120-138, 161-164 (160 is not included
