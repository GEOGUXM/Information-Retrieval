   What is the Earth to Orbit Engineering Design Challenges Program?
   The ETO Engineering Design Challenges Program connects students in
   their classrooms with the challenges faced by NASA engineers as they
   design the next generation of aerospace vehicles. Students in grades
   6-9 work on design challenges with their teachers. These design
   challenges help students achieve national goals in science,
   mathematics, and thinking skills.

   Working under the supervision of their teachers, students design,
   build, test, re-design, and re-build models that meet specified design
   criteria. Students employ the same analytical skills as engineers as
   they improve their designs. The design challenge culminates in the
   classroom with each student team preparing a poster that describes the
   process and results of their work.

   All the design challenges have been field tested to insure that they
   are educationally appropriate and valuable.

   The educator guide also includes a reproducible handout for parents to
   inform them of their child's work along with suggested activities to
   conduct at home.

   How To Participate?

   The Earth to Orbit Engineering Design Challenge program has been
   designed as an integral part of classroom work. Teachers who wish to
   participate in the program with their students should download the
   Educator Resource Guide for the challenge they wish to conduct and use
   it as a guide for carrying out the challenge with their students.
