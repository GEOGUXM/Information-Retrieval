   NOAA OR&R offers training courses for oil and chemical incident
   responders.

SOS and SACS Workshops

   NOAA offers two workshops on a space-available basis to spill response
   professionals in local, state, and Federal governments and industry.

   Science of Oil Spills (SOS, formerly STOCS) Workshops are held
   approximately every 9 months, usually at NOAA's main campus in Seattle.
   Each 40-hour workshop covers a variety of topics relating to oil and
   chemical spill response and planning. The next SOS class will be held
   June 10 - 14th, 2002, in Seattle, Washington.

   Scientific Aspects of Chemical Spill Response (SACS) Workshops are held
   when demand warrants at NOAA's Seattle campus. Each 4-day workshop
   covers chemical principles and basic hazard identification and
   assessment. There are no SACS workshops scheduled at this time.

   For more information about SOS and SACS workshops, or to find out how
   to apply, contact ORR.Spills@noaa.gov.
