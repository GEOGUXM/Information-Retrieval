   Executive Order 13158 directs federal agencies to conserve the nations
   valuable marine resources through a variety of tasks related to marine
   protected areas. It directs the federal government to work with public
   and private partners to significantly strengthen and expand the
   national system of MPAs. A key component of the national MPA initiative
   is the establishment of a Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA Center) by
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department
   of Commerce. The MPA Center, in cooperation with the Department of the
   Interior (DOI) and other partners, will coordinate the implementation
   of the Executive Order by developing "a framework for a national system
   of MPAs, and [providing] Federal, State, territorial, tribal, and local
   governments with the information, technologies, and strategies to
   support the system.

   Responsibilities of the MPA Center

   Implementing the Executive Order will require considerable cooperation,
   collaboration and information sharing among many government and private
   institutions. Working with DOI and many partners, the MPA Center will:
     * develop the framework for a national network of MPAs;
     * coordinate the development of information, tools and strategies,
       and provide guidance, that will enable and encourage agencies in
       their efforts both to enhance and expand the protection of existing
       MPAs, and to establish or recommend new ones;
     * coordinate the MPA Web site;
     * partner with federal and nonfederal organizations to conduct
       research, analysis, and exploration;
     * help construct and maintain an inventory of existing U.S. MPAs and
       the MPA List; and
     * support the MPA Advisory Committee.

   Building the Foundation for the National System of MPAs

   The Executive Order directs the MPA Center, with the Department of the
   Interior, to coordinate and share information, tools and strategies,
   and to provide guidance, to enable and encourage federal, state,
   territorial, tribal and local agencies in the exercise of their
   respective authorities both to enhance and expand the protection of
   existing MPAs, and to establish or recommend new ones.

   The Center will use a combination of targeted research, assessment,
   policy analysis, education, outreach, training and technical assistance
   in the following areas, specifically identified in the Executive Order:
     * science-based identification and prioritization of natural and
       cultural resources for additional protection;
     * integrated assessments of ecological linkages among MPAs, including
       ecological reserves in which consumptive uses of resources are
       prohibited, to provide synergistic benefits;
     * a biological assessment of the minimum area in which it is
       necessary to prohibit consumptive uses in order to preserve
       representative habitats in different geographic areas of the marine
       environment;
     * an assessment of threats to natural and cultural resources, and
       gaps in levels of protection, as appropriate;
     * practical, science-based criteria and protocols for monitoring and
       evaluating the effectiveness of MPAs;
     * the identification of emerging threats and user conflicts affecting
       MPAs, and appropriate, practical, and equitable management
       solutions, including effective enforcement strategies, to eliminate
       or reduce such threats and conflicts;
     * an assessment of the economic effects of the preferred management
       solutions; and
     * the identification of opportunities to improve linkages with, and
       technical assistance to, international marine protected area
       programs.

   Creating the MPA Center: A Nationwide Network of Public and Private
   Expertise in Ocean Conservation

   Fulfilling the tasks from the Executive Order will require expertise
   and effort from a wide range of agencies, institutions and partners.
   Consequently, the MPA Center has been designed to tap into the existing
   network of public and private interests and expertise to achieve a
   common goal: designing and creating a system of MPAs. The focal point
   of this center will be building partnerships to address MPA issues. The
   MPA Center will have a central office managed by NOAA's National Ocean
   Service at its headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. It will be managed by
   a small staff that will lead and coordinate all aspects of implementing
   the Executive Order in cooperation with the Department of the Interior
   and other partners. In time, MPA experts from other federal and state
   agencies may join NOAA staff at the center, either permanently or on a
   temporary basis.

   The MPA Center will be initially supported by two regional institutes
   that focus on distinct aspects of the design and management of MPAs.

   The Institute for MPA Science will collaborate with agency and
   nongovernmental partners to develop the science-based framework and
   tools to design and effectively manage MPAs. The Institute is
   co-located with NOAA's new Fisheries Lab in Santa Cruz, California,
   adjacent to a growing number of state and federal marine research and
   conservation institutions associated with the University of California.

   The Institute for MPA Training and Technical Assistance will work with
   partners in the United States and internationally to develop and offer
   specialized training in MPA issues, and to develop technical products
   and services that enhance MPA conservation worldwide. This Institute is
   located at NOAAs Coastal Services Center in Charleston, South
   Carolina.

   Both institutes will focus on priority areas of EO 13158, as identified
   by the national MPA Center in Washington, DC. The institutes are to
   seek and forge meaningful partnerships with other governmental and
   nongovernmental institutions with expertise in ocean science and
   management. In addition to engaging local resources, the institutes
   will form collaborative networks of experts located in NOAA and other
   public, academic, and private institutions throughout the nation.
