            Blame Game is Wrong Antidote for the Troubled Economy

     Washington, D.C. - House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt made the
     following statement on the economy:

     "Things are going well with the war in Afghanistan and now it is
     time to focus on the homefront and make sure that we can revive our
     struggling economy," said Gephardt. "We need a plan that will
     stimulate the economy and meet our priorities without wreaking havoc
     on the long term fiscal health of our nation. That means
     re-evaluating our country's budget and making sure we can meet
     competing needs without creating huge deficits.

     "I have not heard one Democrat say he or she wants to raise taxes.
     Nonetheless, some in the Republican party are insisting that Senator
     Daschle and Democrats want to raise taxes. This is a partisan blame
     game and it has no place in the debate about the future economic
     health of this country.

     "We have a lot to do in terms of helping people who have lost their
     jobs, providing a solid education for every American child, helping
     seniors afford prescription medicine and creating a balanced energy
     plan that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. When Congress
     returns, we hope to have a serious debate about how to do all of
     these things and also how to get this economy back on its feet. If
     this partisan blame game continues, it is going to be hard for us to
     come together, like we need to do, and get this economy going."
