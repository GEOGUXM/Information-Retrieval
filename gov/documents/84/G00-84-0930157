              Organization of the Supersymmetry/Higgs Workshop



   [rbowl2.gif]

   The workshop is organized around five semi-autonomous working groups,
   each one coordinated by a pair of theory conveners and CDF + D0 contact
   persons. The names of the working groups are merely mnemonics; the
   subject areas are organized roughly around the various possibilities
   for the SUSY LSP, and associated experimental signatures. Consult the
   home pages of the individual working groups for details of the topics
   to be covered.

   It is expected that, within this overall framework, a number of
   informal subgroups will be formed around particular theoretical
   variants, calculations, experimental signatures, and software. The
   event generator working group will function as a metagroup, integrating
   its activities with those of the other four working groups.

   The results of the Supersymmetry/Higgs workshop will appear as a
   published report.
