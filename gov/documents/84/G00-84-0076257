                      Mucosal Immunity And Vaccination
            _____________________________________________________

   [electrophoresis.jpg] Avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease
   virus (NDV), and Salmonella enteriditis (SE) initiate infections on
   mucosal surfaces of the respiratory or intestinal tract of chickens.
   Most vaccination programs seeking to prevent these illnesses rely on
   parenteral immunization which provides good serum immunity but elicits
   little immunity at mucosal surfaces. As a result, the organism becomes
   established in the host before encountering immune defenses. A new area
   of research at SEPRL will examine the development of immunity against
   AIV, NDV, and SE in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of chickens
   and the abilityof electrostatic technology to reduce airborne
   transmission of SE. New knowledge will be applied to the production of
   novel vaccine strategies and regimes to enhance the immunity at mucosal
   surfaces and air cleaning and disinfection techniques to prevent the
   initiation of infection by these organisms.
