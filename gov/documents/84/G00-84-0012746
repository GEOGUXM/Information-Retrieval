   Introduction

   The Restoration Technology group (RT) responds to client needs for
   bioengineering research/technical assistance. RT applies engineering
   principles, biology, chemistry and quantitative methods to the
   development of new techniques for water conditioning, monitoring and
   pollution abatement as well as the advancement of knowledge at the cell
   through system levels. The research field is broad based with an
   emphasis on activities that require the knowledge and experimental
   skills provided through modern biological research as well as problem
   solving approaches derived from the traditional engineering
   disciplines, i.e. environmental, chemical and metallurgical
   engineering. This combined skill set provides for the development of
   unique problem solving approaches - - integrated science at its
   smallest unit of organization.

   Group Mission

   The Leetown Science Center conducts research to provide information
   needed to restore, enhance, maintain and protect fish and other
   important aquatic and terrestrial organisms and their supporting
   ecosystems. Research activities within RT directly support this
   mission, specifically in the area of aquatics with an emphasis on
   priority problems impacting the Appalachian region. The RT group
   mission can be stated as follows:

   The Restoration Technology group conducts research needed to restore or
   protect the chemical, physical and biological integrity of desirable
   aquatic systems.

   Group Vision

   Our vision of RT group research is identical to that established for
   LSC - - research will be relevant, scientifically sound and well
   managed.

   Group History

   The RT Group is one of three Leetown Science Center research components
   that share resources at Leetown, West Virginia. This site includes the
   central Administration Building of the Leetown Science Center as well
   as the Eastern Regional Office of the Biological Resources Division of
   USGS. The RT group was established in 1997 to enhance the Centers
   ability to satisfy customer research needs in bioengineering, e.g.
   restoration of streams degraded by acidic mine drainage.

   Group Structure

   The RT Group includes a mixture of permanent, term and contract
   employees:

   Physical Resources

   The LSC site includes 500 acres of land, several cold water springs,
   state-of-the-art water conditioning equipment, concrete raceways and a
   modern research pond facility that provide the core physical resources
   needed to conduct a wide variety of aquatic oriented research. In
   addition, RT has remodeled /developed the following RT specific work
   areas:

                   ·

                               750 ft^2 office/library complex (Bldg. 126)

                   ·

                           480 ft^2 office/dry laboratory (Hatchery Bldg.)

                   ·

                     900 ft^2 model assembly/testing room (Hatchery Bldg.)

                   ·

                       880 ft^2 wet/hyperbaric laboratory (Hatchery Bldg.)



   The office/library complex serves as the RT Group Headquarters. Water
   chemistry and solid analyses needed to support bioengineering research
   are performed in the dry laboratory. The laboratory is fully equipped
   with modern instrumentation including a graphite furnace atomic
   absorption spectrometer capable of performing low-level analysis of
   dissolved metals. Additional capabilities include analysis of solid
   samples for particle size distribution, analysis of water alkalinity,
   acidity, nutrients, oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved gas
   concentrations. The model assembly room doubles as an equipment storage
   area. It also provides the space, power, gas and water needed to test
   prototypes used in model calibration/verification studies. The wet
   hyperbaric laboratory contains four replicate test systems capable of
   controlling the pressure, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved
   air, and dissolved carbon dioxide levels during tests designed to
   simulate ballast water treatment methods. This computer-controlled
   laboratory equipment is unique to USGS. Also unique is a hydropower
   test station recently constructed to evaluate fish friendly technology
   at water flow rates up to 1500 gpm and heads up to 20 feet.

   Group Methods

   The RT Group is unique within LSC and USGS as it integrates biology,
   engineering and chemistry to develop new methods for water
   conditioning, monitoring and pollution abatement. Currently, research
   supports Appalachian stream and river restoration efforts, seeks to
   reduce impacts of hydropower operations, as well as to control the
   introduction of aquatic exotics. Typically, pilot scale equipment
   employing a new method or process is constructed within the laboratory
   then field tested to establish comparative performance. Chemical
   reactor theory is often used to establish performance algorithms needed
   to adjust equipment designs to match operating conditions with desired
   performance.

   Resources required to fully develop and apply a new process exceed
   those typically available within RT or LSC. Hence RTs goal is to
   perform research that is necessary to initially validate the concept.
   End products are both technical papers, patents and in some cases
   design software. When appropriate, RT seeks partnerships that leverage
   group resources and allow for further development of the methodfield
   tests, new applications. These partnerships are pursued through the
   Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) mechanism as
   directed and formalized by the USGS Technology Transfer Office. This
   mechanism provides for license based royalty income that is directed in
   part back to LSC. Alternatively, technical assistance within DOI can
   provide additional opportunities to apply and further develop RT
   research products, e.g. vacuum degasser scale-up at the Craig Brook
   National Fish Hatchery, Maine.

   High priority research needs being addressed by RTs staff often require
   involvement of researchers representing LSCs other laboratory
   components including AEL and FHL. Partnerships here are developed
   through the LSC Theme Team program --team participants, including
   partner scientists, prepare a programmatic plan, and define the desired
   outcomes. The teams then establish objectives and define the research
   and information management /transfer strategies required to obtain the
   outcomes. RT fully supports the Team concept as a means of better
   utilizing resources within and outside of LSC.

   Studies Underway

   Current studies support three BRD program elements, i.e. Exotic
   Species, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Application of Science
   Information to Management. These studies are linked in turn to four LSC
   priority resource issues. Specifically, they address (1), fish passage
   in eastern rivers (2), restoration of Appalachian streams (3),
   invasive/exotic species and (4), natural resources on public lands:
