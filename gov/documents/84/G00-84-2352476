      The research of the Magnetic Films group emphasizes the synthesis of
    a broad range of novel materials by means of sputtering and molecular
      beam epitaxy (MBE), and the characterization of their structural,
     physical, chemical and metallurgical properties utilizing advanced
    techniques, including the surface magneto-optic Kerr effect (SMOKE).
