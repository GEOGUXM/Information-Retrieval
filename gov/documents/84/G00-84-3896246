   Stakeholders FGDC Funding Publications Data Standards

   The FGDC develops geospatial data standards for implementing the NSDI,
   in consultation and cooperation with State, local, and tribal
   governments, the private sector and academic community, and, to the
   extent feasible, the international community.

   Anyone interested in participating in FGDC standards activities is
   invited to contact the Chair of the sponsoring FGDC Subcommittee or
   FGDC Working Group.

   The FGDC Standards Reference Model defines the expectations of FGDC
   standards, describes different types of geospatial standards, and
   documents the FGDC standards process. Standards Directives provide
   additional guidance to the FGDC Subcommittees and Working Groups
   developing standards and document the practices of the FGDC Standards
   Working Group.

   Many standards documents are in Portable Document Format. You may
   download a free PDF reader from Adobe.
