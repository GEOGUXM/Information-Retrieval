   WDC Logo

   World Data Center (WDC) for Oceanography is one component of a global
   network of discipline subcenters that facilitate international exchange
   of scientific data. Originally established during the International
   Geophysical Year of 1957-58, the World Data Center System functions
   under the guidance of the International Council of Scientific Unions
   (ICSU). WDC for Oceanography, Silver Spring, is collocated with, and
   operated by, the U.S. National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).

   In accordance with principles set forth by ICSU, WDC for Oceanography
   acquires, catalogues, and archives data, publications, and data
   inventory forms and makes them available to requesters in the
   international scientific community. To improve user access, the WDC
   provides copies of data it receives to its counterparts, World Data
   Center for Oceanography (Obninsk, Russia) and World Data Center for
   Oceanography (Tianjin, China). Oceanographic data contributed to the
   WDC become automatically available to scientific investigators in any
   country. Thus, there can be no restrictions or limitations placed on
   data exchanged through the WDC system, however for certain types of
   data, the exchange of inventories of available data in a WDC subcenter
   may be considered acceptable in lieu of the transfer of the actual data
   sets.

Data Collection and Products

   The WDC for Oceanography data collections and products are available
   through the U.S. NODC Internet Web site. The following Web sites
   provide WDC Oceanography collections and products:

   New Products
       CD-ROMS
       Publications
       Ocean Climate Laboratory

Exchange Policy

   WDC for Oceanography is responsible for the provision of materials to
   requesters either in exchange or at a cost not to exceed that of
   processing and shipping. For certain types of requests, limitations in
   funding, personnel, or facilities may preclude direct or free provision
   of data or information by the WDC. In general, reasonably-sized
   requests from national or regional contributors to WDC for Oceanography
   may be considered as exchange. For requests for unusually large amounts
   of data, for specially formatted data, for derived data products, or
   for data to be obtained from outside the WDC system, WDC for
   Oceanography will often be required to recover the costs of processing
   and shipping, or, at its discretion, may arrange for the request to be
   serviced by a regional, national, or discipline center.

Automation of Data

   The WDC has no facilities for automated data processing; NODC provides
   support to the WDC for Oceanography for all required computer
   operations. Data submitted to the WDC that are amenable to processing
   and incorporation into NODC's data files thus become part of NODC's
   global data bank.

WDC for Oceanography Publications

   All data received by WDC for Oceanography are described in the
   "Catalogue of Data and Report of Data Exchange". The scientific
   community is kept apprised of the availability of data and publications
   from the WDC through regular dissemination of the catalogue to
   organizations and individuals in more than 75 countries, and, as
   appropriate, to qualified requesters.

ROSCOP

   WDC for Oceanography maintains the Report of Observations/Samples
   Collected by Oceanographic Programs (ROSCOP) international marine data
   inventory system. (The 3rd edition of ROSCOP, entitled Cruise Summary
   Report, is now in use.) Data inventory forms, such as ROSCOP, enable
   inventory centers to determine the availability of internationally
   exchangeable data in advance of the actual receipt of the data and are
   also useful in providing a referral service to data not yet available
   through the WDC system. The WDC has increasingly utilized the automated
   ROSCOP information base maintained by the International Council for the
   Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
