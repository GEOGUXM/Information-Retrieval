   Background and Objectives

   Background

      NOAA's Polar-Orbiting Environmental System (POES) and the DoD's Defense
      Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) have served the nation for many
      years.

      In 1994, the Administration recognized that converging the Department
      of Defense (DoD) and Department of Commerce (DOC) systems would result
      in a more cost effective and higher performance integrated system. As a
      result, in May 1994, a convergence plan was submitted to the U.S.
      Congress stating

        NPOESS can "reduce the cost of acquiring and operating
        polar-orbiting environmental satellite systems, while continuing to
        satisfy U.S. operational requirements for data from these systems."

      The President endorsed this initiative, signing Presidential Decision
      Directive NSTC-2, "...establishing a single, converged, operational
      system [that] can reduce duplication of efforts in meeting common
      requirements while satisfying the unique requirements of the civil and
      national security communities." NPOESS is administered by the
      Integrated Program Office (IPO).

   Objectives

      The NPOESS program was established by Presidential Decision Directive
      to provide a single system incorporating the missions currently
      provided by the DMSP and POES programs. NPOESS objectives are to:
        * Provide a single, national, polar-orbiting remote-sensing
          capability to acquire, receive and disseminate global and regional
          environmental data
        * Achieve National Performance Review (NPR) cost savings through the
          convergence of DoD and NOAA environmental satellite programs
        * Incorporate new technologies from the National Aeronautics and
          Space Administration's (NASA's) Office of Earth Science Enterprise
          (OESE) program
        * Encourage international cooperation

      NPOESS requires remote sensing data from three orbital planes (early
      morning, mid-morning, and mid-afternoon) to accomplish its mission. The
      current notional architecture includes two U.S.-developed NPOESS
      satellites and a EUMETSAT satellite to meet the requirements. The
      EUMETSAT (METOP) satellite will provide data in the mid-morning orbital
      plane.
