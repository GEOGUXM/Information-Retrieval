 Immunotherapy Treatment Shows Dramatic Results for Rare Neurological Disorder

   For release: Wednesday, December 26, 2001

Overview

   An immunologic therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), administered
   to patients suffering from stiff person syndrome (SPS), provides
   dramatic relief from disabling symptoms, according to a study appearing
   in the December 27, 2001, issue of The New England Journal of
   Medicine.* The study's principal author, Marinos C. Dalakas, M.D.,
   chief of the Neuromuscular Diseases Section of the National Institute
   of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says that the success of the
   treatment supports the theory that SPS is the result of an autoimmune
   response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.

   An immunologic therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), administered
   to patients suffering from stiff person syndrome (SPS), provides
   dramatic relief from disabling symptoms, according to a study appearing
   in the December 27, 2001, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
   ^* The study's principal author, Marinos C. Dalakas, M.D., chief of the
   Neuromuscular Diseases Section of the National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says that the success of the
   treatment supports the theory that SPS is the result of an autoimmune
   response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.

   SPS is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and
   limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and
   emotional distress that can set off muscular spasms. People with SPS
   are often too disabled to walk or move, or are afraid to leave the
   house because of stimuli-triggered spasms and frequent falls. The
   incidence of SPS has been estimated at one in every one million
   persons, but according to Dr. Dalakas, "the disorder is so often
   misdiagnosed - as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,
   fibromyalgia, psychosomatic illness, or anxiety and phobia - that its
   actual incidence is probably much higher."

   Researchers have known since the 1980s that people with SPS have
   elevated circulating antibodies against a particular enzyme, glutamic
   acid decarboxylase (GAD[65]), involved in the synthesis of
   Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that
   controls muscle movement. Since GABA modulates the action of the
   excitatory muscular neurotransmitters, lower levels of circulating GABA
   allow the excitatory neurotransmitters to hijack communications between
   the brain and the motor system, overstimulating the muscles into
   stiffness and spasm.

   This link between the neurological symptoms of SPS and a potential
   immunological culprit led to several preliminary but successful
   attempts to treat the symptoms of the disorder with immuno-modulating
   therapies, including IVIg. Dr. Dalakas and his colleagues put this
   anecdotal evidence to the test by designing a double-blind, cross-over
   study that would measure the effect of immunoglobulin therapy versus
   placebo in a group of patients with SPS.

   The research team selected 16 patients who tested positive for GAD65
   antibodies to receive either IVIg or placebo for 3 months. After a
   1-month washout period, the patients crossed to the alternative
   therapy. Results were based on a "stiffness scale" and a "heightened
   sense scale" devised by Dr. Dalakas and his colleagues to detect
   changes in the severity of spasms.

   Patients treated with IVIg showed a statistically significant decrease
   in symptoms of stiffness and spasm. The scores of the IVIg-randomized
   patients dropped significantly from the first month to the fourth, but
   rebounded when they crossed to placebo. In the placebo group, scores
   remained constant for the first 4 months, and then dropped after
   crossing to IVIg. Eleven of the 14 patients who finished the study
   became less stiff and more mobile, and were able to either walk
   unassisted, resume work activities, or remain upright without fear of
   falling.

   The current treatment standard for SPS is diazepam, but according to
   Dr. Dalakas, "most patients require such high dosages that they become
   overly sedated." IVIg treats symptoms more successfully and comes with
   no disabling side effects.

   The mechanism of action of IVIg is not completely understood. Dalakas
   proposes that IVIg either blocks production of GAD65 or somehow
   neutralizes the circulating antibodies. What causes SPS is also
   uncertain. "We don't know why the body begins to produce these
   antibodies or how they reach the neuronal cell," says Dalakas. "It
   could be a virus, or something else that breaks tolerance and induces
   the autoimmune process. What we do know is that we have a strong
   indication that SPS is an autoimmune disease. As a result, we may be
   able to propose and test additional autoimmune modulators."

   The Bayer Corporation and Crescent Health donated part of the IVIg used
   in the study.
