                   Registration of Designs of Vessel Hulls

     The Vessel Hull Design Protection Act, Title 17, Chapter 13 of the
     United States Code, was signed into law on October 28, 1998,
     providing for protection for original designs of vessel hulls. The
     new law grants an owner of an original vessel hull design certain
     exclusive rights provided that application for registration of the
     design with the Copyright Office is made within two years of the
     design being made public. Protection is afforded only to vessel hull
     designs embodied in actual vessel hulls that are publicly exhibited,
     publicly distributed, or offered for sale or sold to the public on
     or after October 28, 1998. The Copyright Office has promulgated
     interim regulations for registration of vessel hull designs.

     Registration of a vessel hull design must be made on a Form D-VH. A
     continuation sheet, Form D-VH/CON, may be used if additional space
     is required. In order to be considered for registration, a submitted
     application must include the following elements: (1) a completed and
     signed Form D-VH; (2) deposit material identifying the design or
     designs for which registration is sought; and (3) the appropriate
     fee. The basic application fee for each design is $75.

     The deposit material may consist of either drawings or photographs
     of the design. Because the drawings or photographs constitute the
     entire visual disclosure of the design, they should be clear and
     complete, and include a sufficient number of views so that the
     appearance of the design is adequately shown. Please consult the
     "Basic Information" section of Form D-VH for the requirements for
     deposit material.

     A single application may be used for more than one design embodied
     in the same vessel provided that the information contained in all
     spaces of the application other than the information describing the
     design is the same for each design. See the instructions for Space 2
     on Form D-VH and use Form D-VH/CON. The basic application fee for
     each design included in the application is $75.

     The effective date of a vessel hull design registration is the date
     on which the Copyright Office publishes notice of the registration.
     Notice of registration will be published on the Copyright Office
     website, and registrations may be viewed, in reverse chronological
     order, by clicking here.

     Although design protection and copyright protection under title 17
     of the United States Code are both administered by the Register of
     Copyrights, they are not identical. Design protection differs
     significantly in most respects, including term of protection,
     ownership, eligibility, scope of protection and registration
     procedures. While some designs that are eligible for design
     protection may also be eligible for copyright protection, design
     registration does not include a copyright registration. Copyright
     registration must be made separately.

     Design protection under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act is not
     available, and registration may not be made, for designs that have
     received patent protection under title 35 of the United States Code.

     When a design protected under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act
     is publicly exhibited, publicly distributed, or offered for sale or
     sold to the public, a design notice should appear on the vessel in
     the manner set forth in section 212.4 of the interim regulations.
     The notice may contain, in place of the name of the owner of the
     design, a distinctive identification of the owner if the distinctive
     identification has been recorded with the Copyright Office.
