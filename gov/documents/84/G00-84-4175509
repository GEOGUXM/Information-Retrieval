   IHS Diabetes Program April, 2001 Preface Welcome to AUDIT01! If you are
   already familiar with the IHS Diabetes Chart Audit process, read the
   information below for a brief summary of this year's changes followed
   on the next page by quick-start directions. More detailed instructions
   for any of the steps are available on the pages referred to in
   parentheses. If you have not previously participated in the annual
   Diabetes Audit, please take time to read carefully through Sections 1-9
   before beginning your audit activities. What's new in AUDIT01? U New
   items Two optional demographic items have been added for your
   convenience: * Tribal Affiliation * Community (for further information
   on both of these items, see Section 7). No new clinical elements have
   been added to the audit this year. UModified items PAP SMEAR: Choice 3
   was changed from "Unknown" to "Refused" on the audit form, to match the
   listed choices in prior audit years. UNew report A Cardiovascular
   Disease Report, describing cardiovascular risk status and risk
   reduction opportunities, is now available (see Section 14 for further
   details). U A note on Epi Info Epi Info 2000, the Windows version of
   Epi Info, is now available. HOWEVER, for the FY 2001 diabetes chart
   audit, we will continue to use the most recent DOS versions of Epi Info
   (6.04b-to-c or 6.04d). Epi Info 2000 has many nice features. It also is
   more complex, requires faster computers, takes up more space (the
   install program uses the equivalent of 27 diskettes in contrast to 3
   for the DOS version), and at present there are an insufficient number
   of individuals trained in the new program to provide adequate technical
   support. You are welcome, even encouraged, to download Epi Info 2000
   and begin to learn its features, but keep in mind that the AUDIT01
   files were written for the DOS version of Epi Info, and they are not
   entirely compatible with the Windows version. (See Appendix D for
   information on upgrading Epi Info). 2 Quick Start Directions: 1. Check
   with your Area Diabetes Consultant to see if an Area-wide Local Option
   Question has been developed. If a local option question will be used,
   print it onto the audit form (refer to pg 12). 2. Select in random
   fashion the appropriate number of charts to review (pg 6-8). 3. Review
   the audit form, definitions and criteria with all chart reviewers (pg
   9-11). 4. Perform the chart audit. If a PC is available to you, you may
   proceed through the following steps. Confirm that your computer has an
   upgraded version of Epi Info (i.e., version 6.04c or 6.04d) that
   permits dates with 4 digit years. If necessary, refer to Appendix D
   Upgrading Epi Info. 5. Load the files from the AUDIT01 package into the
   computer subdirectory that contains Epi Info, usually \EPI6 (pg 15,
   step 1). 6. Enter the audit data into the AUDIT01.REC file, by going to
   Epi Info's ENTER Program and typing in AUDIT01 when prompted for the
   name of the data (.REC) file (pg 15, step 4). 7. If a Local Option
   question was used, modify the report file to correctly display the
   results. This is done by making changes to the AUDIT01.RPT file (pg 13,
   bottom half). 8. Print out a summary report by entering Epi's ANALYSIS
   program, typing READ AUDIT01, pressing to send the report to your
   printer, and then typing RUN AUDIT01 (pg 16, section 13). 9. A
   supplemental Renal Preservation Report can be printed in a similar
   fashion: begin at Epi's main menu, enter the ANALYSIS program, type
   READ AUDIT01, press to send the report to your printer, then type RUN
   RENAL2K (pg 17, section 14). 10. Forward a copy of your data file (.REC
   file) to your Area diabetes consultant. 3 Instructions for Assessment
   of Diabetes Care and Health Status 2001 1. INTRODUCTION The
   instructions that follow describe a standardized method for assessing
   the diabetes care and the health status of diabetes patients at your
   facility. Using a unifor m process and standardized definitions
   provides consistency as you monitor patient care patterns over time. It
   allows valid comparison of your facility with other IHS, tribal and
   urban facilities. During the chart audit, diabetes care is compared to
   the IHS Standards of Care for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (see
   Appendix B). Instructions for sample size calculations, selecting
   charts for the audit, and standard definitions for each item are given
   on the next few pages. Additional assistance, if necessary, can be
   obtained from your Area Diabetes Consultant. 2. CHART AUDITS FOR
   QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES For any facility to
   provide quality diabetes care, on-going self-assessment and improvement
   activities are necessary. A number of techniques or methods to pursue
   improvement may be employed. A central feature of each of these systems
   is some form of an improvement cycle: Surveillance Implementation
   Identification of a Problem Plan for Improvement With respect to
   diabetes, the basic questions to be answered are straightforward: "Are
   we doing those things that we agreed were important for maximizing the
   health of our patients with diabetes?" and "Are there ways that we
   could do better?" Getting accurate and reliable answers is more
   complex, of course, but the diabetes audit program is designed to make
   it easier to do just that. The IHS Diabetes Program recommends annual
   or more frequent medical record review to monitor care patterns and
   changes over time at your facility. You should select in a random
   manner a large enough sample of medical records so that you can be
   reasonably certain that observed changes are significant and not just
   due to chance (see sections 4 and 5). All of the indicators on the
   audit form, which reflect compliance with the Standards of Care for
   Patients with Type 2 Diabetes, should be completed as outlined in
   section 6. The staff at your facility may be asked to participate in
   the audit process. While this process may seem tedious at first, many
   providers have found that participating in the chart audit provides a
   review of the standards of care for diabetes and identifies trends in
   diabetes care at their facility. Through the audit, the providers often
   have a better idea of what changes they can make to improve the outcome
   for people who suffer from this potentially devastating disease. Once
   the chart audit is complete, the data may be entered into the Epi Info
   program, from which you can easily print a summary report. The report
   shows the percentage of charts having documentation of compliance with
   each of the indicators. Your Area Diabetes Consultant can assist you in
   obtaining reports and comparison data. In addition, your Area Diabetes
   Consultant can assist you in identifying program strengths and
   deficiencies. Facilities are encouraged to review the recommendations
   in a team setting, establish priorities together, and develop an action
   plan with a timetable for re-evaluation. 3. ADAPTING THE DIABETES CHART
   AUDIT TO MEET JCAHO/AAAHC REQUIREMENTS The health care environment
   continues to evolve, both within and outside of IHS. In keeping with
   recent changes, both Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
   Organizations (JCAHO) and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory
   Health Care (AAAHC) emphasize patient centered, performance-based
   evaluations. Health centers are asked to demonstrate the efficacy and
   appropriateness of the care they provide. JCAHO and AAAHC both seek to
   determine whether a health facility is actually carrying out those
   functions that reasonably can be expected to improve the health of the
   patients they serve. If JCAHO or AAAHC accreditation is important to
   your facility, you will be pleased to find that the diabetes audit
   process described here can serve as an excellent example of the type of
   performance oriented clinical self-assessment and improvement activity
   that both of these organization require. The diabetes audit is based on
   consensus-derived standards of care. These standards are reviewed
   regularly and then widely disseminated. The audit looks at your
   facility's actual performance on a number of key processes that are
   known to (or considered likely to) improve the health of people with
   diabetes. Outcome measures, such as blood pressure control and glycemic
   control, are also monitored. Because the diabetes audit is designed to
   be performed on a regular basis, it can be extremely useful in
   documenting performance trends that JCAHO or AAAHC find of interest.
   Additionally, when the diabetes audit results are routinely
   incorporated into multidisciplinary diabetes care planning activities,
   they provide a clear illustration of interdepartmental coordination to
   improve patient care. Table 1 - Sample Size Calculations (see next page
   for explanation) Sample size needed to be 90% or 95% certain that the
   rate you find is within 10% or within 5% of the true rate, for
   populations up to 2000. Population 90% Certainty 95% Certainty (# of DM

   Recommended 7 4. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS The number of charts you will
   need to select depends on the number of active patients in your
   diabetes register. Table 1 on the previous page outlines the minimum
   number of charts you will need to audit to be reasonably sure (90%
   confident) that a 10% difference noted from a previous or subsequent
   audit is a real change and not just due to chance. If, for example,
   your facility has 1000 active patients with diabetes, you will need to
   audit a total of 63 charts (see Table 1). The diabetes register will
   often include people who are not considered active patients of the
   clinic and thus do not need to be audited. These charts should be
   identified early in the audit process and excluded. Table 2 outlines
   the charts which are to be included and excluded. Table 2 Patients to
   Include and Exclude in the Chart Audit
   _______________________________________________________________________
   _____ Include patients who: * Attend regular clinics or diabetes
   clinics. * Refuse care or have special motivational problems (e.g.,
   alcoholism). * Are not attending clinic, but you do not know if they
   have moved or have found another source of care. Exclude patients who:
   * Receive primarily referral or contract care, paid by IHS * Have
   arranged other MD care, paid with non-IHS monies. * Receive their
   primary care at another IHS or Tribal health facility. * Live in a
   jail, and receive care there. * Live in a nursing home, and receive
   care there. * Attend a dialysis unit (if on-site dialysis not
   available) * Have gestational diabetes. * Have impaired glucose
   tolerance (IFG or IGT) only. * Have moved -- permanently or temporarily
   (should be documented) * You are unable to contact, defined as 3 tries
   in 12 months (should be documented in the chart). * Have died. Keep in
   mind that unless your diabetes register is frequently updated, up to
   10% of the people in the diabetes registry may not qualify to be
   included in the audit. To make sure you have an adequate sample at the
   end of the audit, increase the chart sample by at least 10%. In the
   example of 63 charts used above, this would mean an additional 6
   charts, or a total of 69, would need to be pulled for the audit. 8 5.
   CHART SELECTION The systematic random sampling technique will provide
   the best representative sample for audit. This is done in the following
   fashion: Suppose you need to select 69 charts from a registry list of
   1000 patients. First, divide 1000 by 69, which yields the number 14.4.
   You now know that you must select one chart out of fourteen. However,
   don't automatically start with the first person. Use any method of
   random chance to determine which one of the first 14 people on the list
   should be selected. Use your imagination... Number 14 pieces of paper
   with 1 through 14 and have someone draw one, or simply ask someone to
   pick a number between 1 and 14. Then use that number to select your
   first name for chart audit. Proceed through the entire list, selecting
   every 14th person on the list. Please note that it is important to
   track down the charts which are missing from Medical Records as these
   are likely to belong to patients who have been seen recently and have
   high compliance with the Standards of Care. 6. COMPLETING THE AUDIT
   FORM Using the instructions that follow, review the medical record to
   see if each of the indicators are satisfied. If you cannot find a
   result in the chart, then for the purposes of the audit, apply the old
   dictum, "If it is not documented, it did not happen." Finally, please
   remember that all medical records are confidential documents and need
   to be handled accordingly. 9 7. QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF DIABETES CARE,

   question carefully and then select the appropriate response. (For more
   information on the Local Option Question, see Section 8). 13 8. LOCAL
   OPTION QUESTION Areas and facilities have the ability to formulate
   their own supplemental audit question, if desired. This permits each
   Area to analyze an additional aspect of diabetes care that may be of
   special interest, or to "test run" a question that might be a useful
   future addition to the national diabetes audit. The procedure for
   developing and incorporating a local option question is explained
   below. Although separate facilities within an Area may not necessarily
   be required to use the same question, it is highly recommended that
   this be discussed and coordinated with your Area Diabetes Consultant.
   The first step is to develop a question that can be answered through a
   review of individual medical charts. The question can relate to
   demographics (Indian blood quantum, location of residence, etc), a
   particular aspect of care (examinations, lab studies, other
   medications, and so forth), co-morbid condition (history of stroke or
   MI, for example), a clinic related parameter (such as the number of
   visits in the preceding month or year), or other auditable element of
   interest. The local option question needs to be posed in a multiple
   choice format. The choices may be as simple as 'Yes' or 'No', or may
   have many possible answers. There can be up to 9 choices, although for
   ease of answering and reporting it is usually best to limit choices to
   no more than 4 or 5. Each choice needs to have an assigned number, just
   like other parts of the audit. After the question and response choices
   are formulated, print or type them onto the lower righthand side of the
   audit form. If there is insufficient room, a separate sheet can be
   stapled to the audit form. Be sure to precede each choice with its
   associated one-digit number. Data entry for a local option question is
   easy. A special "Local Option" field is provided at the very end of the
   audit, and is clearly identified on the data entry screen. Responses
   from the audit form can be entered there in the same manner as all
   other data is entered. LL Modifying the Report File In order for the
   results of the local option question to appear in the final printed
   report, it must be included in the report file (AUDIT01.RPT). To do
   this, first assure that all the AUDIT01 files are loaded into the Epi
   Info subdirectory (if necessary, refer to section 9 for directions).
   Then use the following steps to place the local option question into
   the report file: 1. From Epi Info's main menu, press (Open). An "Edit a
   file" box will appear and prompt you for a Name. Type AUDIT01.RPT . The
   AUDIT01.RPT file will appear. 2. Press the key 9-10 times, or use the
   down-arrow (9) key to get to the last part of the AUDIT01.RPT file. You
   will see the line *#USES LOCAL. Delete the asterisk (*) from the
   beginning of the line. 3. Immediately below the #USES LOCAL line,
   substitute your question for the sample question, being careful not to
   go beyond mid-page. Use multiple lines if necessary. Delete the
   asterisk (*) from the beginning of each line that you use. 14 4. Type
   in each of the possible responses, again substituting for the sample
   answers. Be sure to delete the initial asterisk (*), but only on the
   lines that are actually used. Lines with an initial asterisk remain
   "invisible" when printing the report (If you wish, any extra lines may
   be deleted by placing the cursor anywhere on the line and pressing -
   y). 5. Check the alignment of the bracketed numbers to the right of the
   responses. Add or delete spaces until the first brackets of the
   bracketed numbers line up in a vertical column. 6. Press to save these
   changes, then to return to the main menu. 7. The report file has now
   been modified to give the results of your local option question. Enter
   your audit data if you have not already done so (refer to section 10),
   "clean" your data (optional, see section 11) and then print your
   customized summary report(s) (sections 12 and 13). 9. INSTRUCTIONS FOR
   AUDIT01 DATA ENTRY These instructions assume your computer uses the A:
   drive to receive your audit diskette, and that Epi lnfo is loaded onto
   hard drive C: in a subdirectory named EPI6, as this is most often the
   case. If this is not the case in your particular situation, you will
   need to modify the instructions accordingly. For example, if you are
   using an old computer in which the diskette goes into a B: drive,
   substitute "B:" for "A:" when typing the commands below. 1. Insert the
   AUDIT01 diskette into your A: drive. Copy all the audit files into the
   Epi Info program by typing: COPY A:*.* C:\EPI6 2. Start the Epi Info
   program in the usual way (from your computer's main menu or by going to
   the \EPI6 subdirectory and then typing EPI6). 3. If you chose not to
   audit one or more of the elective items, these items should be removed
   from the data entry screens. To do this, begin at Epi Info's main menu.
   Press (Open). An "Edit a file" box will appear and prompt you for a
   Name. Type AUDIT01.CHK . The AUDIT01.CHK file will appear on the
   screen. You will notice that each of the elective items has its own
   HIDE line, preceded by an asterisk. Delete the asterisk from each line
   containing an item that you did not audit (i.e., use the arrow keys to
   place the cursor under the asterisk, then press the key). When
   finished, press to save the changes, then to return to Epi Info's main
   menu. 4. When the Epi Info menu appears, select Programs, then "ENTER
   data". When the program asks for the ____.REC file, type: AUDIT01
   followed by 1 and then Y . The data entry form will appear on the
   screen. 5. Enter your data into the program. You can set the "NumLock"
   button on your keyboard to "on", and enter most of the data using the
   keyboard pad. Note several features: Automatic jumps: Where
   appropriate, the computer will automatically skip certain sections. For
   instance, it skips "Pap smear" if the patient is a male. 15 Must Enter:
   Certain items, such as audit date, service unit, number of active
   patients in the registry, and patient's sex are required by the audit
   program. You must enter data for these items. However, after the
   initial record, most of these items will be automatically entered for
   you, and only need to be re-entered if their value changes. Automatic
   calculations: The program automatically calculates several items for
   you. For example, you can enter the height in feet and inches and the
   program will calculate the total height in inches. If you already have
   the height in inches, you may enter that under "inches". Other items
   automatically calculated include patient's age, duration of diabetes,
   BMI, mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure. Data entry
   messages: The program will give you an error message if you enter a
   value that is outside of the expected range for that field. If your
   entry is clearly incorrect it may erase what you entered and require
   you to re-enter the value. At other times it merely asks you to double
   check to be sure that your entry was what you intended. 6. MAKE A
   BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATA!!! It's a good idea to make a backup copy of
   your audit file EVERY TIME you finish entering data. This can save you
   considerable time and grief if something should happen to your original
   data. You can easily make a backup by copying your data back onto the
   same diskette that contained the original AUDIT01 programs. To do this,
   exit the Epi Info program, get to any DOS prompt (such as C:\>) and
   type the following command: COPY C:\EPI6\AUDIT01.REC A:\.REC You can
   name anything you wish (up to 8 characters). If you call it
   "AUDIT01.REC", the program will write your data over the empty data
   file on the diskette, which is fine. 10. "CLEANING" YOUR DATA An
   optional program, CLEAN01, is available if you wish to scan your data
   for possible inadvertent data entry errors. The main AUDIT01 program is
   designed to identify and permit correction of many errors at the time
   of data entry, but nevertheless some may occur. The CLEAN01 program
   creates a number of error-checking tables or lists. It begins by
   producing frequency tables on items that should have only a single
   answer per facility (such as the number of active patients on the
   diabetes registry, the name of the facility, or the codes for the Area
   and Service Unit). It also produces a listing by chart number of
   records having values that are atypical or outside of the usual range
   for a given item. These listings may or may not represent actual
   errors, but may be reviewed for accuracy. To "clean" your data, go to
   Epi Info's main menu and select ANALYSIS from the listing of Programs.
   Put your data file into the ANALYSIS program by typing at the EPI>
   prompt: READ AUDIT01.REC Next, turn on your printer, then press the key
   to send output to the printer [Note: you can skip this step if you wish
   and have the results appear only on screen, although most people find
   it easier to have a printout in hand]. Now, type at the EPI> prompt:
   RUN CLEAN01 16 11. PRINTING A SUMMARY REPORT You will probably want to
   print a report after entering and (optionally) cleaning your data.
   [Note: Before printing, if you entered data on a Local Option Question,
   you should first modify the AUDIT01.RPT file so that the results of
   your question appear on the report -- see bottom of pg 10]. To print a
   report, go to Epi Info's main menu and select ANALYSIS from the listing
   of Programs. Put your data file into the ANALYSIS program by typing:
   READ AUDIT01.REC Next turn on your printer, then press the key. A
   message should appear that says "ROUTE PRINTER", meaning that the
   output from the ANALYSIS program will be sent to your printer (if you
   wish to have the output appear only on your computer screen, skip this
   step). Finally, type: RUN AUDIT01.PGM The computer will immediately
   begin to analyze your data, and will then print the report (or simply
   display it on your screen, if you did not push ). 12. PRINTING A
   SUMMARY REPORT IN THE "OLD" FORMAT If you want to make a direct
   comparison of your 2001 audit results with those of prior years, you
   may wish to print a summary report in the format used earlier for
   glucose and BP control categories. To print a report that lists the
   blood glucose control categories and blood pressure control categories
   in the "old" format, make a simple modification to the AUDIT01.PGM
   file. You delete a single asterisk. The modification can be easily made
   from Epi's ANALYSIS program: At the EPI6> prompt, type: EDIT
   AUDIT01.PGM The AUDIT01.PGM file will appear on the screen. On line 23
   (which may appear as the last line on the initial screen), you will see
   the statement *GOTO OLDREPORT. Delete the asterisk from the beginning
   of the line, then press to save the modified file. Press to return to
   ANALYSIS, and then follow the instructions outlined earlier in Section
   11 to print a report. Please note that if you have already run a
   report, you must re-READ your .REC file in order to produce an accurate
   summary report in the "old" format. 17 13. THE RENAL PRESERVATION
   REPORT A supplemental audit report, referred to as the Renal
   Preservation Report, is available to you. It provides more detail
   regarding diabetic kidney disease screening and treatment efforts at
   your facility. To print the Renal Preservation Report, go back to Epi
   Info's main menu and then select ANALYSIS from the list of Programs.
   (It is important to do this, even if you were already in ANALYSIS, as
   it "resets" certain variables). At the EPI> prompt, type: READ AUDIT01
   Press if you wish the output to go to the printer, or skip this step if
   you want it to go to your computer screen only. At the next EPI>
   prompt, type: RUN RENAL01 The Renal Preservation Report will now be
   printed (or will appear only on your screen, if you did not push ). 14.
   THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE REPORT Beginning this year an additional
   supplemental audit report, the Cardiovascular Disease Report, is also
   available. The report helps identify and target opportunities to
   decrease the risks for cardiovascular disease in your patients with
   diabetes. To print the Cardiovascular Disease Report, go to Epi Info's
   main menu and select ANALYSIS from the list of Programs. (It is
   important to do this, even if you were already in ANALYSIS, as it
   "resets" certain variables). At the EPI> prompt, type: READ AUDIT01
   Press if you wish the output to go to the printer, or skip this step if
   you want it to go to your computer screen only. At the next EPI>
   prompt, type: RUN CVD01 The Cardiovascular Disease Report will now be
   printed (or will appear only on your screen, if you did not push ). 18

   Diabetes April, 2001 The Standards of Care for Type 2 diabetes have
   been developed and updated by the IHS National Diabetes Program to help
   provide consistent, quality care to patients with diabetes. 1. Baseline
   Studies Height- Measure once and record on PCC Health Summary. If PCC
   is not available, record on diabetes flowsheet. For children <18 years
   of age, height and weight should be recorded at each visit. Use to
   calculate body mass index and ideal or reasonable body weight. Date of
   Diabetes Diagnosis - Record on PCC Health Summary. If PCC is not
   available, record on diabetes flowsheet. Longer duration of diabetes
   correlates with increased risk of complications. ECG - Obtain baseline
   then repeat every 1-5 years as clinically indicated (for those age 40
   and above, or with diabetes duration over 10 years, every 1-2 years is
   recommended). PPD - Should be documented once after diagnosis of
   diabetes (Offer INH prophylaxis to patients according to protocol
   refer to Section 9). 2. Each Clinic Visit Blood Pressure - Target BP is
   < 130/80. Additional protection against complications, including renal
   failure, may be obtained by lowering BP further. Weight - Compare with
   measurements from prior visits to identify trends. Blood Glucose -
   Results of lab determinations and self-monitoring should be available
   for timely discussion with the patient. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 3-4
   month intervals. ! Fasting/casual glucose measurement and
   self-monitoring records should be available for timely discussion with
   the patient at each visit. Self-monitoring BG records are vital to
   diabetes management decisions. ! Determine if HbA1c has been performed
   within the past 3-4 months, and order if due. Patients in acceptable
   glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%) should be tested at least every 6
   months. HbA1c estimates the average degree of glycemic control over the
   preceding 3 months. HbA1c is the standard way to measure glycemic
   control. ! HbA1c results should be discussed with the patient at the
   time of the patient visit. If in-house measurement is unavailable,
   blood sample should be obtained several days before the clinic visit.
   At each clinic visit, the appropriate education, intervention,
   referral, and or follow-up will be provided as indicated. Foot Check -
   Inspection of feet and nails. Check for ingrown toenails, calluses,
   deformities, pressure points, ulcers, and cellulitis. 3. Annual
   Creatinine - Screen for renal insufficiency. Complete
   UA/Microalbuminuria - A test for urine protein should be performed
   yearly. If negative, a screening test for microalbuminuria should be
   performed (by A/C ratio or dipstick test). Dipstick-positive
   microalbuminuria should be confirmed on a separate specimen using an
   A/C ratio (abnormal >30mg/gm) or 24 hour urine. ACE inhibitors should
   be considered in patients with microalbuminuria or proteinuria, even if
   normotensive. Lipid Profile Risk factors for atherosclerosis include
   LDL >100, HDL <40 in men and <45 in women, and TG >200. Even lower LDL
   and TG values represent increased risk in persons with previously
   documented atherosclerosis. These risk factors, especially elevated
   LDL, should be treated aggressively. Caution should be used when
   considering agents that aggravate hyperglycemia. A lipid panel should
   be performed annually (TC, LDL, HDL, TG). Consider direct LDL
   measurements, especially if TG >250 or if the specimen is to be
   obtained non-fasting. Elevated TC, LDL, TG and low HDL confer greater
   risk for atherosclerosis. Optimal LDL cholesterol levels for adults
   with diabetes are <100. All patients with LDL >100 require medical
   nutrition therapy and other lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic
   intervention is recommended if dietary interventions and lifestyle
   modifications are ineffective in lowering LDL to <100. Aspirin Therapy
   - Aspirin has been used as a primary and secondary prevention strategy
   to prevent cardiovascular events. Men and women with diabetes have a
   2-4 fold increase in risk of dying from complications of cardiovascular
   disease (CVD). Aspirin in doses of 162-325 mg/day is recommended for
   patients with diabetes. Strongly consider aspirin therapy as a primary
   prevention strategy in high risk men and women age 30 and above with
   diabetes. This includes individuals with family history of CVD,
   cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, albuminuria and dyslipidemia.
   Use aspirin therapy as a secondary prevention strategy in diabetic men
   and women who have evidence of large vessel disease, such as history of
   MI, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, claudication or angina. Eye
   Exam - Retinal exam through dilated pupils or fundus photo. Individuals
   with type 1 diabetes should receive an initial exam within 3-5 years of
   diagnosis once they are > 10 years of age. People with type 2 diabetes
   should receive an initial exam at diagnosis and yearly thereafter.
   Dental Exam - Annual screen for periodontal disease and other oral
   pathology. Foot Exam - Risk assessment to include pulse check and
   sensory evaluation with monofilament, identification of foot deformity,
   and documentation of history of foot ulcers. Screen for Neuropathy - By
   history and physical; include sensory, motor and autonomic evaluation.
   4. Immunizations and Skin Tests Flu Vaccine - Yearly Pneumovax -
   Vaccinate everyone at the time of diagnosis. Revaccination should be
   strongly considered five (5) years after the first dose for those
   patients at highest risk of fatal pneumococcal infection (e.g.,
   asplenic patients) or those at highest risk of rapid decline in
   antibody levels (e.g., those with chronic renal failure, nephrotic
   syndrome, or transplanted organs). Revaccinate all patients > age 65
   years if it has been >5 years since initial vaccination. Td - Every 10
   years. Hepatitis B - Vaccinate persons whose renal disease is likely to
   lead to dialysis or transplantation (serum creatinine > 2.0). PPD -
   Once after diagnosis unless known positive. PPD-positive people with
   diabetes, including AI/AN with Type 2 diabetes, have 5 times the risk
   of reactivating TB. All diabetic patients with positive PPD including
   those over age 35 should be given INH chemoprophylaxis according to
   current guidelines (see Section 9). 5. Special Aspects of Diabetes Care
   Lab Tests - C-peptide, the other half of pro-insulin, can evaluate a
   patient's endogenous insulin secretion and help distinguish between
   Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The test can be useful in at least two
   clinical situations: 1. Solving a clinical problem about using oral
   agents vs. insulin. 2. Evaluating a patient with history of
   ketoacidosis when stable (useful in setting of ETOH, acidosis, and
   diabetes to determine ongoing need for insulin). 6. Self-Care Education
   - Use of the PCC education codes to document education is encouraged.
   Nutrition Education - Meal planning, nutrition education, and exercise
   are the primary treatment strategies for Type 2 diabetes. The Indian
   Health Service Diabetes Program supports the American Diabetes
   Association position that all persons with diabetes receive regular
   nutrition counseling and are seen by an RD/nutritionist every six
   months to 1 year. Some people may require more frequent evaluation and
   counseling. Diabetes Education - All patients with diabetes and their
   families should have diabetes self-care information. The National
   Standards for Diabetes Care and Patient Education provide guidelines
   for education program development with criteria specific for AI/AN
   health care facilities. Every facility should work towards providing
   systematic mechanisms to make culturally relevant self-care information
   available for patients. Exercise Education - Exercise is associated
   with improvement in both short- and long-term metabolic control.
   Exercise counseling should be provided to all persons with diabetes.
   The appropriate type of activity, including frequency, duration, and
   intensity, should be individualized for each patient. Education and
   Glycemic Control ! Self monitoring results should be discussed with the
   patient at each visit. ! HbA1c results should be discussed with the
   patient within 2 weeks of the test, preferably at the patient visit.
   Self-Blood Glucose Monitoring (SBGM) - The purpose of SBGM is to
   determine the pattern of blood glucose throughout the day. This pattern
   provides information for selection and adjustments in therapy.
   Frequency of monitoring must be individualized and may vary as
   day-to-day circumstances require. 7. Routine Health Maintenance
   Physical Exam Complete exam as baseline, then routine. Pap Smear/Pelvic
   Exam Yearly Breast Exam Yearly Mammogram Every 1-2 years in women ages
   40-49, yearly thereafter. Rectal Exam/Stool Guaiac Yearly in adults >
   40 years of age. Tobacco Use Current tobacco use should be documented
   and a referral made for cessation of tobacco use. 8. Pregnancy and
   Diabetes All women who are in their childbearing years should receive
   pre-pregnancy counseling for optimizing metabolic control prior to
   conception. Counseling for family planning is essential to achieve this
   goal. American Indian women are at increased risk for developing
   gestational diabetes (GDM), as are women with certain other risk
   factors, including but not limited to the following: * previous
   gestational diabetes * obesity * previous fetal macrosomia * insulin
   resistance syndrome * unexplained stillbirth * polycystic ovarian
   syndrome (PCOS) * congenital anomaly * family history of diabetes These
   women should be screened for GDM early in pregnancy. If early screening
   is negative, the screen should be repeated at 24-28 weeks gestation.
   Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
   (about one third of all AI/AN women with GDM will develop diabetes
   within 5 years). These women should be re-tested by OGTT at least 6-12
   weeks post delivery to determine their glycemic status. Women with a
   normal postpartum OGTT should be re-tested every 1-3 years. Bear in
   mind that diagnostic standards for diabetes in breastfeeding women have
   not been established. Blood glucose should be monitored in the
   postpartum and lactating period, including regular self blood glucose
   testing, as clinically appropriate. All women with a history of GDM
   should receive counseling/education regarding lifestyle modifications
   that will reduce or delay the development of type 2 diabetes. Moreover,
   the importance of maintaining optimal glucose control prior to and
   during any subsequent pregnancy should be stressed. Mothers should be
   made aware that children of GDM pregnancies should be monitored for
   obesity and abnormalities of glucose utilization. Further
   recommendations and guidelines for the screening, diagnosis and
   treatment of GDM may be found in the most recent Clinical Practice
   Recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (published
   annually), Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy, 3rd Edition (ADA),
   2000, and Metzger BE, Coustan DR (Eds.): Proceedings of the Fourth
   International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
   Diabetes Care 21 (Suppl. 2): B1-B167, 1998 9. Tuberculosis and Diabetes
   Patients* A-positive PPD skin test (i.e., >10 mm in duration 48-72
   hours after administration) means that a person either has latent
   tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or active tuberculosis (TB) disease.
   Active TB disease needs to be ruled out prior to starting patients with
   LTBI on treatment. Treatment for active TB and LTBI are different*.
   Patients with diabetes and LTBI are at high risk of progressing to
   active TB, if they are not treated for LTBI. Studies have shown that
   the risk is 2 to 6 times greater than in patients without diabetes.
   Other factors that further increase the risk for TB include: recent PPD
   conversion within 2 years, intravenous drug use, chest film showing
   prior active disease that was never treated, immunosuppressive drugs,
   and ESRD. Cutaneous anergy increases as patients age and develop
   complications of diabetes such as ESRD. Anergy may lead to false
   negative PPD test results. *Recommendations for targeted tuberculin
   testing and treatment of LTBI in MMWR, June 09, 2000/ 49(RR06); 1-54 or
   at www.cdc.gov/mmwr//indrr_2000.html Or at: Treatment for active TB
   disease is detailed in: CDC Core Curriculum in TB: What the Clinician
   Should Know. CDC, 2000 (4th edition). In most cases progression of LTBI
   to active TB can be prevented by treatment with INH. In general,
   patients with diabetes who have a positive PPD (accurately read by a
   provider trained in interpretation of PPD) should receive treatment for
   LTBI, except in the following circumstances: * severe liver disease *
   suicidal ideation * adverse reaction to INH. Patients receiving
   treatment for LTBI should be followed and monitored for potential
   hepatotoxicity. While national recommendations emphasize monitoring
   hepatotoxicity through systematic repetitive patient education and
   clinical evaluation for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, baseline
   measurement of liver function tests and after one month should be
   considered, especially in patients receiving other potentially
   heptotoxic medications. Some experts recommend that INH be discontinued
   if transaminase levels exceed three times the upper limit of normal
   when associated with symptoms or five times the upper limit of normal
   if the patient is asymptomatic. IHS TB Protocol for Patients with
   Diabetes: * Check the PPD status of all patients with diabetes. * If
   the PPD status is negative or unknown: - PPD testing should be done
   within one year of initial work up for diabetes diagnoses, and treated
   if they have LTBI. - If no PPD has been placed since the diagnosis of
   diabetes, and the patient's PPD status is negative or unknown, a PPD
   status needs to be ascertained. - Subsequent PPD testing is done only
   if there is contact with an active TB case. * If the PPD status is
   positive: - Check for completion of past treatment for active TB or
   LTBI (6-9 months of INH for LTBI or multiple drug therapy for active
   disease). - If the patient has not been adequately treated, search for
   active disease by history (weight loss, etc), fever (record
   temperature) and recent chest x-ray (within 6 months). If there is no
   evidence of active disease, recommend treatment for LTBI (9 mos. of INH
   300 mg daily) to all patients with diabetes, regardless of age, unless
   the patient has liver disease, suicide ideation or a previous adverse
   reaction to INH. Patients with diabetes should be given pyridoxine
   (10-50 mg/day) with their INH. Consider directly observed therapy of
   LTBI when possible, especially for patients on dialysis. APPENDIX C
   Technical Notes IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit FY2001 This
   document is intended to accompany the 2001 audit summary report. The
   report contains data on diabetes-related care, and the health status of
   American Indians and Alaska Natives with diabetes who receive care from
   IHS, Tribal or Urban health facilities. The data is obtained from an
   annual chart audit conducted under the auspices of the IHS Diabetes
   Program. A random sample is drawn from the health facility's list of
   active diabetic patients in sufficient number to provide an estimate
   "10% of the true rate. Summary reports from each Area and for all IHS
   Areas are weighted by the size of the diabetic population of the health
   facility or Area, respectively. The percentages reported represent
   either the proportion of the sample population having a particular
   attribute, in the case of demographic data, or the percentage in
   compliance with a specific standard of care*. The reported rates are
   calculated using the total audit sample as the denominator for each of
   the standards, with the following exceptions: Standard or Test
   Denominator Tobacco cessation counseling All current tobacco users.
   Chronic aspirin use All individuals age 30. ECG All individuals age 30.
   Pap smear All females. Creatinine 2.0 All individuals who had
   creatinine tested in the past year. Microalbuminuria All individuals
   who had a urinalysis in the past year and no proteinuria by standard
   dipstick. Definitions Eye Exam: A dilated fundoscopic exam conducted by
   a primary care provider, optometrist or ophthalmologist, or a dilated
   fundoscopic photograph. Foot Exam: An examination of the feet that
   includes neurologic and vascular evaluation as well as visual
   inspection for deformities or lesions. Dental Exam: The dental
   examination is one that includes evaluation of the teeth (if present),
   gingiva and mucosal surfaces. ___________________ *IHS Standards of

   Diabetes Audit Page 2 Glycemic Control: Based on last HbA1c level, if
   one was recorded in the past year. If no HbA1c was recorded, then based
   on the average of the last 3 blood glucoses drawn within the past year.
   For records without an HbA1c value, the mean blood glucose is converted
   to the analogous HbA1c level, using the formula: HbA1c = Mean BS +
   60.16 30.9 Be aware that in the audit reports from 1998 and earlier,
   mean blood glucose values were not converted to HbA1c values. Instead,
   glycemic control categories included separtate HbA1c and blood glucose
   ranges, as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Glycemic Control Categories ("Old"
   Format) Control level HbA1c Mean BG Acceptable #7.5 #165 Fair 7.6 -10.0
   166-250 High 10.1-12.0 251-340 Very high >12.0 >340 Blood Pressure
   Control: Based on the mean of the last 3 blood pressure determinations
   taken within the preceding 12 months. Under the new format, there are 5
   BP categories, ranging from "Ideal" (<120/<80) to "Markedly poor"
   (160/95 or greater). Under the "old" format, hypertension was defined
   as systolic BP 140 or diastolic BP 90, and severe hypertension was
   defined as systolic BP 160 or diastolic BP 95. PPD Status: A negative
   PPD is considered current if it was placed after the date of diabetes
   diagnosis. INH treatment is noted only if the treatment course was
   completed. Proteinuria: Considered to be present if the most recent
   urine dipstick test in the past year showed 1+ (30 mg/dl) or more
   protein. Because the color difference between a "Negative" and a
   "Trace" reading can be subtle and misread, a Trace reading is not
   sufficient to constitute proteinuria for audit purposes.
   Microalbuminuria: Considered to be present if the urine specimen is
   without gross proteinuria (as defined above) and meets one of the
   following criteria: ! urine albumin/creatinine (A/C) ratio is $30
   mg/gm. ! urine albumin excretion rate (AER) >20 Fg/min, or 30 mg/24hrs.
   ! 30 mg albumin/L of urine. Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose
   documented: Considered to be present if a provider made note of or
   assessed SMBG results at least once in the last 4 diabetes visits.
   APPENDIX D UPGRADING EPI INFO Epi Info is the CDC software package that
   is used to enter audit data and obtain audit reports. It is now
   available in both DOS and Windows versions. For the current (FY 2001)
   audit, the DOS version will be used. Epi Info versions 6.04c and 6.04d
   are the most recent DOS versions of Epi Info. Both are capable of
   correctly handling dates with 4 digit years, whereas 6.04b and earlier
   versions are not. The AUDIT01 programs use dates with 4-digit years and
   will run properly only on the two most recent versions of Epi Info.
   Confirm whether you have a recent version of Epi Info. This is easily
   done by looking at Epi's main menu page. The version number is located
   immediately below the large blue "Epi Info 6". If it says "Version
   6.04b to c Upgrade" or "Version 6.04d", you are all set: you have a
   recent version. If not, you will need to upgrade. Either of the upgrade
   options listed below are acceptable if you have Epi Info version 6.04b.
   For earlier versions, only the latter option is appropriate. To upgrade
   from Epi Info version 6.04b to version 6.04c 1. Obtain the file
   4BUPDATE.EXE and copy it into the \EPI6 subdirectory. The 4BUPDATE.EXE
   file is available on last year's AUDIT2K diskette (it is in the \UPDATE
   subdirectory), or from the IHS Diabetes Program office (505) -248-4182.
   2. From Epi's Program menu, select Analysis, then press which will take
   you to a DOS prompt (usually C:\EPI6>). At the DOS prompt, type
   4BUPDATE This begins the extraction of the update file. 3. You will be
   asked: Continue extraction? Type Y . 4. There are 23 files that the
   program will modify. For each file, the program will ask if you wish to
   overwrite the existing file. For example, it will say, "Analysis.exe
   exists, Overwrite?" Type Y 5. Repeat step 4 for the remaining 22 files.
   After the last file (EPITENG.RES) has been overwritten, you will be
   returned to a DOS prompt. Type exit, then press twice to leave Epi
   Info. This completes the upgrade to version 6.04c. To upgrade to Epi
   Info 6.04d 1. Create a temporary subdirectory (for example,
   C:\EPITEMP). 2. Go to CDC's Epi Info website (www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/),
   and select Epi Info 6. 3. Download the following 3 compressed files
   into the temporary subdirectory: EPI604_1.EXE EPI604_2.EXE EPI604_3.EXE
   4. Execute the 3 files, then run Install.exe. 5. Follow and respond to
   the installation questions and prompts.
