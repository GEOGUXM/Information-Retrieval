                      Energy Efficiency & Conservation:

                             You Have the Power

                              Use it Wisely !!

   Why do we care?  Beyond our general concern, as Bay Area residents, the
   Air District promotes energy efficiency and conservation to reduce air
   pollution.

   efficiency, click here.

   Much of our electricity comes from burning natural gas in power plants.
   When power supply is outstripped by demand, rolling blackouts can
   occur, disrupting our activites and even threatening our health. During
   blackouts, some facilities, such as company offices, hotels and
   shopping malls, use back-up electricity generation equipment they have
   on-site to keep their power flowing, helping prevent their operations
   from being disrupted or shut down. Unfortunately, these generating
   units are highly-polluting and operate inefficiently.

   In our homes, natural gas-burning furnaces provide most of us with the
   warmth we want when the weather gets cold. But with the rise in natural
   gas prices in the winter, some of us turned to wood to heat our homes,
   thinking this would lower our heating bills. If you plan to do this,
   you should be aware that wood is a relatively dirty fuel, emits much
   more smoke and particulate pollution than natural gas, produces toxic
   contaminants, and doesn't provide the monetary benefit you think you
   will get.

   While natural gas is the cleanest fuel available, burning it still
   produces air pollution, mostly oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and some very
   fine particulate matter.  These pollutants contribute to health
   problems, especially for sensitive sectors of our population, like
   children and the elderly.

   AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT FOR MANY IN THE COMMUNITY, LIKE THE ELDERLY, A
   POWER LOSS CAN BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

   Reducing the amounts of electricity and natural gas that you use,
   through energy conservation measures and with energy-efficient
   equipment, can help avoid blackouts, prevent health problems and
   improve air quality in the Bay Area.

   And there's a monetary benefit for you! By lowering your energy use,
   you will reduce your utility costs and the drain on your pocketbook, in
   addition to helping ensure reliable power supplies and reducing air
   pollution.

                                 In the Home

   Reduce peak loads - minimize use of electric devices during afternoon
   to early evening hours.

    1.          Set thermostat below 68 degrees F for heating, above 78
   degrees F for cooling, and off when away from home, health permitting.

    2.    Turn off your heat at night, and set your thermostat to start
   heating shortly before you get up.  An extra blanket will help keep you
   warm.  If you don't have a programmable thermostat, buy one.  They're
   cheap and easy to install.

    3.    Caulk and weatherstrip around doors, windows and other
   openings.  This will help prevent cold air from entering your home.

    4.     Insulate your water heater and keep it at the "warm" setting,
   and insulate hot water pipes.  Hot water temperature of 120 degrees F
   is sufficient (140 degrees F if you have an older dishwasher with no
   heating element).  Prevent heat loss by making sure your water heater
   is insulated and the first five feet of water heater piping is
   insulated.

    5.    Repair leaky faucets and install low-flow showerheads.  Leaky
   faucets waste water and make your water heater work overtime.  Low-flow
   showerheads reduce water and water heater use.

    6.    Check and repair disconnected or crushed ducts in attic and
   crawl space, and clean or replace furnace filters seasonally.  Duct
   repairs and clean filters will help insure the heated air from your
   furnace, or cooled air from your air conditioner, isnÂ’t wasted heating
   or cooling your crawl space, and that it reaches your living space most
   efficiently.  No air coming from an open register can be a sign of duct
   problems.

    7.    Make certain vent grills are not blocked by plants, books or
   furnishings.

    8.    Clean your refrigerator coils every six months.  Dusty coils
   make it work harder than necessary.  If more than 10 years old,
   consider replacing it with a new high-efficiency refrigerator.

    9.    Turn off lights when not needed.  Wasted energy pushes the
   supply grid towards rolling blackouts and costs you money
   unnecessarily.

    10.      Replace old incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents.
   Compact fluorescents come in various shapes and sizes that fit regular
   light fixtures and can last up to ten times as long as old-fashioned
   bulbs.  They use only about a quarter of the electricity the old bulbs
   use.

    11.   Turn off computer-related and entertainment equipment when not
   in use.  Wasted energy pushes the supply grid towards rolling blackouts
   and costs you money unnecessarily.

    12.   When the weather is cold, close drapes at night and open them
   during the daytime.  Closed drapes at night help keep heat in the
   house.  Open drapes during the day helps the sun's energy warm the
   house interior.

    13.   When the weather is hot, close drapes during the daytime.  This
   will minimize outdoor heat coming into the house.

    14.      Consider long-term energy efficiency and conservation
   improvements for both cold- and hot-weather conditions.  These include
   improved insulation of ceilings, floors, windows, doors, water pipes,
   etc.  Replace old inefficient furnaces, refrigerators or dishwashers
   with new high-efficiency appliances. (They can pay for themselves in
   just a few years!)  Look for the "Energy Star" label whenever you shop
   for appliances or computer equipment.

    15.   Avoid running large appliances such as dishwashers, clothes
   washers and dryers, electric ovens and stoves, electric heaters, water
   pumps and other electric devices during peak power periods (peak
   periods are afternoon to early evening hours).  This will lower
   electricity demand on the power grid and reduce the possibility of
   rolling blackouts.

    16.   Set air conditioning thermostats to pre-cool spaces at off-peak
   periods (off-peak periods are morning and late evening hours).

                              In the Workplace

   Reduce peak loads - minimize use of electric devices during afternoon
   to early evening hours.

   1.      Establish a system to alert employees of expected high demand
   days including, but not limited to E-mail, voice mail, or public
   address announcement to all employees.  Communicate early to allow
   employees to take load reduction measures at home.

    2.   Set air conditioning thermostats to pre-cool spaces at off-peak
   times (peak periods are afternoon to early evening hours).

   3.      Initiate load reduction measures for "Stage 2" and "Stage 3"
   alerts.  Employees can take steps to reduce lighting, personal
   computers and appliances electricity use.  While energy efficiency
   should be encouraged on a daily basis, stress the need for increased
   diligence to alleviate the emergency

   4.    Remind and encourage employees to reduce electrical loads in
   their homes, too, to reduce demand on the utility system.

    5.      Enhance employee awareness of energy efficiency through
   training and less formal methods. Provide mandatory and voluntary
   training opportunities on smart energy practices so that employees can
   practice energy efficiency during emergency periods and year-round.  In
   addition to training, send periodic e-mail messages about turning off
   lights and computers and implementing other efficiency practices; post
   signs or billboards near light switches or communal printers; and
   consider holding annual energy fairs prior to seasonal emergency
   periods to provide additional information for employees about how to
   manage energy use in the work place and in their homes.

    6.    Turn off lights when leaving an area for more than a few
   minutes.

    7.    In areas with sufficient daylighting, turn off electric lights.
   Adjust blinds, if available, to reduce glare.

    8.    Use task lighting and turn off general lighting, where it is
   feasible to maintain sufficient lighting levels for safety and
   productivity.

    9.    Turn off computers, monitors and printers when not in use.

    10.    Ensure their ENERGY STAR-type "low power stand-by" mode
   features are set and activated.

    11.   If they do not have ENERGY STAR features available, turn them
   off when leaving the office for more than an hour.

    12.   If a "Stage 3" alert is imminent, back up your computer and
   don't forget to frequently save what you are working on, to be ready if
   the power goes off.

    13.   Turn off personal appliances, such as coffee pots and radios.

    14.   Where feasible, schedule high electrical energy-use processes
   during off-peak periods (peak periods are afternoon to early evening
   hours).

    15.      Encourage employees to not use copiers during peak demand
   periods.  Turn off selected copiers.  Ensure power saver switch on
   copiers is enabled.

    16.      Install motion sensors and separate lighting circuits, where
   feasible, to allow turning off unneeded lights.

    17.      Consider long-term energy efficiency and conservation
   improvements for both cold- and hot-weather conditions.  These will pay
   for themselves due to lowered utility costs, and will provide a net
   cost savings thereafter!  If energy costs rise, these energy and
   conservation measures will pay for themselves even more quickly.

     Don't substitute woodburning as a way to heat your home because you
                          think it will save money!

                                  It won't:

   Wood costs around $200 to $300 per cord.  It burns inefficiently in
   your fireplace, compared with the heating efficiency of your gas
   furnace.  Besides, wood is a relatively dirty fuel and, when burned, it
   produces much more particulate pollution than natural gas, as well as
   toxic contaminants.

    Based on the energy content of typical wood used in fireplaces and
   using a cost of $225 per cord, you will be paying about $8-$11 per
   million BTU of heat and wasting about 80% of that, as heat going up the
   chimney in the form of hot combustion gases.  (The usable 20% is the
   radiant heat that you feel when you face the fire.)  So the actual cost
   of the wood energy that does heat your home will be about five times
   that $8-$11 range, or about $42-$56 per million BTU.

   And remember the radiant heat from a fire will warm an area about six
   feet from a fireplace.  Areas in your home beyond that are too far from
   the fireplace to benefit from the radiant heat it produces.

    Compare this with PG&E's latest natural gas rates (filed with the
   Public Utilities Commission for May, 2001).  The baseline rate is $1.08
   per therm ($10.80 per million BTU) and the rate for gas use above
   baseline (known as the "excess" use) is $1.27 per therm ($12.70 per
   million BTU).  A gas furnaces could typically be 75% efficient.  In
   this case, the actual cost of usable heat from natural gas will be
   about $14 per million BTU for baseline use, and about $17 per million
   BTU for "excess" use.  Compare this to the $42-$56 per million BTU for
   usable heat from wood.

    NOTE:  In some homes, it can be even worse.  Using a fireplace can
   produce a net loss of heat.  If the chimney draft is strong, it pulls
   warm air from the living spaces and draws cold outside air in, through
   all the little cracks and gaps in the house shell.

    You can see from this comparison that burning wood in your fireplace
   as a substitute for using your gas-fired furnace is not the remedy it
   would appear to be.
