      Cantwell Applauds Decision to Name Steve Wright BPA Administrator

   WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) today applauded the
   appointment of Steve Wright to be Administrator of the Bonneville Power
   Administration (BPA) by Energy Secretary Abraham. Cantwell said that,
   with Steve Wright at the helm, "BPA is in good hands."

   "Steve is the best person for the job," Cantwell said. "Steve has a
   long history at BPA. He has a deep understanding of the agency, the
   unique concerns of the Northwest and how they fit within national
   energy policy as a whole. "

   On May 14, 2001, Cantwell joined Senators Larry Craig (R-ID), Conrad
   Burns (R-MT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Max Baucus (D-MT), Ron Wyden (D-OR),
   Gordon Smith (R-OR), and Mike Crapo (R-ID) in sending a letter to
   Secretary Abraham supporting Wright's appointment. The letter stated,
   "Steve has earned our confidence with his candor and sound judgment on
   behalf of the Pacific Northwest During his years at Bonneville - and
   particularly during the trying times he has experienced as Acting
   Administrator - Steve has proven that he is an asset to both the BPA
   and the Pacific Northwest."

   "Steve has proven himself, having already led BPA through a very
   difficult time," Cantwell concluded.

   Wright has served as Acting Administrator since November 2000. Prior to
   that, he was Deputy Administrator. He was Senior Vice President for
   Corporate at BPA from 1998-2000. He worked for BPA as manager of the
   California office between 1987 and 1990 and Washington DC Office
   between 1990 and 1998.
