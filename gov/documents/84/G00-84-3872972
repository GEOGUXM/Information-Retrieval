   Did you know...

   that the International Space Station will be larger than a football
   field when completed?

   that if you could see as well as the Hubble Space Telescope you would
   be able to read the fine print on a newspaper 1 mile away?

   that scientists have been able to watch two giant "white oval" storms
   on Jupiter, each about half the size of Earth, colliding and merging to
   form an even bigger storm?

   The NASA Speakers Bureau can provide knowledgeable speakers to attend
   your conference or event and tell you about these subjects and many
   other wondrous aspects of the United States space program.

   The bureau is comprised of NASA scientists, engineers, managers, and
   many others from Centers throughout the country. They volunteer, taking
   time from their work schedules to address the public. Our audiences
   range from the very young to the elderly, professional and technical
   organizations, government agencies, civic and social groups, the
   educational community, and more.
