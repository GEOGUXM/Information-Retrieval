                                    ULYSSES

   The Ulysses spacecraft is an international project to study the poles
   of the sun and interstellar space above and below the poles. The
   mission, managed jointly by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the
   European Space Agency, is designed to study three major topics in solar
   physics: the sun, the solar wind and interstellar space. The
   instruments of Ulysses will study those phenomena at nearly all solar
   latitudes, but the most important work will be at high solar latitudes,
   near the polar regions of the sun that have not been explored by other
   spacecraft.

   Ulysses is a 370-kilogram (8l4-pound) spacecraft that was sent into an
   orbit at right angles to the solar system's ecliptic plane using a
   gravity-assist on Feb. 8, 1992 from Jupiter. (The ecliptic is the plane
   in which the Earth orbits the sun.) The orbit will allow Ulysses to
   examine, for the first time, the regions of the sun's north and south
   poles.

   Scientific data returned by Ulysses will aid scientists in their
   studies of the sun and of space beyond the solar system. All spacecraft
   that have studied the sun previously have done so in or near the
   ecliptic plane. But the sun's magnetic and electric fields and the
   solar wind have a strong influence on interplanetary space in that
   region. Because of the structure and shape of the sun's magnetic field,
   scientists expect to see very different phenomena, both outbound from
   the sun and inbound from interstellar space, in the polar regions.

   The first high latitude solar pass began when Ulysses reached 70
   degrees south solar latitude in June l994. Ulysses has spent about four
   months above that latitude, about 2.2 astronomical units from the sun.
   (An astronomical unit is about l50 million kilometers or 93 million
   miles, the average distance between the sun and the Earth.) Ulysses
   will cross the sun's equator in February l995 and then continue toward
   the north pole. During its second polar passage, beginning in June
   1995, Ulysses has spent four months at latitudes greater than 70
   degrees. The primary mission was completed in October 1995. Currently
   Ulysses is beginning continuing on it's eliptical orbit towards another
   intercept of the ecliptic at about 5.4 AU in early 1998.

   Ulysses' scientific payload is composed of nine instruments which
   include:
   * Magnetometers
   * A solar-wind plasma experiment
   * A solar-wind ion-composition spectrometer
   * An energetic-particle composition experiment
   * A low-energy charged-particle detector
   * A cosmic-ray and solar-particle instrument
   * A unified radio and plasma-wave experiment
   * A solar-flare X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment
   * A cosmic-dust experiment
   In addition, the spacecraft radio signal is used to conduct a
   coronal-sounding experiment and a gravity-wave search.

   The science instruments for Ulysses were provided by the U.S. and
   European science teams. The spacecraft was built by Dornier Systems of
   Germany, for ESA, which is responsible for on-orbit operations. NASA
   provided the space shuttle Discovery and the IUS and PAM-S upper stages
   and the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which was built for the
   U.S. Department of Energy by the General Electric Co.

   Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the U.S. portion of the mission for
   NASA's Office of Space Science and Applications. Ulysses is being
   tracked and data gathered by NASA's Deep Space Network, which is
   operated by JPL. Spacecraft operations and data analysis are being
   performed at JPL by a joint ESA/JPL team.
