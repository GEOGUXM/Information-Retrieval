            The Court Administration and Case Management Committee
                          of the Judicial Conference

     The Court Administration and Case Management Committee's (CACM)
     Subcommittee on Privacy and Electronic Access to Case Files (the
     Privacy Subcommittee) is made up of members of CACM as well as
     liaisons from four other Judicial Conference Committees: 1) the
     Committee on Automation and Technology; 2) the Committee on Criminal
     Law; 3) the Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy
     System; and 4) the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.
     CACM's primary responsibility is to study and make recommendations
     to the Judicial Conference on matters affecting case management; the
     operation of appellate, district and bankruptcy clerks' offices;
     jury administration; and other court operational matters.

     The Judicial Conference of the United States was created in 1948
     with the enactment of 29 U.S.C. ยง 331. The fundamental purpose of
     the Judicial Conference is to make policy with regard to the
     administration of the United States courts. The Chief Justice of the
     United States is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference.
     Membership is comprised of the chief judge of each judicial circuit,
     the chief judge of the Court of International Trade and a district
     judge from each regional judicial circuit.

     The Conference operates through a network of committees created to
     address a wide variety of subjects. CACM is one of these committees.
     Judicial Conference committees derive their jurisdiction and legal
     basis for existence from the Judicial Conference and the Chief
     Justice as presiding officer. The committees review issues within
     their established jurisdiction and make policy recommendations to
     the Conference. Members of the various committees are appointed by
     the Chief Justice of the United States.
