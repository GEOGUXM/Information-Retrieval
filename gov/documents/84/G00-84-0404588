   Travel Instructions

   The CMC-CAT Synchrotron Research Center is located at the Advanced
   Photon Source in Building 433 of Argonne National Laboratory. Please
   call us at (630)252-0320 before you plan to travel so that we can
   arrange for a pass to the Laboratory and the APS.

   It takes approximately 45 minutes to reach Argonne National Laboratory
   by car from each of the two major Chicago airports: O'Hare and Midway.
   Limousine service is available
   from each airport, and major car rental agencies serve both airports.

   Driving directions from O'Hare:
   To get to Argonne National Laboratory from O'Hare Airport, take the
   Interstate 190 to the exit for the Tri-State Tollway, or 294, south
   (toward Indiana). The Tri-State costs 95 cents (two 40 cent tolls and
   one 15 cent toll).  Take I294 south to Interstate 55 south (toward St.
   Louis). Take I55 south to the exit for South Cass Avenue. Exit at South
   Cass Ave, drive over the overpass, and you will see the sign for
   Argonne National Laboratory. Follow the signs and turn into the
   Laboratory entrance on Northgate Road. You will need to stop at the
   Visitor Center to obtain a pass and a map to the APS.

   Driving directions from Midway:
   Take Cicero Avenue north to I55. Take I55 South to South Cass Avenue.
   Exit at South Cass Ave, drive over the overpass, and you will see the
   sign for Argonne National Laboratory. Follow the signs and turn into
   the Laboratory entrance on Northgate Road. You will need to stop at the
   Visitor Center to obtain a pass and a map to the APS.

   Hotels

   There are several hotels near the laboratory on Kingery Road (Rt 83)
   north of I55. Rt 83 is east of the laboratory on I55. If you exit the
   laboratory at Northgate road and travel north on I55, Kingery Road is
   the first exit.

   From the airport, Kingery Road is two exits before the South Cass
   Avenue exit.

   Limousine Services

   If you are planning to stay at APS for an extended period of time, we
   recommend that you rent a car. If you plan to stay for only a short
   time or won't leave the APS site for any reason, several limousine
   services are available for transport from the airport. When you make
   your reservation the company will inform you of the phone number to
   call when you arrive at either O'Hare or Midway to summon the
   limousine. Rates are subject to change. For a more complete list of
