SeaDAS 4.1 Configuration and Requirements

   SeaDAS 4.1 is currently being developed on Silicon Graphics Inc.'s
   (SGI) O2/IRIX 6.3 and has been successfully ported to an SGI ONYX/IRIX
   6.5,  SUN UltraSPARCs running both Solaris 2.6 and Solaris 2.7 and PC's
   running the Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.2, 7.0, and 7.1 operating systems.

   The Interactive Data Language (IDL) from Research System Inc. (RSI) is
   used to build all the GUI and display-related programs in SeaDAS. With
   Update #001 to SeaDAS 4.0 (released July 11, 2000), IDL is no longer
   required in order to run SeaDAS. Instead, users may choose to run
   SeaDAS under an embedded  IDL runtime license which is provided with
   the SeaDAS package. SeaDAS includes the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)
   libraries from National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
   which are also required to build certain SeaDAS programs. C, FORTRAN77,
   and IMAKE from the vendors are required only if you want to modify the
   source code and rebuild the executables.

   Currently SeaDAS only supports the following platforms: SGI and SUN
   unix workstations as well as PC platforms running Red Hat Linux 6.0,
   6.2, 7.0, and 7.1.  The SeaDAS development team may try to port SeaDAS
   to other platforms in the future. In the meantime, since all the source
   codes are available, if any group is interesting in porting SeaDAS to
   other platforms, the development team will be happy to give any kind of
   assistance.

  Suggested Hardware Requirements:

     * Platform: SGI O2,  SUN UltraSPARC workstations or PC
     * Memory:192MB (regular user), 384 (HRPT user)
     * Disk: 9 GB*
     * Tape Drive: 4MM(DAT) or 8mm Exabyte (for data from DAAC)
     * Display: 19" Console or X-terminal with 20MB memory, 1280x1024
       resolution, 8-bit, 256 colors

   *Note: The actual SeaDAS installation requires about 330MB without demo
   files and 950MB with demo files. The embedded IDL runtime feature will
   require an additional 130MB. A large amount of disk space is suggested
   for storing data.

  Software Requirements:

     * Operating Systems: SGI: IRIX 6.3 or 6.5, SUN: Solaris 2.6 or 2.7,
       PC: Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.2, 7.0, or 7.1
     * Optional Software: IDL 5.3 or IDL 5.4
       Note:  IDL 5.2 will still probably work, but has not been retested
     * Optional Compiler: C , FORTRAN (required if desire to compile from
       scratch)
     * Software Libraries: HDF 4.1r1 (included in SeaDAS)

  Compile-from-scratch support:

     * SGI: IRIX 6.3 and  6.5
     * SUN: Solaris 2.6 and  2.7
     * PC: Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.2, 7.0, and 7.1
