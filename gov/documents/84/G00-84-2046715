   By participating in Labs21, public and private sector laboratories can
   achieve significant benefits including the following:
     * Lower laboratory utility and operating costs
     * Reduced health and safety risks
     * Improved facility management
     * Reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
     * National recognition and an enhanced image
     * Access to technical assistance
     * Opportunities for regulatory relief

   In addition to these benefits, there are broader environmental and
   societal benefits of the program. For example, according to EPA
   estimates, if half of the nation's estimated 150,000 private and public
   research laboratories achieve energy efficiency improvements of 30
   percent, then the United States could reduce annual electricity
   consumption by 84 trillion Btus. This figure equals the electricity
   consumed by 2.2 million U.S. households. This improvement would save
   $1.2 billion in utility costs, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16.7
   million tons, and remove the equivalent of 3 million automobiles from
   U.S. highways each year.

   The following links provide additional information on two important
   benefits:
     * Regulatory Relief. Learn how Labs21 is working to expedite the
       opportunities for regulatory relief.
     * Carbon Emissions Reductions. Learn more about how laboratories can
       capture the value of emission reductions.
