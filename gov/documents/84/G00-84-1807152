   What is it?

   The NOSB is a nationwide academic competition among teams of high
   school students. Regional competitions will be held around the U.S. in
   February 2002 with the final national competition held in Providence,
   RI from April 26-29, 2002. The NOSB will test students' math and
   science skills as applied to topics on ocean (and Great Lakes) biology,
   chemistry, geology, physics, technology, history, and economics. The
   NOSB Fact Sheet is available online to help students and teachers
   prepare for the competition. Click here to go to the fact sheet.

   When / Where will it be held?

   The Midwest Regional Competition of the NOSB will be held on Saturday,
   February 23 at the Francois Xavier Bagnoud Center, College of
   Engineering, University of Michigan North Campus, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

   Who competes?

   High school teams of four students, one alternate, and a coach will
   compete in 18 minute long rapid-fire question and answer matches during
   the day-long round-robin, double elimination competition.

   What are the prizes?

   The Midwest Regional Competition will award trophies, medals, cash, and
   other prizes to top-finishers. The overall winning team of the
   competition wins a paid trip to Providence, RI in late April to compete
   in the National Ocean Sciences Bowl finals. The grand prize for the
   winning team of the finals competition has not yet been determined, but
   prizes for previous years included cruises on oceanographic research
   vessels, visits to oceanographic research laboratories, computer
   hardware/software for the winning team's school, scientific equipment
   and laboratory supplies, scholarships, endowments, t-shirts, trophies,
   and medals.
