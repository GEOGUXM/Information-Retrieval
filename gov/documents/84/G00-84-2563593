   Notices/Announcements

   Warning: I'm nearly constantly testing items on this site. Live Image
   Transmission Speed and Options May Change At Any Time! If you see a
   static Green Faced Daemon ;-) / Standby Message in the image window
   above, then you must RELOAD your WWW page. This message means the
   server video/imaging drivers have been reset by an authorized user to a
   different operating mode. Unfortunately, this requires that you as a
   visitor must re-establish your on-line link.

                          All Collaboratory Users:

   I recommend you set your Monitor to 16 bit (Thousands of Colors) in
   order to view these images properly. If your Monitor is set to 8 bit
   (256 Colors) then the images will appear grainy or may show
   color/intensity banding since the full range of gray scales is not
   available for image display. This should be done before you start your
   WWW browser not after...

   The Buttons at the beneath the Image (shown above) allow you to select
   which of the Camera/Detector's you are viewing and work with most
   NetScape compatible browsers. If they do not work with your browser
   please use the Comment Form to let me know.

   Warning   NetScape Communicator Users: I have found that there is a bug
   in Communicator. When using the remote control options of the
   Microscopy and/or Macroscope, Communicator disconnects the live video
   feed from the server. You will have to "RELOAD" and/or just switch back
   to Navigator

                                 Notice #1:

   On this public site visitors have the ability to select which live
   image displayed at any time, but, you should realize that when you
   switch the image you switch it simultaneously for every visitor that is
   logged into the Collaboratory. So if the image suddenly switches to a
   different view without your intervention, then someone else who is also
   visiting the Collaboratory has changed the image broadcast source.The
   small Red Dot in front of the Image Selection Buttons underneath the
   Live Display Screen will let you know which imaging source is active at
   the time you log in. This marker only refreshes when you RELOAD your
   WWW page. It does not change if another user changes the video image
   source.

                                 Notice #2:

   During some experiments the Image Selection Option may be disabled from
   public control.
