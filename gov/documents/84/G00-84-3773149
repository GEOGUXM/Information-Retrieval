                                  Privacy Notice

      This section of the page explains how the U.S. Agency for International
      Development will handle information we learn about you from your visit
       to our web site. The information we receive depends upon what you do
                              when visiting our site.

        * If you visit our site to read or download information, such as
          country information or information about one of our projects:
          We collect and store only the following information about you: the
          name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example,
           aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or
             iowa.edu if you are connecting from the University of Iowa's
             domain); the date and time you access our site, the Internet
          address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site;
              and what information you view while you visit our web site.
          We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors
          to the different sections of our site, find out what information is
           the most viewed, and to help us make our web site more useful to
            visitors. This gathering and storing of information is separate
           from the activity described as monitoring in our Security Notice.
          The information gathered is used for two purposes: site management
             and, in the case of suspected unauthorized activity, for law
              enforcement and possible criminal prosecution (see Security
                                       Notice).

        * If you identify yourself by sending us a comment using our contact
          page or an E-mail:
          You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information,
            for example, in an electronic mail message asking a question or
                   providing us with a comment or suggestion. We use
           personally-identifying information to respond to your comment or
          suggestion, and to count the number of people sending us comments.
           In certain instances, your comment or suggestion may be forwarded
          to other U.S. government agencies or departments if they are in the
                       best position to respond to your message.
          We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying
          information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
                            provide such information to us.

               Cookies and other information stored on your computer

       In general, this site does NOT use the "cookies" that some Web sites
       use to gather and store information about your visits to their sites.

      Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and
        passwords, which some Web servers collect from you when you access
        them. That data is stored on your hard drive-not on the Web site's
       server. Whenever you visit a "cookie" site, the server looks for its
      cookie on your hard drive and, if found, then reads the information it
      stored there. Cookies generally are stored in your browser's directory
        or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh).

      Some of the links on the USAID web site point to non-USAID sites which
      may place cookies on your computer. You can expect to be notified that
        you are leaving the USAID site when you select one of these links.
        However, you should know that the non-USAID site may still place a
        cookie on your computer while you are reading the warning message.

      If you want to avoid such cookies, we encourage you to set your browser
      to notify you when cookies are being set and allow you to reject them.
               Your system's help files will explain how to do this.

                                  Security Notice

        For SITE SECURITY purposes and to ensure that this service remains
          available to all users, this government computer system employs
       software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
       attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

       Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
       this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
         Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
                          Infrastructure Protection Act.

       We generally will not obtain personally identifying information about
          you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such
                  information to us. See also Privacy Act Notice.

        If monitoring reveals evidence of possible criminal activity, such
              evidence may be provided to law enforcement personnel.

                                General Disclaimer

      Information presented on this Web site is considered public information
        and may be distributed or copied freely unless identified as being
      subject to copyright protection. In return, we request only that USAID
       be cited as the source of any information, photos, and images copied
         from this site and that any photo credits or bylines be similarly
                      credited to the photographer or author.

       We strongly recommend that USAID data be acquired directly from this
      Web site and not through other sources that may change the information
       in some way or exclude material crucial to the understanding of that
          information. While we make every effort to provide accurate and
      complete information, some information may change between site updates.
          Substantive changes may be noted when content is next updated.

       The documents posted on this Web site may contain hypertext links or

        visitors' convenience. We do not control or guarantee the accuracy,
         relevance, timeliness, or completeness of any linked information.
       Further, the inclusion of links or pointers to Web sites other than a
       USAID-managed Web site is not intended to assign importance to those
        sites and the information contained therein, nor is it intended to
          endorse, recommend, or favor any views expressed, or commercial
            products or services offered on these outside sites, or the

                            manufacture, or otherwise.

          Reference in this Web site to any specific commercial products,
       processes, or services, or the use of any trade, firm or corporation
       name is for the information and convenience of the site's visitor's,
      and does not constitute endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the
                        United States Government or USAID.

       The views and opinions of authors expressed herein do not necessarily
       state or reflect those of the U.S. Government or the USAID, and shall
           not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.

        Every effort is made to provide accurate and complete information.
        However, with the thousands of documents available, often uploaded
         within short deadlines, we cannot guarantee that there will be no
       errors. We make no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy,
          completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this Web site and
       expressly disclaim liability for errors and omissions in the contents
                                 of this Web site.

        With respect to the content of this site, neither the United States
        Government, nor USAID, nor their employees and contractors make any
      warranty, expressed or implied or statutory, including but not limited
      to the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, and
      the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose
        with respect to content available from this USAID Web site or other
         Internet resources linked from it. Additionally, neither the U.S.
         Government nor USAID assume any legal liability for the accuracy,
        completeness, or usefulness of any information, product, or process
      disclosed herein nor freedom from computer virus, and do not represent
      that use of such information, product, or process would not infringe on
                              privately owned rights.
