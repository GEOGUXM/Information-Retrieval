Fire Research Information Services (FRIS)

     Fire Research Information Services FRIS is a resource both to the
     BFRL staff and to fire protection engineers, scientists, and fire
     service personnel around the world. The 55,000 item document
     collection is accessible through FIREDOC; it is an on-line
     bibliographic database accessible at no cost via the Internet and
     the Web. The collection represents a vast resource of information on
     nearly any fire research related subject.
     * BFRL Publications Online A collection of recent publications (since
       1994) available for free download published by and for BFRL staff.

  FIREDOC

     FIREDOC is a fire research bibliographic database. The database
     reflects the 55,000 holdings (published reports, journal articles,
     conference proceedings, books, and audiovisual items) of FRIS. Each
     reference has complete bibliographic information including the
     title, author, journal, book, or conference identification,
     keywords, identifiers, and abstract (if available). We have recently
     added a direct link from the FIREDOC record to BFRL Publications
     Online. Currently, links exist for BFRL fire research publications
     in the year 2000 and beyond.

  Fire Test Data

     BFRL maintains a database of fire test reports and related test data
     developed by NIST researchers and by other research organizations
     that have contributed data for public use. For further information
     contact Paul Reneke, paul.reneke@nist.gov.

  International Fire Conferences

     A listing of international fire conferences is available.

  FRIS Products/Publications:

     Each year a CD-ROM is created containing publications of BFRL staff.
     BFRL publications are also available on the web.

  Fire on the Web

     These web pages provide links to experimental fire data and
     mpeg/quicktime movies for fire tests that can be downloaded and/or
     viewed with a web browser. This award winning site contains
     additional fire-related resources at BFRL and elsewhere.

  Fire Modeling Programs

     The Building and Fire Research Laboratory has developed numerous
     software tools for predicting the effect of fires on the environment
     in a building. Many of these programs and associated documentation
     are available through the Fire Safety Fire Modeling Programs.
