                       What They're Saying About Trade

      Highlights from the "Fight Back With Free Trade" Press Conference
       National Press Club, National Press Building, Washington, D.C.
                             September 27, 2001
                        (attributions follow quotes)

   "...I have long believed, as I think all the economists at Brookings
   have believed, that the case for this  previously called fast-track,'
   now Trade Promotion Authority'  was pretty well self-evident, a
   no-brainer. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11,
   it is needed now more than ever."

   "...the terrorists have supplied an action-forcing event that impels
   us, over the midterm, to stimulate additional demand for our exports by
   further reducing barriers to trade and we can't do this without
   legislative authority."

   "[the terrorist assaults]...demand a political response, an affirmation
   of the values that define us as a people. That includes openness,
   peaceful exchange with other nations, and efforts to extend freedom of
   commerce wherever such transactions take place, either inside or
   outside our borders."

   "...combating the perpetrators of international terrorism, those who
   extend their -- them support and refuge requires the mobilization of a
   global coalition. Our partners in this endeavor will be better equipped
   to help if they can escape their own economic problems, and many of
   them depend even more heavily on trade than we do."

   "...what better way than this, along with other measure that are being
   taken, for us to send a message of defiance to the terrorists than
   promptly passing legislation which woul d give the President the
   authority he needs to promote a new round..."

   -Michael H. Armacost
   President of the Brookings Institution
   ***********************************************************************

   "And at this point in time, when the U.S. is attempting to forge a
   global coalition to defend civilization, there must be an economic
   component where we coordinate economically, as well as on the security
   front. Other nations depend critically on trade and will simply go
   their own way without us if we are not able to participate and
   hopefully lead in that exercise. Congressional passage of Trade
   Promotion Authority is thus absolutely critical and urgent for both
   economic and security reasons, and we need to proceed immediately."

   "...trade is certainly an economic issue...but trade is also
   quintessentially a foreign policy and national security issue. And
   quite literally, if you look at every major U.S. economic initiative in
   the world, in the post-war period  the Marshall Plan, the creation of
   the IMF and the GATT, President Kennedy's Trade Expansion Act and the
   Kennedy Round of the 1960's, right up through NAFTA  they were all
   motivated in very large part by foreign policy and national security
   considerations."

   "The United States is trying to forge an effective international
   coalition to deal with the terrorist threat. That obviously has a
   military and a security dimension. It also must have an economic
   dimension. And what is more sensible and appropriate than for the
   world's countries who trade with each other to such an extent, to try
   to improve that component of their relationship as a part of this
   overall initiative? Indeed, it would be folly not to do so."

   -C. Fred Bergsten
   Director of Institute for International Economics
   ***********************************************************************

   "With the WTO's meeting in Qatar only a few weeks away, it is important
   that America use that event to reestablish its firm commitment to world
   leadership following the September 11 tragedy."

   "With Trade Promotion Authority, the president will be given another
   leadership tool in international relations. We will then be able to
   prove that the United States of America can and will lead in economics
   as well as in diplomacy and military coalitions. We need TPA now."

   -Edwin J. Feulner
   President, The Heritage Foundation
   ***********************************************************************

   "...trade promotion authority is likely to be an important component of
   any program for economic recovery and anti-terrorism mobilization, and
   for good reason. The terrorist attacks were in important part attacks
   on the global expansion of freedom, diversity, and tolerance among
   differing nations and cultures."

   "That global commerce is a central part of this expansion and was a
   target of the attack is dramatized by the fact that a primary target
   was the World Trade Center. It is appropriate and highly desirable that
   the response of America and the civilized world to these attacks should
   be a renewed commitment to a liberal trading order, which cannot be
   achieved without American leadership, which in turn cannot be achieved
   without Trade Promotion Authority."

   -Chris DeMuth
   President of the American Enterprise Institute
   ***********************************************************************
   *******

   "...A new comprehensive, multilateral trade agreement is especially
   important at this time to maintain the momentum of increased trade and
   economic growth in those developing countries that have recently joined
   the World Trade Organization. It is encouraging, but not accidental,
   that the governments of these same countries have also supported our
   government in the fight against terrorism, because international trade
   promotes both economic growth and more civil
   relations among nations."

   -William A. Niskanen
   Chairman of the Cato Institute
   ***********************************************************************
   *******

   "The economy is in trouble, and it was in trouble before the 11th of
   September, and it's clearly getting a lot worse....clearly, there's a
   reason to press ahead with trying to improve trade around the world as
   an engine to pull us out of this."

   -John J. Hamre
   President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
   ***********************************************************************
   *******

   "...today, when the U.S. economy and the world economy are stalled,
   with growth falling near zero in North America and the European Union
   and Japan, I think it's terribly important that we get back to a trade
   expansion and market-opening agenda as a way of boosting economic
   confidence."

   -Will Marshall
   President of the Progressive Policy Institute
