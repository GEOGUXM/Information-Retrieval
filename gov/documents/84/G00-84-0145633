                     Borrelia burdorferi, linear chromosome

   The nucleotide sequence of 909,265 bp of the large linear chromosome of
   Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 has been determined at Brookhaven
   National Laboratory (BNL) by random first-end and directed second-end
   sequencing of plasmid libraries of random chromosomal fragments,
   followed by primer walking using 12-mer primers generated by ligation
   of two hexamers on hexamer templates. The sequence assembly was
   confirmed and contigs were aligned by end sequencing a framework of
   ~35-kbp fesmid clones. The few remaining gaps were filled by PCR
   amplification from fesmid clones or genomic DNA.

   The same sequence has also been determined by The Institute for Genomic
   Research (TIGR) (Fraser et al., Nature, 390: 580-586 (1997)), and the
   current version of the TIGR sequence is available at
   ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/data/b_burgdorferi/. The two sequences align
   with each other and with the physical map of Casjens and Huang
   (Molecular Microbiology 8: 967-980 (1993)). The TIGR sequence goes all
   the way to the covalently closed ends of the linear chromosome. The BNL
   sequence covers only the extent covered by BNL clones, and lacks 404 bp
   at the left end and 249 bp at the right end.

   BNL Sequence via http or ftp
   Date: 04/16/98
   Length: 909,265 bp of BNL sequence
   909,918 bp total, including the first 404 bp and last 249 bp of the
   TIGR sequence
   Coverage: The entire BNL sequence has been determined at least once on
   each strand
   Notation: The BNL sequence is uppercase, except ambiguities
   The 404 bp of TIGR sequence at the beginning and 249 bp at the end are
   in lower case
   Ambiguities indicate where BNL sequences determined on different clones
   did not agree

     Mismatch ambiguities are indicated by ambiguity codes (lower case)
     Indel ambiguities are indicated by a lower case a, c, g, or t

   Alignment between BNL and TIGR sequences:
   Available via anonymous ftp from ftp://www.bio.bnl.gov/pub/borrelia
   Numbering is approximately the BNL number, diverging to accommodate
   small indels
   Flags in the alignment:
          * mismatch between the BNL and TIGR sequences
          - indel between the BNL and TIGR sequences
          # BNL mismatch ambiguities
          % BNL indel ambiguities
          + TIGR ambiguities

Comparison of BNL and TIGR sequences:

        Alignment is between the TIGR sequence of 7/12/99 and the BNL
   sequence of 04/16/98.

        Indels: The TIGR sequence contains seven tandem copies of a 162-bp
   imperfect tandem repeat that occurs only twice in the BNL sequence, at
   213,195 and 213,357. The alignment shown leaves out the five additional
   repeats in the TIGR sequence (810 bp). The TIGR sequence has a
   duplication of the AGA at BNL position 38,087 and a deletion of one
   copy of a 9-base tandem repeat at BNL positions 812,841 and 812,850. In
   addition there are 48 single-base indels between the two sequences and
   8 BNL indel ambiguities.

        Mismatches: There are 36 single-base mismatches between the two
   sequences.

        Ambiguities: In the BNL sequence, ambiguities represent sequence
   differences among different clones in the plasmid libraries used for
   sequencing. The BNL sequence contains 57 mismatch ambiguities and 8
   indel ambiguities. The TIGR sequence contains 43 ambiguity codes. Each
   ambiguity in both sequences corresponds to an unambiguous base in the
   other sequence, and, in every case, one of the ambiguous bases matches
   the unambiguous base in the other sequence.

        Conclusions: The increasing frequency of discrepancies at lower
   BNL coverage suggests that a few errors remain in the BNL sequence. The
   discrepancies and ambiguities observed could be accounted for if each
   DNA preparation used for sequencing had polymorphisms at the ~0.01%
   level, with a similar level of polymorphism between the two DNA
   preparations.
