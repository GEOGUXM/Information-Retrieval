   O NEWS RELEASE Comptroller of the Currency Administrator of National
   Banks NR 2002-07 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Robert M. Garsson
   January 18, 2002 (202) 874-5770 OCC and People's Bank of China Assess
   Money Penalties Against Bank of China WASHINGTON -- The Office of the
   Comptroller of the Currency and the People's Bank of China announced
   today they have entered into separate actions against Bank of China and
   its U.S.-based federal branches for misconduct engaged in by prior
   management. The bank's New York branch will pay a $10 million penalty
   to the OCC and the parent bank, which is based in Beijing, will pay an
   equivalent amount in local currency to the People's Bank of China, for
   a total of $20 million. The bank and its U.S. branches have begun to
   implement measures to prevent future misconduct. In reaching this
   settlement, the OCC noted that the bank's current management cooperated
   with the investigations conducted by the OCC and the People's Bank of
   China. The actions taken by the new management of the bank include
   removing officers suspected of misconduct, uncovering and reporting
   acts of misconduct to the two regulatory agencies, and requiring the
   U.S. branches to implement several action plans over the past 18 months
   to correct misconduct of prior management. The OCC supervises Bank of
   China's three U.S.-based federal branches -- two in New York and one in
   Los Angeles. The OCC's monetary penalties were levied against one of
   the New York branches, where the misconduct was uncovered, but the
   remedial measures cover all three branches. The People's Bank of China
   is the home-country regulator of Bank of China. The misconduct, which
   resulted in significant losses to the New York Branch, included showing
   preferential treatment to certain customers of the New York branch who
   had personal relationships with some members of the New York branch's
   prior management. The OCC had a number of other concerns about the Bank
   of China's U.S. branches under the former bank management, including
   large exposures to a single borrower, the facilitation of a fraudulent
   letter of credit scheme, the facilitation of a loan fraud scheme, the
   unauthorized release of collateral and the concealment of that action,
   and other suspicious activity and potential fraud. In its consent
   order, the OCC required Bank of China's federal branches to: develop
   procedures -more- to guard against fraud; provide for adequate customer
   due diligence, using an independent third party to verify compliance;
   and cease doing business with 34 specific individuals and companies,
   and affiliated entities. The consent order also requires Bank of
   China's federal branches to: Strengthen their Risk Management Division,
   ensuring that it has unrestricted access to documents, files and
   personnel of the federal branches, and authority to terminate customer
   relationships, deny loans and conduct investigations. Develop new
   policies and procedures to guard against fraud in trade settlement
   transactions, including direct verifications of documents submitted by
   customers. Adopt new policies and procedures to prevent loan fraud,
   including analysis of related accounts, requirements for audited
   financial statements and additional due diligence on large customers
   and those who conduct business with the large customers. Hire an
   independent third-party to conduct a portion of the direct
   verifications of trade settlement documents and conduct due diligence
   on large customers and their business relationships. Implement new
   procedures to identify account owners and beneficial owners. In the
   case of business accounts, officers, directors and major shareholders
   must be identified and, in some cases, credit reports are required for
   account owners, beneficial owners, shareholders and other parties. Bank
   of China's U.S. branches have already begun to implement the remedial
   measures required in the consent order. In taking the enforcement
   action, both the OCC and the People's Bank of China recognized the
   bank's willingness to rectify past problems and the substantial
   progress that it has made. The two agencies believe that the bank's
   reorganization of the branches will better ensure compliance with
   applicable federal law and safe and sound banking practices The
   enforcement action stems from a lengthy investigation by the OCC and a
   separate inquiry by the People's Bank of China. ### Attachments:
