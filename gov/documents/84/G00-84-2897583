Frank Tupper, Director TSI Picture The salient effort in striving for the
goal of safety in transportation involves prudent planning and an effective
implementation of programs. Factual knowledge and adaptable skills are basic
in teaching safety; however, more essential than these two attributes is the
acquiring of a safety mentality - the development of an attitude. Attitudes
are not inherent, but develop with time through learning experiences that are
critical to a continuous life process.
Students are exposed to a variety of simulated conditions that assist in the
development of the safety attitude which is accompanied with the gain of
knowledge and skills adapted to the individual need of each student.
To accomplish the goals of the programs, the expertise of all types of
personnel is utilized. These people develop an "Esprit De Corps" through
loyalty to associates, dedication to work objectives, pursuit of performance
excellence, and a sensitivity to individual needs which develops favorable
relationships with students and instructors.
We look forward to working with you.
