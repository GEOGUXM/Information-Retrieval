   A concentric circle at CA-MEN-753 (Feliz Creek) Rock art images may
   have meaning on many levels. They sometimes depict mythological or
   cosmological events, serve a magico-religious function, or involve
   ceremonies crucial to world renewal or cultural history. Of all the
   traces of past cultures, rock art sites are perhaps the most difficult
   to understand and interpret. They offer an insight into the values and
   lives of distant times and other worlds.
