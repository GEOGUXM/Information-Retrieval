   The information NIMH provides is intended to help people better
   understand mental health and mental disorders. Please note that NIMH
   does not provide referrals to mental health or health care providers
   nor counsel people on specific mental health problems. Medical advice
   on a diagnosis, treatment, or care of an individual patient should be
   obtained through consultation with a mental health practitioner or
   other health care provider. If you are interested in participating in a
   research study, please go to our Clinical Trials page.
