   This OML adds the following new paragraph to the end of section 4.6 in

   Operational contacts shall be established with cooperators in the RFC
   area responsible for maintenance of stream gaging stations (e.g.,
   district offices of the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS]). Prior to and
   during high flow events, real-time coordination should occur between
   the cooperator's streamflow measuring crews and RFCs. Key cooperator
   personnel responsible for operational maintenance of stream gaging
   stations shall be listed in RFC station duty manuals. Phone numbers
   where operational forecasters can be reached at the RFC shall be
   provided to the cooperator(s) for posting in each stream gage house.
   RFCs shall also work with cooperators to provide efficient two-way
   exchange of routine information, including forecasts, data, and rating
   tables.
