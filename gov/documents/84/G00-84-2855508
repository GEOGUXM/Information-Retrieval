   Small Business Week Awards 2002 Introduction In recognition of the
   small business community's contributions to the American economy and
   society, the President of the United States designates one week each
   year as National Small Business Week. Small Business Week 2002 will
   take place in late spring. In the run-up to the spring event, the U.S.
   Small Business Administration, in partnership with public- and
   private-sector small business supporters, will cosponsor special events
   honoring the nation's entrepreneurs at the local, state and national
   levels. The highlight of National Small Business Week is the
   presentation of awards spot-lighting the outstanding contributions of
   small business persons and advocates at the district,* state and
   national levels. Winners in the following award categories will be
   invited to Washington, D.C., during National Small Business Week for a
   series of special events in their honor: Phoenix (Disaster Recovery);
   Small Business Advocate; Special Achievement; and Small Business Person
   of the Year from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. The national Small
