   OVERVIEW:
   The Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) website is
   maintained by the WFC3 Project to provide information during instrument
   development. It provides an overview of the project for the public at
   large as well as promoting information exchange within the Project.
   There are two main categories of information:

     1. General information (publicly accessible).
     2. Internal Private Pages for the Project and the Scientific
     Oversight Committee

   This document outlines the services available and describes the
   procedures for using these services.

   HOW TO REACH THE WFC3 WEBSITE:
   The main entry into the WFC3 page is through:
   http://wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov/

   PUBLIC PAGES:
   The public WFC3 site provides background information and current status
   of the project. It also provides contact information for the WFC3
   project and the SOC. Feedback from the public is solicited through the
   guestbook.

   PRIVATE WEBPAGES:
   Password-protected pages are maintained for the exclusive use of the
   SOC, Project and other approved users. They can contact
   webmaster@wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov to request a username and password. Once
   they have been approved for access to the private pages they can set
   their own preferred passwords. The WFC3 staff will maintain these pages
   as needed. Users of these pages should contact
   wfc3-web@wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov to request modification of these pages.
   Material can be provided using the ftp site (see below).

   ANONYMOUS FTP:
   Anonymous ftp is supported. Access is obtained by pointing an ftp
   capable client to:

     ftp://wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov/
     Username: anonymous
     Password: your e-mail address

   Once logged in, the general user has access to the wfc3/public/
   directory. This directory is restricted to read-only for public access,
   although write access is available in the public/incoming/ directory.
   The purpose of the /incoming/ directory is to provide a convenient file
   drop-off location. To prevent abuse, the files in public/incoming/ will
   be automatically purged after 7 days, and a strict 50 Mb quota is
   enforced for the directory. Users are encouraged to quickly notify the
   intended recipient so that deposited files can be moved to another
   directory or machine.

   SOC/PROJECT FTP:
   All users with passwords will have access to both public as well as
   nonpublic disk space for reading and writing. These areas may be used
   as repositories for sharing information, as well as for communicating
   with the WFC3 staff. Users can create sub-directory structures within
   either the private or public directories. Note that SOC and Project
   users will have separate ftp directory trees.

   At this time, the ftp passwords are not the same as the Web page
   passwords used to access the private pages. There is a shared, group
   ftp user name and password for all SOC private page users. There is
   also another shared, group ftp user name and password for the Project
   page users. We are currently working on integrating the ftp access
   controls with the Web page access controls.

   MAIL EXPLODERS:
   E-mail aliases are provided to ease communication with groups within
   the WFC3 Project. Project and SOC members should refer to the User's
   Manuals posted on their respective private pages for additional
   information.

   Detailed listings of recipients are available from the "E-mail Alias"
   web page within the private pages.

   LISTSERVER/NEWSLETTER:
   A listserver-based mailing list is supported for the automatic
   broadcast of periodic announcements. Listserver mailing lists are
   similar to aliases in that mailings to the listserver are re-mailed to
   the entire list. With listservers, users are added or removed from the
   list by subscribing and unsubscribing (membership in the list is not
   manually controlled or regulated). The mailing list can be reached by
   sending mail to:


   wfc3-info For public WFC3 information. This site is advertised on the
   public web page. Submissions to this list are restricted to list owner.
   Please send all potential newsletter information to Kathy Glasser
   (glasser@stars.gsfc.nasa.gov).

   To subscribe:
   To subscribe to a mailing list, send e-mail with the word "subscribe"
   in the body to: wfc3-info@wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov

   An e-mail will be sent out with additional information.

   To unsubscribe:
   To unsubscribe from a mailing list, send e-mail with the word
   "unsubscribe" in the body to: wfc3-info@wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov

   BACKUPS:
   All files that reside at the wfc3.gsfc.nasa.gov site are backed up
   nightly to a hot spare disk.
