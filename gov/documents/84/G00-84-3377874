The Problem

   Our nationâ€™s roadway facilities have become so overloaded that they
   have adversely impacted the quality of life.  Congestion on our urban
   freeways and arterials is increasing at an alarming rate, increasing
   the potential for accidents, undesired long delays, adverse pollutants,
   increased operating costs and adverse sociological effects.

The Goal

   There is a strong push to enhance our transportation infrastructure so
   that we can overcome congestion without having to build additional
   lanes of highway.  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been
   developed and advanced transportation management and control efforts
   have begun and will continue to escalate so as to provide remedial
   measures for traffic congestion and options for improving traffic
   operations.

The "Big" Challenge

   As our transportation system becomes more sophisticated and complex
   coupled with limited resources available, transportation professionals
   must adopt innovative ways of managing existing systems more
   efficiently.  As we deploy the highly sophisticated technologies of
   hardware and software systems, there will be an increasing need to:
     * Fully understand, evaluate and optimize traffic flow patterns
     * Dynamically modify traffic signal timing patterns in response to
       increasing traffic demands
     * Be able to respond to recurring and non-recurring congestion in
       real time (being proactive rather than reactive)
     * Be able to predict and evaluate the outcome of various response
       plans
     * Assist TMC operators in their decision making by developing
       strategies/plans on-line and in real time or off-line
     * Integrate freeways and surface streets with various control and
       management strategies
     * Predict and evaluate responses to various sources of traveler
       information

Traffic Analysis Tools and Models

    Traffic models will help engineers and managers to:
     * Evaluate the various ITS strategies and courses of action
     * Aid in decision process of alternative evaluation of design and
       operational improvements
     * Decrease cost, time, and disruption to traffic
     * Understand/manage traffic by analyzing simple or complex problems
       and scenario building
     * Test new and innovative transportation management systems concepts
       without the inconvenience of a field experiment.

   Currently, there is a variety of traffic and transportation engineering
   analysis tools for professionals to use for evaluating and improving
   congested roadway facilities.  The use of these tools or models in the
   design and evaluation of transportation facilities will result in
   safer, more efficient, and cost-effective transportation systems.

   Numerous traffic models have been developed to simulate traffic (e.g.,
   emulate real-time traffic conditions), evaluate and determine traffic
   operations (e.g., provide a detailed analysis of proposed designs and
   operational improvements), and optimize signal timings (e.g., develop
   signal timing plans to improve traffic flow on arterials and networks
   and reduce unnecessary stops, delay and fuel consumption).
