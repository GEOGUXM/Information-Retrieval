   ***********************************************************
   At the time the scheduling error was realized, the BB sequence was in
   mid
   execution. The decision was made to let the activity run its course to
   allow for the collection of any resulting calibration data.

   Maneuvers:

   The next MODIS Lunar Calibration via a spacecraft roll maneuver is
   scheduled for February 3rd, 2002 (2002/032) with data collection from
   20:19:21 to 20:25:51. The roll angle will be -3.4357 degrees. .

   A Drag Make-Up (DMU) maneuver of 17 seconds on Wednesday, January 9,
   2002, at 20:12:40, completed successfully.

   The Inclination Adjust Maneuver (2 of 6), originally scheduled for
   January 16, 2002, was postponed. The EOC required a network
   reconfiguration to solve sporadic network anomalies recently witnessed
   by the FOT. The IAM will be rescheduled for some time in the next two
   weeks.

   The DMU planned to follow the IAM by one week was advanced to
   Wednesday, January 16, 2002, at 15:39:00 for 14 seconds. DMU Maneuvers
   are much shorter and less complex than IAMs, as no attitude changes or
   significant instrument re-configurations are required. Therefore, the
   maneuver was deemed safe and not susceptible to major impact by the
   sporadic network events. As a safety precaution, Terra Flight
   Operations Team (FOT) personnel were stationed in the backup EOC to
   take over operational responsibility in the event of any problems.
   There were no network issues during the maneuver.

   The IOT has been notified that the Terra Deep Space Calibration
   Maneuver has been postponed once again. The maneuver is not expected to
   be performed until late summer of 2002 at the earliest. The reasoning
   for this delay was to allow the EOS Operations Center (EOC) time to
   adjust to operating Terra and Aqua spacecraft simultaneously.

   MODIS Anomalies:

   ***********************************************************
   At the end of last week, we scheduled our set of monthly calibrations
   for January. These included SDSM, SRCA, and BB calibrations. An error
   was made when scheduling these activities and B-side SRCA and BB
   calibrations were scheduled instead of A-side calibrations. The SDSM
   calibrations were scheduled (A side) correctly.

   The BB activities ran as scheduled which turns on the B-side
   calibration electronics, turns on the B-side blackbody heater circuit,
   sets the BB temperature to a variety of values, and toggles the BB
   heater duty cycle.

   The B-side SRCA calibrations did not run because there is no
   cross-strapping capability between PS1 and SRCA B-side. The SRCA
   commands were issued (which will cause the motor step numbers to
   change), but no SRCA components were actually powered.

   There are two problems with what occurred:

   1) The calibrations did not execute as intended. The SRCA calibrations
   were not executed; they need to be rescheduled. The MODIS IOT is
   waiting for MCST to either verify that the B-side BB activity was
   suffice or if they would prefer an A-side BB calibration?

   2) We had not powered the instrument B-side components since the PS2
   shutdown anomaly last June. There was concern as to whether or not any
   of the B-side loads had been damaged and as a result would further
   damage other components if powered. Based on the observed telemetry,
   the B-side BB calibration performed nominally without affecting other
   components, but we did not wish to take this route until necessary.

   We have identified means to prevent such a mishap from occurring again:

   1) Be more verbose in our scheduling notification E-mails to include
   the full name of the calibration being performed: i.e. "SRCA A-side
   Full Radiometric" instead of just "SRCA Full Radiometric". This would
   provide an opportunity for other team members to spot the scheduling
   error in time to change the command load.

   2) Add additional MMS constraint checking abilities to the MODIS
   resources. This would involve adding a new scheduling resource for the
   instrument configuration (A-side, B-side, or Cross-strapped). Then,
   constraints would be defined to warn the team if an A-side calibration
   was scheduled while the instrument was in a B-side configuration. This
   feature would take some time to develop, but it would be autonomous
   once in place.

   We have some additional analysis to perform to gather all of the
   telemetry from last week's calibrations and will let you know if we
   identify anything out of the ordinary. We apologize for this error and
   will do our best to ensure it does not happen again.

   Formatter Error Events:

   The Formatter Error Count has now passed 9 Million Events.

   The Formatter Error Rate has been fairly steady for the past few weeks
   with the counter rollover time approximately every seven hours and five
   minutes.

   Error tracking spreadsheets have been updated and can be retrieved
   from:

   ftp://mcstweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/pub/permanent/IOT/am1/analysis/FR_event
   s/

   An MS Excel spreadsheet called, AM1_FR_error_rollovers_MMDDYY.xls
   contains the data for the times each of the error count "roll over"
   occurs (with the MMDDYY denoting the date the spreadsheet was made, the
   more recent date containing the most up-to-date information).

   General Instrument Comments:

   MODIS is in Science Mode on the A-side with the SVD and NAD open,
   operating with the Formatter Resolution Flight Software Patches
   (FRFSP).

   MODIS Telemetry Trends: No abnormal telemetry trends are being
   observed.
