   The Northwest Fisheries Science Center is the Pacific Northwest
   regional research center of NOAA Fisheries, the National Marine
   Fisheries Service. The NWFSC is responsible for providing scientific
   and technical support for the management, conservation, and development
   of the Pacific Northwest region's anadromous and marine fishery
   resources and their habitats. The NWFSC's five divisions conduct
   applied research to resolve problems that threaten these resources or
   that impede their use. The Center conducts research programs to develop
   the scientific base required for reports on status of stocks and of
   fisheries, environmental assessment and environmental impact statements
   for management plans and international negotiations; and pursues
   research to answer specific management needs in habitat conservation,
   endangered and protected species, aquaculture, and full utilization of
   harvested fish.

   Research is conducted in cooperation with federal, state, and local
   agencies, tribal groups, universities and other fishery groups. The
   Center is located in Seattle, near the University of Washington, with
   facilities at Manchester, Mukilteo and Pasco, Washington; Newport and
   Hammond, Oregon; and Kodiak, Alaska. Follow this link to learn more
   about our research programs.
