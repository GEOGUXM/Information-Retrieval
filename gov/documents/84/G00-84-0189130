         Fogle v. William Chevrolet/Geo, Inc., ___ F.3d ___, (No. 01-1427)(7th
         Cir. 2001)(Dec. 26, 2001).
            The circuit court, in an opinion written by Judge Posner, reduced
         both the number of hours as well as the hourly rate (from $310 to $185)
         in determining an adequate attorney fee in a fee shifting situation.
         The court noted that there is no single, market-wide fee for a given
         case, and thus, a judge must consider the quality of the particular
         lawyer as well as the amount of time that he devoted to the case. "The
         best evidence of the lawyer's quality is the fee he commands in the
         market,...but such evidence may not be available if the lawyer is
         usually compensated by a-court-awarded fee,... ." The court noted that,
         "Given the well-known informational problems in the legal-services
         market, a lawyer's ability to persuade the very occasional client to
         pay a very high hourly rate is poor evidence of the lawyer's market
         value." Finally, the court noted that in the absence of a reliable
         market test of the attorney in questions own services, he had to show
         that lawyers of comparable ability commanded the rate he was asking the
         judge to assess. The lawyer in the instant case submitted the affidavit
         of a lawyer which failed to impress the circuit court and referred to
         as a "self-serving evaluation" which was "worthless and inadmissible
         under Daubert... ." "There are almost a million lawyers in the United
         States, and if [the] affidavit counts as evidence there will never be a
         case in which a lawyer can't produce the paid affidavit of another
         lawyer that his market value is whatever he says it is."

                           ___________________________________

         Rodriquez v. Bowhead Transportation Co., ___ F.3d ___, (9th Cir.
         2001)(No. 00-35280)(Oct. 26, 2001).
            At issue here was who was responsible for liability in a borrowed
         employee setting when there is a "time charter." Barrett Business
         Services (Barrett), a temporary labor supplier provided longshoring
         services (including employee/claimant Mr. Rodriquez) to Northland
         Services, Inc.(Northland), a stevedoring company. The stevedoring
         company was loading a barge owned by Foss Maritime Company(Foss) when
         Claimant was injured. Bowhead Transportation Company (Bowhead), a
         common carrier, had arranged for transportation of cargo via a Standard
         Terminal Services Agreement with Northland.
            Bowhead did not own or operate the loading dock and Bowhead was not
         involved in the loading of cargo on the barge. Under the agreement
         Bowhead was to provide the barge and Northland was to provide use of
         its loading terminal and load Bowhead's cargo on the barge. Bowhead did
         not own or operate any of the vessels used to transport cargo. Instead,
         it contracted with Foss in 1995 to provide and operate the necessary
         vessels each year in a "time charter."
            Bowhead had limited involvement in loading the barge. Bowhead gave
         Northland a load plan, identifying which cargo was to be delivered at
         which port. Claimant asserts that his injury occurred when Northland
         employees loaded some cargo in an incorrect order and had to rearrange
         if on the barge deck while other workers were continuing to load the
         rest of the cargo. No Bowhead representative was supervising the
         loading when Claimant was injured.
            Claimant brought an action against Northland and Foss. The district
         court held that Claimant was a borrowed employee of Northland and that
         his sole remedy was workers' compensation under the LHWCA. The District
         Court granted Northland's Motion for Summary Judgment. Claimant then
         brought an action against Bowhead. Bowhead argued that it could not be
         sued for negligence under the LHWCA and that even if it could be sued,
         there was no evidence it breached any duty owed to Claimant. The
         district court granted Bowhead's summary judgment motion and dismissed.
            The Ninth Circuit held that under Section 905(b), a "time charterer"
         can be sued as a "vessel." "Our cases make no distinction between
         charters and shipowners as far as who is a "vessel" under the LHWCA."
         Therefore, the "claimant" can bring a 905(b) negligence action against
         the company.
         [ED. NOTE: The Ninth circuit also dealt with the issue of whether
         Bowhead breached a duty under the LHWCA, but that issue is not germain
         to this Digest.]

                           ___________________________________

         Alexander v. Director, OWCP, ___ F.3d ___, (9th Cir. 2001)(No.
         00-70762)(December 19, 2001).
            Under Section 3(e), in a last responsible employer case, settlements
         with prior employers for long term exposure injury are not to be
         credited against the amount owed by the last responsible employer. The
         Ninth Circuit found that as Section 3(e) refers only to payments made
         under "other workers' compensation laws," the statute provides no
         credit for settlements made under the statute itself. The Ninth Circuit
         also found that the last responsible employer's argument that Section
         14(j) should be read in light of Section 2(22) to authorize credit, is
         mistaken. "The plain language of Section 14(j) authorizes credit for
         compensation advances made only by "the employer," not "the
         employer(s)." Further, Section 33(f) can not be used to secure credit
         here since it "is limited to the situation in which the third party is
         potentially responsible to both the employee and the covered employer."
         Finally, the circuit court found that the last responsible employer
         could not argue that it was entitled to credit by way of the credit
         doctrine. The credit doctrine, created by the Board does not refer to
         settlements of the kind at issue here. The settlements that the
         claimant here received were alternative to an entire award against any
         one of the three settling employers, who might have been liable for an
         entire award if found to be the claimant's last responsible employer.
         "The credit doctrine, an equitable creation, cannot here trump the
         plain words of § 903(e).

                           ___________________________________

         Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. Wiggins,
         (Unpublished)(No. 00-2532)(December 14, 2001).
            Here, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the ALJ's award of total
         disability benefits to the claimant. Employer had argued that
         Claimant's part-time job as a newspaper carrier constituted "suitable
         alternate employment." In upholding the award, the Fourth Circuit
         agreed that the newspaper route did not establish a continuing ability
         to earn wages. The evidence showed that Claimant experienced problems
         with her hands, wrists and knee, and that it swelled and gave way if
         she walked too much or too quickly. It further showed that she
         sometimes received help from her children in carrying out her duties.
         Furthermore, her doctor noted that the carrier job was causing her "a
         lot of pain in her knee" and he prescribed medication and a knee brace
         to ease the pain and stabilize her knee.
         [Topic 8.2.4 Partial Disability/Suitable Alternate Employment]
                           ___________________________________

         Pool Co., v. Cooper, ___ F.3d ___ (Nos. 99-60615, 00-60093)(Nov. 20,
         2001).
            The Fifth Circuit held: (1) a claim for additional benefits filed by
         a claimant could not be deemed an impermissible protective filing
         against speculative future injuries; (2) the regulation permitting an
         LHWCA claimant to withdraw his claim applies only when a claimant seeks
         to withdraw the entirety of his claim for benefits, rather than to
         modify it with respect to dates or categories of disability; (3) the
         Board erred in awarding attorney fees to the claimant under the statute
         authorizing such an award when the employer has paid compensation
         without an award and the claimant subsequently obtains a compensation
         award in excess of what employer was willing to pay; and (4) the
         claimant was entitled to an attorney fee award under another section of
         the LHWCA.
            Here there was no protective filing since the claim arose from a
         specific injury which was identified on the claim form and since the
         claimant had not attained MMI. The court distinguished the instant case
         from Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v.Asbestos Health Claimants, 17 F.3d
         130 (5th Cir. 1994), noting that in Ingalls, the claimants had endured
         exposure to asbestos but "as yet suffered neither physical nor economic
         disability." In the instant case, there existed substantial evidence
         from which the ALJ could infer that at the time the claim was filed, he
         was undergoing continuing treatment for his original injury in the hope
         of improving his condition, and he and his physicians reasonably
         believed that he had not attained maximum medical improvement after
         all.
            In a matter of first impression, the Fifth Circuit held that the
         withdrawal regulation, 20 CFR §702.225(a), applies only to the
         withdrawal of a claim, not to the situation where a claimant seeks to
         modify a claim with respect to dates or categories of disability.
            Under Section 28(b), the Fifth Circuit found that an attorney fee
         could not be awarded where no informal conference with OWCP had taken
         place. Significantly, the court stated, "However, as the parties
         concur, no informal conference with the [DOL] ever took place. Under
         the law of our Circuit, that fact poses an absolute bar to an award of
         attorney's fees under § 28(b). See FMC Corp. v. Perez, 128 F.3d 908,
         910 (5th Cir. 1997); accord Staftex Staffing v. Director, OWCP, 237
         F.3d 404, 409 (5th Cir. 2000), modified on rehearing, 237 F.3d 409 (5th
         Cir.2000); James J. Flanagan Stevedores v. Director, OWCP, 219 F.3d
         426, 434-35 (5th Cir. 2000)." The court would not entertain the
         claimant's arguments on this issue: "We see no need to entertain these
         arguments, not only because of our obligation to follow the established
         law of our Circuit, ... ,but because we find that an award of
         attorney's fees is proper under § 28(a)."

         Owens v. Seariver Maritime, Inc., ___ F.3d ___, (No. 00-60048)
         (November 26, 2001).
         [ED. NOTE: This non-LHWCA seaman case is included for informational
         purposes only.]
            At issue in this FLSA claim is whether or not a claimant performed a
         substantial amount of non-seaman's work, thus preventing him from
         properly being considered a seaman for purposes of the maximum hour
         provisions of the FLSA. Workers employed as seaman under 29 U.S.C. §
         213(b)(6) are exempt from FLSA coverage as to maximum hour and overtime
         provisions. The FLSA does not define "seaman." Although barge tenders
         are seamen under the FLSA, industrial workers on dredge barges are not.
         The definition of "seaman" under the FLSA is narrower than that used in
         the Jones Act and the definitions under the two acts are separate and
         independent of each other. Under the FLSA, when a worker performs both
         seaman's work and non-seaman's work, he is a seaman unless his
         non-seaman's work is substantial in amount. DOL h, for FLSA purposes,
         has defined "substantial" as work that "occupies more than 20 percent
         of the time worked by the employee during the workweek."
            B. Federal District Court
                           ___________________________________

         Olsen v. Ms. Alexis Herman, et al, (No. 00-3165 MMC)(N. Dist.of
         CA)(Oct. 31, 2001).
         [ED. NOTE: This matter is presently unpublished.]
            In this matter, the employer filed a Section 22 Modification Request
         challenging the claimant's entitlement to benefits. The claimant
         resisted the employer's move to affect his benefits. During the course
         of considering the modification request, the claimant sued members of
         the Department of Labor, OWCP, OALJ, and members of the Board. The
         Federal District Court ruled that a claimant cannot sue the above noted
         persons for rulings made in the course of considering the challenge to
         the claimant's benefits. "ALJs and judges serving on the BRB are
         entitled to absolute immunity for performing judicial acts."
            The federal district court went on to state that "As the Court
         previously ruled in its Order filed December 21, 2000, the LHWCA
         provides the exclusive procedures for the determination of benefits
         available under the LHWCA. Courts have repeatedly held that the
         comprehensive nature of the LHWCA's administrative review scheme, its
         limited provision for district court jurisdiction, and its legislative
         history, purpose, and design preclude subject matter jurisdiction in
         district courts over claims for injunctive relief arising out of
         compensation proceedings under the LHWCA." The court found that it
         lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims against the federal
         defendants for injunctive relief and dismissed these claims.
            Besides noting the federal defendants immunity, the court
         specifically rejected the plaintiff's claims for 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981,
         1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988 damages, finding that these claims fall for a
         variety of reasons.

         Sistrunk v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., ___ BRBS ___, (BRB No.
         01-298)(Nov. 26, 2001).
            A prima facie case (lung cancer plus asbestos at the shipyard) does
         not result in recovery once the Section 20(a) presumption falls out and
         the medical evidence shows that there is no asbestosis. Here, the Board
         noted that in denying the claimant's claim for death benefits based on
         the record in its entirety, the ALJ found that the decedent's death was
         not caused, contributed to, or aggravated by his exposure to asbestos
         at the employer's facility, but was caused by carcinoma, cancer,
         related to his history of cigarette smoking. Of particular importance
         was a medical opinion stating that in the absence of asbestosis, lung
         cancer cannot be attributable to exposure to asbestos and that there
         was no lung parenchyma available for the evaluation of the presence or
         absence of asbestosis.
         [ED. NOTE: The term "lung cancer" should not be construed as including
         mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung. One can have
         mesothelioma without also having asbestosis.]

         Jensen v. Weeks Marine, Inc., ___ BRBS ___, (BRB No. 01-0532)(Nov. 30,
         2001).
            At issue in this matter, on its third ALJ and second Decision and
         Order on Remand, whether an employer is entitled to a modification of
         an existing disability award. Specifically, the ALJ found that the
         employer did not present sufficient evidence of suitable alternate
         employment to warrant modification of the award of total disability.
         Additionally the ALJ had declined to address whether the claimant's
         physical condition had changed/improved as employer conceded that the
         claimant could not return to his previous work, and there is
         insufficient evidence of suitable alternate employment to alter the
         claimant's totally disabling condition.
            The Board remanded this matter once again, for several reasons.
         Pertinent here, the Board, distinguished Lombardi v. Universal Maritime
         Service Corp., 32 BRBS 83 (1998)(When an employer presents no evidence
         of extenuating circumstances that prevented it from doing so, or of a
         change in the claimant's economic position, the employer is not
         entitled to a modification based on evidence of the current
         availability of jobs. Under these circumstances, the new submission
         reflects nothing more than a change in litigation strategy for which
         modification is not available.) The Board noted that the instant
         employer presented evidence of suitable alternate employment at the
         initial hearing, and, on modification, put forth evidence of a change
         in the claimant's economic position, i.e., evidence of the claimant's
         subsequent cooperation and of an improvement in the local labor market.
            Further, the Board found that, on remand, the ALJ must also fully
         consider the effect of the claimant's subsequent cooperation with the
         employer's vocational experts, and may, if necessary, elect to reopen
         the record for submission of additional relevant evidence, previously
         excluded on this issue.

         II. Black Lung Benefits Act
            A. Circuit Courts of Appeals
            In Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Summers, ___ F.3d ___, Case No.
         01-1430 (7th Cir. 2001), the court held that the ALJ properly invoked
         the 15 year presumption at 30 U.S.C. § 921(c)(4) having found that the
         miner's work at the surface of the mine was under "conditions
         substantially similar to those in an underground coal mine." The ALJ
         found "similarity" based on the miner's unrefuted testimony about his
         employment conditions. The miner worked as an electrician in the mines
         during some of his coal mine employment but most of his work "occurred
         when he worked inside the offices and shops that were built above
         ground on the coal company's property." The court found that the miner
         described, in detail, the dusty conditions in his work areas and it
         noted the following:

           Summers intermittently labored underground or in buildings located
           atop subterranean coal mines, performing tasks inexorably
           intertwined with coal production. Therefore, he is a miner,
           according to the regulations, and we will not require him to prove
           similarity in a different manner merely because he did not wield a
           pickaxe and a shovel while he worked.

         Id.
            Applying the pre-amendment regulations at 20 C.F.R. §
         725.101(a)(32), the court utilized the 125-day rule to determine the
         miner's length of coal mine employment. In satisfying this requirement,
         the court stated the following:

           Summers was not required to establish that he worked underground for
           more than 125 days per annum. See Landes v. Director, OWCP, 997 F.2d
           1192, 1198 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting Yauk v. Director, OWCP, 912 F.2d
           192, 195 (8th Cir. 1989)). Nor did he have to prove that he was
           around surface coal dust for a full eight hours a day on any given
           day for that day to count towards the 125-day total. (citation
           omitted). All that Summers had to show was that he worked in or
           around a coal mine' for any part of 125 days in a calendar year, for
           a total of 15 years. This he unquestionably did, by demonstrating
           that he was exposed to worked-related dust five or six days each
           week from May 1948 to April 1965 and from April 1975 to October
           1980. On this record, we conclude that the ALJ properly invoked the
           15-year presumption.

         Id. The court further upheld the ALJ's weighing of the medical opinion
         evidence concluding that the ALJ properly accorded greater weight to
         the opinion of Dr. Cohen "particularly in light of his remarkable
         clinical experience and superior knowledge of cutting-edge research."
            The court also found that the ALJ properly gave less weight to the
         opinions of Dr. Fino "based on a finding that they were not supported
         by adequate data or sound analysis." Of importance, the court made
         reference to the comments to the amended regulations and stated the
         following:

           Dr. Fino stated in his written report of August 30, 1998 that there
           is no good clinical evidence in the medical literature that coal
           dust inhalation in and of itself causes significant obstructive lung
           disease.' (citation omitted). During a rulemaking proceeding, the
           Department of Labor considered a similar presentation by Dr. Fino
           and concluded that his opinions are not in accord with the
           prevailing view of the medical community or the substantial weight
           of the medical and scientific literature."

                           ___________________________________

            By unpublished decision in Consolidation Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP
         [Wasson], Case No. 98-1533 (4th Cir. Nov. 13, 2001), the court upheld
         the ALJ's use of the American Medical Association's Guides to the
         Evaluation of Permanent Impairment to conclude that a miner's "single
         breath diffusing capacity (DLCO) study was abnormal." A conflict arose
         in the interpretation of the test:

           Dr. Rasmussen questioned the lower predicted value used by Dr.
           Bercher's laboratory in the 1991 test, stating that he believed that
           the claimant's diffusing capacity on that test would be abnormal if
           a higher predicted value was used. Thus, a controversy arose as to
           whether the claimant's actual performance on the 1991 test was
           within normal or abnormal range, i.e., whether the lower predicted
           value was in fact the appropriate or correct value against which to
           measure the claimant's test result.

         Id. The ALJ properly notified the parties that the AMA guidelines would
         be used to determine the proper predicted value for the test. Employer
         objected to the use of the AMA guides because "inter-laboratory
         differences" would render the AMA guidelines unreliable. The court
         disagreed, however, and held that the guide already takes such
         differences into account. Consequently, the court concluded that "the
         employer had adequate notice yet offered no specific evidence to show
         that the use of the AMA guide was unfair or inaccurate when applied to
         the case at hand."
            Turning to medical opinion evidence, the court noted that "[i]n his
         practice of pulmonary medicine, Dr. Rasmussen had examined some 24,000
         to 25,000 miners, and the employer conceded on the record that he is an
         expert in his field." Dr. Rasmussen found that the miner suffered from
         obstructive and restrictive impairments arising from coal dust exposure
         and smoking. The court determined that his opinion was supported by the
         objective medical data of record. On the other hand, the court agreed
         that Dr. Fino's opinion was entitled to less weight. Dr. Fino concluded
         that the miner did not suffer from a restrictive or interstitial
         disease because his diffusing capacity values were normal which "rules
         out the presence of clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis, and
         pneumoconiosis is an example of a pulmonary fibrosis." However, the ALJ
         properly found that the diffusing capacity values were abnormal
         according to the AMA guidelines and, therefore, Dr. Fino's conclusions
         were accorded less weight.

            B. Benefits Review Board
            In Cornett v. Arch of Kentucky, Inc., 22 B.L.R. 1-___, BRB No.
         01-0276 BLA (Nov. 28, 2001), a case arising in the Sixth Circuit, the
         Board upheld retroactive application of the amended medical treatment
         dispute regulations at 20 C.F.R. § 725.101(e) to determine whether the
         miner's medical bills were related to his respiratory impairment
         arising from coal dust exposure. Employer argued that the regulations
         adopted the Fourth Circuit's presumption set forth in Doris Coal Co. v.
         Director, OWCP [Stiltner], 938 F.2d 492 (4th Cir. 1991) which was
         specifically rejected by the Sixth Circuit in Seals v. Glen Coal Co.,
         147 F.3d 502 (6th Cir. 1998). Citing to the district court's ruling in
         United Mining Ass'n. v. Chao, 160 F.Supp.2d 47 (D.D.C. 2001), the Board
         upheld the validity of the revised regulation which provides that any
         pulmonary disorder for which treatment is required is presumed to be
         caused or aggravated by the miner's condition. The Board further noted
         that Employer's burden to defend against the "compensability of the
         disputed expenses" has not been altered. Turning to the merits of the
         case, the Board upheld the ALJ's finding that the miner's
         hospitalization was related to his coal dust induced lung disease
         notwithstanding the fact that the records did not specifically "reflect
         treatment for pneumoconiosis." The ALJ noted that the miner's chronic
         obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis had been found to
         be related to coal dust exposure and, therefore, because his
         hospitalization records reflected treatment for such a disease, the
         costs were compensable. Moreover, it was proper to give little weight
         to Dr. Branscomb's opinion that the medical expenses were not
         compensable because his opinion was premised on a finding that the
         miner did not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis.

                           ___________________________________

            By unpublished decision in Howard v. Valley Camp Coal Co., BRB No.
         00-1034 BLA (Aug. 22, 2001) (unpub.), a case arising in the Fourth
         Circuit, the Board held that a survivor was not entitled to application
         of collateral estoppel to preclude re-litigation of the existence of
         pneumoconiosis. Under the facts of the case, Employer did not contest
         the existence of pneumoconiosis in the miner's claim and benefits were
         ultimately awarded. Citing to Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, 211,
         F.3d 203 (4th Cir. 2000) and Penn Allegheny Coal Co. v. Williams, 114
         F.3d 22 (3d Cir. 1997), the Board noted that, subsequent to
         adjudication of the miner's claim, the Fourth Circuit changed the
         standard for establishing the presence of pneumoconiosis and required
         that all relevant evidence under 20 C.F.R. § 718.202(a) be weighed
         together in making such a determination. As a result, the issue to be
         litigated in the survivor's claim was not "identical to the one
         previously litigated" and, therefore, collateral estoppel was
         inapplicable.
