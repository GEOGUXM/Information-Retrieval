   We offer Basic and Advanced options for BLAST-searching our database to
   find sequences closely-related to a query sequence. Both options use
   version 2.0 of BLAST, which allows gaps in aligning sequences.

   BLAST searches are performed on the non-redundant database (see
   Curation) of nucleotide and protein sequences.
