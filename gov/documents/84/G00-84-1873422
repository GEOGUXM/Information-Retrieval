   Status Information for Awards in Process

   The purpose of this section is to provide status information for all
   grant/cooperative agreement awards currently in process within the
   GSFC.  Status information is based on Procurement Requests (PRs)
   initiated in the GSFC's automated Small Purchasing System (SPS).
   Requests for additional information should be forwarded to the
   following e-mail address: Grants@POP200.GSFC.NASA.gov

   Your inquiry should include the PR Number assigned to your action,
   which is available on the status page, and provide a clear, concise
   statement of the information you are requesting. We will make every
   effort to respond to your inquiries within 2 business days.

   Information on individual procurement actions is grouped by (1) the
   overall program which will provide funding for the grant/agreement, or
   (2) alphabetical order according to Principal Investigator's Last name.
   The content for both listings is identical.

   SPECIAL NOTE: Any PR generated outside of GSFC's automated system (e.g.
   supplements to GSFC grants awarded prior to August 1996) will not be
   included on this page at this time.
