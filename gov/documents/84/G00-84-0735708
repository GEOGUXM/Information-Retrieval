   reviewing and implementing County wetland policies, regulations and
   programs.

   Introduction to Wetlands
   Cattails and Sitka spruce, salamanders and great blue herons,
   white-tailed deer and juvenile salmon - wetlands are overflowing with
   life. In all, some 212 species of wildlife and many species of plant
   life depend on western Washington's wetlands for survival.

   individual parcels. See the map below to query wetland data.

   Hydrography - Interactive Map
   Note: this link will open two new browser windows
   View and query GIS datasets including the King County General Wetlands
   Survey. Individual wetlands in this dataset may be queried using the
   Arc IMS Query tool tool to identify wetland size and wetland rating
   referred to in sections 21A.24.320 to 21A.24.350 of the King County
   code.

   King County Code>>Environmentally Sensitive Areas (Acrobat PDF format)
   County rules on development standards, restrictions, and requirements

   sensitive areas. Codes pertaining specifically to wetlands can be found
   under sections 21A.24.320 to 21A.24.350 of this document.

   Wetland and Stream Reporting Guidelines
   Guidelines to help residents prepare wetland and stream reports that
   are sometimes required for development permits. Provided by the
   Department of Development and Environmental Services.

   Characteristics of the low-elevation Sphagnum-dominated peatlands of
   western Washington: a community profile

   Wetland Mitigation Banking
   A mitigation bank site is a property purchased and converted to a
   wetland by a public agency or utility to earn credits to compensate for
   wetland damage at another site, usually from development by other
   agencies, utilities, or private developers. See a summary of Mitigation
   Banking Rules.

   Read about the Aquatic Greenhouse Natural Treatment: Aquatic Greenhouse
   This page describes a natural secondary treatment system that will rely
   on wetland plants and microbes to cleanse nutrient-rich wastewater, so
   the water can be reused. Construction of the aquatic greenhouse is a
   collaborative project between King County, Friends of Issaquah Salmon
   Hatchery (FISH), Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, and
   the City of Issaquah.

   King Conservation District Wetland Plant Cooperative
   The Wetland Plant Cooperative is home to native wetland plants grown
   from local seed. The Cooperative provides wetland emergents, shrubs and
   trees to community groups and government doing wetland and stream
   restoration.

   Purple Loosestrife - a Threat to Wetlands
   Purple loosestrife is not native to this area, has no natural enemies
   and provides little or no habitat value to fish or wildlife.
   Loosestrife is very prolific and can overtake wetland areas, replacing
   valuable native plants like sedges and bulrushes.

   Wetland Education Project
   Students learned about wetlands through hands-on experience, completing
   an interpretive sign while benefitting the environment and the
   community by sharing their knowledge and enhancing the existing
   wetland.
