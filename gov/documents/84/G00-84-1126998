   RULE OF THUMB:The Department which creates or receives the record is
   ALWAYS responsible for maintaining the 'record' copy of the document or
   information.

   These schedules are organized by Department and must be used with
   NARA's General Record Schedules, which deal with federal records common
   to most agencies. The first section of the OPIC Schedules deals with
   Administrative Files which are records common to most OPIC Departments.

   Abbreviations used in this volume are:
     * CF = Central Files
     * FIRMR = Federal Information Resource Management Regulations
     * GRS = General Records Schedules (NARA)
     * N/A = Non-applicable
     * NARA = National Archives & Records Administration
     * TBD = To Be Determined
     * WNRC = Washington National Records Center.

   Please direct comments and questions to:
     * Lena Paulsen, Manager, Information Center, X. 8565
     * Carol Brock, Records Management Consultant, X. 8563
