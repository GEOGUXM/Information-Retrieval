   Letter of Intent for Drell-Yan Measurements of Nucleon and Nuclear
   Structure with the FNAL Main Injector. The E866 Collaboration ( D. F.
   Geesaman Spokesman for 120 GeV Measurements.) April 15, 1998 Abstract
   We propose to make precise measurements of the fractional momentum (x)
   distributions of the ratio of d-antiquarks to u-antiquarks in the
   proton, _d=_u, using proton induced Drell-Yan reactions at 120 GeV.
   Recent E866 measurements unexpectedly suggest considerable x dependence
   in this ratio at x ?0.2. High intensity primary proton beams from the
   Main Injector make it possible to extend the x range of the E866
   measurements with high precision. The apparatus will also be used to
   precisely measure the change in the _u distributions in nuclear targets
   at x ?0.2. Contents 1 Introduction 2 2 Physics Discussion 4 2.1 _d=_u

   Introduction While proton structure functions have been measured in
   deep inelastic scattering over ranges of five-orders-of-magnitude in
   both the fractional momentum of the parton, x, and the virtuality of
   the incident photon, Q2, the underlying non-perturbative parton
   distributions must be determined by phenomenological fits e.g. [1, 2].
   Each time new data have tested underlying assumptions of the
   phenomenology that were unconstrained by known symmetries, the
   phenomenology has been found wanting. For example, no known symmetry
   requires the equality of the _d and _u distributions in the proton,
   but, until 1991, this was a common assumption. Following the NMC
   observation [3] that the integral of _d \Gamma _u is non-zero, NA51 [4]
   used the Drell-Yan process to confirm this difference and E866 [5, 6]
   recently measured the x dependence of _d=_u and _d \Gamma _u from 0:03
   ! x ! 0:32. The E866 results for_ d=_u are shown in Figure 1 along with
   the NA51 result and the CTEQ4M prediction [1] for this quantity.
   Fundamentally, the nucleon structure functions are non-perturbative
   manifestations of Quantum Chromodynamics. While perturbative QCD
   quantitatively describes the Q2 evolution of the parton distributions,
   the parton distributions themselves have not proved amenable to QCD
   treatment, although many models exist in the literature. Because first
   principle calculations of parton distributions have to date proven
   intractable, measurements of those distributions that are poorly
   determined provide vital information on nucleon structure which is used
   to constrain and refine the phenomenology. For example, the MRST [7]
   collaboration has already incorporated the E866 results in their new
   global fits yielding sea and valence distributions that differ
   substantially from previous parameterizations. 2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4

   FNAL E866 results[5] for the x dependence of the ratio _d=_u of the
   proton at a mass scale of 7.35 GeV. The curve represents the CTEQ4M
   parameterization[1]. The square is the NA51 result at a mass scale of
   5.2 GeV [4] We propose to make precise measurements of proton-induced
   Drell-Yan cross sections on hydrogen and deuterium. These measurements
   will determine _dp=_up for 0:1 ! x ! 0:5. The measurements on deuterium
   are also directly sensitive to _dp + _up over this same range. We also
   propose to measure proton-induced Drell-Yan cross sections on nuclear
   targets. Our present knowledge of the flavor dependence of the nuclear
   parton distributions limits the understanding of the nuclear
   dependences that have been observed. (e.g. [8]). These nuclear
   measurements also provide a direct comparison with neutrino data on
   nuclear targets which are currently used to measure_ d + _u. Our
   results could have implications in other areas. For example, in
   proton-proton collider experiments the highest energy scales are
   achieved via q _q annihilation of large x partons. New information,
   especially about the flavor dependence of high x proton antiquark
   distributions could become important in understanding new phenomena at
   the LHC. 3 2 Physics Discussion To lowest order, the Drell-Yan process,
   virtual photon production in hadronhadron collisions, depends on the
   product of quark and antiquark distributions in the beam and target as:
   doe dx1dx2 = 4ssff2 9sx1x2 Xi e 2i (qbi (x1; Q2)_qti (x2; Q2) + _qbi
   (x1; Q2)qti (x2; Q2)) (1) where the superscripts b(t) label the
   beam(target) and the sum is over all quark flavors (u, d, s, c, b, t).
   x1 is the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the beam carried by
   the quark from the beam and x2 is the fraction of the longitudinal
   momentum of the target carried by the quark from the target. The
   squared total energy of the beam-target system is s = 2mt \Lambda Ebeam
   + m2b + m2t with Ebeam the energy of the beam hadron and mb and mt the
   rest masses of the beam and target hadron respectively. In the case of
   nuclear targets, we will assume the reaction takes place on a component
   nucleon, mt = Mn, where Mn is the nucleon mass, and the momentum
   fraction is A (the number of nucleons) times the fraction of the
   momentum of the quark compared to the entire nucleus. The convention
   that c=1 is used throughout the text. The kinematics of the virtual
   photon- longitudinal center of mass momentum pflk, transverse momentum
   pflT and mass Mfl - are determined by measuring the two-muon decay of
   the virtual photon. These quantities determine the momentum fractions
   of the two quarks: xF = pflk =pfl;maxk = x1 \Gamma x2 (2) x1x2s = M 2fl
   (3) where pfl;maxk is the maximum possible center of mass longitudinal
   momentum. The kinematics are chosen to gain sensitivity to the
   antiquark distribution of the target with xF ? 0 and x1 large so that
   the valence quarks of the beam dominate. In this limit the contribution
   from the second term in eq. (1) is small and with a proton beam the
   first term is dominated by the valence uv(x1) distribution of the
   proton. Under these circumstances, the ratio of the cross sections for
   two different targets, X and Y, which have AX and AY 4 nucleons is
   approximately the ratio of the _u distributions: 1 AX doeX dx1dx2 1 AY
   doeY dx1dx2 ss _u X(x2) _uY (x2) : (4) In this relation the cross
   sections are defined per nucleus but the parton distributions are
   conventionally defined per nucleon. Equation 4 demonstrates the power
   of Drell-Yan experiments in determining relative antiquark
   distributions. We wish to extend the measurements made by E866 to
   relatively large x2 where the antiquark distributions are small. Beams
   from the FNAL Main Injector have two primary advantages compared to
   previous 800 GeV measurements: ffl For fixed x1 and x2 the cross
   section is / 1=Ebeam. Main Injector experiments at 120 GeV have factor
   of ,7 larger cross sections compared to experiments with the 800 GeV
   Tevatron extracted beam. ffl Practical limitations in the acceptable
   luminosity for these experiments are radiation protection limits and
   the singles muon rates in the detectors. To the extent that the
   radiation dose scales as beam power, one can take ,7 times the
   luminosity for the same beam power at 120 GeV relative to 800 GeV. In
   E866 at 800 GeV, J=\Psi events from the beam dump were a significant
   contribution to the muon singles rates. At 120 GeV the total J=\Psi
   production cross sections fall by an order of magnitude when compared
   to 800 GeV. We expect that the combination of these effects will allow
   a factor of 50 improvement in the statistics at high x2 compared to
   E866 and E772. 2.1 _d=_u of the proton E866 and NA51 used measurements
   of the ratio of the Drell-Yan cross sections on deuterium and hydrogen
   to determine the ratio of _d=_u on the proton by assuming the deuterium
   cross section is the sum of the proton and neutron cross sections and
   using charge symmetry to equate _dp to _un. When the antiquarks in the
   beam and the strange and heavier antiquarks in the target are ignored:
   5 oepd 2oepp fifififix 1??x2 ss 12 (1 + d(x 1) 4u(x1) ) (1 + d(x 1)
   _d(x2) 4u(x1)_u(x2) ) 1 + _d(x2)_u(x 2) ! (5) While this expression
   illustrates the sensitivity of the experimental ratio to _d=_u, the
   E866 extraction of _d=_u was performed using eq. (1) and the CTEQ4M
   distributions for the valence quark distributions, the sum _d + _u, and
   the heavier sea quark distributions. The results showed little
   variation if MRS(R2) distributions were used. Figure 2 shows the
   distribution of _d \Gamma _u. This difference is a pure flavor
   non-singlet quantity: its integral is Q2 independent [9] and its Q2
   evolution at leading order does not depend on the gluon distribution of
   the proton. In perturbative QCD, differences between the _d and _u
   distributions arise only at second order and are calculated to be very
   small [10]. The large differences seen in Figures 1 and 2 must be
   non-perturbative in nature and are likely explained in terms of
   collective degrees of freedom of QCD at low energy. Early expectations
   that Pauli blocking would contribute significantly to differences in
   the light sea were not borne out by calculations [10]. There are three
   significant approaches which can accommodate large _d \Gamma _u
   differences: 1) hadronic models of the meson cloud of the nucleon 2)
   chiral quark models which couple mesons directly to constituent quarks
   and 3) instanton models. Figure 2 illustrates calculations for
   representative examples of each of these models. An intriguing feature
   is that in each of these models the flavor and spin distributions of
   the proton are intimately linked. The pion cloud model has a
   tantalizing simplicity and does explain basic features of the data. A
   proton wave function containing sizable virtual jnss+ ? Fock states
   will have an excess of _d from the valence quarks in the ss+. If one
   treats the NNss vertex function as a free parameter one can
   characterize the experimental distribution to x , 0:2 with
   "not-unreasonable" vertex functions (dipole vertex functions with a , 1
   GeV cut off). The difficulty in this approach is finding justification
   to truncate the hadronic expansion. A more realistic inclusion of
   \Delta (1232) isobars leads to a reduction in the predicted _d \Gamma
   _u [11]. Again, however, with reasonable parameter choices for the N
   \Delta ss vertex function consistent with pp ! p\Delta data, one
   obtains an approximate description of the _d \Gamma _u data (solid
   curve in Figure 2). The resulting probabilities for the jN ssi and
   j\Delta ssi admixtures lead to a prediction for the difference in total
   spin carried by the u quarks (\Delta u) and the d quarks (\Delta d), 6
   Figure 2: FNAL E866 results[6] for the x dependence of _d \Gamma _u of
   the proton at a mass scale of 7.35 GeV. The curves represent three
   model calculations of _d \Gamma _u. The solid curve is the meson
   calculation including nucleons, deltas and pions [6]. The dot-dashed
   curve is a chiral quark model of Szczurek et al. [12] and the dashed
   curve is the instanton inspired parameterization of Dorokhov and
   Kochelev [14]. 7 \Delta u \Gamma \Delta d = GA of 1.2 [6], close to the
   experimental value of 1.260 \Sigma .003. Chiral field theories suggest
   that the relevant degrees of freedom are constituent quarks, gluons and
   Goldstone bosons. Processes such as u ! dss+ and d ! uss\Gamma generate
   a flavor asymmetry in the sea simply because there are more up than
   down quarks in the proton. The prediction of _d \Gamma _u in one of the
   chiral models [12] is shown as the dot-dashed curve in Figure 2. A
   general feature of these models is an x dependence which is too soft
   because the models start with the x distribution of the valence quarks.
   Instanton effective Lagrangians imply a coupling between the instantons
   and the valence quarks which leads to a _d \Gamma _u difference. This
   raises the intriguing possibility that Drell-Yan measurements could
   provide experimental information on these theoretically very useful but
   seemingly experimentally inaccessible constructs. Within the framework
   of the t'Hooft SU(2) effective Lagrangian [13] (which is of the form
   _uRuL _dRdL + _uLuR _dLdR where the subscripts R and L label the quark
   helicity) the u quarks generate a _dd sea and the helicity of the
   valence quarks is screened [14]. (A flavor SU(3) Lagrangian would also
   generate s_s pairs.) Dorokhov and Kochelev fit the NMC measurement of
   the _d \Gamma _u integral to a parameterized form which is shown as the
   dashed curve on Figure 2. This approach also qualitatively reproduces
   the E866 results for x !0.23 but its only predictive power is the
   relations between the instanton contributions (subscript I in eq.
   (6)-(8)) of the spin and flavor matrix elements: _dI (x) \Gamma _uI(x)
   = \Gamma 14 (\Delta uI(x) + \Delta dI (x) + \Delta sI (x)) (6) =
   35(\Delta uI (x) \Gamma \Delta dI (x)) (7) = \Gamma (\Delta uI (x) +
   \Delta dI (x) \Gamma 2\Delta sI (x)): (8) None of these models
   consistently incorporate the flavor symmetric sea and consequently all
   substantially overpredict the ratio of _d=_u for x ?0.23. Unfortunately
   the error bars on the E866 data become large in this region, due
   entirely to limited statistics. The pion models tend to level off at a
   predicted ratio _d=_u , 1:5 \Gamma 5 (depending on the baryons and
   mesons included in the calculations) until x ? 0:5 where the ratio
   begins to decrease slowly to unity. The instanton model predicts a
   ratio of _d=_u , 4 at high x. One possible interpretation of the E886
   results is the perturbative gluon mechanism begins to reestablish its
   dominance over the non-perturbative mechanisms at 8 Ratio of Deuterium

   proposed here are shown as the error bars on the solid circles (which
   are arbitrarily plotted at 1.0). a lower x value than previously
   expected. The expected statistical precision with which one can measure
   the ratio oepd 2oepp in an experiment at the Main Injector is shown by
   the error bars on thesolid points in Figure 3 along with the E866 high
   mass results. E866 has considerably more data at spectrometer settings
   which emphasize lower masses, and consequently lower x2, but this
   represents essentially the complete data set for large x2. It is
   apparent that a high luminosity Main Injector experiment can extend the
   x range of our knowledge of _d=_u up to x , 0:5. At even higher x
   values the \Upsilon states obscure the Drell-Yan yield and make 120 GeV
   measurements difficult. The cross sections on deuterium determine the
   flavor singlet quantity 9 Figure 4: E772 measurements of the ratio of
   Drell-Yan cross sections on nuclear targets to deuterium [15]. 10 _up+
   _dp and the extended kinematic range compared to previous measurements
   will be important in the global fits to determine this quantity with
   minimal nuclear corrections. As present, neutrino data on nuclear
   targets place the dominant constraints on _u + _d. The comparison of
   the nuclear dependences will be discussed in the next section. 2.2 _u
   of Nuclei compared to _u of deuterium. In the context of nuclear
   convolution models, virtual pion contributions to nuclear structure
   functions were expected to lead to sizable increases in sea
   distributions of the nuclei compared to deuterium. This expectation was
   shattered by the convincing E772 Drell-Yan measurements [15] (See
   Figure 4) which showed little A dependence except in the shadowing
   region. High precision measurements at x larger than E772 could access
   would provide extremely valuable new information on the nuclear
   dependence of parton distributions. This information would remove any
   questions about the role shadowing plays in influencing the x
   dependence and would, for the first time, have the sensitivity to see
   the reduction in the nuclear sea distributions predicted in the Q2
   rescaling models. A large rise in the nuclear ratio would provide an
   important alert that nuclear effects may be important in the deuterium
   to hydrogen ratio. Figure 5 shows convolution model calculations by
   Coester[16] of the ratio of _u in iron and deuterium to (_u + _d)=2 of
   the proton and the ratio of _uF e=_uD. One can observe that even in
   this model the predicted nuclear effects in the deuterium-to-hydrogen
   ratio are small for x ! 0:3 as compared to the large effects seen in
   Figure 1. Since this model implies much larger nuclear effects in iron
   than are compatible with the E772 results, it appears to substantially
   overestimate the nuclear effects. By taking comparable nuclear data, we
   will be able to constrain the possible nuclear effects on the _dp
   \Gamma _up measurements and be able to make direct comparisons with
   antiquark distributions obtained from neutrino data on nuclear targets.
   Figure 6 illustrates a comparison of the deep inelastic and Drell-Yan
   results on the ratios of calcium to deuterium along with the expected
   errors from the measurements proposed here. 11 Figure 5: Ratio of _u in
   deuterium to (_up + _dp)=2 (solid) as calculated by Coester [16]

   iron to deuterium which should be directly comparable to the E772 data

   proposed are shown as the error bars on the solid circles (which are
   arbitrarily plotted at 1.0). 13 2.3 Interpretability of the Results The
   interpretability of Drell-Yan results as direct measures of the parton
   distributions is based on the QCD factorization theorems [17, 18].
   Bodwin, Brodsky and Lepage [18] give the condition for the minimum beam
   momentum Pmin below which initial state QCD interactions become
   important as: Pmin ss p?A 2=3 x1 (9) A conservative estimate of ! p2?
   ?, 0:4 GeV2 (Ref. [18] use 0.25 GeV2) yields a typical transverse
   hadronic scale p? of , 0.6 GeV and a minimum beam momentum of 23 GeV
   for x1 ? 0:3 and a calcium target, comfortably below the 120 GeV
   considered here. 2.4 Possible Future Measurements This letter of intent
   focuses on measurements with the primary proton beam. A number of other
   interesting measurements could be made with this spectrometer. We have
   previously submitted a letter of intent for Drell-Yan measurements with
   polarized protons on a polarized proton target to determine the spin
   structure of the sea distributions. When a polarized proton beam
   becomes available from the Main Injector, the present apparatus would
   be immediately suitable for that experiment. Even with an unpolarized
   beam there appear to be interesting correlations one can measure with
   Drell-Yan on a polarized proton target [19]. Intense secondary meson
   beams would open up new possibilities such as a more accurate
   determination of the charged kaon valence parton distributions or
   measurements of the ratio of d=u distributions of the proton as x ! 1.
   3 Experimental Apparatus The experimental apparatus leans heavily on
   the E605, E772, E789 and E866 experience for the best technique to
   handle high luminosities in fixed target Drell-Yan experiments. The key
   features of the apparatus are: ffl Relatively short (!15% interaction
   length, LI ) targets to minimize secondary reactions in the target. 14
   ffl Two independent magnetic field volumes, one to focus the high
   transverse momentum muons and defocus low transverse momentum muons and
   one to measure the muon momenta. ffl A 10 LI hadron absorber to remove
   high transverse momentum hadrons. ffl A 20 LI beam dump at the entrance
   of the first magnet. ffl Zinc and concrete walls for muon
   identification at the rear of the apparatus. The lower beam energy has
   two disadvantages relative to 800 GeV experiments. ffl The
   corresponding lower particle energies lead to increased probabilities
   for muon decay of the produced hadrons. This is handled by reducing the
   target-to-hadron-absorber distance to , 1:0 \Gamma 1:5 m. ffl The lower
   energy muons multiple scatter more easily in the hadron absorber. We
   wish to optimize the design for events with large x2 events and xF ,
   0:2. For example, the muons generated by an 8 GeV virtual photon with
   xF = 0:2 which decays perpendicular to the direction of motion (in the
   virtual photon rest frame) will in the laboratory have momenta of 36
   GeV, an opening angle of 200 mr and transverse momenta of 4 GeV. A
   sketch of the apparatus showing trajectories for muons from 90ffi
   decays at 0 ! xF ! 0:4 is shown in Figure 7 (bend plane view) for a 7
   GeV mass virtual photon. Figure 8 illustrates the non-bend plane view.
   A bend plane view for a J=\Psi event is shown in Figure 9. The purpose
   of the first magnet of the spectrometer is to contain the high
   transverse momentum muons and to bend low momentum muons out of the
   experimental acceptance. The optimal performance would be obtained with
   a 3 GeV pt kick (, 9 T-m) large aperture magnet. Reasonable Drell-Yan
   acceptance is retained provided the aperture of the downstream
   spectrometer is large enough for field integrals as low as 5 T-m.
   However such a configuration increases the acceptance of low-mass pairs
   and hadron-decay muons resulting in unacceptably high detector count
   rates. 15 Figure 7: Bend plane view of the trajectories of one of the
   two muons resulting from the muon decay of a 7 GeV virtual photon
   (which has xF of 0.0, 0.2 or 0.4) in a 9 T-m spectrometer. 16 Figure 8:
   Non-bend plane view in a 9 T-m spectrometer. Only muons which pass
   around the beam dump in the bend plane contribute to the acceptance and
   so the beam dump is not shown. 17 Figure 9: Bend plane view of the
   trajectories of one of the two muons resulting from the muon decay of a
   J=\Psi particle (which has xF of 0.0, 0.2 or 0.4) in a 9 T-m
   spectrometer. 18 A 9 T-m large aperture magnet could be constructed
   using the iron from SM12 in Meson East with new coils, following the
   same principles as SM12. With such a magnet, there appear to be no
   experimental barriers to completing the measurement proposed here. The
   muons will lose , 3 GeV in energy passing through the absorber and
   multiple scatter by an average angle of , 150=p_ mr. This level of
   multiple scattering will still permit acceptable virtual photon mass
   resolution (,250 MeV) and acceptable vertex resolution to separate
   target and beam dump events for muon energies greater than 20 GeV. Due
   to the long target length relative to the target-to-absorber distance,
   the target position does not provide additional track constraints for
   the mass measurement. To reduce the cost and time scale for the
   experiment we are exploring the possibility of using existing magnets.
   To date we have not found a solution with existing magnets that can
   reach the required field integral and achieve acceptable singles rates
   in the wire chambers. The second magnet must provide the accurate
   momentum determination and have a large acceptance. The existing SM3
   magnet would be ideal, but is being moved to C0. The most suitable
   available FNAL magnet appears to be the Jolly Green Giant (JGG) which
   is currently in Lab G. At present, the JGG has a turn-to-turn short in
   one of its coils. We would need to have the short repaired to improve
   the pt kick to 0.5 GeV (estimates of the cost of the repair are
   available). We also expect that for radiation protection purposes, the
   spectrometer, like the Meson-East spectrometer, will need to be
   vertically bending. If so the JGG would require modification to
   accommodate this since it is presently configured as a horizontal
   bending (vertical field) magnet. We are still in the process of
   studying the rate capability of the apparatus to determine the final
   magnet configuration. We consider this the one remaining experimental
   issue. We believe that a 9 T-m focusing magnet will be acceptable but
   have not yet determined the optimization of cost and luminosity for
   lower field integral concepts. 3.1 Detectors The wire chambers and
   scintillators used for E866 are the appropriate size for the new
   spectrometer and the dimensions of these existing detectors have been
   used in the simulation. We would like to replace the TRANSPORT 19
   readout with a more contemporary system. We would anticipate using the
   same trigger strategy and trigger matrix electronics that proved
   successful in E866. 3.2 Muon Identification We have also assumed the
   present E866 muon identification system, zinc absorber, concrete
   absorbers, proportional tubes and hodoscopes [20]. 3.3 Yields The
   experiment would use 20" long liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets,
   and two 10 gm/cm2 nuclear targets and a dummy liquid target cell. The
   targets would be interchanged roughly every 60 minutes. Unlike the
   Tevatron spill with its 40 s gap between pulses, the rapid Main
   Injector Spills would require blocking the beam for target motion. We
   have assumed a primary beam intensity of 1e12 protons per pulse or 2e13
   protons per minute. Figure 10 shows the results from a Monte Carlo
   simulation of the acceptance of the spectrometer for the hydrogen with
   various acceptance cuts for 40 days at 100% efficiency running. With an
   8 month run at 50% total efficiency, we would achieve these yields on
   four targets (hydrogen, deuterium and two nuclear targets, relative
   running time 44% H, 33% D, 33% nuclear) with the relative errors on the
   ratio of the deuterium to hydrogen cross sections for xF ? 0:05 shown
   in Figure 3. 3.4 Collaboration The core of the collaboration, Los
   Alamos National Laboratory, Abilene Christian University, Texas A & M,
   Valparaiso and Argonne National Laboratory has recently successfully
   completed the E866 Drell-Yan experiment at FNAL. These groups encompass
   the key technologies needed for the new measurements. Several other
   groups have expressed interest in the experiment and we expect little
   problem identifying sufficient manpower to construct, operate and
   analyze the experiment in a timely fashion following a favorable
   response from FNAL. 20 Figure 10: Monte-Carlo results for yields from a
   40 day 100% efficiency run with 2e13 protons per minute on a 20" long
   liquid hydrogen target with the apparatus shown in Figures 7-9. The
   dashed curve represents all accepted events with masses between 4 and
   8.5 GeV, the solid curve includes the additional requirements of: xF ?
   0:05, and both muons having momenta greater than 20 GeV. The dotted
   curve includes the requirement of xF ? 0:2 and requires both muons to
   have momenta greater than 20 GeV. 21 4 Summary This letter of intent
   proposes using the 120 GeV primary proton beam from the Main Injector
   to measure Drell-Yan yields for hydrogen, deuterium and two nuclear
   targets. These measurements will provide new information on the ratio
   for _d=_u and _d \Gamma _u distributions of the proton over the x range
   of 0.2-0.5 and new insight into the non-perturbative origin of the
   parton distributions. Measurements of the nuclear dependence of the _u
   distribution will provide new information over a similar x range. The
   combination of these two measurements should also resolve nuclear
   ambiguities inherent in obtaining nucleon antiquark distributions from
   neutrino data on nuclear targets. References [1] H. L. Lai et al.,
