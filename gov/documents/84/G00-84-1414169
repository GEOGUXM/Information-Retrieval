                                                    APPLICATIONS

                                                      * Speech recognition
     * Speaker verification
     * Speech synthesis
     * Speech diagnostics

   Our group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has recently
   described methods of using low-power electromagnetic (EM) sensorssuch
   as miniature radarsin conjunction with acoustic speech to improve the
   accuracy, speed, and quality of speech signal recognition for a variety
   of applications. The output from one or more sensors can be combined
   with acoustic sound versus time information to describe each "frame" of
   human speech. The radar sensors can be miniaturized and placed into
   hand-held microphone housings or near the speaker in many typical
   appliances or computer-related devices.

  EM sensor measurements

   EM radar sensors can be positioned around the human vocal system in
   several ways (as seen in the above view of the vocal system), and can
   be incorporated into several standard instruments such as microphone
   housings, microphone booms, electronic jewelry, and computer housings.
   The processing of the radar and acoustic data uses several new, but
   easily implemented algorithms. The data shown in the figure below are
   illustrative of the information available from two micropower radars
   (sensors 1 and 2 in the above figure) when used in conjunction with an
   acoustic microphone, as the word "print" is spoken. Trace (a) below
   shows the audio signal and trace (b) shows the glottal radar signal,
   which detects the motions of the vocal folds as "print" is articulated.
   These data provide heretofore unavailable information describing the
   excitation of speech, the start of speech, as well as procedures for
   noise removal and for accurate algorithm timing. Traces (c) and (d)
   show jaw and tongue motions obtained using radar sensor 2. The upward
   jaw motion precedes the formation of the "p" in the word "print," then
   downward motion takes place as the "p" is spoken. Trace (d) shows the
   tongue moving down for "ri" and then upward to say the "n" sound. Such
   sequences can be used to identify patterns of speech sounds (e.g.,
   words or phrases) The lowest trace (e) shows the running vocalized
   pitch of the speaker, which is useful for intonation and language
   decisions.

  Processed data

   The data from signals illustrated above also make possible very clear
   descriptions of the vocal tract configurations, which include the
   shapes of air paths from above the vocal folds, where a split occurs
   into the nose and past the tongue, and out the nose and lips. These are
   called transfer functions and are used by current automated speech
   recognizers to identify the sounds being spoken. The transfer
   functions, illustrated in the figure below, show the quality of data
   obtained using these methods.

   [fig-g.gif]
   As "print" is spoken, transfer function data are obtained for each time
   frame, which is defined as every two vocal fold open and close cycles
   (e.g., frame numbers 4 to 18 equal 30 glottal cycles). To estimate the
   transfer function, the Fourier transform of the audio (top trace) is
   divided by the Fourier transform of the glottal radar signaltrace (b)
   in second figure.

  Applications and markets

   The low-cost electromagnetic radar sensors and the algorithms that we
   have developed make possible many important technical devices for a
   wide variety of speech-related markets. They range from lower volume
   medical markets of $10 million per year (such as the production of
   special diagnostic instruments for people with speech disorders), to
   the several billion dollar per year market associated with the sale of
   a low cost "radar/microphones" attached to a significant fraction of
   the 60 million personal computers sold each year. Other applications
   are for noise-immune and reduced bandwidth cellular telephones,
   personalized speech synthesizers, noise suppression microphones, speech
   disability diagnosis and correction, and teaching, as well as many
   other applications.

   Availability: We are presentating and publishing our work at
   conferences and for expert groupsmore information on this technology
   is also available at our Speech Technology Web site. Patents on the
   radar technologies have already issued and patents on the speech
   processing methods are in progress. We welcome interest from industry
   in developing new speech recognition technologies.
