     H*Wind for Dummies

    1. Establish an X11 windows session, via CubeX or X-Terminal.
    2. In your local host, type: xhost +
    3. ssh -l username cat5.nhc.noaa.gov (140.90.240.207)
       or for faster execution at AOML
       ssh -l username 140.90.39.134
    4. At the prompt of cat5, type: setenv DISPLAY IP address of local
       machine:0.0
       For example, if your localhost is tropic: 'setenv DISPLAY
       140.90.39.130:0.0'
       Type: hwind
    5. H*Wind Graphical Output {for use by HRD realtime analysts}
       Do quality control and schedule an analysis. After a successful
       analysis, you will find the IDL output images on
       "cat5:/home/AnalysisOutput/year/ATCFcode/day/time/"
       (for example, /home/AnalysisOutput/2001/al01.2001/0605/1930)
       Final output files:
       idlbw1.ps - Black & white, 1 degree around the storm center
       idlbw2.ps - Black & white, 2 degrees "
       idlbw4.ps - Black & white, 4 degrees "
       idlc1.ps - Color, 1 degree "
       idlc2.ps - Color, 2 degrees "
       idlc4.ps - Color, 4 degrees "

    1. These files will get overwritten every time you re-run an analysis
       for the same storm, same day and same time.
    2. Ftp the desired 'idl*.ps' to a NeXT machine for final processing.
    3. Creation of PLOTS on tropic:
       ftp tropic (140.90.39.130)
       login: wanda
       Name: wanda
       331 Password required for wanda.
       Password:
       put idl.ps idl.eps
       quit
       - On tropic: (in the wanda account)
       Launch Diagram
       Drag '.eps' file on blank template
       Save anotated analysis as Postscript (.ps)
    4. To capture Hwind's data coverage window, run xv on cat5. Click on
       the button 'Grab' and follow its instructions. Save the image in
       '.jpg' format (for example, allison_data_0605_1930.jpg)
    5. How to put and print the analysis output at NHC:
       Once the analysis is ready to be sent to NHC, create a postscript
       version of it. (Note: you can not print ".eps" files at NHC.)
       On tropic:
       scp analysis.ps cat5.nhc.noaa.gov:
       ssh cat5.nhc.noaa.gov
       For black and white printer:
       lpr -Ptafbhp analysis.ps
       For color printer:
       lpr -Ptekcol analysis.ps
       Don't forget to call and confirm printout:
       (305) 229-4415
       (305) 229-4418 backup
    6. How to put and print wind analyses at CPHC:
       Create a postscript version of the analyses
       ftp 140.90.183.29
       User name? hrd
       Password? (see Shirley for it)
       put analysis.ps stormname_latest.ps <-- PLEASE use a name like
       "daniel_latest.ps". Remember this will overwrite the image each
       time. We need to conserve disk space....this is NOT an archive!
       quit
       telnet 140.90.183.29
       User name? hrd
       Password? (see Shirley for it)
       For black and white printer:
       lp stormname_latest.ps
       For color printer:
       lp -d DJ1600 stormname_latest.ps
       Don't forget to call and confirm printout:
       (808) 973-5280
       (808) 973-5281 FAX
    7. Sending wind analyses to JTWC:
       E-mail wind analysis and data coverage jpg images to:
       tdo@npmoc.navy.mil
       This will get to all the typhoon duty officers.
    8. Create JPEG version of analysis
       - Convert Diagram's postscript analysis version to a JPEG file via
       PixelMagician, Taylor or Imageviewer. Save JPEG file following the
       naming convention of: "stormName_mmdd_hhmm.jpg" (for example,
       allison_0605_1930.jpg).
    9. Put the JPEG (data coverage, analysis) files available for ftp:
       On tropic:
       scp analysis_jpeg_file
       username@cat5.nhc.noaa.gov:/home/FTP/Year/StormName/Analysis
       scp data_coverage_jpeg_file
       username@cat5.nhc.noaa.gov:/home/FTP/Year/StormName/DataCoverage
