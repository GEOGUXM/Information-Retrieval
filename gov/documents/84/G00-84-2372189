Federal Register notices

   When Western has important information to share with the public, we
   print it in the Federal Register. Our Federal Register notices
   frequently focus on rate actions or environmental impact statements.
   The index below gives you access to all the notices we have printed
   since 1997. For more information, please contact our Corporate
   Communications office through our Media contacts page.
