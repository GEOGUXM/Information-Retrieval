   EAD Teams with Museum of Science and Industry

   EAD applied its combined capabilities in environmental research and
   Internet applications to help the Museum of Science and Industry in
   Chicago (MSI) develop its "Reusable City" exhibit, which focuses on
   urban environmental issues. Reusable City was originally a traditional
   museum exhibit, but the MSI was looking for a way to move some of the
   associated learning experience out of the context of the museum
   building and into classrooms. Out of this effort was born an on-line
   experience known as "Tales from the Underground." The concept was to
   involve kids in collecting environmental data from their surroundings,
   and to provide them a means for sharing this data over the web with
   other kids in the Chicago area. The museum staff had seen
   demonstrations of early versions of EAD's MaD browser and approached
   EAD about building an on-line interactive experience around the
   browser. Included in this task was changing the look and feel of the
   browser to make it more kid friendly and adding some exhibit-specific
   functionality, as well as developing a set of neighborhood maps for the
   Chicago area and providing administration tools to the museum.

   "Tales from the Underground" went on-line at the end of September 1999.
   Detailed maps of 77 Chicago neighborhoods are accessible through the
   MaD browser. For a small fee, teachers can purchase related activity
   kits from the MSI. These kits include enough material to conduct 10
   rounds of soil sample analyses for pH, nitrate, and phosphate. The kits
   include passwords that allow students or teachers to locate their
   samples on maps using the MaD browser and upload their results to a
   master database maintained by EAD. Results for all of Chicago are
   viewable with the MaD browser simply by selecting sampling locations
   from maps and requesting a data table. On the MaD maps, sampling
   locations are color-coded according to their pH, nitrate or phosphate
   values. Users can toggle between these three analytes, changing the
   display of sampling locations based on the selected analyte results.
   With their passwords, students are also able to add schools to the map
   if their school isn't shown, and attach URLs to their own web sites,
   making those web sites directly accessible from within the MaD browser
   simply by clicking on a sampling location icon. Museum staff approve
   all new data or web site links uploaded by students before data or
   sites become publicly available. While the museum is still in the
   process of organizing the sale and distribution of activity kits,
   initial reaction to the site has been overwhelmingly positive from
   students and teachers at schools in the Hyde Park area where it has
   been tested.
