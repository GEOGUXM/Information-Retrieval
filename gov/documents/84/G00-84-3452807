   Biography
    _____________________________________________________________________

   Photo of the Lt. Governor Cruz M. Bustamante was elected Lieutenant
   Governor of the State of California in November 1998, the latest step
   in a career in public office that began when he was elected to the
   state Assembly in a special election in 1993. He was elected Speaker of
   the Assembly by his colleagues in December 1996, and served as Speaker
   until February 1998. A first generation Californian, Bustamante was the
   first Latino to serve as Speaker of the Assembly, and upon his election
   as Lieutenant Governor, he became the first Latino elected to statewide
   office in California in more than 120 years.

   As Lieutenant Governor, Bustamante is the President of the California
   Senate, serves as a Regent of the University of California and is a
   Trustee of the California State University system. The Lieutenant
   Governor also serves as a member of the State Lands Commission,
   chairman of the Commission for Economic Development, vice-chairman of
   the Commission of the Californias, and is a member of the California
   Rural Policy Task Force and the World Trade Commission.

   During his term, Lieutenant Governor Bustamante has participated in
   international trade missions to Mexico, Germany, Israel and Italy. In
   addition, he hosted a trade summit with the Governor of the Mexican
   State of Jalisco. To promote tolerance and encourage dialogue on issues
   of diversity, Bustamante formed the Lieutenant Governors Commission
   for One California. This commission meets quarterly and is currently
   exploring ways in which the media and our schools can foster tolerance.
   During Bustamante's term as Speaker, the Legislature reduced class
   sizes, enacted a $1.7 billion tax cut, extended health insurance
   coverage to 600,000 low-income children, reformed welfare and rolled
   back student fees at state universities and colleges. Bustamante
   authored the laws that provided $1 billion to put updated textbooks
   into California classrooms, allowed the State of California to join the
   multi-state litigation against tobacco companies, and prohibited job
   application fees.

   Governor Gray Davis named the Lieutenant Governor as co-chair of the
   Governors Commission on Building for the 21^st Century, which is
   directed to develop a long-term plan to address the states critical
   infrastructure needs. The Governor also named him to the University of
   California Merced Implementation Team, a task force proposed by the
   Lieutenant Governor to speed up the formation of the tenth University
   of California campus. An advocate of full participation in the 2000
   decennial census, Lieutenant Governor Bustamante proposed the creation
   of a panel to develop and oversee an outreach strategy to encourage
   full participation in the 2000 federal decennial census. Based on this
   proposal, Governor Davis created the California Complete Count
   Committee and named Lieutenant Governor Bustamante as a member. In
   January 2000, Bustamante was also appointed by President Bill Clinton
   to serve on the United States Census Monitoring Board, which is
   responsible for monitoring the Census Bureau's preparation and
   implementation for the 2000 decennial census.

   A native of Dinuba, California, and a graduate of Tranquility High
   School, Bustamante attended Fresno City College, and then Fresno State
   University, where he was active in the student Senate. Bustamante
   served as the Program Director of the Summer Youth Employment Training
   Program, which was responsible for employing more than 3,000 Central
   Valley teenagers each summer. He later worked as a district
   representative for Congressman Rick Lehman and Assemblyman Bruce
   Bronzan, whom he replaced in the Assembly in 1993.

   Devoted to his family, Bustamante is married to the former Arcelia De
   La Pena. They have three daughters, Leticia, Sonia, and Marisa; a
   grandson, David; and a granddaughter, Lauren.
