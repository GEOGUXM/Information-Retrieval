    Terrestrial data available from the National Geophysical Data Center,
      and its collocated World Data Center, include discipline areas of
   topography, natural hazards, geomagnetism, gravity, global change, and
         other global phenomenon. These data are used by scientists,
    researchers, civil engineers, managers, and others for the mitigation
       of damage and loss of life due to natural hazards, for land use
   planning, scientific research, resource exploration, satellite orbits,
                      and numerous other applications.

                           Scientific Disciplines:

          Environment & Biosphere
          Geomagnetism
          Geothermal
          Gravity
          Natural Hazards
          Topography

     NGDC is currently a partner in several special projects, including:
     * The Global Observations to Benefit the Environment Education
       Initiative and it's Student Data Archive
     * International Digital Elevation Program
     * Development of tools to help visualize and access data
