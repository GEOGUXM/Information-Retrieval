   CMAC Meeting Preparation
   Video conferencing desktop-to-desktop demo status
       Kevin gave an update on the progress of the video  conferencing
       project. The proposal has changed to include a high-end PC capable
       of  supporting this function. The following features are proposed:

   Pentium PC
       Network Card
       Sound Card
       CU/seeMe software (White Pine Supported)
       Talkshow Whiteboard software
       Microphone
       Connectix Camera
       Cost ~ $K per unit x 14 units = $54K
       NSL would pre-configure units
       Cost is ~ $4.5K x 15 =
       TCCR approved.

   FY97 Site requirements ($100K level)

   AL
   Result of FY96 Allocation -- 40K

   In 1996 we put $20K together with other internal funding  and external
       funding from CU to purchase a new CPU server for the modelers in
       the lab.  This consists of an UltraSparc 3000 with 4 processors
       which ties via a 400MHZ connection  to the SparcCenter 2000 which
       it uses as an I/O handler. The other $20K went into a  100BaseT
       Switch to tie these to the SUN, SGI, and Alpha systems that utilize
       them.

   FY97 Proposal (100K)
   For 1997 we would anticipate using the entire $100K to  increase the
       network bandwidth so that all systems that can utilize a 100MHz
       network will  have one. We find it impossible to backup current
       systems, and to succeed in operating our  distributed data handling
       systems at 10MHz.

   AOML
   Result of FY96 Allocation -- 40K

   Replaced 4 year old workgroup printers with 12 HP printers  ( 7 - 4MV
       and 5 - 4M Plus). These printers support Postscript level 2 and
       provides 600 dpi  output (21k).
       Replaced the PC file server (Pathworks) on the VAX with a  Pentium
       and
       a Alpha PC running Windows NT (13K).
       Purchased an Apple color Laser printer. (7K)

   FY97 Proposal (100K)
   DECstation Trade-ins (35K)

   We purchased 16 DECstations in 1990, which use 25MHz MIPS  processors,
       and are now obsolete. DEC no longer plans any software upgrades for
       them,  their Unix requires an Alpha processor. One limitation is
       that the DECstations don't  support shared libraries (needed for
       some of our IDL procedures). We'd like to trade them  in for newer
       machines.

   Fiber (70K)
   Our current network cabling system is based on thinwire  (10Base2)
       Ethernet. We have many problems with bad connectors, users
       disconnecting a chain  in the middle, etc. AOML has placed and a
       P.O. was awarded for cables, connectors and  racks to replace the
       infrastructure from thinwire to Fiber (100BaseFX). Electronics is
       now  needed for on the fiber infrastructure -- repeater hubs, Fiber
       switch, and network cards  for servers and high power workstations.

   ARL
   Result of FY96 ($40K)

   I do not have access to information on how last years funds  were spent
       at this time. I am trying to get that information from ARL HQ
       currently.  Allocation -- 40K


   FY97 Proposal (100K)
   1. PC refreshment - various division PC upgrades $25K
       2. New Workstations for SORD and ATDD (both need more  processing
       power) $50K
       3. NAWIPS workstation (meteorological data ingest, display  system
       for FRD $25K

   CDC
   CDC Result of FY96 Allocation ($40K):

   - CDC used the $40K from the CSCS funds to purchase an UltraSPARC 2
       with  dual 200-Mhz processors and 512-MB of physical memory. At
       272-MFLOPS, the aggregate  performance of this machine should
       exceed the performance of the eight processor,  220-MFLOPS,
       SPARCcenter 2000's. CDC plans to install LSF to help users make
       more efficient  use of this compute server for batch jobs.


   FY97 Proposal ($100K):
   The $100K would be used to supplement the existing on-line storage
       capacity with a tape jukebox in the 2-4 terabyte range. Although
       CDC is evaluating an 8mm  Mammoth, it seems more likely that this
       jukebox would be based on the new DLT 7000 tape  technology, which
       provides 35-GB per tape, uncompressed, and a transfer rate around
       2.5-MBps, uncompressed.

   CMDL
   How we spent FY96 $40K:
       - Tektronix Phaser 550 color laser printer - Video conference
       Pentium with  software
       - SPSS maintenance
       - Fast SCSI-2 card for CMDL3 Server
       - Hyper Sparc 150 MHz CPU with 512 kByte cache - 4 x 32 MByte SIMMS
       memory
       - UPS
       - miscellaneous supplies (printer cartridges, paper, etc)
       - .5 salary for systems administrator
       FY 97 Proposal ($100K)

   1. Ethernet switch/hardware for network $20K
       2. Upgrade for FTP and Web server $15K
       3. Upgrade Carbon Cycle Group's server $15K
       4. Digital linear tape drive for backups $ 6K
       5. Additional memory for CCG1 workstation $ 2K
       6. 4Gb disk drives for CCG1 workstation $ 2K
       7. Upgrade HP-UX operating system $ 2K
       8. Upgrade observatory computers and peripherals $15K
       9. Two x-terms $ 6K
       10. Recordable CD drive $ 2K
       11. Supplies $ 5K
       12. Hardware/software maintenance $10K
       TOTAL $100K


   ETL
   ETL Result of FY96 Allocations ($40K)

   Like the rest of the ERL labs ETL received $40K of TCCR funds for FY
       96. Rather than  spend this money we are saving it to combine with
       the $100K we plan to receive early next  fiscal year. Our original
       intent was to invest in a larger 64-bit computer system and
       improve the ETL network. However, this wasn't possible with $40K.
       The $40K we received  wasn't enough to purchase the compute server
       and we felt compelled to await the new  building contract award
       before making an investment in a high-speed network.

   FY97 Proposal ($100K):
   Several important events have occurred recently. 1) The new
       NOAA/Boulder building  contract has been awarded with ground
       breaking scheduled for later in 1996. This settles  the issue of
       whether ETL will be moving (most likely within two years) and gives
       us the  opportunity to implement a partial high-speed network. We
       anticipate using ~ $30K of our  allocation to implement a
       high-speed network that will be transferable to the new NOAA
       building. This test bed will consist of selected NT servers, Unix
       workstations and  printers and will be based on switched
       technology.
       Because we have experienced a lack of commitment to technology
       refreshment of RISC  systems and a reluctance to pay for
       hardware/software maintenance we will be using ~5K to  test the
       feasability of using PC/Intel Linux systems as alternatives to Unix
       Workstations  in the future. The test will include performance,
       software availability and ease-of-use.
       The remaining $110K will be used to purchase/upgrade one of our
       compute servers to a  larger 64-bit system to meet the needs of ETL
       scientific researchers who require high  performance computing and
       I/O.

   FSL
   Result of FY96 allocation:

   The FY96 allocation was targeted at upgrading our UniTreesoftware
       license from 1.4TB to  10TB. The cost of this was ~$80K. FSL went
       ahead and purchased this early in the year  using our equipment
       fund. When the $40K arrived late in the year it was put into the
       equipment fund to partially replace the money spent earlier.

   FY97 Proposal
   We plan to use this allocation to purchase a Central Facility Media
       Center. The Media  Center is inteded to provide a reliable,
       consistance method for backing up larger volumes  of data (mostly
       software) residing on FSL servers and workstations. It will also be
       used  to translate Mass Store data into a format usable for FSL
       staff.
       Possible configuration:

   Sun Enterprise 4000 Departmental Server
       FDDI interface
       DLT tape stacker
       8mm tape stacker
       CD rom
       ~12GB disk
       Legato software


   The estimated cost is ~150K. FSL will fill in the remaining amount from
   its equipment  fund.

   GFDL
   Use of FY 1996 NIST/ERL Funds

   Last year GFDL proposed to use FY 1996 NIST/ERL funds to upgrade the
       network as  described below. It was felt that such an upgrade would
       remedy the poor network  performance that was being experienced,
       especially during file transfers. Upon further  testing and
       monitoring of the network, it was determined that the poor
       performance was  caused by old fiber-optic repeaters that predated
       the Ethernet standard. These repeaters  were replaced with new
       units that significantly improved network performance at a much
       lower cost than an upgrade.
       In addition to the new fiber-optic repeaters, FY 1996 NIST/ERL
       funds were used to  purchase new networked printers and two Silicon
       Graphics Indigo2 workstations.

   GFDL Proposal for NIST/ERL Funds (FY 1997)
   As researchers scale their models up to the processing capabilities of
       the new Cray  T90, massive amounts of data are expected to be
       regularly transferred from the  supercomputer to desktop
       workstations. The internal GFDL 10 Mbps Ethernet network will  need
       to be upgraded to handle the increased network traffic.
       The upgrade would take place in two phases:

   Phase 1 (FY 1997):
       Install a 100 Mbps network backbone that incorporates 10/100 Mbps
       Ethernet switches;  install Category 5 wiring from the switches to
       each workstation. This will result in each  workstation having
       dedicated, rather than shared, 10 Mbps bandwidth to the network.
       Phase 2 (FY 1998 and beyond):
       Install 100 Mbps network interface cards in as many workstations as
       possible. No  upgrades to the 10/100 Mbps Ethernet switches should
       be necessary. The remaining  workstations for which 100 Mbps cards
       are not available would continue to operate with  dedicated 10 Mbps
       bandwidth. These older workstations will eventually be replaced
       with  units capable of 100 Mbps network connections.

   GLERL
   Use of FY 1996 NIST/ERL Funds


       Gary Spalding asked me to submit the following proposal for FY97.
       From the FY96 fund of  $40K we spent $26K on our T1 Internet
       connection and banked the remaining $14K for FY97.

   Proposal for NIST/ERL Funds (FY 1997)
   So what follows is based on a $114K total. $79K upgrade SMP system with
       4 CPUs and  additional memory. $35K purchase a more powerful single
       CPU workstation to support the  CHARMS project.

   NSSL
   NSSL Result of FY96 Allocation ($40K):

   - Increased capacity of new RAID subsystem, added 3 new disks ($7.5K).
       - Upgraded general-use data visualization SGI computer. Purchased
       new CPU and high-end  graphics card ($13.4K).
       - Purchased an automated, dual-drive, DLT tape backup unit for RAID
       ($22.7K).
       Total spent: $43.6K

   FY97 Proposal ($100K):
   Upgrade NSSL's only data server. Current processor is over 4 years old
       and  has only 1/20th the compute rating of some of the newer chips.
       Unfortunately, this IBM  model does not have a convenient upgrade
       path, so will require a "forklift"  upgrade replacing cabinet, CPU,
       and internal disk drives. Peripheral disk and tape drives  will
       remain ($100K).

   PMEL
   FY96 Request:

   Upgrade local computing and information infrastructure Result:
       Purchased  additional CPU for the compute server DEC AXP 2100 4/275
       system, on-line 9 GB disks for  moderlers, 20 GB DLT tape drive for
       backup, and a UltraSPARC 1/200E (192MB memory, 11 GB  disk storage)
       desktop workstation for a modeler to perform analysis of modeling
       data sets  ($44.4K)

   FY97 Proposal:
   1) Upgrade local modeling capabilities:

   The current compute server is a DEC AXP 2100 Model 4/275 with 3 CPUs,
       512  MB memory, and 75 GB disk. Plan an upgrade to include 4 CPUs
       with the newer generation  Alpha CPU running at 300 MHz (63%
       floating-point performance improvement over current  CPU). The
       upgrade will also add additional PCI slots for greater expansion
       potential.  Cost: $61K

   2) NFS file-server:
   An Ultra Enterprise 1 Model 170 with 60-80 GB disk with FDDI
       attachment  will provide lab-wide file-storage. The server will
       also host a recently purchased 7xDLT  tape stacker (280 GB capacity
       with compression) and network backup software to serve as a
       network backup server. Cost: $35K

   3) Network printer:
   Sun SparcPrinter-E w/32 MB, with support for common Sun fonts to
       1200x1200  DPI, and additional tray. Cost: $4K

   SEC
   FY96 Request:

   In FY96 SEC channeled most of its computer funding resources, including
       the TCCR $40k  Allocation, into the "Off-the- MV" project, an
       effort to eliminate the  dependency of SEC's primary real-time data
       analysis and display system on an outdated MV  10000 minicomputer
       system.

   FY97 Proposal:
   In FY97 SEC will continue to modernize its operational and research
       systems, improving  performance, supportability, reliability, and
       adding needed capabilities. Added  functionality will include image
       processing, archiving and access capabilities, the  ability to run
       operational real-time models and enhanced data displays.
       To accomplish these goals SEC will use the TCCR Allocation and
       other funds towards:

     * High speed network interface cards for critical data servers
     * Spare switching hub
     * Network test equipment
     * Upgrade data display hardware and software
     * UPS systems for new display hardware
     * Second/backup DMS server
     * Antivirus software for added system security
     * A mirror Outside User System (OUS)
     * Upgrade all PC users to W95/NT
     * Purchase public PC for use by visitor and lab personnel
     * Replace older Apollo Domain systems with UNIX platforms and PCs
     * A UNIX work station capable of supporting large scale real-time
       model applications
     * Convert SEC's existing magnetic tape archives to CD-ROM
     * Add capacity and capability to our network backup system

   ERL-wide priorities for NIST/ERL funds (need to develop options)

   Review of the Internetworking Plan for FY 97.
       We discussed the revisions to the ERL Internetworking Plan  for FY
       97. What ERL-wide proposals should we submit for this fiscal year.
       There is  approximately $555K available.

   *Video Conferncing testbed
       56K pc-to-pc test
       *Supplement Internet connectivity (as HPCC backs out of
       maintenance role)

   $26K GLERL (non-HPPC request)
       $15K increase to all other labs and HQ
       $191K total

   *Internet services across ERL (Administrative info-  supplement ESDIM
   proposal)

   *Intranet services (assist in development at each lab -  Paul Quicker's
   email?)

   Request for Labs not benefitting from HPCC funding --
   NSSL - none
       GLERL - $26K for T1 charges.
       ARL / ASMD requests upgrades for its current DEC 2100  server in
       two parts. One is $30K for additional disk capacity for the server.
       Second is  $40K for additional CPU SRRB requests $25K funding for a
       RAID disk system to protect the  integrity of its data
       dissemination server.
       ARL requests ~$30K for desktop videoconferencing for each  of its
       divisions, allowing them to participate in ARL wide meetings
       (division chiefs,  scientific staff cooperatively working on a
       project, etc.).

   $200K has been allocated to the Alaska Cray deal. This  investment has
   bought us $1M in Artic Research funding from Alaska. The cost to the
   labs  is $200 per SU. John Calder will check with the ERL director to
   see if a call for  proposals for using this fund is going to occur this
   year. Labs should call for proposals  for this computer time.

   Year 2000 problem (is it a problem for ERL?)
   Kevin discussed the problem of the date change at the turn of the
       century.  The question we need to answer is: Is it a problem for
       ERL? NOAA met this summer and  determined that the cost of this
       problem for us would be $184M. Management at all levels  are
       requiring information of this problem. OAR needs to submit it's
       needs to NOAA on  October 4, 1996 and to OMB in January 1997. There
       will be no additional money appropriated  for correcting problems,
       so we need to take it out of current funding.
       Action Item: A suggestion was made that each lab  set up testbed
       systems with their clocks set to years past 2000 to determine the
       real  issues. This inventory needs to include PCs, Macs, Unix
       system clocks, legacy software  systems and field data collection
       systems. The lab's agreed that we will work with NOAA  IRM to
       purchase year 2000 compliant systems in the future.
       Dave Lewis volunteered as of date/time algorithms with test
       software. We  will be making this software available through the
       TCCR web page.

   Updates (We were joined by Bob Kidwell, Sandy Wine, Amy Holman and
   Cayhill Converse.)
   NARB (Amy Holman)

   The last NARB meeting was in July 31, 1996 and the  Washington, D.C.
       network IP address issue was discussed. This issue is being dealt
       with  locally. The Year 2000 issue was also presented. Amy has put
       up a NARB page on the OAR  server. The next meeting will be held on
       October 31, 1996; she briefly presented the  proposed agenda.
       Regional network councils and there relationship to the NARB will
       be  discussed.

   ESDIM (Don Mock)
   Don Mock is the OAR representative to the ESDIM program.  Funding has
       remained level for the past 3 years; FY 97 funding levels are not
       known at  this time. A major change which occured this year is a
       shift toward "ESDIM Directed  Projects" which are more closely
       managed. Requirements for granting proposals include  ties like
       FGDC compliant metadata and NOAAserver connections. Hot topics are
       data fusion  and JAVA projects. The ESDIM team is also moving
       toward more involvement in data and web  policy and management.

   IRM (Bob Kidwell via video conference)
   Bob discussed the OAR liaison to the NOAA IRM Office. See  memo dated
       August 9, 1996.
       The IRM has established a Web page containing useful  information.
       The URL is at: http://www.rdc.noaa.gov/~irm. Sandy Wine requests
       information  for improvements to the page.
       Information Technology Reform Act became active in August.  This
       law repealed the Brooks Act and required DOC to appoint an IRM.
       This law implements  major changes by transferring procurement
       authority to individual Departments (i.e. DOC).  All DOC policies
       and procedures remain in effect. There are efforts at the DOC level
       to  revise current policies and procedures including the IRM
       handbook, Capitol Planning and  Investments, Acquisition Process
       and establishing a Chief Information Officer (CIO).
       Bob reviewed the procurement vehicles available to us and  the
       amount of money spent on each contract. $10M of the $20M on the
       SCIWOC II contract has  been spent. SEWP II has been awarded, but
       specifics are forth coming. The NIH virtual  store is available for
       our use for personal computer equipment. Bob's group is working on
       a NOAA virtual store to purchase personal computer equipment.
       Bob discussed site licenses. Paul Quicker is the OAR
       representative to the NOAA committee. They are currently working on
       a Office Automation  Suite site license. They have met with
       Microsoft and Corel and both are interested in  establishing a site
       license. Cost determination will be made upon a survey that is
       currently being made. Only one suite will be chosen.

   HPCC (Britt Bassett)
    Britt handed out a set of guidelines for HPCC proposals for FY 97.
       The regional managers are working with the NOAA NIC to create
       regional NOAA NICs. The  purpose is to coordinate and implement new
       features.

   New Issues
       ESDIM Central Region Demo Project (Don Mock)

   This proposal is in the competition with other regional  proposals and
       is intended as a intranet prototype. As a new proposal it is
       competing with  established projects; the outcome is unsure at this
       time.

   Firewalls - overview (Britt Bassett)
   Britt gave an overview of firewall issues focused on  corporate
       security policy, physical security, network security and dial-up
       security. A URL  with a list of certified firewall is:
       http://www.ncsa.com/fpfs/fwindex.html
       The security policy is the key to planning and them  implementing
       network security. Consider:

    1.
    2. Know the technology.
    3. Know the organizations' network needs.
    4. Mediate between what is possible, what is needed, and  what is
       requested.
    5. Don't forget remote users and staff on travel.
    6. The scientific/research environment has different needs  than a
       business.
    7. Once implemented, requires continuing changes.
    8. Don't allow the typical overreaction to an incident to  occur.

   Kevin discussed a network security attack that recently  occurred on
   the NSSL network.

   Java (Paul Lu)
   Paul Lu gave an overview JAVA.
       There was a Java workshop in Seattle in Jun 1996. Regions  are
       working on implementing Java processes that can be placed into a
       common library.  Several ERL labs are implementing Java programming
       in their web pages. Paul showed  examples of Java applets for the
       TAO system that have been implemented on the PMEL web  page.

   NOAA Mail*Hub progress (Britt Bassett / All)
   We discussed the Mail*Hub project and its purpose. This hub  is
       currently running and is through its testing phase. It works quite
       well for  attachments.
       Names are inconsistent. Lookup of a person's name is  required
       because of this consistancy problem. There is currently no common
       method of input  to the system of user names. PMEL and AL currently
       input their names on a daily basis.  Britt Bassett inputs the
       remainder of the Boulder names from his CSO database.

   ERL HQ network status (Paul Quicker)
   John Parker has left ERL and there is no longer systems  support person
       in the organization. This raises the issue of whether he should be
       replaced  and what the new position will be.
       A systems analyst was contracted to reccommend how/if  OAR/ERL
       would be able to move away from Banyan. The report is due within a
       month and  should bring change.

   TCCR Administrative

       TCCR homepage: status, what else is needed? (Rich  Beeler)

   We discussed and displayed the TCCR home page. Paul Quicker  is the
       keeper of the page. Access is currently restricted by domain name
       to TCCR members.  The URL is http://tccr.erl.noaa.gov/TCCR/. The
       URL for the TCCR minutes and  membership/meeting information is
       currently on an ETL system which is linked to Paul's  page.
       We decided to move the minutes, membership and meeting  information
       to Paul's page to consoladate the information and create an
       archive.

   Election of new officers (Kevin Kelleher)
   We held elections. The chair nominations were restricted to  Boulder
       Lab members. The vice chair nominations were restricted to
       non-Boulder Lab  members. This is in accordance with our original
       decision to alternate the chair position  between Boulder and
       non-Boulder Labs. We used secret ballots to elect officers. Larry
       Lewis was absent during voting.
       Chair nominations: Rich Beeler. Approved unanimus.
       Vice Chair nominations: Stan Wilkinson, Kevin  Kelleher. Their was
       a tie vote and Kevin withdrew his nomination. Stan was approved
       unanimus.

   Review of subcommittees (goals, members, status)
   We currently have a two Sub-committees:

   Networking Sub-committee - Paul Lu (chair), Kevin Kelleher,  Jerrold
       Momplais, Britt Bassett (ex-officio), Russ Richards (ex-officio).
       Web Advisory Sub-committee (WAS) - Don Mock (chair), Rich  Beeler,
       Stan Wilkinson, Walt Harrop and Paul Quicker.

   Paul Quicker and Amy Holman are working on the NOAA Web  Committee to
   create policy. The WAS will review their work when it comes up for
   review.

   Next meeting
   The next annual meeting will be held in Seattle in ~ 1  year. We
       decided on a early September meeting.
