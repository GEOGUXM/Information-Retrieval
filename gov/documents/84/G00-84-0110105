                    Radar Wind Profiler and Doppler Sodar

Abstract

   In recent years, remote sensing has played an increasingly important
   role in atmospheric boundary layer studies.  Ground-based remote
   profilers have gained a reputation as effective tools for acquiring
   upper air information.  FRD employs a two unique remote sensors used to
   acquire wind profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer.

Introduction

   A 915-MHz Radian phased-array Doppler radar wind profiler transmits has
   a range of approximately 150 to 4000 m with a vertical resolution of 60
   to 100 m.  The remotely-sensed measurements include horizontal wind
   speed (U) and direction (2), the standard deviation of the horizontal
   wind direction (
   F[2]), and vertical wind speed (W).  In addition, the radar estimates
   the refractive index structure parameter (C[N]^2).  This value is a
   direct measurement of the turbulent intensity of humidity fluctuations
   in the atmospheric boundary layer and is useful for estimating the
   mixed layer height (z[i]). [radar1.jpg] A Radian 600PA phased-array
   Doppler sodar transmits a 1.5 to 3 KHz acoustic signal and has a range
   of about 50 to 800 m with a resolution of about 10 to 50 m.  The sodar
   acquires the same wind field data (U, 2, F[2], W) as well as the
   standard deviation of the vertical wind speed (F[w]).  The backscatter
   information acquired by the sodar is directly related to the
   temperature structure function (C[T]^2).  This measurement is useful in
   depicting inversion layers and other regions were temperature gradients
   exist.

   Both systems transmit their respective signals in pulses.  Each pulse
   is both reflected and absorbed by the atmosphere as it moves upwards.
   The vertical range of each pulse is determined by how high it can go
   before the signal becomes so weak that the energy reflected back to the
   antenna can no longer be detected.  That is, as long as the reflected
   pulses can be discerned from background noise, meaningful wind
   velocities can be obtained by comparing the Doppler shift of the output
   signal to that of the return signal.  The attenuation of the pulses are
   functions of signal type, signal power, and atmospheric conditions.

   The radar and sodar are mounted on a 7-m flatbed trailer.  The radar
   sits on the front end of the trailer with the sodar in the rear.
   Leveling of the trailer and sensors is accomplished with seven jacks
   mounted along the sides and front of the trailer.  All of the
   electronics are sheltered in an enclosed trailer.  The heated and
   cooled trailer is 2.4 m wide and 5.5 m long.

   The radar and sodar are each operated by their own PC.  These two
   computers are networked into a "hub" computer using NodeRunner 2000/C
   self-describing Internet cards with LANtastic 6.0 network software.
   Remote access into the hub computer is possible via telephone line and
   a high speed modem.  Data from the hub computer can also be downloaded
   by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) through an Internet connection.
