                                Field Offices

   The FBI's Field Offices are located in major cities throughout the
   United States and in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In addition, resident
   agencies are maintained in smaller cities and towns across the country.
   The locations were selected according to crime trends, the need for
   regional geographic centralization, and the need to efficiently manage
   resources.

   Some of the FBI's 56 Field Offices have jurisdiction in surrounding
   states. For example, the Salt Lake City, Utah, Division investigates
   criminal activity in Utah, Idaho, and Montana, and the Boston,
   Massachusetts, office has jurisdiction in Maine, New Hampshire, and
   Rhode Island.

   Each FBI field office is overseen by a Special Agent in Charge (SAC),
   except for those located in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington,
   D. C. Due to their large size, those offices each are managed by an
   Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC). The ADICs are assisted by SACs
   responsible for specific programs.

   All of our Field Offices may be contacted twenty-four hours a day,
   every day. Check out the Field Office Contact Information page for
   addresses and phone numbers of the closest FBI Office to your locale --
   as well as links to their web sites.
   The FBI encourages the public to report any suspected violations of
   U.S. federal law. You can do so by calling your local FBI office, Legal
   Attache office, or by submitting a tip via the FBI Tips and Public
   Leads form.
