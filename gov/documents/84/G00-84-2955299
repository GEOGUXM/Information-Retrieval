                          Payload Integration Flow
                            [USEMAP:overview.jpg]
                 Based on a "typical" Cargo Integration flow

   The process of preparing for each Shuttle mission includes the
   manifesting of a compatible payload mix, and the installation of those
   payloads into the payload bay. The payload integration process varies
   in both length and activities performed depending on numerous factors:
   the complexity of the payload complement, horizontal vs. vertical
   installation, reflight of primary payload, etc.

   The process and timeline described here represents a "typical" flow
   starting with the earliest stages of planning and design, and
   continuing through launch. The time scale is delineated in months
   before launch, or L minus months. Each of the bars symbolize a major
   component of the activities performed in the payload integration
   process, and the triangles denote major milestones encountered along
   the way. Click on on any of the bars or milestones to obtain more
   information.
