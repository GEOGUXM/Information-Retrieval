New Release: BK-Economics 1.34

   For Windows and Macintosh

About the Software

   BK-Economics is a software package that was developed by a team of
   scientists at the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona to
   assist commercial beekeepers in streamlining their business practices.
   This software allows beekeepers to simulate years of business, taking
   into account factors like equipment purchases, labor force,
   transportation, marketing strategies, loans, honey flow, and other hive
   products without taking the usual risks. This software, when used in
   combination with the marketing strategy information in publication, can
   help beekeepers formulate a successful business plan when making
   financial decisions, expanding an operation or just starting out.

Downloading BK-Economics 1.34

   This software is downloadable on-line in "net installer" versions. Net
   Installer software packs are in archive format for each platform and
   the associated files are large. If you are downloading from home,
   please take note of the file sizes and the approximated download time.
   (Times are calculated based on a ~5kbps modem connection with
   compression.) Once the file has been downloaded, you will need
   decompression software to "unzip" or "unstuff" the archive. Note that
   particular browsers will do this for you (ie., Communicator or
   Explorer), provided they have the proper plug-in. The archive contains
   a setup program that will install BK-Economics for your computer. Click
   on the link for your platform below to begin downloading BK-Economics
   1.34.
