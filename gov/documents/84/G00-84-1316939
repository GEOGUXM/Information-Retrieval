     The Alaska Fisheries Science Center's AFSC Processed Report series
   (1991 to present) continues the NWFC and NWAFC Processed Report series
    originally established in 1974. This series is not formally reviewed
     and individual reports do not constitute publications; some of the
         reports may be contract reports or administrative reports.
    The reports are listed chronologically for each calendar year and by
   series title. Availability of copies varies greatly for each Processed
    Report. Single reprints of the most recent AFSC Processed Reports are
     available free of charge from the senior author of the report until
      supplies are exhausted. The mailing address for the senior Center
                 author is also indicated in each citation.
          Single copies of the older reports may be requested from
    Bernie Goiney (Alaska Fisheries Science Center). In many cases, there
     are no available copies of the older reports. Expect a significant
    delay in receiving the older AFSC, NWAFC, or NWFC Processed Reports.
