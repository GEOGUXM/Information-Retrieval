   Remote VPN Requirement
   To access the JSC-TSC from a University or a Corporate Intranet, the
   IPSEC port will need to be configured by the University or the
   Corporate Intranet's System Administrator. Please verify that the
   following ports are allowed : Ports TCP 264, IP 50 & 51 and UDP 500.
   The remote user will be unable to access JSC-TSC through VPN if the
   router does not allow the IPSEC ports.
   IMPORTANT NOTICE: In order to establish a Secured VPN using
   Checkpoint's SecuRemote software, the following protocols and ports
   will have to be opened through your firewalls and filter-lists to allow
   communication between your client and the JSC-TSC firewall.
   IPSEC Protocols:
   ** UDP 500 bi-directional- IKE For key exchange
   ** IP 50 and 51 bi-directional- Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP)
   For encryption of data
   ** TCP 264 outbound - Updated Topology Fetch which connects to our
   Firewall when needed.
   If you need further information, please send an email toCurator:
   JSC-TSC.
