    Overcome Your Symptoms!  -  A Program for People with Chronic Disease
     __________________________________________________________________

   This coping strategy class is designed for veterans with chronic
   diseases. Spouses and/or partners are also welcome to attend with the
   veteran.

   The class assists people in dealing with chronic illnesses through
   participation in a "peer lead" series of group meetings. People with
   different chronic health problems can attend the course together. 2
   trained leaders facilitate the course, one or both of who are
   non-health professionals with chronic diseases themselves.

   The 6-session fall series is held on Tuesdays, beginning on Jan 15, 22,
   29 and Feb 5, 12, and 19th, 2002 from 10am to 12:30 in the GIMC
   Conference Room.

   Subjects covered include:
     * Techniques to deal with problems as frustration, fatigue, pain and
       isolation
     * Appropriate exercise for maintaining and improving strength,
       flexibility and endurance
     * Appropriate use of medications
     * Communicating effectively with family, friends and health
       professionals
     * Nutrition and
     * How to evaluate new treatments.

   Each participant uses a copy of the companion book, Living a Healthy
   Life with Chronic Conditions.
