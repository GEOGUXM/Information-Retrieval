   Engineering at LLNL has a reputation for doing the impossible, as it
   develops its technologies to meet critical national issues. Today
   Engineering is pioneering technologies that extend the range of
   solutions from microscale to ultrascale, often simultaneously. We call
   these poles "Xtreme Engineering" because these new areas of expertise
   stretch the already wide breadth of LLNL's technology portfolio.

   Engineers work with others at the Laboratory and in the Department of
   Energy to address national priorities--demanding even smaller parts,
   faster times, greater power, more complexity, and higher precision.
   LLNL Engineering has developed the world's smallest biomedical
   instruments and is now helping to build the National Ignition Facility,
   the world's largest laser. The following examples illustrate LLNL
   engineering solutions to challenges in the micro and ultra worlds.
     * Microscale Systems
     * Very-High-Speed Diagnostics
     * Ultra-Precision Tools
     * Monumental Structures

   Microscale Systems

   Robin Miles and Peter Krulevitch The next generation of medical
   diagnostic instruments will integrate electronics with fluids on
   microfabricated chips. Working with the MD Anderson Cancer Center and
   UC Berkeley, mechanical engineer Peter Krulevitch estimates that his
   team is one year away from applying this technology to a hand-held
   instrument capable of separating and identifying cells.

   Meanwhile, mechanical engineer Robin Miles and her team are building a
   device to purify and concentrate airborne pathogens for more efficient
   detection.

   Their designs use 20- to 200-micrometers-deep fluid channels etched in
   glass substrates with patterned electrodes for identifying and
   manipulating biological particles. A human hair is about 100
   micrometers in diameter.

   For more information, see Handling Fluids in Microsensors.

   Amy Wang There is great interest in developing miniaturized total
   analysis systems on a single chip. Most of these systems are targeted
   for diagnostic applications with the intent of speeding up assays,
   reducing sample size, and even producing small portable instruments for
   home use.

   Amy Wang is using her electrical engineering skills to advance these
   miniaturized systems. She is studying both acoustic forces and
   ultrasonic waves as a means to mix, transport, and sense the tiny
   particles in these revolutionary microfluidic systems.

   Very-High-Speed Diagnostics

   Rob Costa and Dean Lee A second of time is "forever" to mechanical
   technician Rob Costa and electronics engineer Dean Lee. Their work is
   measured in picoseconds or one-trillionth of a second. The two work as
   a team to design and develop diagnostics that will support fusion
   experiments in the target chamber for the National Ignition Facility.

   Until NIF is built, they develop diagnostics and support experiments on
   the Nova laser at LLNL. These findings will improve the technology of
   streak cameras, gated imagers, digital cameras, and other diagnostic
   components.

   Paul Sargis Defense technologies also depend on extremely high-speed
   diagnostics. Paul Sargis, an electronics engineer, specializes in
   developing high-speed measurement systems that use advanced fiber-optic
   and microwave technologies.

   He is currently developing a diagnostic device to measure surface
   speeds over 4000 mph in a microsecond timeframe. Here Sargis is shown
   next to the prototype velocimetry electronics that he designed and used
   on recent high-explosives tests.

   For more information, see Computed Electromagnets: Codes and
   Capabilities.

   Ultra-Precision Tools

   Rick Montesanti and Sam Thompson The National Ignition Facility will
   depend on optics that set new standards for quality and purity.
   Mechanical engineer Rick Montesanti and mechanical engineer associate
   Sam Thompson applied their expertise and experience in precision
   engineering to guide a commercial design of a new ultra-precision
   machine tool critical for fabricating a unique class of optics needed
   for NIF. (Ultra-precision machine tools can be one- to
   two-orders-of-magnitude more precise than those industry calls
   high-precision tools.)

   The new machine tool, a diamond fly cutter, will produce the final
   surfaces on all crystalline optics used in the 192 laser beams of NIF.
   Aside from helping NIF, the work advanced a company's position as a
   world-class machine tool builder.

   Debra Krulewich The same increased precision in manufacturing is being
   demanded by other LLNL programs. Requirements for many of these
   precision parts are being specified in terms of the allowable frequency
   distribution of errors on the final machined part. Before work by LLNL,
   no precision method existed for designing or selecting machine tools to
   manufacture these parts.

   Mechanical engineer Debra Krulewich has developed advanced methods for
   correlating the behavior of a machine's subsystems to their "signature"
   or impact on the accuracy of a finished part. With this new method,
   errors can be predicted, and changes to the machine's subsystems can
   better match finished part requirements.

   For more information, see Machine Tool Metrology.

   Monumental Structures

   Dave McCallen Structural mechanics engineer Dave McCallen, with LLNL
   seismologists and UC Berkeley engineering faculty, is performing
   large-scale computer simulations to determine how various mammoth
   structures will respond during earthquakes in California. His detailed
   computer modeling already has helped CalTrans fine-tune its $50-million
   retrofit of the 24-580-980 highway interchange in Oakland, California.

   Now he is studying how long-span arch bridges along California's
   coast--like the San Francisco Bay Bridge--will respond to earthquakes.
   His studies will improve structural designs and probably save lives in
   the "Big One."

   For more information, see A Shaker Exercise for the Bay Area.

   Tony De Groot and Carol Hoover LLNL, a pioneer in monumental-scale
   computing since our founding, is now utilizing massively parallel
   computers that provide thousands of processors to calculate engineering
   problems with hundreds of millions of sets of data. Electrical engineer
   Tony De Groot and computational physicist Carol Hoover design
   innovative numerical methods for ParaDyn, a parallel version of the
   popular DYNA3D computer code developed at LLNL that is now used
   worldwide as a materials deformation code for structures of all sizes.

   ParaDyn performs calculations in less than a day that required over a
   month before. Hoover and De Groot report that ParaDyn and massively
   parallel computers are already providing breakthroughs in the defense,
   transportation, and manufacturing industries.

   Very-Large-Scale Experiments

   Bret Knapp Today we cannot use actual testing to assure that the
   nation's nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and reliable. Instead, the
   Laboratory conducts "tests" with computer simulations or on parts of
   technical components that already exist.

   Mechanical engineer Bret Knapp leads a group whose work includes the
   Lab's Big Explosive Experimental Facility. His group builds
   very-large-scale experiments for the scientists who are charged with
   ensuring the safety and reliability of the high-explosives components
   for existing weapons. After creating sketches or computer-generated
   designs, they make parts that can be tested at the Lab's Site 300 or at
   the Nevada Test Site.

   Johanna Swan The Stanford Linear Accelerator will make scientific
   history this summer when it begins high-energy accelerator experiments
   on the grand scale aimed at unraveling how the universe evolved after
   the Big Bang. This $300-million UC project, called the B Factory, will
   use many machine components built at LLNL.

   Mechanical engineer Johanna Swan designed, built, and tested the final
   focusing quadrupole magnets that will guide the accelerator beam before
   it goes into the detector. The magnet she worked on is unique because
   it used an unprecedented coil design to shape the magnetic field to
   meet the most stringent requirements on the B-Factory project. Swan is
   shown above with a cross-section design for her five-foot-long magnet.

   For more information, see The B-Factory and the Big Bang.

   Very-Large-Scale Systems

   Paul Van Arsdall and Vicki Miller Kamm The world's most powerful
   laser--now under construction at LLNL--will be controlled by one of the
   most complex computer systems. Shown at the prototype operator console
   are electrical engineers Paul Van Arsdall, system manager of the design
   team, and Vicki Miller Kamm, in charge of the alignment computer
   subsystem that controls some 9,000 motors attached to beam transport
   optics.

   The integrated system of over 500 computers will control some 60,000
   points for every shot, including mirrors, lenses, motors, sensors,
   cameras, amplifiers, pulse power, and diagnostic instruments. Working
   with the harmony of an electronic symphony, the control system will
   ensure that the laser's 192 beams propagate a 20-ns-long burst of light
   precisely toward a microscopic fusion target.

   For more information, see the Integrated Computer Control System for
   the National Ignition Facility.

   Preston Carter A global-scale concept that could revolutionize
   intercontinental flight and access to space is ready to jump from the
   drawing board for aerospace engineer Preston Carter. His new aircraft,
   called HyperSoar, could fly 6700 mph and reach an altitude of 200,000
   feet, getting passengers to any destination on the planet in under two
   hours.

   The key to HyperSoar is the skipping motion of its flight along the
   upper edges of the Earth's atmosphere that avoids the heat of the lower
   layers. Most likely to be first used for military applications,
   HyperSoar is under serious discussion for development of the first
   prototype.
