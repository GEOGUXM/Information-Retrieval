NY001 Surface Water Stations

   PROBLEM

   Surface-water information is needed for surveillance, planning, design,
   hazard warning, operation, and management in water-related fields such
   as water supply, hydroelectric power, flood control, irrigation, bridge
   and culvert design, wildlife management, pollution abatement,
   flood-plain management, and water-resources development. To provide
   this information, an appropriate data base is necessary.

   OBJECTIVE

   (1) To collect surface-water data sufficient to satisfy needs for
   current- purpose uses, such as assessment of water resources, operation
   of reservoirs or industries, forecasting, disposal of wastes and
   pollution controls, discharge data to accompany water-quality
   measurement, compact and legal requirement, and research or special
   studies. (2) To collect data needed in analytical studies to define for
   any location the statistical properties of, and trends in, the
   occurrence of water in streams, lakes, estuaries, etc., for use in
   planning and design.

   APPROACH

   Standard methods of data collection will be used as described in the
   series, "techniques of water resources investigations of the united
   states geological survey." Partial-record gaging will be used instead
   of complete-record gaging where it serves the required purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

NY002 GW Stations

   PROBLEM

   Long term water level records are needed to evaluate the effects of
   climatic variations on the recharge to and discharge from the
   ground-water systems, to provide a data base from which to measure the
   effects of development, to assist in the prediction of future supplies,
   and to provide data for management of the resource.

   OBJECTIVE

   A. To collect water level data sufficient to provide a minimum
   long-term data base so that the general response of the hydrologic
   system to natural climatic variations and induced stresses is known and
   potential problems can be defined early enough to allow proper planning
   and management. B. To provide a data base against which the short-term
   records acquired in areal studies can be analyzed. This analysis must
   (1) provide an assessment of the ground-water resource, (2) allow
   prediction of future conditions, and (3) provide the data base
   necessary for management of the resource.

   APPROACH

   Evaluation of regional geology allows broad, general definition of
   aquifer systems and their boundary conditions. Within this framework
   and with some knowledge of the stress on the system in time and space
   and the hydrologic properties of the aquifers a subjective decision can
   be made on the most advantageous locations for observation of long-term
   system behavior. This subjective network can be refined as records
   become available and detailed areal studies of the ground-water system
   more closely define the aquifers, their properties, and the stresses to
   which they are subjected.
     __________________________________________________________________

NY003 Water Quality Stations

   PROBLEM

   Water resources planning and water quality assessment require a
   statewide and nationwide level of information of chemical and physical
   quality of surface and ground-waters.

   OBJECTIVE

   To provide a statewide and nationwide bank of water-quality data for
   Federal, State, and local planning, and provide such data where it will
   support other projects within the New York District. Maintain a
   water-quality lab within the district to analyze low-ionic strength
   water.

   APPROACH

   Maintain and operate a network of water-quality stations to provide
   concentrations, loads, and time trends of chemical constituents in
   surface waters. Funding for these sites comes from the state/federal
   coop program (Federal water-quality program was discontinued in FY
   1996). Data provided by local cooperators are used to supplement the
   network.
     __________________________________________________________________

NY005 National Trends Network (NTN) for Monitoring Atmospheric Deposition (MAD)
/ National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP)

   PROBLEM

   To establish and operate a nationwide long-term monitoring network to
   detect and measure levels of atmospheric deposition.

   OBJECTIVE

   To determine variations in atmospheric deposition that occur on a week
   to week basis. To collect wet and dry deposition products for analysis
   of elements and compounds that can contribute to the chemical
   composition of surface waters.

   APPROACH

   Set up monitoring stations as part of the National Trends Network.
   Maintain stations, make on site measurements, process samples, and
   submit samples to an analytical laboratory. Verify data retrievals and
   report on results.
     __________________________________________________________________

NY046 Occurrence and Transport of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Residues within
the Upper Hudson River Basin

   PROBLEM

   The industrial discharge of (PCB's) Polychlorinated biphenyls into the
   upper Hudson River has degraded this resource. Because it is not known
   whether significant quantities of PCB-contaminated sediments have
   already been transported downstream, the efficacy of proposed sediment
   dredging operations in the upper Hudson is not known.

   OBJECTIVE

   The role of the upper Hudson in contributing PCB's to the estuary will
   be approximated, and, it will be determined whether PCB-contaminated
   sediments have been transported into the estuary. This study will
   provide a data base from which the effects of dredging the upper
   Hudson, if that course of action is followed, can be evaluated.

   APPROACH

   The movement of PCB Aroclors from sediments into the water column and
   their configuration to the PCB load transported by the Hudson River
   will be studied with emphasis on high-flow events.

NY114 Baseline Water Quality Assessment of Selected Aquifers in New York

   PROBLEM (11400)

   Principal aquifers in upstate New York are generally isolated
   unconfined glacial or alluvial deposits in valleys cut into crystalline
   or shaley bedrock. As development has taken place on those aquifers,
   they have become susceptible to contamination. Contamination, whether
   from agricultural, industrial or non-point sources, in many places
   jeopardizes the only economical source of water for individual,
   communities and small industries alike. Management decision for
   solutions or prevention of these problems would be facilitated by an
   appraisal of selected areas of known or potential problems.

   PROBLEM (11401)

   Clifton Park water supply is derived form ground-water sources in a
   wide variety of hydrogeologic settings. The consolidation of several
   smaller water suppliers into a town water authority has resulted in a
   need for an updated conceptualization of the hydrogeologic system to
   support effective water-resources management/protection within the town
   as a whole.

   OBJECTIVE (11400)

   (1) Select aquifers that have a known potential ground-water
   contamination problem (e.g., Utica-Rome, Clifton Park), (2) compile
   geohydrologic maps on the aquifer systems, (3) select a ground-water
   quality monitoring system for major water-supply users, and (4) sample
   and analyze for initial baseline quality.

   OBJECTIVE (11401)

   To update the conceptual model of the hydrogeologic system centered on
   the Colonie Channel, a buried bedrock channel that runs north-south
   beneath the eastern half of the town.

   APPROACH (11400)

   Aquifer selection will be flexible, dependent on needs of cooperator.
   Well-data base will be conducted under NY002 project. Aquifers will be
   mapped on 1:24,000 scale using published (or minor field mapping)
   geology, soils and land- use maps. Aquifer characteristics will be
   interpreted using thickness, sections, water-level, and general quality
   maps. Sets of maps will be published in O-F series.

   APPROACH (11401)

   Existing driller's logs, water-quality analyses, and pumpage data will
   be compiled. A ground-water level network will be established and will
   be adjusted, over time, to focus on different areas of interest.
   Monthly specific conductance measurements will be instituted at all
   active production wells and ground-water samples will be collected for
   inorganic tritium analyses at selected wells. Continuous water-level
   measuring equipment will be installed at several wells at one time and
   shifted, as needs arise, during the course of the study.
   Conceptualization of the hydrogeologic system will integrate water
   level data (including barometric responses), subsurface logs,
   water-quality analyses, and pumpage data.

NY125 Hydrologic Models of the Ground-Water Flow System on Long Island, New York

   PROBLEM

   Declining ground-water levels, streamflow depletion, saltwater
   encroachment into aquifers, and pollution with industrial and domestic
   wastes pose a serious threat to the potable water supply of Long
   Island, which is heavily dependent upon ground water as a source for
   domestic, public, and industrial water supplies. Local governments are
   keenly aware of the importance of proper management of their
   ground-water resources. Integral to proper resource management planning
   is an adequate understanding of the hydrologic system and the testing
   of various alternatives using predictive hydrologic models.

   OBJECTIVE

   To provide quantitative estimates of (1) the characteristics of the
   ground- water system under predevelopment conditions; (2) the changes
   in these characteristics which have been caused by the effects of man;
   and (3) the changes that would result from future implementation of
   various water-resource management schemes. Pertinent characteristics of
   the ground-water system include the patterns and rates of ground-water
   movement, and the rates of ground-water discharge at boundaries (i.e.
   streams, shore, sub-sea discharges).

   APPROACH

   A new three-dimensional finite difference ground-water flow model,
   which will include all unconsolidated hydrogeologic units on Long
   Island, will allow for regional hydrologic simulations to be made. Data
   compilation and analysis for model input include estimates of gaged and
   ungaged stream baseflow, current reinterpretation of hydrogeologic
   geometry, approximation of position of salt- water interfaces, and
   refined calculation of ground-water recharge under natural and
   urbanized conditions. Steady-state simulations of both predevelopment
   and recent hydrologic conditions and a transient simulation of the
   1960's drought will be made. The results of these simulations will be
   compared to documented historical data to demonstrate the accuracy of
   the model. In addition these simulations will add to our understanding
   of the characteristics of the ground-water system. Predictive runs will
   be made to assess managerial decisions regarding future development of
   the ground-water system.

NY175 Resource-Management Evaluation and Study of Saltwater Movement within the
Transition Zone of the Hudson River Estuary

   PROBLEM

   The effect of freshwater withdrawals on salinity in the transition zone
   of the Hudson River is unknown. Increased salinity and upstream
   movement of the salt front could adversely affect the river. As a
   result, new water supplies should be developed until their probable
   effect on saltwater movement can be determined. The mechanisms or
   driving forces that determine saltwater movement and salt-front
   location are not fully understood; therefore, solute transport in the
   estuary resulting from a given set of hydrologic conditions cannot be
   predicted accurately.

   OBJECTIVE

   To identify and describe the driving forces that determine the location
   and shape of the saltwater/freshwater boundary, identify the effect of
   seasonal variations and channel geometry on the location of the salt
   front, predict the effect of water withdrawals at different points on
   the location of the salt front, and develop a numerical model that will
   be used to examine proposed water-withdrawal plans, such that
   conditions limiting the use of the estuary as a source of potable water
   can be defined for different sets of hydrologic conditions.

   APPROACH

   This study will be divided into several phases that include identifying
   and evaluating present models, data, and data-collection programs for
   the Hudson River estuary; developing a one-dimensional model and using
   the model to evaluate what data are needed and where data-collection
   sites could be located; installing tide-stage stations and
   stream-gaging stations at several locations; performing three to five
   tidal-cycle discharge and salinity measurements under differing
   hydrologic conditions; using these data to calibrate and verify one-,
   two- and/or three-dimensional models to simulate the forces controlling
   flow and saltwater movement in the estuary; and evaluating the effects
   of several water-withdrawal scenarios with these models.

NY178 Evaluation of Scour at Bridges in New York

   PROBLEM

   No reliable technique to estimate scour at bridges in New York is
   available. Lack of certainty as to which scour-prediction equations(s)
   to use for a particular set of circumstances has prompted an effort to
   develop data bases that reflect full-scale, prototype field conditions.
   The types of channels and bridges that are vulnerable to scour and the
   methods of data collection need to be identified.

   OBJECTIVE

   To collect scour data to evaluate and perhaps improve
   scour-predictions. To categorize the types of channels and bridge
   designs vulnerable to scour. To assess alternative methods of data
   collection.

   APPROACH

   76 bridge sites will be selected for scour-data collection, including
   31 sites for measurement during high flows. Measurement techniques will
   include equipment and procedures used by U.S. Geological survey along
   with geophysical techniques. Sites not selected for onsite measurements
   will be inspected annually. The type(s) and extent of scour will be
   examined. Results of scour- prediction equations will be compared with
   measured scour. Regression analyses and(or) other curve-fitting
   techniques will be used to improve scour-prediction equations. The
   types of channels and bridges vulnerable to scour will be categorized.

NY190 Effects of Stormwater Detention in Wetlands of the Lower Irondequoit Creek
Basin Near Rochester

   PROBLEM

   Irondequoit Creek, which flows through an expansive flood plain wetland
   into Irondequoit Bay, has been identified as a significant source of
   nonpoint-source pollutants. The U.S. Geological Survey studied the
   Irondequoit Creek basin as part of the National Urban Runoff Program
   (NURP) in 1980-81 to determine the chemical quality of urban runoff and
   provide data to indicate which strategies could help decrease chemical
   loads in urban runoff that enters Irondequoit Bay.

   OBJECTIVE

   To evaluate the use of the flood-plain wetlands at the mouth of
   Irondequoit Creek as a nutrient and sediment filter. Determine the
   effects of storm runoff on a monocultural cattail wetland after flow
   modifications to disperse stormflows through wetlands and increase the
   residence time of the water and associated constituents; and document
   the present flora and fauna of the wetland and evaluate ecosystem
   changes that might affect the multiple-use value of the wetland.

   APPROACH

   Baseline quality water data will be collected upstream and downstream
   of the wetland before flow modification area to document the effect of
   the present dispersion patterns on water quality. A flow-control
   structure midway through the wetland to increase stormwater dispersion
   and detention throughout the wetland water sampling will be resumed
   there after to document the resultant changes. Flora and fauna surveys
   will be conducted throughout the study to document ecological changes
   that result. Shallow sediment and plant-tissue samples will be taken
   along transects above and below the flow-control structure to document
   changes in the accumulation of nutrients, trace metals, and organic
   compounds in the sediments and plants after the flow modification.

NY191 Croton Watershed Ground-water-quality-monitoring Network

   PROBLEM

   Urbanization in the Croton River Watershed has led to deterioration of
   water quality in New York City's Croton Reservoir System. The water
   does not require filtration at present, but if current trends in
   urbanization and subsequent deterioration in water quality continue,
   filtration, and other types of treatment, which are expensive, will be
   inevitable. Data on water use, streamflow, ground-water levels and
   water quality are needed by water-resource managers to evaluate the
   quality and quantity of water resources in the watershed.

   OBJECTIVE

   To document the effects of development on shallow ground-water
   (nutrients and inorganic constituents) at sites ranging from
   undeveloped forested areas to highly developed residential areas.

   APPROACH

   Samples where collected from 33 first- and second-order streams during
   baseflow conditions and from seven wells on a quarterly basis for one
   year. Stream baseflow samples were used because they represent
   ground-water discharge that ultimately reaches the reservoirs. Such
   samples are a composite of shallow ground-water contributions from the
   drainage area upgradient of a given sampling site. The chemical data
   was then interpreted with respect to land use type and intensity within
   the drainage basins. The wells were installed in nests of three and
   four wells at varying depths downgradient of residential areas served
   by individual septic systems.

NY199 Hudson River Basin National Water-Quality Assessment

   PROBLEM

   The Nation's water resources are composed of many interrelated ground-
   and surface-water systems. The response of each of these systems to
   natural and human factors manifests itself in a corresponding set of
   hydrologic, chemical, and biological characteristics that reflect the
   water-quality effects of these factors. A nationwide assessment is
   needed to address the recurring local and regional problems related to
   managing and protecting the quality of our Nation's water resources.

   OBJECTIVE

   Provide a nationally consistent description of current water-quality
   conditions for a large part of the Nation's water resources. Define
   long-term trends (or lack of trends) in water quality. Identify,
   describe, and explain, to the extent possible, the major natural and
   human factors that affect observed water- quality conditions and
   trends.

   APPROACH

   The Hudson basin is one of 60 study units that together will provide
   the information for local, regional, and national assessments of
   water-quality conditions and trends. Each study will evaluate existing
   information and use this information to design sampling programs that
   use nationally consistent methods. Three years (1993-95) were spent
   implementing these sampling programs and analyzing the data. This
   intensive phase is being followed by six years of less intensive
   sampling, then the cycle will begin again.

NY200 Stream-Water Quality as a Function of Watershed Scale in the Neversink
River, Catskill Mountains, New York

   PROBLEM

   Maintaining the water quality of Catskill reservoirs which supply
   drinking water to New York City requires a detailed understanding of
   watershed processes which control the water quality of streams and
   rivers that flow into the reservoirs.

   OBJECTIVE

   Determine water-quality relations between the Neversink River and
   upstream drainages by assessing the chemical changes in stream
   chemistry throughout the basin. Develop a quantitative relationship
   between stream chemistry, discharge, and watershed characteristics.
   Determine methods to extrapolate water-quality data between watersheds
   at different scale.

   APPROACH

   Conduct a detailed spatial analysis of surface-water quality throughout
   the basin. Relate topographic characteristics to spatial variations in
   stream chemistry. Evaluate temporal variability of streamflow and
   chemistry at different watershed scales.
     __________________________________________________________________

NY202 Geohydrology of Northern Nassau County, Long Island, New York

   PROBLEM

   Increased groundwater use in Northern Nassau County has predicated the
   need for detailed knowledge of the hydrologic and hydrogeologic
   framework of the area. Northern Nassau County is dominated by fresh
   groundwater necks and peninsulas surrounded by saltwater bays and
   inlets. This close proximity of saltwater and a fresh groundwater
   reservoir coupled with an ever increasing demand of the resource causes
   concern for possible saltwater intrusion.

   OBJECTIVE

   Investigate the present position of a freshwater-saltwater interface
   and try to delineate it. Determine hydraulic separations and
   interconnections between aquifers and how the hydrogeology affects
   local groundwater flow patterns. Map hydrogeologic units at a higher
   resolution then presently exists.

   APPROACH

   Develop a water elevation well network for the study area. Measure and
   map water-table and potentiometric surface elevations to determine
   hydraulic gradients within and between aquifers. Compile available
   groundwater data, water levels, chloride analyses and geophysical logs
   to provide a data base from which future drilling sites can be
   identified. Sample selected and installed wells for major inorganic
   constituents, in particular chloride concentrations at regular
   intervals during the study. Compile hydrogeologic maps and cross
   sections from previous workers to determine future drilling sites for
   detailed hydrogeologic mapping. Drill and install wells using PVC
   casing and collect geologic, electric electromagnetic and gamma logs.

NY203 Monitoring and Simulation of Proposed Ground-Water Supply and Dewatering
Operations, Kings and Queens Counties, New York

   PROBLEM

   The recovering water level has created flooding problems in subway
   systems in several areas. The question is also raised as to whether a
   largely recovered aquifer can be used to supplement supply under a new
   pumping strategy to reduce saltwater encroachment. The leaking storage
   tanks and other urban sources of contamination have affected the water
   quality of the aquifer.

   OBJECTIVE

   Define the ground-water quality with emphasis on volatile organics and
   saltwater intrusion. Establish a data collection network including
   water supply and dewatering operations by numerical simulation.

   APPROACH

   MONITORING COMPONENT - compile water quality data over the past ten
   years and new data from approximately 100 wells used in 1981-1983
   study. Establish stream gaging stations at two locations. Drill ten
   additional PVC wells and use EM39 to determine vertical water quality
   profiles. Identify long-term water-level monitoring network.
   GROUND-WATER FLOW-SIMULATION COMPONENT - develop a detailed
   three-dimensional ground-water flow model of western Long Island. The
   model will be calibrated under average, steady-state conditions.
   Various pumping and dewatering scenarios will be tested.

   PROBLEM

   The recovering water levels have created flooding problems in subway
   systems in several areas. The question is also raised as to whether
   recovered ground water reservoir can be used to supplement water supply
   under a new pumping strategy and reduce salt-water encroachment.
   Volatile organic compounds have appeared in the ground water and need
   to be monitored.

   OBJECTIVE

   Define the ground-water quality with emphasis on volatile organics and
   salt-water intrusion. Establish a basic data network for ground-water
   and stream-flow. Determine the effect of current and proposed
   water-supply and dewatering operations by numerical simulation.
   Monitoring Component: Compile water quality data over past 10 years.
   Collect new data from approximately 100 wells and compare this data
   with the 1981-1983 data set. Establish stream-gaging stations at two
   locations. Drill 10 additional PVC wells and use EM39 to determine
   vertical water quality profiles. Identify long term water-level
   monitoring network. Ground water Flow Simulation Component: Develop a
   detailed 3-D ground-water flow model of western Long Island. The model
   will be calibrated under average, steady-state conditions. Various
   pumping and dewatering scenarios will be used.

NY204 Effects of Forest Harvesting on Nitrogen-Cycling Processes in Headwaters
of the Neversink River

   PROBLEM

   The Catskill Mountain region has among the highest rates of atmospheric
   nitrogen deposition in the northeastern United States. Long-term water
   quality data indicates that nitrate concentrations have increased
   during the past 50 years in Catskill streams. Nitrate is largely
   transported as a strong mineral acid, and therefore, contributes to
   stream acidification and its associated toxic effects on biota. Because
   nitrogen is a nutrient that potentially limits forest growth, the
   historical increases in Catskill stream nitrate concentrations are
   closely related to forest stand history and maturity. Forest harvesting
   may result in increases in the leaching of nitrogen from soils into
   streams, and thus, may effect stream acidification and stream biota.

   OBJECTIVE

   The objectives of this study are to determine how two different forest
   harvesting techniques affect the rates at which nitrogen and related
   chemical constituents are processed within two Catskill watersheds, the
   implications of changes in nitrogen-cycling rates on stream-water
   quality and stream biota, and how quickly and to what extent nitrogen
   retention in the affected watersheds recovers from the effects of
   harvesting.

   APPROACH

   This study will use a watershed approach in which inputs and outputs of
   chemical constituents are measured in three catchments. The trees will
   be completely removed from one watershed, a second watershed will be
   selectively harvested (removal of about 40% of the trees), and a third
   will remain undisturbed as a control. Streamflow and rainfall amount
   will be continuously monitored, and stream and precipitation samples
   will be collected frequently for chemical analysis. Additionally,
   samples of soil water, ground water, and throughfall will be collected
   for chemical analysis. In-situ incubations and buried ion exchange
   resin techniques will be used to determine rates of soil nitrogen
   turnover and movement. Homogenized mineral soil will be buried and
   removed annually to determine changes in soil chemistry. Data will be
   collected for three years prior to harvesting and for four years after
   harvesting.

NY205 Hydrogeology of Mudboils along Onondaga Creek Near Tully Valley New York

   PROBLEM

   Information on the origin of the Tully Mudboils, their persistence, and
   the possible extent of their migration is needed to mitigate or
   remediate (1) land subsidence, and (2) degradation of Onondaga Creek by
   turbidity, fine-sediment deposition, and chloride loading.

   OBJECTIVE

   To define the glacial stratigraphy and hydraulic-head distribution
   within the unconsolidated deposits, and identify the source(s) of
   artesian head driving the mudboils.

   APPROACH

   A drilling, sampling and hydraulic-head monitoring and testing program
   will be implemented in and near the mudboil area. Auger holes about 125
   feet deep will be drilled to define the glacial stratigraphy.
   Transducers will be used to measure pressure fluctuation in the poorly
   permeable units, and hydraulic tests will be performed in permeable
   layers. These data will be used to identify the source of artesian head
   that causes the mudboils to discharge ground water and fine sediments
   at land surface and to Onondaga Creek.

NY301 Hydrogeologic Evaluation of Brookhaven National Laboratory

   PROBLEM

   The USGS will assist the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in its
   evaluation of the underlying hydrogeologic setting and the local
   ground-water system.

   OBJECTIVE

   Hydrogeologic data have been collected in several regional and local
   studies, but these data (and additional data from proposed
   investigations) need to be compiled and analyzed.

   APPROACH

   The USGS will compile the available hydrogeologic information and, if
   possible, transfer it to BNL in GIS format. An on-site USGS geologist
   will observe geologic samples obtained at test-boring sites, as needed.
   Geophysical logs will be collected by the USGS at present and new
   wells.

NY302 Determination of Ground-Water Discharge to the Peconic Estuary System,
Eastern Long Island, New York

   PROBLEM

   The Peconic Estuary system, an interconnected series of shallow
   embayments at the eastern end of Long Island, New York, has been
   repeatedly plagued with an unusual algal bloom since 1985. Adverse
   effects caused by the algal bloom, popularly dubbed the "Brown Tide",
   include the severe decline of locally and nationally significant
   shellfishes, and the decimation of Peconic Estuary eelgrass beds, which
   serve as critical habitat for commercially important finfish as well as
   shellfish.

   The Brown Tide Comprehensive Assessment and Management Program
   (BTCAMP), initiated by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services
   (SCDHS) in 1988, identified the importance of ground waters contributed
   to Peconic River and Flanders Bay, at the head of the estuary, to
   estuarine surface-water quality in the western, most stressed portion
   of the system. With the recent inclusion of the Peconic Estuary system
   in the National Estuary Program (NEP), one of the key activities of the
   Peconic Estuary Program, under the coordination of SCDHS, is to better
   define ground-water inflow to the entire Peconic Estuary system.

   OBJECTIVE

   The primary objective is to provide data regarding ground-water inputs
   to the Peconic Estuary system for use in estuarine surface-water
   modeling and management alternative evaluations. In addition, support
   will be provided for certain site-specific ground-water investigations
   along upland areas of smaller embayments within the estuary, to provide
   guidance for watershed-specific management efforts. Technical
   assistance will also be provided to the Peconic Estuary Program in
   interpreting ground-water information.

   APPROACH

   A previous effort undertaken by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to
   develop a regional numerical ground-water model of the Long Island
   mainland (Buxton and Smolensky, written communication, 1990) has
   yielded estimates of ground-water inflow to the western portion of the
   Peconic Estuary system. However, other ground-water inputs to the
   Peconic Estuary system are contributed by the North Fork, Shelter
   Island, and South Fork areas at the eastern end of Long Island. These
   contributions need to be comprehensively assessed.

   Results from several previous USGS ground-water studies developed for
   site-specific areas of the North Fork, Shelter Island, and South Fork
   (Soren, 1978; Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982; Prince, 1986; Simmons, 1986;
   Bohn-Buxton, Buxton and Eagen, in press; and McNew-Cartwright, written
   communication, 1993) will be used to evaluate ground-water inflow to
   the Peconic Estuary system. A water-budget analysis (Fetter, 1988, p.
   446), incorporating results from the site-specific ground-water
   studies, will be conducted to estimate ground-water inflow from the
   remaining areas of the North Fork, Shelter Island, and South Fork, and
   will be evaluated against the previous site-specific studies for
   verification of approach.

   Development of the water-budget analysis will entail evaluation of the
   flow boundaries of the ground-water systems of the North Fork, Shelter
   Island, and South Fork. The extent of the top boundary, the water
   table, will be determined from water-level measurements at observation
   wells. This information will also determine the location of one of the
   lateral boundaries, the ground-water divide, which runs roughly along
   the center of the North and South Forks, separating flow systems that
   discharge to the Peconic Estuary System, Long Island Sound, and the
   Atlantic Ocean. The position of the bottom boundary, the equilibrium
   interface between fresh ground waters, and saline ground waters lying
   below, will be determined from limited water-quality sampling and
   geophysical-data collection at observation wells. The estimation of
   ground-water recharge from rainfall, the determination of significant
   well-pumpage withdrawals, and an approximation of ground-water
   evapotranspiration constitute important additional boundaries. At the
   western edge of the study area, the regional numerical ground-water
   model of the Long Island mainland (Buxton and Smolensky, written
   communication, 1990) will provide estimates of ground-water inflow to
   the western portion of the Peconic Estuary system. Evaluating
   ground-water discharge along the remaining lateral boundary will
   provide estimates of ground-water inflow to the central and eastern
   portions of the Peconic Estuary system.

   Site-specific ground-water investigations will be conducted adjacent to
   smaller embayments within the Peconic Estuary system, to assess
   ground-water conditions along upland areas of surface-water bodies
   having chronic water-quality problems or which experience unusually
   recurrent Brown Tide blooms. These investigations will entail the
   development of more detailed, site-specific water-budgets, analytical
   solutions, or numerical ground-water modeling as necessary.

NY305 Long Island/New Jersey Water Quality Assessment (LINJ NAWQA)

   PROBLEM

   A comprehensive, consistent assessment of the Nation's surface- and
   ground-water quality currently is not available. Such an assessment is
   needed to provide a sound, scientific basis for prioritizing national
   water-quality issues and formulating effective national water policies.
   A detailed description of the physical, chemical, and biological
   characteristics of the Nation's streams and aquifers, and an
   understanding of the factors that affect the Nation's water quality,
   are two of the valuable products that would result from such an
   assessment. The LINJ study unit is one of 60 investigations nationwide
   that together will provide a large-scale framework of focused
   activities to develop a greater understanding about regional and
   national water-quality conditions that cannot be acquired from
   individual, small-scale programs and studies alone.

   OBJECTIVE

   To determine current water-quality conditions (status) in the LINJ
   study unit. Over time, to identify any trends in observed water-quality
   conditions. To determine, to the extent possible, the causes of the
   observed water-quality conditions and trends.

   APPROACH

   Following two years (FY 1994-95) of planning, analysis of existing
   data, reconnaissance sampling, and network design, the study will enter
   three years (FY 1996-98) of intensive data collection and data
   interpretation. Fixed-station, synoptic, and reach studies of surface
   water will be conducted, as will regional and land use surveys and
   flow-path studies of ground-water. Water-quality results, useful to
   policy makers and managers at the National, State, and local levels,
   will be published in numerous papers during the 3rd through 7th years
   (FY 1996-2000) of the study.

NY310 A Runoff Model for Ninemile Creek Watershed in the Town of Camillus,
Onondaga County

   PROBLEM

   The Town of Camillus, a suburb of Syracuse, N.Y., has undergone urban
   growth for two decades and is expecting continued growth. The town is
   concerned about the effect of increased urbanization on flooding and
   water quality along Ninemile Creek. Concern has arisen that
   stormwater-detention facilities in developing areas flooding because
   may increase peak runoff from the detention basin could coincide with
   the peak from unregulated upstream sources. This concern has prompted
   efforts toward development of effective watershed-management strategies
   within the town. A watershed-runoff model is needed to assess the
   hydrologic effects of development on stormflows of Ninemile Creek and
   determine the effectiveness of runoff-control structures.

   OBJECTIVE

   To develop a storm-runoff model to assess the effects new development
   on storm runoff in the Ninemile Creek watershed within the Town of
   Camillus, and assess the effects of stormwater basins in developing
   areas of the town.

   APPROACH

   To develop and calibrate the Hydrologic Simulation Program - Fortran
   (HSPF), precipitation-runoff model for a 38 square mile area between
   USGS gaging stations at Marietta (upstream) and Camillus (downstream).
   Two recording rain gages will be installed in the basin to provide
   local precipitation data for model calibration. GIS coverages will be
   obtained or developed to assemble pertinent geographical information
   for model development and input. Hydrologic and precipitation data will
   be compiled into the Watershed Data Management System (WDMS) that
   provides a interface with the HSPF model and analysis capabilities.

   The calibrated model will be run in two models: (1) current land-use
   conditions based on long-term stream flow and precipitation records
   and; A log-Pearson type-III frequency analysis will be computed from
   the long-term simulations; and (2) conditions after expected
   development. The precipitation-runoff model will also be used to assess
   the potential after increased flooding by delaying peak flow by
   detention storage in downstream developing areas.

NY311 Assessing Effect of Mine Flooding on the Regional Aquifer System in the
Genesee River Valley, Livingston County, New York

   PROBLEM

   The Retsof Salt Mine (1100 feet below land surface), was the largest
   salt mine in the western hemisphere, an area of almost 16 square miles.
   Two rooms in the mine collapsed in the spring of 1994, and the mine was
   completely flooded by the end of the year. Two large, circular collapse
   features several hundred feet apart developed at land surface. The
   northern feature is about 700 feet in diameter and contains a central
   area 200 feet wide that has subsided about 20 feet; the southern
   feature is about 1,000 feet in diameter, and the land surface within
   this area has subsided about 70 feet. The subsidence in the xxx zone
   has caused the partial collapse of a bridge and forced the closure of a
   section of State Route 20A.

   Fractures that developed during the formation of these collapse zones
   provided hydraulic connections between the mine and overlying aquifers,
   which were previously isolated from each other by confining units. The
   inflow of ground water to the mine, has developed several
   unconsolidated and bedrock aquifers and caused some wells to go dry.
   Other land subsidence 3 miles southwest of the collapse zone might be
   related to aquifer compaction due to dewatering.

   Water levels in the flood-plain sediments and upland bedrock units are
   showing only expected seasonal changes, but water levels in the glacial
   deltaic deposits and in the basal gravel, show significant declines
   that are a result of the dewatering.

   OBJECTIVE

   To identify the factors that affect the inflow of ground-water to the
   mine and the extent of dewatering in the aquifer system, and construct
   alternative models representing several sources of recharge to identify
   these factors and delineate areas in which additional information could
   reduce uncertainty in the interpretation of model results.

   APPROACH

   Ground-water flow models will be developed. Steady-state and transient
   simulations will be used to simulate precollapse conditions,
   equilibrium conditions the mine- flooding period, and the return to
   equilibrium conditions. The models will be based on the current
   understanding of the local ground-water system and will use uniform
   hydraulic properties to represent the units. Model results will be
   calibrated to the assumed steady-state distribution of hydraulic head
   before the mine collapse and to transient changes in (1) ground-water
   inflow to the mine, and (2) drawdowns induced near the collapse zone.
   Uncertainty regarding aquifer extent, boundary conditions, and
   hydraulic connections between aquifers will be addressed by alternative
   models.

   Results of test drilling by the mine company will improve the
   understanding of the geologic framework and refine the boundary
   conditions and hydraulic properties used in model simulations.
   Hydraulic head measurements and single-hole pumping tests will be
   conducted in multilevel piezometers installed at five locations, and
   ground-water samples will be obtained from each aquifer and analyzed
   for major inorganic constituents by the mine company and for stable
   isotopes by the USGS. Waters from the various aquifers will be compared
   to identify sources of recharge and to estimate the relative
   contributions of each aquifer to mine flooding.

NY313 Controls on Iron Solubility in Magothy Aquifer, Suffolk County, New York

   PROBLEM

   Iron-related encrustation of wells and the attendant declines in
   specific capacity of several Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA)
   supply wells have forced SCWA to adopt a costly well-reconditioning and
   replacement program. From 1989 through 1992, the USGS, in cooperation
   with SCWA, studied the effects and distribution of well-screen
   encrustation and aquifer biofouling in Suffolk County (D.A. Walter,
   U.S. Geological Survey written commun., 1995). A related study by the
   USGS, in cooperation with SCWA, is currently underway to determine the
   spatial distribution of iron-bearing minerals in the subsurface, and
   perform geochemical mass-balance modeling along a specified
   ground-water flow path to identify geochemical processes, but
   additional work is needed to identify chemical changes associated with
   mineralogy, organic carbon content, microbial communities, and redox
   conditions along hydrologic flow paths. A thorough understanding of
   these processes is necessary to determine optimal siting of wells and
   suitable pumping practices.

   OBJECTIVE

   The major objectives of this study are to define iron reactions along
   specified paths of ground-water flow, and in the vicinity of selected
   public-supply wells, through use of geochemical speciation and
   mass-balance models, including PHREEQC (Parkhurst and others, 1980;
   Parkhurst and others, U.S. Geological Survey written commun., 1995) and
   NETPATH (Plummer and others, 1994). Such modeling allows simulation of
   iron reactions likely to result from the mixing of waters of differing
   chemical composition and the presence of differing iron-source
   minerals. Another objective is to define the occurrence, abundance,
   spatial distribution, and relative reactivity of the major iron-bearing
   phases (through analysis of drill-core samples) and to relate the
   findings to ground-water chemistry in wells (including iron-fouled
   supply wells) along specified ground-water flow paths. Microbial
   communities and redox zones, and their effect on iron geochemistry,
   will be identified along the specified ground-water flowpaths.
   Microbial reactions of iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and
   iron-oxidizing bacteria, which typically vary along a flow path
   (Chapelle, 1993), can control the solubility of iron-bearing minerals.

   APPROACH

   Microbially-mediated reactions that occur in zones along ground-water
   flow paths (Champ and others, 1979; Plummer and others, 1994) are
   critical in many iron reactions, including precipitation and
   dissolution of iron-bearing phases. Several techniques have been used
   to delineate zones of microbial activity, including isolation of iron-
   and sulfate-reducing bacteria in sediment cores, study of patterns of
   electron-acceptor consumption and final-product accumulation (Chapelle
   and Lovely, 1990), and measurement of intermediate products of
   microbial metabolism, such as H2 (Lovely and Goodwin, 1988; Chapelle
   and others, 1995). To determine the iron-mineral contribution to
   dissolved iron in ground water will require identification and location
   of the major iron sources and the extent of weathering in both
   aquifers; characterization of microbial communities and related redox
   conditions along specified flow paths; and estimation of overall
   dissolution rates of iron-bearing minerals. Although the emphasis of
   this study is on iron reactions (pyrite and iron-oxide dissolution) in
   the Magothy aquifer, these reactions directly affect iron chemistry,
   including precipitation of ferric hydroxides, in areas of ground-water
   discharge.

NY315 Lake Erie Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA)

   PROBLEM

   Basic-fixed site data collection is required in the Cattaraugus Creek
   Watershed as part of the LERI-NAWQA study unit.

   OBJECTIVE

   To collect water-quality information in a routine manner that is
   consistent with national protocols and specific study-unit needs.

   APPROACH

   To conduct 18 site visits per year for collection and processing of
   required water-quality samples. Maintain NWIS data base for site data.

NY316 Streamflow Characteristics and Groundwater Characteristics of the Beaver
Kill Basin

   PROBLEM

   Salmonid production and fishing success in the Beaver Kill Basin has,
   according to some accounts, decreased over the past three decades.
   Decreasing habitat quality, quantity, and diversity caused by larger
   and more protracted extremes in low- and high-flow conditions have been
   suggested to be the basis for lessened salmonid production. Changes in
   stream hydrology have been hypothesized to result from recent land use
   (for example - construction of NY Route 17 in the lower basin)
   occurring throughout the Beaver Kill watershed.

   OBJECTIVE

   The objectives of this project are to document current hydrogeology of
   the basin, and potential changes in long-term trends in annual flows,
   base flow, high- and low-flow characteristics and channel
   characteristics in selected reaches of the Beaver Kill.

   APPROACH

   Existing hydrogeologic data will be documented and compiled and
   conceptual models of ground-water occurrence and movement in the study
   area will be developed. Similar characteristics of base and high flow
   and channel morphology (from historical USGS flow records) will be
   evaluated at selected Beaver Kill sites and at adjacent watersheds for
   a time-trends analyses. Precipitation data will be used to normalize
   daily and annual flow records. Comparisons of hydrologic trends before
   and after 1965 will be made to determine the significance of any
   changes, in the basin, that might be associated with NY Route 17.

NY320 Geohydrology and Simulation of Ground-Water Flow in an Unconsolidated
Aquifer Near Marathon, Southern Cortland County, New York

   PROBLEM

   The Village of Marathon needs hydrogeologic information avoid
   incomplete comparatives for protection and management of its municipal
   wellfield, which supplies ground water to about 1,000 people. The
   wellfield has been threatened in the past by contamination from a
   leaking petroleum-storage tank and by flooding. The municipal wells tap
   a relatively thin (typically less than 40 ft thick) and narrow (0.25
   mi. wide) unconfined sand and gravel aquifer that lies in the
   Tioughnioga River valley. Hunts Creek, an upland tributary, joins the
   Tioughnioga River valley at Marathon. Both streams intersect the
   aquifer, except possibly where the Tioughnioga River flows along the
   valley wall or where the channel is on bedrock or till; therefore
   induction of surface water to the aquifer by pumping wells may be
   possible. Hydraulic boundaries such as surface water and valley walls
   that are near the pumping wells may affect the ground-water flow regime
   in the vicinity of pumping wells. A numerical three-dimensional
   ground-water flow model, such as MODFLOW, is needed to simulate the
   ground-water system in the Marathon area. Simple analytical or
   semianalytical flow models, such as the Wellhead Protection Area model
   (WHPA) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which are based on
   simplified characterizations of the ground-water-flow system, could
   incorrectly identify areas that contribute water to a well while
   failing to identify areas that do contribute water.

   OBJECTIVE

   To define the stratigraphy and hydro boundaries the of the unconfined
   glacial aquifer of delineate areas that are likely to contribute
   recharge to the municipal wells, and provide a numerical ground-water
   flow model that can be used to manage in ground-water-resource
   management.

   APPROACH

   Compilation of Available Data:

   Well data from the Village of Marathon will be compiled and analyzed,
   and an inventory of private wells in Marathon will be made that
   provides data on aquifer extent and water levels. Drawdown data for
   municipal wells will be analyzed to estimate aquifer properties, which
   will be used to guide data input in construction of the numerical
   model. Water-quality data will be compiled.

   The following data will be collected for use in model calibration:

   Synoptic Water-Level Measurements

   A synoptic water-level measurement survey will be made during
   average-flow conditions to: (1) provide data for a potentiometric
   surface map, (2) plot the directions of ground-water flow, and (3)
   calibrate the numerical flow model.

   Streamflow Measurements:

   Stream-discharge measurements will be made at base flow during the same
   time as the water-level survey. Several streamflow measurements will be
   made in the Tioughnioga River and in Hunts Creek to obtain rates of
   gain or loss. These data will also be used to calibrate the numerical
   ground-water flow model.

   Leveling:

   Levels will be run to obtain elevations of measuring points of wells
   and stream channels in the study area.

   The computer program MODFLOW will be used to develop the numerical
   model. A geographical information system (ARC-INFO) will be used to
   facilitate model input and display of model results. The model will be
   calibrated from data collected during the synoptic ground-water level
   and streamflow measurements. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted
   to identify which factors most strongly affect water levels. The
   contributing areas (based on reasonable ranges of the parameters
   tested) for municipal wells will be delineated through a
   particle-tracking routine MODPATH (Pollock, 1989) developed for use
   with MODFLOW.

NY321 Distribution and Habitat of Endangered Mussel Populations in the Neversink
River Basin

   PROBLEM

   Populations of endangered and threatened macroinvertebrate species,
   particularly the dwarf wedge mussel (Alasmidonta heterodon) and the
   swollen wedge mussel (A. varicosa), are known to occupy portions of the
   lower Neversink River Basin (The Nature Conservancy 1995). However,
   little is known of the broader spatial distribution of these and other
   endangered and rare invertebrate species throughout the Neversink River
   Basin, or of the chemical, physical, and biological factors that affect
   these populations on a stream-reach scale (100s of meters) in natural
   systems (Strayer and Ralley 1993, Strayer 1993).

   An initial spatial survey of water quality, physical habitat,
   hydrology, and macroinvertebrate communities of the Neversink watershed
   (and a compilation of historical fish data) is proposed by the USGS
   herein to define spatial patterns within each resource and to advance
   our understanding of their unique interrelations within the basin. In
   conjunction with existing fishery information, this initial survey will
   allow for refinement of hypotheses regarding factors affecting
   endangered and threatened mussel populations and general ecosystem
   integrity, and, also provide data needed to plan efficient sampling
   strategies for more intensive studies within the basin. Ideally,
   information from this preliminary study and future intensive efforts
   will help the Nature Conservancy develop a strategy to protect, manage,
   and monitor rare mussel populations and related natural resources
   within the Neversink River Basin.

   OBJECTIVE

   This initial study has four major objectives.

   1) Document the distribution of threatened and endangered mussel,
   mussel species richness, and other macroinvertebrate species (both
   known and unknown) from 25 to 35 reaches across the Neversink River
   basin.

   2) Establish baseline information on the spatial variation in water
   quality and physical-habitat characteristics, macroinvertebrate
   communities, and fish populations during base flow conditions in the
   basin.

   3) Generate preliminary (working) hypotheses concerning potential
   environmental factors that are highly correlated to or may influence
   the distribution (and health) of rare mussel populations and the
   richness of mussel communities.

   4) Design sampling strategies for future surveys that will quantify the
   interrelations between the distribution, abundance, and health of rare
   mussel populations and the integrity of local macroinvertebrate
   communities (e.g., indicator species, community richness and density,
   and etc.) and other environmental factors (e.g., nutrient enrichment,
   substrate composition, calcium concentrations, specific land uses,
   sediment loads, distribution of host-fish species, and etc.) in the
   Neversink River basin.

   APPROACH

   1) The field survey will consist of a standardized search for rare
   mussel species at 30 "new" and 5 "old" sites, followed by a rapid
   assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, stream habitat
   (and the corresponding riparian zones), and water quality at a subset
   of these sites across the entire Basin. At the 5 old sites (previously
   identified with endangered mussel populations) in the lower basin,
   mussel data will be obtained from prior surveys. The 30 new sites will
   be selected to represent a wide range in instream habitat conditions
   and watershed land uses. The presence of rare and other mussel species
   (mussel species richness) at the new sites will be determined by our
   proposed efforts. From these 35 sites, 25 will be selected for further
   macroinvertebrate community sampling and habitat characterizations.

   2) Each study site will consist of reaches that are equal to 20 mean
   stream widths, but, that are not less than 150 m nor greater than 500 m
   long, and, should include 2 or more sequences of stream habitat types
   (riffles, runs, and pools) (Meador et al. 1993; Simonson et al. 1993;
   Simonson et al. 1994). All mussel surveys, macroinvertebrate samples,
   water samples, and physical habitat measures will be collected within
   each study reach. Fish-species lists for the basin will be generated
   either simply by noting resident species during site visits or by
   extracting information from existing historical survey databases.

   3) The distribution of endangered and threatened mussel populations and
   host fish species, the composition of macroinvertebrate communities,
   additional invertebrate species that are listed as federally threatened
   or endangered, and other environmental characteristics will be
   summarized in the final report.
   Graphical and multivariate data analysis techniques such as
   classification and ordination (e.g., correspondence analysis, principal
   components analysis, canonical correlation analysis), will be used to
   describe spatial patterns among sites in terms of 1) the composition of
   macroinvertebrate communities and distribution of various invertebrate
   species across the basin, 2) the presence or absence of all mussel
   species and of rare mussel populations, 3) the presence or absence of
   host fish species, 4) measured water-chemistry parameters, and 5)
   selected habitat characteristics.
   Spatial distributions, results of multivariate analyses, and simple and
   multiple (forward and backward) regression analyses will be used to 1)
   formulate working hypotheses concerning environmental factors affecting
   rare mussel populations at these sites and 2) devise subsequent
   intensive surveys to gather additional environmental information needed
   to accurately test the validity of these hypotheses in Neversink River
   basin. As many features and levels of reach characterizations as
   practical will be used during statistical analyses.

NY322 The Effects of the Clean Air Act on Water Quality of Medium-Scale Rivers
in the Northeastern United States.

   PROBLEM

   As deposition of nitrate and sulfate either stabilizes or declines
   during the 1990's (Likens and others, 1996), the effects on
   surface-water quality will likely be complex and difficult to quantify.
   For example, discharge-event chemistry data collected to date in the
   Northeast indicate that changes in nitrate concentrations occur rapidly
   near storm peaks and then return to base-flow concentrations over a
   drawn-out period (Murdoch and Stoddard, 1992). The research plan we
   propose must therefore include sufficient storm-event sampling to
   determine if storm-flow concentrations are changing over time, yet also
   allow for rigorous trend detection for average and base-flow
   conditions. Fixed interval sampling is very important for detecting
   trends in long-term records. When sampling at a fixed interval,
   however, more samples is not always better. Serial correlation can be a
   problem when sampling density becomes too great. Defining "too great"
   is a site-specific problem and may vary considerably from stream to
   stream. Biweekly sampling appears to be a good compromise between
   weekly and monthly timesteps, and will be used during this study for
   trends detection.

   Analysis of trends in peak-flow concentrations are critical to
   understanding the processes that control sulfate and nitrogen
   transport. However, defining these trends can be problematic because
   different streams and constituents within a stream can have different
   concentration-discharge relations during each storm-flow event. These
   relations vary with season, watershed characteristics, and antecedent
   conditions. Methods for determining peak-flow trends in constituent
   concentrations, therefore, are in need of further refinement.

   In this project, the proposed water-quality sampling regime at each
   station include both biweekly samples and multiple samples during each
   of ten stormflow or snowmelt events. The biweekly samples will provide
   good coverage for fixed-interval trend detection, and the event
   sampling will provide, at a minimum, additional information about
   concentration-discharge relations and processes affecting stream-water
   chemistry during stormflows. Integration and analysis of these two
   sampling regimes will allow a systematic review of the historical
   record at each station , and more robust determination of long-term
   trends in selected water quality constituents.

   OBJECTIVE

   The purpose of this project is to track the effects of sulfur and
   nitrogen emission reductions on surface-water quality of 2 small-scale
   (0.75 and 3.8 mi2) and 3 medium-scale (46-69 mi2) rivers in the
   Northeastern United States and two medium-scale rivers in the
   southeast. The project will link deposition-chemistry data (NTN sites)
   with stream chemistry information (HBN and BDP sites) to develop a
   better understanding of chemical changes brought about by the CAA than
   would be possible using data from either network by themselves. Current
   and historical data from the proposed stations will be used to
   investigate the following 3 hypotheses:

   (1) A combination of biweekly and event sampling of stream chemistry
   and weekly sampling of deposition chemistry during the next three years
   will provide sufficient information on the effects of seasonal and
   climatic variability on concentration-discharge relationships to: (a)
   enable improved analysis of the historical records and (b) better
   detect trends (if they exist) in stream water sulfate, nitrate, and
   calcium concentrations resulting from the CAA;
   (2) The first evidence of trends in streamwater sulfate and nitrate
   resulting from decreased emissions will appear in the highest flow
   classes and in the areas of highest deposition. The magnitude of
   changes in the concentration-discharge relation thus will decrease
   along a gradient of improving air quality from southwest to northeast;
   (3) The scale of the HBN station on the Neversink River is sufficiently
   small to detect changes in surface-water quality resulting from
   emission reductions, and exhibit trend characteristics that are
   consistent with trends observed at smaller research watersheds (Biscuit
   Brook and Winnisook Creek) upstream.
   (4) HBN long-term data provides information on trends in soil calcium
   availability.

   The project should thus illustrate the value of the national HBN
   network for tracking long-term trends in the surface waters of
   small-to-medium scale river basins, and provide our first indications
   of the effect of the Clean Air Act on water quality in the Northeast.
   Results from this project will also provide guidance on monitoring
   strategies for a redesigned National Hydrologic Benchmark Network,
   including the cost-effectiveness of using automated samplers, District
   laboratory services, and research personnel.

   APPROACH

   Biweekly and episodic sampling of water quality will be done at the 5
   discharge-gaging stations. Automated water samplers will collect
   samples over a range of flow conditions during 10 storm or snowmelt
   events (episodes) of each year. The proposed stations are:

   (1) Young Woman's Creek (01545600) near Renovo, PA (46.2mi2)
   (2) Neversink River (01435000) near Claryville, NY (65 mi2)
   (3) Biscuit Brook (01434025) near Frost Valley, NY (3.8 mi2)
   (4) Winnisook Creek (01434021) (formally the W. Br. Neversink River at
   Winnisook Lake near Frost Valley)(0.75 mi2)
   (5) Wild River (01054200) near Gilead, ME (69.5 mi2)
   (6) Cataloochie Creek (03460000), Western North Carolina (127 km2)
   (7) Little River (03497000), Eastern Tennessee (275 km2)
   Brief descriptions of these stations and their proximity to NTN
   stations are presented in Appendix 1. The approach to field sampling,
   laboratory analysis, quality assurance, and data analysis will be
   described separately in the following sections. In addition, data from
   the nearest NTN station, collected independently of this study, will be
   used to estimate deposition inputs to each watershed.

   Field monitoring and sampling approach:

   Bi-weekly grab samples will be collected manually near the automated
   sampler intake during routine site visits. Automated samplers at each
   station will be used to collect samples during 8-10 storm events per
   year. The automated samplers will be activated by a datalogger in each
   stream-flow station. Four samples representing the initial flow rise,
   mid-rise, peak, and recession condition respectively will be selected
   from each set of storm samples for laboratory analysis. Continuous
   specific-conductance data collected at each site, and selected lab
   analyses of automated samples will be used to detect chemical changes
   that may have occurred independent of the hydrograph. If such chemical
   changes are observed, additional samples may be processed for
   laboratory analysis. Sampling will begin in March of 1997 and continue
   through the spring melt period of 1999. The remainder of FY1999 will be
   used for data analysis and interpretation.

   In addition, depth- and width- integrated samples will be collected
   quarterly at each of the original HBN stations (Young Woman's Creek,
   Wild River, and Biscuit Brook) using standard depth- and
   width-integrated methods. Considering the non-developed nature of the
   watersheds and the study focus on stream acidity, the use of elaborate
   "clean" methods needed for collection and processing of trace-metal
   samples is unwarranted. This change in protocol will allow sampling to
   be less time consuming and will require only one field person per
   sampling visit. All depth- and width-integrated samples will be split
   and filtered at the New York District Research Laboratory (NYRL) in
   Troy, NY, and sent for laboratory analysis to both the USGS National
   Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) in Arvada, Co. and the NYRL. All other
   samples will be filtered by the same protocol but analyzed only at the
   NYRL. Estimated annual sample load for the NWQL is 12 samples, and for
   the NYRL is 240 samples.

   Automated samplers at the Neversink River, Biscuit Brook, and Young
   Woman's Creek stations will be serviced by the Watershed Research Group
   in the New York District. Samples from the Wild River will be collected
   by field personnel from the Maine District office. Samples chosen for
   analysis from the Maine station will be sent in coolers by overnight
   mail to the NYRL for processing and analysis.

   Longitudinal profiles:

   At least one set of samples and discharge measurements will be
   collected during low-flow conditions at sites representing subbasins of
   each study watershed to determine the within-watershed variability of
   water quality and sources of flow. These synoptic surveys will include
   8 to 10 sites within each watershed. Samples will be filtered and
   processed using the same protocols for automated sampling (see below).

   In-situ monitoring:

   In addition to the collection of water quality samples, stream stage,
   specific conductance, water temperature, and precipitation volume will
   be monitored continuously at each station. Stream stage will be
   monitored by the local USGS basic data personnel. Precipitation volume
   will be monitored continuously at a site near each station by either
   project or basic data personnel depending on the station. Specific
   conductance data will be used to fine-tune the timing of auto-sampler
   sample collection relative to discharge, and for selection of a subset
   of samples for laboratory analysis.

   Laboratory analysis:

   All samples will be processed using standard methods of the New York
   District research laboratory in Troy, New York (Lawrence and others,
   1995). Samples will be analyzed for the following constituents:
   Major cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K)
   Major anions (SO4, NO3, Cl)
   pH, Acid Neutralizing Capacity
   Silica
   Dissolved organic carbon
   Total dissolved aluminum, total monomeric aluminum*
   Total dissolved nitrogen, organic nitrogen, ammonium**
   *For high acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) samples, aluminum analysis
   will not be done.
   ** Total dissolved nitrogen, organic nitrogen, and ammonium will be not
   be measured in every sample-- instead, it will be measured in
   sufficient selected samples to determine a general
   concentration-discharge relation for each site.

   Analysis for total dissolved N will be done at the Forest Analysis
   Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire under the direction of
   Dr. Bill McDowell during the initial phases of the project, and using
   similar methods protocols at the NYRL thereafter. The lab uses a
   high-temperature catalytic oxidation procedure that couples an N
   analyzer with a TOC analyzer. N is measured by chemoluminescence.
   Detection will be about 10 ug/L (Merriam and others, 1996). DON will be
   determined by difference.

   Samples will be chilled and shipped or transported to the NYRL, where
   they will be filtered upon receipt using 0.4 micron Nucleopore filters
   for major ions and silica, and glass-fiber filters for dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC).

   Samples to be sent to the NWQL will be processed at the NYRL prior to
   shipment by overnight mail, and will be analyzed for the following
   constituents:
   Major cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K)
   Major anions (SO4, NO3, Cl)
   pH
   Silica
   Total dissolved nitrogen, organic nitrogen
   Ammonium, Nitrite
   Total phosphorous, Ortho-phosphate
   These analyses will be completed according to the following NWQL
   schedules:
   Schedule 667 (Silica)
   Schedule 286 (Major inorganic ions, pH)
   Additional samples may be sent to the NWQL if additional funds become
   available in the future.

   Quality assurance:

   The NYRL will continue to adhere to it's approved quality-assurance and
   control protocols as outlined in Lawrence and others, 1996 . Field
   quality assurance testing will occur primarily during the quarterly
   sampling visits. Triplicate samples will be collected twice per year at
   each site during the quarterly sampling visits(for a total of 10
   triplicates per year) as part of the field quality assurance plan.
   Field blanks (de-ionized water that are taken into the field and
   transferred there into a standard sample-collection vessel) will be
   collected during each of the quarterly sampling visits at each station
   (for a total of 12 field blanks per year). Bottle blanks are also run
   routinely as part of the QA protocol in the NYRL.

   Field teams are trained in proper procedures for servicing automated
   samplers and labeling the samples collected. Samples will be collected
   soon after each event at all sites except Young Woman's Creek, where
   samples will be collected at least monthly. A refrigerated automated
   sampler has been installed at Young Woman's Creek to preserve samples.
   Triplicate samples will be drawn into the automated sampler at each
   site at least twice during each year to determine the variability in
   quality of samples collected automatically (for a total of 10
   additional triplicate samples). Conductance, water temperature, and air
   temperature sensors will be checked monthly for quality control and
   calibration. Control charts for each sensor will be developed to track
   drift in calibration, and control limits of 10 percent deviation from
   check solutions and field temperature measurements will be used as a
   criteria to flag suspect data.

   Holding time experiments are conducted periodically by the NYRL to
   determine the stability of samples held in automated samplers for more
   than a few days. The autosampler at Young Woman's Creek, where delays
   in sample retrieval could be the longest, will be refrigerated to
   reduce the chance of sample degradation. Samples from the other
   stations will be retrieved shortly after each event. Data on stream
   nitrate that are shown to be influenced by sample holding times will
   not be used in interpretation nor reported in the public-access
   database.

   Data management:

   Field data will be hand-entered into a SAS database that has been
   designed by the Watersheds Research Group specifically for watershed
   data applications. Laboratory data is electronically transferred from
   the instrument computers to the database after verification by
   laboratory analysts. Programs have been written by the New York
   District so that, once verified, all data from this database can be
   batch loaded into NWIS.

   Data analysis:

   Data collected at each stream-flow station and the nearest NTN
   deposition monitoring stations will be used to compute chemical
   input-output budgets and flow-adjusted average-ion concentrations. NTN
   deposition quality data from a station within the watershed is only
   available for Biscuit Brook and the Neversink River. In the case of the
   other stations, three NTN or University deposition stations can be used
   to define an area of deposition that includes the study watershed.
   Deposition concentrations for the Young Woman's Creek and Wild River
   watersheds will be estimated by interpolation from the three nearest
   deposition stations, then combined with precipitation volume data
   collected within the study watershed to compute chemical loads. While
   this method is not ideal for calculating loads to each study unit, it
   will provide the most accurate estimates short of establishing new NTN
   stations at Wild River and Young Woman's Creek.

   Trend analysis will be performed on volume, chemical loads, and
   chemical concentrations of both deposition and stream water. Trend
   analysis and mean concentration estimates will be computed for the
   quarterly, fixed-interval, and episodic sampling modes, and the results
   compared to determine the sampling frequency required for trend
   detection over a short period (2 years). Data analysis plans will be
   described separately for each of the three hypotheses.

   HYPOTHESIS 1:

   A combination of biweekly and event sampling of stream chemistry and
   weekly deposition chemistry during the next three years will provide
   sufficient information on the effect of seasonal and climatic
   variability on concentration-discharge relationships to: (a) enable
   improved analysis of the historical records and (b) better detect
   trends (if they exist) in stream water sulfate, nitrate, and calcium
   concentrations resulting from the CAA:

   APPROACH

   The combined fixed interval (bi-weekly) and event (8-10 events, 1-3
   samples per event) sampling during a two year period (March, 1997
   through April, 1999) will provide a data base for modeling controls on
   sulfate concentration at the present time at the 4 sites. ESTREND will
   be used to analyze the data for trends. The model will incorporate
   instantaneous discharge and/or average discharge during an optimized
   antecedent period, as well as seasonality. We assume the 1997-1999
   period in itself is too short a period in which to identify a trend (If
   in fact there is a trend it will show up in the model residuals and we
   can easily modify our analysis plan.). We will apply our model to the
   entire period of record (mid-1960's to present) at each site and
   analyze the model residuals for all observations prior to 1997. If the
   model residuals exhibit a trend with time, this indicates the
   conditions of the model have changed, possibly as a result of changes
   in sulfate emissions. In effect, the model will remove the effect of
   discharge, antecedent moisture conditions, and seasonality on sulfate
   concentration, thus allowing the residual trends to represent changes
   in sulfate deposition or other factors.

   Trends in the residuals cannot be unambiguously linked to observed
   changes in deposition. For example, Huntington et al. (1994)
   constructed a similar concentration model from 7 years of combined
   fixed interval and event sampling at Panola, Georgia, and found that
   the model did in fact change over this time period. They attributed the
   shift in trend, however, not to a change in sulfate deposition but
   rather to a major shift in sulfate/soil equilibria when a cycle of
   excessively wet years followed a period of drier than average years.
   The HBN database provides a sufficiently long period of record to allow
   for such short-term climatic variations to be recognizable as
   oscillations in the trend in residuals, superimposed on the monotonic
   trend expected from depositional changes. Also, soil chemical changes
   are less likely in the northeastern U.S. where evapotranspiration is
   lower and soil moisture content remains higher relative to Georgia.

   We anticipate that the effects of change in sulfate deposition may be
   manifest only in certain flow classes. To test this we will stratify
   the historic data at each site into 4 or 5 flow classes based on flow
   duration curves and evaluate the trend in model residuals independently
   for each class. Here we anticipate some problems with data density,
   since the HBN historic record contains only 2 to 6 samples per year and
   multi-year gaps in the record for a given flow class are common.
   Unfortunately, the highest flow class, in which we have the most
   interest, may have the poorest coverage. We therefore may need to
   broaden our flow class at the upper end.

   HYPOTHESIS 2:

   The first evidence of trends in streamwater sulfate and nitrate
   resulting from decreased emissions will appear in the highest flow
   classes and in the areas of highest deposition. The magnitude of
   changes in the concentration-discharge relation thus will decrease
   along a gradient of improving air quality from southwest to northeast:

   APPROACH

   The greatest changes in streamwater sulfate and nitrate concentrations
   are expected where deposition has historically been highest, i.e. at
   the Pennsylvania and New York sites. If trends are detected from the
   above analysis, we will assess the magnitude of the change in
   concentration /discharge relation at each site as a function of
   position along the deposition gradient. If the magnitudes of trend
   changes along the gradient are consistent with hypothesis 2, this will
   support the analysis of hypothesis 1 by suggesting that changes in
   deposition, and not some other external factor, are the cause of
   streamwater sulfate and nitrate trends.

   The arrangement of sites along a depositional gradient also allows a
   comparison of sulfate and nitrate behavior during the same storms as
   they track from west to east. Although data from all storms will be
   incorporated in the concentration-discharge modeling, detailed analysis
   during individual storms of sulfate and nitrate behavior - the extent
   of dilution at high flow, rising limb vs. falling limb concentrations,
   cross-site comparisons, etc. - will add insight into how these streams
   are responding to decreased sulfate and nitrate deposition.

   HYPOTHESIS 3:

   The scale of the HBN station on the Neversink River is sufficiently
   small to detect changes in surface-water quality resulting from
   emission reductions, and exhibit trend characteristics that are
   consistent with trends observed at the smaller research watershed
   (Biscuit Brook) upstream.

   HYPOTHESIS 4:

   Long-term records of stream chemistry may reveal information on past
   trends in soil calcium availability, but to evaluate the current status
   and future trends in calcium availability, watershed calcium budgets
   will need to be developed.

   APPROACH

   Results of the trend analysis described above will answer the first
   part of this hypothesis if significant trends are detected at the 3
   large-watershed stations. A comparison of trends at the Neversink and
   Biscuit Brook stations can be used to determine if basin scale is an
   issue in trend detection if no trends are observed at the Neversink
   station. If trends are detected at Biscuit Brook, but not at the
   Neversink station, previous modeling of downstream changes in water
   quality and hydrology of the Neversink River (Wolock and others, in
   press) will be used to contrast the trend characteristics of the two
   stations and determine the probable causes of those differences. Data
   on bi-weekly water quality collected by the New York City Dept. of
   Environmental Protection at stations representing intermediate- and
   smaller-scale watersheds in the Neversink River basin will then also be
   used to determine the scale at which trends observed in small
   watersheds become non-detectable.

   To develop budgets, small watersheds will be gaged within the three
   northeastern sites. Periodic sampling, plus event sampling, will be
   used to estimate watershed outputs. NTN data will be used to estimate
   atmospheric impacts of calcium.

   Soil sampling and analysis will be used to determine the current size
   of calcium pools in the soil. Isotopes of Sr will also be used as an
   analog of calcium to estimate inputs from calcium weathering. Calcium
   output information from the small watersheds will be compared to the
   data for the overall watersheds to determine the representativeness of
   the small watersheds.

NY323 Survey of Lake Ontario Sediments off Rochester, New York, to Determine the
extent of Jettisoned Wartime Material and its Contamination Potential

   PROBLEM

   Equipment and ordnance of the World War II and Korean War era that were
   dumped in Lake Ontario offshore from Rochester have been brought to the
   surface by fish-survey and trawling nets during the past decade. Of
   greatest concern are leaking mercury switches, which have a
   contamination potential if they are found in great number and are
   broken open. The amount and location of such material off the Rochester
   shore, and its contamination potential, need to be assessed.

   OBJECTIVE

   To determine the extent of the disposal area(s). If material is found
   that can be identified as a potential contaminant source, lake-bottom
   sediment samples will be collected and analyzed for a suite of metals
   to identify the type and degree of contamination.

   SCOPE

   The lake-bottom survey will encompass an area of 2 square miles that is
   about 4 miles north of the mouth of the Genesee River and at a depth of
   75 to 125 feet.

   APPROACH

   A research "sled" with -A boat at least 30 feet long will serve as the
   research platform and will tow both side-scan sonar and magnetometer
   equipment to detect material. GPS will be used to locate all transects
   and course direction, and speed will be recorded to allow accurate
   positioning of surveys and any found material. A
   remote-operated-vehicle (ROV) with television camera will also be used
   to view the lake floor for any military debris. Initial transects will
   be high in the water column so that a large area can be surveyed to
   determine whether large "piles" of material are present. Dependent on
   the results of these traverses the "sled" will be lowered to collect
   higher resolution side-scan images of suspect lake-bottom areas if
   visibility is adequate. If, sediment obscures the bottom, a
   magnetometer survey will try to detect areas of material
   concentrations.

   If material is found and can be identified as a possible contaminant
   source, divers will collect sediment samples. Video imaging of the
   sample collection is desirable but will depend on lake-bottom
   conditions. Samples will be transferred to bottles and shipped to the
   USGS National Water Quality Laboratory for heavy metals analysis. An
   administrative report documenting the areas surveyed, transect
   positions, results of the side-scan, magnetometer surveys, and results
   of the bottom-sediment sampling will be prepared by the contractor and
   USGS-WRD personnel for the New York State Department of Environmental
   Conservation (Great Lakes Program Office) and the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency - Region 2 office in New York City.

NY324 Avoidance Behavior of Juvenile Brown Trout (Salmo Trutta) to Copper
Sulfate in Natural Waters

   PROBLEM

   The City of New York, Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP)
   periodically treats aqueduct waters with copper sulfate to reduce
   density of phytoplankton populations. During these treatments, total
   and dissolved copper can reach concentrations that may, based on
   literature values, be toxic to certain salmonid species and potentially
   toxic to juvenile and adult brown trout (Salmo Trutta) within affected
   reservoirs.

   The ability of brown trout to avoid acutely and chronically toxic
   concentrations of copper has not been documented under laboratory or
   natural (field) conditions, therefore, it is unclear whether they might
   avoid toxic concentrations of copper sulfate within natural systems. If
   hatchery brown trout can be shown to actively avoid waters treated with
   copper sulfate during avoidance testing, then stocked brown trout may
   also be able to avoid subacute and acute copper concentrations within
   treated reservoir waters. An avoidance response would lessen any
   potential for mortality in reservoir populations of brown trout and for
   any impacts on their populations (within these reservoirs).

   The United States Geological Survey (USGS) proposes to document the
   effect of commonly used dilutions of copper sulfate on avoidance
   behavior of juvenile brown trout using dilution waters directly from
   aqueducts at either the Kensico or West Branch reservoirs.

   OBJECTIVE

   This study has 3 major objectives. The first objective is to assess the
   ability of local young of the year brown trout to actively avoid toxic
   (acute and subacute) concentrations of copper sulfate under ambient
   conditions in waters taken directly from a local reservoir.

   The second objective is to determine the lowest observed effect (i.e.,
   avoidance) concentration (LOEC) and the highest no observed effect
   (i.e., no avoidance) concentration (NOEC). These values are averaged to
   estimate the no effect copper concentration (threshold) for brown
   trout.

   The third objective is to determine the short-term avoidance response
   of brown trout to lethal and sublethal copper-sulfate concentrations
   that are projected to occur in NYCDEP reservoirs (copper concentrations
   that exceed NOEC and acutely toxic thresholds).

   A related goal of the project is to generate preliminary acute toxicity
   information to (1) quantify the sensitivity of the local test
   population (Catskill Hatchery brown trout) to copper and (2) provide
   preliminary data to assess whether site-specific water quality criteria
   for copper are feasible and to compare these to U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency water quality criteria for copper.

   APPROACH

   Avoidance testing will be conducted on site at one of the 2 reservoirs,
   depending upon the usual point of copper application and the
   availability of testing space. Acute (reference) toxicity tests will be
   conducted at the same time as the avoidance tests to quantify the
   sensitivity of the source-fish population to copper sulfate. Applicable
   information for (1) the source of test organisms, (2) avoidance-testing
   procedures, (3) acute toxicity testing procedures, (4) water quality
   measures, and (5) data analyses are summarized below.

   Juvenile, young-of-the-year brown trout will be obtained from the New
   York State Department of Environmental Conservation Catskill Hatchery.
   The smallest brown trout available will be obtained and moved to
   holding cages near the testing facility and acclimated for about 1 week
   prior to avoidance and acute-toxicity testing. Reference tests will be
   conducted to (1) quantify the sensitivity of tested fish to copper
   sulfate and (2) ensure that the tested fish population is not
   abnormally sensitive or tolerant to copper sulfate.

   Except for differences necessitated by natural conditions (ambient
   water temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels) avoidance tests will be
   conducted in a dual-channel fluviarium using procedures slightly
   modified from those described in Ramey (1986) and EA (1996). Dilution
   water will be obtained directly from pumping facilities at the
   reservoir aqueducts and passed directly to test chambers. Total copper
   target concentrations of 0.0, 0.003, 0.015, 0.046, 0.061, 0.076, and
   0.091 mg/L will be created from a single primary (saturated copper
   sulfate solution using NYCDEP copper sulfate crystals) and
   daily-secondary (dilutions) copper stocks, and used in avoidance tests.
   Alternative dilutions will be tested if those above do not produced
   avoidance responses. Higher copper concentrations will be used in
   proposed acute reference tests to ensure a full range in mortality
   responses. Waste water generated by the experiments will be contained
   and disposed of appropriately.

   Acute (reference) static-renewal toxicity tests (96 hours) will be
   conducted with a subsample of the test group to affirm that the
   sensitivity of the source-fish population to copper is not unusual.
   Acute test methods will follow those described in USEPA (1993).
   Static-test containers will be bathed in reservoir waters to maintain
   ambient conditions. Mortality results from these tests will be compared
   to that available in the literature for the genera to assess the
   sensitivity of the tested population.

   Daily measures of pH, dissolved oxygen, conductance, and temperature
   will be obtained from each acute test dilution; these same parameters
   will be measured from avoidance-test waters at the start of each
   copper-sulfate dilution and replicate test. Water samples will be
   collected from each acute test dilution at the start and end of the
   4-day test period and from each avoidance test before and after each
   dilution replicate exposure. Infrequent water samples will be collected
   and analyzed for concentrations of total recoverable copper (TRC),
   dissolved copper, total organic carbon (TOC), calcium, and magnesium
   and for water hardness using standard methods at the USGS Central
   Laboratory in Denver, CO, (Fishman and Friedman 1989). The majority of
   dissolved copper analyses from individual avoidance dilutions will be
   run at the NYCDEP Kensico laboratory.

   The relations between acute mortality, copper sulfate avoidance
   concentrations, and observed fish behavior will be evaluated to assess
   the probability that brown trout can avoid selected concentrations of
   copper sulfate that are used to treat NYCDEP reservoir waters. Analyses
   will include:

   1) Nominal and measured copper sulfate concentrations and other
   constituents will be summarized for each acute- and avoidance-test
   dilution to determine actual copper concentrations for each test and to
   ensure other water quality conditions were not a source of stress.

   2) Mortality response of brown trout to copper sulfate in the reference
   tests will be compared to that commonly reported for the species or
   genera to evaluate their relative sensitivity levels.

   3) The percent gross and net response of test organisms will be
   determined from the percent distribution of test organisms in control
   and various copper dilutions; these data will be evaluated to determine
   whether brown trout, in fact, actively avoid sublethal copper
   concentrations and to predict the fraction of the population that might
   actively avoid various concentrations of copper.

   4) The LOEC and NOEC values will be determined from the percent average
   distributions to estimate the threshold no effect (avoidance)
   concentration of copper for juvenile brown trout.

   5) Acute test (mortality) data will be compared to measured copper
   concentrations, water quality data from dilution waters, related data
   from the literature, and to national and state copper criteria to
   determine if site-specific modification of the permitted copper
   concentration (criteria) is feasible. Additional toxicity tests would

NY325 Water-quality Reconnaissance of Hemlock Lake and Canadice Lake Watersheds
- With Emphasis on Pesticide Presence and Distribution

   PROBLEM

   Information on pesticide concentrations in Canadice and Hemlock Lake
   watersheds has been limited by the relatively high detection limits and
   small number of compounds that are reported by private contract
   laboratories. A systematic approach to evaluating the temporal and
   spatial distribution of pesticide occurrence in the watersheds is
   needed. The watersheds serve as a water supply for the city of
   Rochester, New York.

   OBJECTIVE

   The objective of this proposal is to gather and supply information that
   can be integrated into an assessment of pesticide presence and
   distribution in Hemlock Lake and Canadice Lake watersheds. The
   assessment includes (1) the relative contributions of pesticides from
   different land-use areas within the watersheds, (2) an understanding of
   the seasonal variability of pesticide input to the lakes, and (3)
   relative importance of baseflow and storm runoff in the pesticide input
   to the lake.

   APPROACH

   In the Hemlock Lake and Canadice Lake watershed, we propose to sample
   water and bottom sediments in Lakes and streams as a reconnaissance
   study for selected pesticides. Seasonal and hydrologic factors affect
   pesticide occurrence; accordingly, water sample collection is proposed
   for (1) two dates during runoff recession (after peak flow that results
   from rainfall), and (2) two dates during dry-weather base flow (when
   ground water contributes most of the streamflow). The first set of
   runoff and baseflow samples will be in June, immediately after
   agricultural-herbicide applications; the second set of samples will be
   in October, after the herbicides have dissipated. The water samples
   will be collected at 9 sites. One year of data collection is proposed,
   which will allow changes in the sampling program to be based upon
   initial results.

NY326 Water Resources Management in the Finger Lakes - Lake Ontario Basin of New
York -- Data Base Development: Phase I Data Base Assessment

   SUMMARY

   The Finger Lakes-Lake Ontario Basin of New York encompasses more than
   8,000 square miles contains all or part of 24 counties, and lies within
   three physiographic provinces. Watershed management within the basin
   requires coordinated efforts of participants at the local, county,
   state, and federal levels. The objective of this study is to establish
   a framework of data that can be used to quantify and assess changes in
   surface-water and ground-water quality and quantity in relation to land
   use, population growth, urbanization, and changes in water regulation
   and use. The first phase of the project will be an evaluation of
   existing data within participating counties. PROBLEM

   Watershed management within the Finger Lake-Lake Ontario Basin requires
   coordination among local, county, state, and federal agencies to
   properly manage and protect the water resources. Water-resource issues
   include:

   Flow management along the Barge Canal system (Clyde, Seneca, Oneida,
   and Oswego Rivers), and water-level management of the Finger Lakes.
   Present demand results in seasonal and short-term water-level
   fluctuations (generally flooding) that affect water supply, recreation,
   power generation, and wildlife in the lakes and along the canal.

   Agricultural runoff (pesticides, nutrients, and soil erosion). These
   affect ground water, streams that drain the agricultural areas, and
   lakes and wetlands that receive the streamflow.

   Industrial and municipal wastewater that is discharged to streams,
   rivers and lakes of the basin.

   Urbanization. This has affected surface- and ground-water resources.
   Exotic flora and fauna. Several species of plants and mollusks have
   disturbed the ecology and water use within the watershed. A centrally
   coordinated management system will need at???a on the basin's resources
   and the factors that affect streamflow, ground water, lake levels, and
   water quality. At present, information related to these management
   issues is inconsistent or lacking.

   OBJECTIVE

   This is phase I of a proposed, long-term study to establish a framework
   of data that can be used to quantify and assess changes in
   surface-water and ground-water quality and quantity in relation to land
   use, population growth, urbanization, and changes in water-resource
   regulation and use. The objective of this phase is to evaluate data
   within the participating counties, New York State, and Federal
   agencies, including USGS. This evaluation will aid in the development
   of a computer-based resource-information system (to be called The
   Finger Lake - Lake Ontario Basin Database), which ca
