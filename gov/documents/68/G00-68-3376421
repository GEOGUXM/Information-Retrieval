               About the GLAS Software Development Team (SDT)

   The SDT defines the methods and schedules for developing and
   implementing the Ground Data System (GDS) software for the Geoscience
   Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). GLAS, an integral part of the EOS
   program, is a satellite laser altimeter designed to measure ice-sheet
   topography and associated temporal changes, as well as cloud and
   atmospheric properties. Operation of GLAS over land and water will
   provide along-track topography to fulfill the GLAS Science Objectives.

   The major effort of the SDT is the development of the software to
   produce GLAS Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 standard products. These
   standard products will be made available to the EOSDIS users through
   the EOSDIS. The GLAS Science Team Leader is responsible for the
   development of standard data products software, and the Software
   Development Team will work under the Team Leader to support this
   effort.

   The GLAS GDS will accept as input: the GLAS telemetry data stream from
   the spacecraft; the orbital location parameters; and ancillary data.
   The output of the system consists primarily of the science data
   products, at appropriate data rates and with sufficient precision, to
   satisfy the requirements of the Science Team and EOSDIS users. The
   system provides tools to assess the quality of the data products. The
   data quality and other metadata are also provided to the EOSDIS. The
   Science Team, rather than the SDT, will develop the software to produce
   orbit, attitude, and some of the Level 3 and Level 4 data products.

   In addition to the software for standard data product production, the
   GLAS GDS will provide software to support assessment of the
   instrument's health for the Instrument Operation Terminal (IOT). The
   Instrument Team Leader is responsible for the development of the IOT
   software. The SDT will support this development effort under the
   direction of the Instrument Team Leader. This software will interface
   with the EOSDIS to provide instrument control and monitoring
   capabilities.
