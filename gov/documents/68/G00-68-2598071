   Information For Citizens

   The Office of Financial Management serves the public as a resource for
   state financial information and population and economic data. Whether
   you're in search of Washington State budget trends or the population of
   your city or county, our web site may be able to help.

   How Your State Services Are Funded
   "How Your State Services Are Funded," provides one view of Washington
   state finances. The chart was made available last fall to the public in
   the voter pamphlet distributed by the Secretary of State.

   Most of OFM's print publications are accessible online, so finding what
   you're looking for can be a simple click away. View the Governor's 2001
   Budget Highlights or check out some of Washington's environmental
   trends in the Environmental Chartbook.

   From current budget drivers to the latest census information, citizens
   from all parts of Washington can rely on the Office of Financial
   Management for up-to-date information about the state of Washington and
   its people.
