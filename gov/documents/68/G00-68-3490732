   High-tech Industry to Bush Economic Team: Stay the Course on Tax Cuts,
                             Economic Security!

   Raleigh, NC - Employees and employers in North Carolina's Research
   Triangle today urged Commerce Secretary Don Evans and other key members
   of President Bush's Economic Team to "stay the course" in its continued
   fight for tax cuts and economic security.

   "America's working families and job-creators are speaking up loudly and
   clearly: 'preserve our tax cuts, and help us grow this economy and
   create jobs with a stimulus package,'" Evans said.

   The high-tech industry's views on economic security were voiced at an
   "America Works" town hall meeting today in Raleigh, N.C., with Evans,
   U.S. Small Business Administrator Hector Barreto, Chairman of the
   President's Council of Economic Advisors Glenn Hubbard, and Chairman of
   the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Floyd
   Kvamme. The "America Works" session was the third in a series of
   economic roundtable discussions hosted by the Bush Economic Team around
   the country.

   "The President has been leading on economic security since Day One.
   Last spring, he won strong bipartisan support in Congress for tax cuts.
   After September 11th, he proposed a plan to help workers who have lost
   their jobs and to stimulate growth in the economy so they can replace
   unemployment checks with paychecks," Evans said. A bipartisan majority
   in the House of Representatives passed the economic security plan
   before the winter holidays, but the Senate has not acted.

   In a speech today at Washington's National Press Club, U.S. Sen. Edward
   Kennedy proposed putting a stop to the tax cuts enacted last spring.
   Kennedy's speech came on the heels of a controversial speech last week
   by Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who was widely criticized by
   economists and lawmakers from both major political parties for
   suggesting the tax cuts passed last spring have worsened the current
   economic slowdown.

   "I don't know what economic text book they are reading, but the way to
   growth is tax cuts. Tax cuts are the real stimulus," Evans said.
   "That's what I hear consistently from workers, entrepreneurs and
   business across the country."
