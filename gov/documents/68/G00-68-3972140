   The Indiana Wing is proud to announce the formation of a Critical
   Incident Stress Management Team.


   What is Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM)?: CISM is a
   structured group process lead by a mental health professional and peer
   leaders, in response to a group of  people being exposed to unusual and
   potentially traumatic events. The purpose of CISM is to minimized the
   trauma and restore individuals back to their previous level of
   functioning as soon as possible.


   Is CISM psychotherapy?: No, it is a supportive and educational process
   focused on the traumatic event and the individuals emotional and
   physical responses to that event.


   Will our responses be recorded?: No, the CISM interview process is
   confidential and a minimum of paper work is required. What is said in
   the group is kept in the group. Any exceptions to this rule will be
   clearly stated at the beginning of the process.


   Do the CISM team members have any special training in this processes?:
   Yes, all members attended a CISM training workshop in Michigan
   sponsored by the GLR CISM team. The Mental Health Chief had additional
   training in trauma and disaster mental health services. Training for
   the entire team will be on-going.


   What constitutes an “unusual situation”  requiring Critical Incident
   Stress Management debriefing?: Accidents fatalities, emotionally
   charged searches, visually disturbing scenes. Stress is subjective,
   when in doubt call the mental health chief and discuss the situation.


   Are CISM debriefings only for the senior corps?: No, they are for the
   support of all members of CAP, Seniors and Cadets.


   Who can request a CISM debriefing: YOU and YOU and YOU!
