                Who We Are

        The California State Council on Developmental Disabilities is a
        federally-funded independent state agency established in federal and
        state law to assist in planning, coordinating, monitoring and
        evaluating services for individuals with developmental disabilities
        and their families. Federal law requires the Council to identify
        ways to improve and increase services for individuals and their
        families, and to submit these to the federal government in the form
        of a State Plan. The Plan addresses specific information required by
        federal law within specified priority areas, and includes the
        Council's determination of California's priority issues and
        resulting Council goals and objectives for the time period covered
        by the Plan. The Plan must by approved by the federal Administration
        on Developmental Disabilities.

        Councils on Developmental Disabilities are established in each state
        through the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill
        of Rights Act. This Act also creates state protection and advocacy
        systems, university affiliated programs, and projects of national
        significance (see Council Links and Resources page). Each entity has
        a federally-assigned responsibility designed to improve services for
        individuals with developmental disabilities and their families, and
        enhance independence, productivity and inclusion.
