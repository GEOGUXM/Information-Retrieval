   This is a quiz designed to give you a clue about how you are doing with
   your child. Now that you have read the answers and "tallied" your
   points, what do YOU think you could be doing better? Rate yourself. Try
   to see yourself as a parent through your childs eyes. Would your child
   rate you as poor, fair, good, or excellent in terms of your handling of
   these typical situations? What changes would you like to make not only
   for the sake of your child, but for YOU, as well? We leave that
   determination up to you.

   Folks who work with children of divorce, or with teens and young adults
   many years after the divorce, can tell you about the pain and losses
   that children felt and never revealed to their parents. It is not too
   late.

   It is encouraging to know that parents who recognize their mistakes can
   model very important life lessons for children, by teaching them how to
   own up, to be honest and accountable. Children learn from their parents
   about the dignity of an apology. It is a valuable gift to show your
   child that no matter how difficult things may be, it is never too late
   to make a difference.
