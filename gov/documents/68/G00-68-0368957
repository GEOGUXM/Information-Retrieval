   below, and then check the items you need.

   NEW PRINCIPALS with pre-existing accounts at Fermilab: If your existing
   primary system login name (UNIX and/or NT) is eight or fewer
   characters, then use this login name for your Kerberos principal. If
   not, see Appendix C. More about Choosing a Principal Name in the
   manual.

   item even if they need root access! Read Root Instance of Kerberos
   Principal for information.
   How urgently do you need these items?

   items is currently about two weeks. This varies according to demand. To
   help us best accommodate everyone, please select a time span that
   indicates how long you can wait for these items:
   [No rush, I'm planning ahead]

   If less than two weeks, please give reason for the urgency:

   __________________________________________________

     timebomb You must change your initial Kerberos password within 30
     days of its creation. If it expires, you will not be able to login
     to strengthened systems and you will also not be able to use your
     CRYPTOCard.

     Submit Form Clear Form

   Copies of your submitted form are sent to compdiv@fnal.gov and to
   yourself (at the email address you provided). After your principal is
   created and/or the items you checked are ready, you will receive an
   email for each item from compdiv@fnal.gov with further instructions.
   Turn-around time will vary based on volume of requests.
