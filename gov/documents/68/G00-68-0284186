        NIH Advanced Laboratory Workstation System Quick Reference Guide

Getting Started on an Advanced Laboratory Workstation (ALW) System

   The Advanced Laboratory Workstation (ALW) System Quick Reference Guide
   is designed as an easy to use reference aid for novice users. This
   document covers:
    1. Logging on and off an ALW
    2. Passwords and authentication procedures
    3. Requesting disk space
    4. Further ALW system information and assistance available

Using This Document

   This document uses the following conventions to guide you as to how you
   enter UNIX commands and how you distinguish these commands from
   information displayed by the ALW system.

   bold face text
          Variable information and UNIX commands or information you type
          or action you perform.

   Typewriter face text
          Any information displayed on screen that you do not enter, such
          as your system's prompt, or information displayed in response to
          your entries.

   normal face text
          Symbols and conventions used by this document to explain the
          command or response.

How to Login to an ALW

   Respond to the login prompt by entering your user name and password in
   the steps outlined below.
    1. login: user-name
    2. Password: password (NOTE: This is not visible to you as it is
       typed)

   A successful login by an ALW user to any ALW results in:
     * an X-window session or a UNIX shell session,
     * provides ALW authentication for access to ALW protected files,
     * begins a login shell session with the user's home directory as the
       current working directory

   The UNIX pathname for your home directory has this format:

   /afs/alw.nih.gov/nih/institute/user-name

   If your user name and password do not allow a successful login call
   496-UNIX for assistance.

Logging Out of an ALW

   You have three choices available when you have finished your work
   session:
    1. Destroy your tokens
    2. Exit from the X-Windows environment only and return to the UNIX
       shell.
    3. Completely leave the UNIX environment.

   You can exit from X-Windows at any time you desire. However, in order
   to log out from the UNIX environment you must first exit from X-Windows
   as shown below.

  STEP 1: To exit from the X-windows environment,

    1. Click on the terminate button on the X-Window-System`s icon or
       dialogue box displayed on screen.
       [xterminate.gif]
    2. Click on the terminate button displayed on the resulting pop-up
       confirmation box.
       [xterminate-confirm.gif]

  STEP 2: To log out from a UNIX shell session

    1. Terminate the X-Windows session (step 1 above).
    2. Enter the logout command.

Changing an Account Password

   For the security of the individual account and the system as a whole,
   every ALW account must have a password. Choose a password that is easy
   for you to remember, but not easy for someone else to guess.

   To change the password for an ALW account use the kpasswd command as
   shown below.

    1. hostname% kpasswd (NOTE: The actual hostname that appears as part
       of the prompt will be your system's name)
    2. Old-password: OLD-PASSWORD
       (NOTE: This is not visible to you as it is typed.)
    3. New password: NEW-PASSWORD
       (NOTE: This is not visible to you as it is typed.)
    4. Please re-enter new password: NEW-PASSWORD
       (NOTE: This is not visible to you as it is typed.)

   You will know that you have successfully changed your password when the
   ALW returns with a:

     hostname%

   prompt after you have verified your new password.

     NOTE: Here and throughout the rest of this document you will see the
     system prompt given as: hostname%

     This is used as a convention in this document for illustratation.
     The actual name you will see displayed will depend on your machine's
     actual name.

Renewing/Cancelling Andrew File System (AFS) Authentication -- klog/unlog

   The Andrew File System (AFS) authentication you obtain at login lasts
   for about 25 hours. To renew authentication for an ALW account use the
   klog command..
    1. hostname% klog
    2. Password: PASSWORD
       (NOTE: This is not visible to you as it is typed.)

   When you leave your ALW unattended we STRONGLY recommend that, you
   cancel the authentication when you leave and re-authenticate when you
   return.

   To cancel authentication for an ALW account use the unlog command.

    1. hostname% unlog

Security under AFS

   AFS allows the owner of a directory to set permissions for all the
   files the directory contains. The most common permissions are listed
   below.
        PERMISSION        ALLOWS
           read      read and lookup access
           write     read and write access
           all       write and administer access
           none      no access

   When access is set on a directory it does not propagate to
   subdirectories that currently exist only to subsequently created
   subdirectories.

   Set the Access Control List (ACL) on an AFS directory with the fs
   command.

   For example, to allow a colleague to read, but not write, your files
   follow the sequence outlined below while at the hostname% prompt.
    1. hostname% cd your-directory
    2. hostname% fs seta . -acl user-name write colleague-name read
    3. hostname% fs lista .
Access list for . is
Normal rights:
  colleague-name rl
  user-name rlidwk

     NOTE: all files in a new user's home directory, except those in the
     private subdirectory, are initially readable by everyone.

Requesting ALW System Disk Space

   Every ALW user gets a home area limited to about 20 Megabytes. Requests
   for additional disk space should be submitted via the ptr utility.
   Requests for disk space for very large files should be limited to 200
   Megabytes per request.

UNIX Documentation

   To read on-line documentation for a UNIX command use the man command.

   For example, to list the manual page for the ls command use the command
   below.

          hostname% man ls

   Refer to (vendor supplied) UNIX man pages for hard-copy information
   about UNIX commands.

Andrew Tools Documentation

   In the X-windows environment, use the help command for on-line
   information about "Andrew applications" (e.g. messages, ez):

   For example, enter the following commands at the hostname% prompt.
        help           to browse all help
        help messages   to browse for help on messages
        help ez        to browse for help on ez

   All on-line UNIX documentation is also available in the help browser.

AFS Documentation

   Refer to the AFS User's Guide or AFS Command Reference for hardcopy
   information about the AFS System.

   Call 496-UNIX for information about availability.

ALW System Documentation

   PostScript versions of most ALW system documentation can be found on
   any ALW in the directory /usr/local/alwpub/doc. These can be printed on
   a local PostScript printer with the lpr command.

   ALso, the document you are viewing can most likely be printed directly
   from your current viewing application. Refer to your application's
   documentation for output instructions.

ALW User Assistance

   Use the ptr command to submit written requests for help and/or written
   problem reports.

          hostname% ptr

   To report immediate and/or complex problems call DCRT's Technical
   Assistance and Support Center (TASC) at (301) 594-DCRT or e-mail
   4dcrt@nih.gov.
