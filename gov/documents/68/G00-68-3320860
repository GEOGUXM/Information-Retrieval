   planning and execution of the Annual Conference for the communication
   of recent results in the physics of controlled thermonuclear fusion.

   The goal of controlled thermonuclear fusion research is to develop a
   safe, environmentally benign, and essentially inexhaustible source of
   energy for the future.

   Papers are solicited in the following topics:
     * Plasma properties, equilibrium, stability and transport
     * Physics of plasma edge and divertor region
     * Plasma production and heating
     * Computer simulation of plasmas
     * Atomic, molecular, nuclear, and reactor physics
     * Magnetic reconnection

   This conference is conducted in accordance with the International
   Council of Scientific Unions guidelines on free circulation of
   scientists.
