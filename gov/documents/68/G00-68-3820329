   Special Notices:

   Soon after the publication of September CPI data on October 19th, 2001,
   the Social Security Administration (SSA) announced the annual increase
   in its benefit payments for the coming year. This change will mean
   automatic increases in payments from Social Security's Old-Age,
   Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security
   Income (SSI) programs. The increase will be effective with December
   2001 payments received in January 2002. Specific information on the
   size of the increase is available on the SSA website at
   http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/COLA.sum.html.

   Values for some series--both CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and
   CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)--have been
   revised. The revisions cover the period from January 2000 through
   August 2000. These revised values were loaded into the LABSTAT database
   at 10 a.m. EDT on Thursday, September 28, 2000. See
   http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpirev01.htm for more information, and for links
   to tables containing the revised index values.
