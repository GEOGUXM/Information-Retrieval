   Identifying Screwworm Fly Habitats Using Remote Sensing and Geographic
                             Information Systems

   Introduction

   The USDA-ARS Screwworm Research Program has found that in the tropics
   screwworm population densities are highest in ecotones between mature
   forest and open field. The USDA research unit in Panama is developing
   methods to identify these ecotonal habitats using LANDSAT TM, SPOT, and
   Radarsat satellite imagery. The ability to locate probable screwworm
   populations using remote-sensed data will increase the efficiency and
   effectiveness of USDA's biological control of screwworm.

   SPOT, Landsat TM, ERS-1 and DTED data were acquired of the study area.
   These data were evaluated for their usefulness in mapping screwworm
   habitats in the Panama Canal Zone, Panama using ERDAS Imagine 8.3 and
   PCI 6.0 software.

   Field Data For Image Classification

   Land use and vegetation data were collected in the field using a
   Magellan ProMark V GPS unit and a Magellan MBS-1 base station. For each
   location the vegetation was described by dominant species and percent
   vegetative cover at 1-5 meters, 5-10 meters, 10-20 meters and above.
   Ninety-six locations were visited in the Canal Zone Area. The GPS
   locations were used to collect training samples for image
   classification using ERDAS Imagine 8.2 seed pixel method.

   Using ERDAS Imagine 8.3 a combination of supervised and unsupervised
   classification techniques were used on the imagery. The clouds and
   water were separated using cluster analysis. The vegetation types and
   land use were separated using the non-parametric decision rule. A
   number of band combinations with SPOT, LANDSAT TM and DTED were tried.
   The SPOT bands were considered the most accurate for discriminating
   vegetation types.  The Vegetation Map for the Canal Area is the
   combined results of the SPOT and TM classification.  The classification
   results from the Landsat imagery were used in areas of cloud cover on
   the SPOT image.    DTED data were used to separate the mangroves and
   highland forest types.

   Field Data for Fly Activity

   Panamanian technicians collected fly activity data in the different
   vegetation types identified on the imagery using a baited trap of
   rotting liver. They caught individual flies and took measurements of
   temperature and fly activity every 15 minutes. Data were collected
   from  5 to 7 days at each site.

   Analysis

   To test whether vegetation type effects fly activity we ran an
   Kruskal-Wallis rank test on the data set (fly activity and vegetation
   type).  We found the area of highest fly activity to be secondary
   forest between 20-30 meters tall and "Edge" forests.  In the Canal Area
   this type of forest is most often found on the border of mature forests
   and open areas. The canopy is often fairly open with moderate light
   penetration. The recorded temperature for this vegetation type was
   between 24 C and 30 C with an median of 26 C. The optimal temperature
   for screwworm fly activity is between 24 C and 26 C. The areas of
   lowest fly activity are open areas and forest older than 60 years. This
   information allowed us to map the areas of high fly activity.
