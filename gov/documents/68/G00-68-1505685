      Description of research projects:

      Plum pox virus (PPV) is considered as one of the contagious pathogens
      that has a devastating consequence for prunus fruit production. PPV is
      mainly transmitted by aphid vectors and can infect many Prunus
      species.  The infected trees develop Plum pox or Sharka symptoms that
      affect plant growth and fruit quality and may eventually kill the
      trees. The detection of PPV in North America has drawn a great
      attention from agrobusiness, the research community and government
      agents. PPV could, if not controlled, pose a great threat to
      multi-billion dollar fruit industry in the US.

       The goal of my research is to enhance the resistance of prunus fruit
      crops to virus pathogens, particularly to PPV. To achieve this goal, my
      lab is using available molecular and genetic tools to study the
      pathogenic determinants of PPV, survey the existing prunus germplasms
      for the virus resistant trait, and analyze the profile of
      posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in a PPV-resistant transgenic
      plum C5 line which has been developed in our programs by Dr. Scorza’s
      group. These analyses should help understand how PPV infects Prunus
      trees and identify plant host factors or genes that interact with the
      pathogenic determinants of the virus. The identified factors will be
      further analyzed for their role in governing plant susceptibility or
      resistance to PPV and other viruses and for their relationship with the
      regulation of the posttranscriptional gene silencing or other virus
      resistance mechanisms, if any. To this end, the information obtained
      from our research and others will be used for devising a sound strategy
      for engineering the Prunus resistant to multiple virus pathogens
      including PPV.
