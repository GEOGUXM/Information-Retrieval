                    Project: Internet Telephony / VOIP
   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]

[iptel-logo.gif] GOAL:

   To research and develop testing methodologies and tools that will (1)
   enable the measurement of voice quality for existing VoIP end-systems
   and networks; (2) facilitate the analysis of new VoIP coding and
   representation technologies and network transport services; and (3)
   expedite the research and development of protocols and platforms for
   programmable telephony services.

   Technical Objectives:

   •Explore and evaluate objective speech quality measures, including
   novel continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques.

   •Develop an automated VoIP test and measurement system that is
   integrated with the NISTNet network emulation tool.

   •Identify standardization requirements and testing needs for
   programmable IP telephony services.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Planned Accomplishments:

   • FY00 - Research and evaluate of objective speech quality measures for
   VoIP.

   •  FY00 - Develop automated VoIP quality measurement tool integrated
   with NISTNet.

   •  FY00 - Prototype and evaluate SIP based programmable network
   technologies  for IP Telephony services.

   •  FY01 - Develop SIP interoperability test tools and event-based
   distributed test drivers.

   •  FY01 - Document analysis of key standardization  and testing issues
   in programmable Internet signaling services.

   •  FY01- Research and evaluate of  impact of emerging Internet QoS and
   security mechanisms on VoIP speech quality.

Current Task Plans:

     * FY01 - SIP Test Tools project plan.
