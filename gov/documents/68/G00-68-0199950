   The U.S. Geological Survey Chesapeake Bay Science Program

   By Scott W. Phillips

   Map of the Chesapeake Bay region   The Chesapeake Bay, the Nation's
   largest estuary, has historically supported one of the most productive
   fisheries in the world. The bay serves as the spawning ground for 70 to
   90 percent of the striped bass in the Atlantic Ocean. The
   64,000-square-mile watershed of the bay provides vital habitat for
   migratory birds using the Atlantic Flyway. In addition to supporting
   aquatic communities and wildlife, the bay's watershed serves the
   economic and recreational needs of 15 million people. Unfortunately,
   the commercial, economic, and recreational value of the bay and its
   watershed has been degraded by poor water quality, loss of habitat, and
   overharvesting of living resources. Additionally, the bay was listed
   under the Clean Water Act as an "impaired water body" in 1999 due to
   excess nutrients and sediment. Improvements in the water-quality
   conditions must be made by 2010 or regulatory approaches to achieve
   these standards will be implemented.

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), one of the original CBP Federal
   partners, has the critical role of providing unbiased scientific
   information to be used in formulating, implementing, and assessing the
   effectiveness of restoration goals in the bay and its watershed. The
   USGS Chesapeake Bay Science Program is meeting this role through a
   combination of research, monitoring, modeling, and interaction with
   partners in the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Department of Interior.
   The success of the USGS effort depends on the coordination of multiple
   USGS programs and scientists conducting studies of the bay and its
   watershed.
