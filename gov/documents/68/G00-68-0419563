      Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs (OSFAP) - Student
                             Financial Aid (SFA)

     The 1998 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Programs established
   a Performance Based Organization to administer the Student Financial
   Assistance programs at the U.S. Department of Education. This Web page
   will keep you abreast of the changes to our organization and our
   progress in reinventing these important programs, which provide more
   than $60 billion of financial aid a year to college students.

        Navigating the future (with your help) ...
     * We are pleased to provide the latest draft of our Performance Plan
       [in pdf].
     * Our Progress Report for Fourth Quarter FY 2000 [in PDF] highlights
       some achievements and provides status on SFA's Performance Plan
       Indicators.
     Reengineering our business processes and computer systems is part of
       our top-to-bottom reinvention. The Modernization Blueprint explains
       how we will do it.
     We conducted a survey to help us identify key employee satisfaction
       issues. Read the Improvement Strategy (in PDF) to find out some of
       the things we're doing for employees.
     * Review the SFA Interim Budget Plan.

        How we serve the public and our partners ...
     * We understand customer concerns about privacy on the Web. Our
       privacy policy explains how we're working to ensure the privacy of
       your visit to our site.
     * Applying for SFA grants, loans and work-study costs nothing! Over
       10 million students use the Free Application for Federal Student
       Aid (FAFSA) to apply for student aid each year -- many of them use
       the electronic versions of the form, which can be found on the Web
       at the FAFSA page .
     * PEPS is the information system for Student Financial Assistance. At
       the PEPS Web site you'll find hotline information and what's new in
       PEPS and Case Management. There's also downloadable weekly extracts
       of selected PEPS fields and connectivity instructions and security
       forms to request new user ID's. Soon the site will offer the Case
       Management and Oversight (CMO) weekly institutional updates and all
       the PEPS training guides.
     The Federal Student Aid Information Center helps students complete
       the application and provides the public with free information about
       our programs. The Center responds to approximately 5 million
       telephone inquiries a year. You can call 1-800-4 FED AID to speak
       to a specialist about our student aid programs, or visit Financial
       Aid for Students, which has our popular print publications on-line,
       as well as helpful database resources.
     * The Direct Loan Program includes Stafford and PLUS loans and is run
       by the Department of Education. The Direct Loan Web Site offers a
       variety of interactive tools for students, including a repayment
       calculator and direct access to loan account information. Stafford
       and PLUS loan funding for the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)
       Program comes from private lenders.
     * We maintain a robust collection of technical documents for
       financial aid administrators, lending institutions, auditors, and
       other organizations at Information for Financial Aid Professionals.
     * students.gov is the U.S. Government-wide initiative to deliver
       electronic, Web-based services from government agencies and
       organizations to postsecondary students. We are taking a lead on
       this initiative and are developing and testing services related to
       Web-based student financial aid.
     * We have established the SFA Ombudsman, an office to assist
       borrowers in resolving student loan issues.
