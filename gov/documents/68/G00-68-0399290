     We are committed to providing access to our web pages for individuals
     with disabilities, both members of the public and Federal employees.

     To meet this commitment, we will comply with the requirements of
     Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C.
     794) and the accessibility standards issued by the Architectural and
     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.

     Section 508 requires that individuals with disabilities, who are
     members of the public seeking information or services from us, have
     access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that
     provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities,
     unless an undue burden would be imposed on us. Section 508 also
     requires us to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have
     access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the
     access to and use of information and data by Federal employees who are
     not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be
     imposed on us.

     Comments on the accessibility of our web site should be sent to our
     Webmaster.
