   The production of digital cartographic data and graphic maps comprises
   the largest component of the USGS National Mapping Program (NMP).
   Cartographic data are compiled from aerial photographs, other remotely
   sensed images, historical records, legal documents, and direct field
   observations and surveys and comply with standards of content,
   geometric accuracy, and presentation. Modern, automated equipment is
   used in this process, replacing the labor-intensive processes of the
   past. The NMP incorporates the documented needs of 40 Federal agencies
   and the 50 States, which are solicited and analyzed as part of a
   continuous requirements assessment process.

Printed Maps

   Topographic Quadrangle Maps
          The USGS's most familiar product is the 1:24,000-scale
          Topographic Quadrangle Map. This is the primary scale of data
          produced, and depicts greater detail for a smaller area than
          intermediate-scale (1:50,000 and 1:100,000) and small-scale
          (1:250,000, 1:2,000,000 or smaller) products, which show
          selectively less detail for larger areas.

   Orthophotoquads
          Orthophotoquads are distortion-free aerial photographs that are
          formatted and printed as standard 7.5 minute, 1:24,000-scale
          quadrangles (15-minute in Alaska) or as quarter quadrangles at a
          scale of 1:12,000.

   Satellite Image Maps
          Experimental multicolored or black-and-white image maps produced
          from digital data collected by Land Satellite (Landsat) and
          Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) sensors.
          Scales range from 1:24,000 (Point Loma, Calif.) to 1:7,500,000
          (conterminous 48 States).

   Thematic Maps
          Maps in which information on special subjects is geographically
          displayed on planimetric base maps or overlays registered to
          planimetric or topographic base maps. This category includes
          land use and land cover and associated maps, and National Atlas
          maps.

   Other Format Maps
          This category consists of maps in non-quadrangle format. These
          maps include: a county map series, State base map series, U.S.
          base maps, a National Park series, and outline maps of the
          world. Scales range from 1:960 to 1:80 million.

   Other Map Products
          Other map products, published to meet the special needs of
          Federal agencies, include: National Imagery and Mapping Agency
          15-minute topographic maps, USDA Forest Service National Forest
          and Grasslands Maps, Antarctic map series, shaded relief
          topographic maps, satellite image maps, and U.S. border maps.

Aerial Photographs

   Aerial Photographs
          Aerial photographs archived and distributed by the USGS include
          the repository of multiagency National Aerial Photography
          Program (NAPP) photos at 1:40,000 scale in color infrared or
          black and white; National High Altitude Aerial Photography
          Program (NHAP) photos at 1:58,000 scale for color infrared and
          1:80,000 for black and white; and aerial photos at various
          scales from USGS mapping projects and other Federal agencies
          such as the Bureau of Reclamation, Environmental Protection
          Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

   Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQ)
          Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQ) are digital images of
          aerial photographs in which displacements caused by the camera
          and the terrain have been removed. A DOQ combines the image
          characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of
          a map. The standard digital orhthophoto produced by the USGS is
          a black-and-white or color-infrared 1-meter ground resolution
          quarter quadrangle (3.75-minute) image.

Digital Geospatial Data

   Products archived and available through the USGS include:

   Digital Line Graphs (DLG)
          DLG's are vector files containing line data, such as roads and
          streams, digitized from USGS topographic maps. DLG's offer a
          full range of attribute codes, are highly accurate, and are
          topologically structured, which makes them ideal for use in
          geographic information systems (GIS).

   Digital Raster Graphics (DRG)
          DRG's are scanned images of USGS topographic maps. A scanned DRG
          image includes all map collar information. The image inside the
          map neatline is georeferenced to the Earth's surface. A DRG can
          be combined with digital data or images (for example, DOQ's) to
          aid in the collection, review, and revision of other types of
          digital data, especially DLG's.

   Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
          DEM's are digital records of terrain elevations for ground
          positions at regularly spaced horizontal intervals. DEM's are
          developed from stereo models or digital contour line files
          derived from USGS topographic quadrangle maps.

   Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)
          LULC data are derived from thematic overlays registered to
          1:250,000-scale base maps and a limited number of
          1:100,000-scale base maps. LULC data provide information on
          urban or built-up land, agricultural land, rangeland, forest
          land, water, wetlands, barren land, tundra, and perennial snow
          or ice. Associated maps display information in five data
          categories: (1) political units, (2) hydrologic units, (3)
          census county subdivisions, (4) Federal land ownership, and (5)
          State land ownership.

   Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri Data Base
          This data base forms an Environmental Information System for the
          Upper Mississippi and Missouri River Basins developed in
          response to the great flood of 1993. This system includes
          satellite data, elevation data, digitized aerial photographs,
          data on historic river channels, man-made structures,
          hazardous/toxic waste sites, spatially referenced information on
          soils, and various geologic, biologic, hydrologic, and
          hydrographic themes. The component data sets were designed for
          widely different purposes, and are stored in a variety of
          formats and map scales. The majority of data were provided by
          Federal agencies and are in the public domain. A small number of
          data sets have distribution restrictions due to proprietary
          agreements or to protect resources at sensitive locations such
          as archaeologic sites or endangered species nesting areas.
