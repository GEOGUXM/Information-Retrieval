                    What is the Earth Science Enterprise?

   NASA's Earth Science Enterprise is dedicated to understanding the total
    Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on
   the global environment. The vantage point of space provides information
       about Earth's land, atmosphere, ice, oceans, and biota that is
      obtainable in no other way. Programs of the Enterprise study the
    interactions among these components to advance the new discipline of
      Earth System Science, with a near-term emphasis on global climate
     change. Our research results contribute to the development of sound
           environmental policy and economic investment decisions.
    NASA's Earth Science Enterprise develops innovative technologies and
   applications of remote sensing for solving practical societal problems
      in food and fiber production, natural hazard mitigation, regional
       planning, water resources, and national resource management in
   partnership with other Federal agencies, with industry, and with state
    and local governments. Earth Science discoveries are shared with the
    public to enhance science, mathematics, and technology education and
    increase the scientific and technological literacy of all Americans.
   Earth Science combines the excitement of scientific discovery with the
   reward of practical contribution to the sustainability of planet Earth.
    Earth Science is science in the national interest. NASA is pleased to
   play a leadership role in exploring our home planet. The Earth Science
       Enterprise Strategic Plan describes our approach to science and
       applications research in this great endeavor. Three subordinate
       documents, the Earth Science Enterprise Research Strategy, the
   Technology Strategy, and the Applications Strategy, provide more detail
                          in these important areas.
