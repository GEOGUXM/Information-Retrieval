   The focus on "Citizen-Centered E-government" requires a high degree of
   interoperability across agencies and jurisdictions in order to link the
   systems and applications that collect, process, and display government
   information.

   This newsletter explores how Federal, State, Local and International
   Governments are using XML to help facilitate that process. Featuring 28
   articles from governments around the world, academia, IT associations
   and business, this newsletter provides an excellent introduction to the
   uses of XML by governments.
