   All Mail to the House of Representatives Will be Delayed.
   Due to increased security measures in the House of Representatives, all
   mail received by my District and Washington office has been delayed.
   Your letters are very important to me. They reflect the thoughts and
   concerns of our great Congressional district. I will continue to
   respond to your questions and concerns as quickly as possible. I'm
   honored that you have taken the time to write me and I encourage you to
   keep writing.
