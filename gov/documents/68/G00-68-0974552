    Energy Department Adds More Cutting-Edge Projects to Improve Tomorrow's
    Gas Pipelines

    Morgantown, WV - Every day in the United States an average of 55
    billion cubic feet of natural moves through more than1.2 million miles
    of underground pipe and thousands of compressor stations to virtually
    every home and nearly 5 million businesses across the country.

    For the most part, this flow of natural gas is uneventful in fact,
    America's pipeline system is unequaled in its efficiency and safety.
    But the current gas infrastructure is aging and leaks or breakages can
    occur. Moreover, as the Nation's consumption of natural gas increases,
    at least 300,000 miles of new distribution and transmission pipelines
    will have to be built by 2015.

    In May, the Department of Energy announced its first set of joint
    government-industry projects to develop high-tech ways to improve the
    safety and performance of the Nation's gas delivery system. Now, the
    department plans to add another 10 cost-shared projects that will
    develop cutting edge automation, new sensors and leak detectors,
    corrosion monitors, and other advanced devices that can improve the way
    natural gas is transported through tomorrow's gas infrastructure.

    The new projects were proposed by:
      * Kansas State University, Manhattan KS, which will develop a
        "Virtual Pipeline System Testbed," a computer model that, for the
        first time, will allow operators to identify the most reliable and
        lowest cost path to deliver natural gas to the consumer by
        integrating both the operation of compressor stations and different
        pressures, flow rates and other variables in the pipeline itself.

        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * Gas Technology Institute, Des Plaines, IL, (2 projects):

     1. One project will design and test a robotic system that can seal
        joints in cast-iron pipes. About 47,000 miles of cast-iron
        distribution pipes, or "mains," are now used to bring natural gas
        into homes and businesses.

        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
     2. The second project will develop an obstacle-detection sensor that
        can be installed near the drill bit in horizontal directional
        drilling system. These systems, which bore into the earth, then
        turn horizontally to create tunnels for underground pipes, are
        being used increasingly as an alternative to trenching. The new
        sensing system will signal the presence of obstacles so they can be
        avoided during the drilling operation.

      * CyTerra Corporation, Waltham, MA, which will adapt a plastic
        detection technology originally developed for the U.S. Army to
        locate deeper non-metallic pipes and other buried materials before
        they are inadvertently damaged by construction or other excavation
        activities.
        Point of Contact: Glenn Anderson, 781/622-1360
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * New York Gas Group (NYGAS), New York, NY, which will develop an
        advanced test kit that operators can use in the field to detect the
        presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in natural gas
        distribution pipelines.
        Point of Contact: Ms. Daphne D'Zurko, 212/354-4790 x214
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, which will develop a
        device based on patented magnetostrictive sensor technology that
        sends low-frequency guided waves down a pipe to detect the minute
        changes in pipewall thickness that can signal the beginning of
        corrosion.
        Point of Contact: Mr. Aaron Taylor, 210/522-6094
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc., North Salem, NH, which proposes
        to build a low-cost, easy-to-use ground penetrating radar system
        for locating metallic and non-metallic pipes and detecting gas
        leaks.
        Point of Contact: Alan E. Schutz, 603/893-1109
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * Automatika, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, which will partner with New York
        Gas and its associated utilities to develop a wireless network of
        small pipeline sensors that operators can use to monitor the
        real-time operations of active gas distribution mains, the smaller
        pipes that deliver gas to residences and businesses.
        Point of Contact: Dr. Hagen Schempf, 412/968-1022 x11
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * West Virginia University Research Corporation, Morgantown, WV,
        which proposes a system to detect the unique sound wave generated
        when a pipeline break releases a large discharge of gas after being
        damaged by landslides, excavations, or other disturbances. The
        system will be designed to monitor the background noise inside the
        pipe and pick up any sudden new frequencies that might signal a
        sudden pipeline rupture.
        Point of Contact: John L. Loth, 304/293-4111 x2343
        Public Abstract [submitted by proposer]
      * Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, which proposes to
        replace many of the manual operations in managing the flow of
        natural gas through pipelines and compressors with cutting-edge
        automated systems. The university will develop modeling tools and
        automated feedback controls for large-scale pipeline networks.
