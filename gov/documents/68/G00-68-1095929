       * Education of the next generation workforce
       * Professional development for Idaho teachers
       * Recognition of the importance of pre-college science and technology
         education throughout Idaho
       * Involvement of INEEL personnel with students and teachers in
         education
       * Involvement of Idaho families in the virtual, multimedia JASON
         expedition.

                                                                       rule

   The JASON Project uses advanced curricular and technological approaches
   to engage millions of students and teachers throughout the world in
   science and technology as research is happening. The mission of JASON
   Idaho is to help build academic excellence in science and technology in
   the State of Idaho.

   JASON Idaho is provided free of charge to schools by the INEEL through
   a grant from the Office of Naval Research. Participating teachers
   attend a one-day workshop where they learn about and receive the JASON
   curriculum.

   The JASON Project offers students and teachers in grades 4 through 9 a
   comprehensive, multimedia approach to enhance teaching and learning in
   science, technology, math, geography, and associated disciplines. The
   project delivers its educational content through a print curriculum,
   videos, fully interactive Internet programming, and live satellite
   "telepresence" broadcasts. Students employ several research tools,
   including the Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information
   System (GIS), and satellite remote sensing, to address the following
   questions:

       What are the Earth's dynamic systems?

       How do these systems affect life on Earth?

       What technologies do we use to study the Earth-space system, and
     why?

   Frozen Worlds! JASON Project XIII will take teachers and students on an
   adventure to some of the colder, more inhospitable regions of our
   planet and solar system in 2001-2002.

   2000-2001 Project. In 2000-2001, the JASON Foundation took teachers and
   students to Hawaii: A Living Laboratory, where they studied volcanoes,
   plant life, and culture. The wireless, live JASON broadcast from Hawaii
   was received in Pocatello at Idaho State University, in Boise at
   Northwest Nazarene University, and in Coeur d'Alene at North Idaho
   College from January 29 - February 9, 2001. Student attendance
   represented 53% of the potential student audience in the Idaho service
   areas.
   The JASON Project components. Expedition: Each year, using host
   researchers, JASON mounts a major science expedition that examines one
   or more of the Earth's physical systems.

   Curriculum. Based on the work of the host researchers, who assist in
   identifying key content areas, students participate in an interactive,
   technological curriculum. It is a year-round scientific expedition
   designed to engage students primarily in grades 4-9 in the natural and
   physical sciences and technology. The National Science Teachers
   Association endorses the curriculum. It is correlated to Idaho's
   Science Performance standards.

   Teacher Professional Development. JASON is internationally recognized
   as a leader in professional development and offers workshops and
   seminars with detailed walk-throughs of the curriculum, online, and
   video components for the year.

   Team JASON Online. Students and teachers draw on a wealth of resources
   at the award-winning JASON web site, www.jasonproject.org. The web site
   lets students touch base with expedition scientists and post and share
   data from local experiments with others around the world.

   Video Supplements. JASON produces and distributes topical videos on the
   subjects under study throughout the year. Student and Teacher Argonaut
   Program: The Argonauts participate directly in research, help host the
   JASON broadcast, and communicate the program to others.
