California STAR Program Background

   The governor signed Senate Bill 376 authorizing the STAR Program in
   October 1997. The State Board of Education, as required by statute,
   designated the Stanford 9 as the achievement test for the Program. This
   test was first administered to all California students during spring
   1998. The Stanford 9 is a nationally norm-referenced multiple-choice
   achievement test. School districts are required to administer the test
   to all students in grades 2 - 11, except for:
     * Students receiving special education services with Individual
       Education Plans (IEPs) that specify that the students are to
       complete alternative assessments rather than the STAR Program tests
       and
     * Students whose parents or guardians submit written requests to
       exempt the students.
       Students in grades 2 - 11 are tested in reading, language (written
       expression) and mathematics.

   Students in grades 2 - 8 are also tested in spelling, and students in
   grades 9 - 11 are tested in science and social science. The tests are
   administered to all students during a period that includes the 10 days
   before and 10 days after the day on which 85% of each school, program
   or track's instructional year is completed.

   Beginning in 1999, additional test items in language arts and
   mathematics were added to the STAR Program. These additional items were
   initially referred to as the Stanford Augmentation and are now known as
   the California Standards Tests. During 2001, three additional
   California Standards Tests were included in the program:
     * Grade 4 and 7 writing tests,
     * Grade 9 - 11 end-of-course science tests, and
     * Grade 9 - 11 history-social science tests.

   The purpose of the Stanford 9 is to determine how well California
   students are achieving academically compared to a national sample of
   students tested in the same grade at the same time of the school year.
   The purpose of the California Standards Tests is to determine how well
   students are learning the skills and knowledge required by the
   California Content Standards for each grade or course.

   In 1999 the SABE/2 was added to the Program. Spanish-speaking English
   language learners (limited-English proficient students) who have been
   enrolled in California public schools less than 12 months when testing
   begins are required to take the SABE/2 in addition to taking the
   Stanford 9 and California Standards Tests. Districts have the option of
   administering the test to Spanish-speaking English language learners
   who have been in California public schools 12 months or more.
