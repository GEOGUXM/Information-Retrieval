                                  Space Fun

    Living in space is not just all work and no play. Astronauts like to
   have fun, too. If you're going to work on the space shuttle for a week
     or two, it is certainly okay to look out the window, play with your
    food or tease your crewmates once in awhile. If you're staying on the
      International Space Station for a few months, fun is an essential
                     ingredient to the quality of life.

       Astronauts need a break from their busy schedules when they are
     orbiting Earth. Days or even months of straight work is certain to
   cause stress among space workers. That is why flight planners on Earth
     schedule time during each day so astronauts can relax, exercise and
   have some fun. Shuttle and station crewmembers even manage to have fun
   while working. Experiments in space sometimes involve ordinary toys and
                       how microgravity affects them.

    A popular pastime while orbiting the Earth is simply looking out the
    window. Astronauts onboard the space shuttle can look out the cockpit
      windows and watch the Earth below or the deep blackness of space.
      Inside the International Space Station, crewmembers have numerous
        windows they can look out. Astronauts often comment on their
    fascination and awe as they look at the Earth spin beneath them with
    its multiple shades and textures. Sunsets and sunrises are also very
    spectacular, occurring every 45 minutes above the Earth's atmosphere.

   Onboard the space station, crewmembers have many opportunities to relax
    and play. Like most people who work full time, they get weekends off.
   On any given day, crewmembers can watch movies, read books, play cards
   and talk to their families. They have an exercise bike, a treadmill and
     various other equipment to help keep their bodies in shape. During
       their off time, they certainly take time out to play games and
                         generally have a good time.
