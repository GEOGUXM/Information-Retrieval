Space VLBI: An Introduction

Out of Many - One!

     Space VLBI is an exciting new kind of scientific observation of
     unusual astronomical objects. It requires the simultaneous use of
     many ground radio telescopes and at least one radio telescope in
     space. In addition, it allows us to observe astronomical objects in
     greater detail than other astronomical observing techniques
     currently in use.

VLBI - Telescopes as big as the Earth

     The acronym VLBI stands for Very Long Baseline Interferometry, a
     well-established observing technique used by radio astronomers.
     Radio telescopes around the world can be linked together
     electronically to create an earth-sized "interferometer," which
     creates the effect of one giant telescope as large as the earth.
     These enormous (or VLBI) telescopes can "see" astrophysical objects
     in better detail than any other telescopes in use. This is due to
     the fact that, in general, the bigger the telescope, the better the
     detail.

Space VLBI

     In the observing technique called Space VLBI we electronically
     interlink an Earth-orbiting radio telescope to the world-wide
     collection of ground-based telescopes. This allows us to create one
     telescope as large as the orbit of the spacecraft. Additionally, the
     clocks for each telescope have to be "locked" together to within
     less than a micro-second, for hours on end, for them all to act as a
     single unit.
