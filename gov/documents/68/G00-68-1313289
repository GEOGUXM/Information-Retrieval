                      Directions, Parking and Security
                 Union Station Federal Courthouse in Tacoma

   NOTICE:

   Please be advised that the new Tacoma Art Museum is being constructed
   in the north parking lot adjacent to Union Station and the federal
   court annex. Consequently, the number of parking spaces available to
   the public in that area will be reduced from about 250 stalls to about
   130. It is expected that the number of parking spaces will be further
   reduced to about 70 stalls as construction progresses. Persons with
   court business may have difficulty finding parking and should plan to
   arrive early and expect possible delays both entering and exiting the
   north parking lot. Practitioners may wish to notify their clients of
   this construction activity so that court matters will not be delayed as
   a result.
   Parking:
   Free street parking is restricted in front of and to the north of the
   courthouse on Pacific Avenue, but is available in front of the
   Washington State History Museum and on the opposite (west) side of
   Pacific Avenue. Public pay parking lots are located south and east of
   the Washington State History Museum and north of the courthouse, and
   can be accessed from Hood Street north of the Tacoma Art Museum.
   Directions:
   Take the Tacoma City Center exit (133) from I-5 and go north on I-705
   past the Tacoma Dome. Take the 21st Street exit left (west) onto 21st
   Street and turn right (north) onto Pacific Avenue. The courthouse is
   located a short four blocks north at 1717 Pacific Avenue in the
   historic Union Station between the Washington State History Museum and
   the Tacoma Art Museum (under construction), and across Pacific Avenue
   from the University of Washington â€“ Tacoma.
   Security:
   Security measures have increased at all federal courthouses, including
   Union Station in Tacoma. Please be prepared to show photo ID and pass
   through the magnetometers and x-ray machines at both the Pacific Avenue
   and the rear (eastside) ground-level entrances to the courthouse.
   Security Restrictions:
   Electronic and mechanical devices are not allowed in the Federal
   Courthouse in Tacoma unless authorized in advance by a U.S. District
   Court or U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge. An Order Regarding Security
   Restrictions was signed on May 25, 1994. It prohibits cameras, tape
   recorders, computers, or other mechanical or electronic devices, from
   being brought into the courthouse, unless authorized by a judge.
   Weapons, beepers and cellular phones are prohibited at all times. Any
   electronic or mechanical device allowed into the courthouse by a judge
   is subject to inspection on each entry by a U.S. Marshal or Court
   Security Officer.
