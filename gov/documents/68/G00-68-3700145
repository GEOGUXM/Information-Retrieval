   Description:
   The contracts provide reliable, effective, economical computing and
   communications recovery services to the Federal Government, and other
   Government and non-Government organizations that process Federal and/or
   Federally-mandated applications. (Non-Government organizations are
   contractors that operate information technology installations on behalf
   of the Government.) The computing and communications recovery services
   are used to test and refine organizations' contingency plans, and to
   restore and recover operations in the event of a declared disaster.
   Recovery services are provided for several platforms, including, but
   not limited to: (1) mainframe computer systems (IBM and Unisys
   compatible); (2) midrange computer systems (AT&T, Compaq, Data General,
   DEC, Filnet, HP, IBM, NetFRAM, Pyramid, Sequent, Sequoia, Silicon
   Graphics, Stratus, SUN, and Tandem compatible): and (3) microcomputer
   systems (IBM compatible personal computers and local area network [LAN]
   servers). Associated consulting services (e.g., business impact
   analysis and disaster discovery planning) and automated tools (e.g.,
   personal computer based disaster recovery planning software) are also
   provided. Other resources, including, but not limited to, off-site data
   storage and retrieval, data recovery services, mobile recovery
   facilities, overseas recovery facilities, and cleared recovery
   facilities are available. Year 2000 consulting services, and system
   resources for Year 2000 conversion testing, are also available.
   Individual tasks orders will be competed between the three contractors.
   Task order awards will be made based on best value to the Government.
