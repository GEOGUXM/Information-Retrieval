   Mission Objectives:

             The primary purpose of the flight is to deliver and install the
             ISS Airlock. The Joint Airlock is a pressurized flight element
             consisting of two cylindrical chambers attached end-to-end by a
             connecting bulkhead and hatch. Once installed and activated, the
             ISS airlock becomes the primary path for International Space
             Station space walk entry and departure for U.S. spacesuits,
             which are known as Extravehicular Mobility Units, or EMUs. In
             addition, the Joint Airlock is designed to support the Russian
             Orlan spacesuit for EVA activity.

             The Joint Airlock is 20ft long, 13ft in diameter and weighs 6.5
             tons. It was built at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) by
             the Space Station Prime Contractor Boeing. The ISS-airlock has
             two main components: a crew airlock and an equipment airlock for
             storing EVA gear and EVA preflight preps. STS-104 also carries a
             spacelab pallet with four High Pressure Gas Assembly containers
             that will be attached to the exterior of the airlock.

   Launch:

             July 12, 2001 5:04 a.m. EDT. 10 min window. Tanking operations
             were completed at 10:35 p.m. EDT. At 4:55 a.m., the countdown
             clock came out of the T-minus 9 minute hold and entered the
             final count. The Crew Access Arm was retracted at 4:56 a.m. EDT.
             Launch occured at the opening of the launch window.

             On Sunday evening, July 8, the flight crew for mission STS-104
             arrived to begin final preparation for their upcoming launch.
             Space Shuttle Atlantis. Over the weekend, workers completed
             orbiter aft compartment closeouts. Technicians also successfully
             replaced and retested an orbiter mass memory unit and a TV
             monitor on the aft flight deck launch window. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 7/09/2001)

             On Wednesday, June 20, 2001, following a go ahead from Shuttle
             management, KSC workers began rolling Space Shuttle Atlantis out
             of the VAB at about 2:30 a.m. today. When weather officials
             noted the threat of lightning in the vicinity of the Launch
             Complex 39 area, managers returned Atlantis to the VAB as a
             safety precaution. Atlantis has been rescheduled for rollout to
             Launch Pad 39B at about 12:30 a.m. Thursday, June 21. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 6/20/2001)

             On Tuesday, June 19, 2001, Space Shuttle and International Space
             Station managers agreed to proceed with plans to launch Space
             Shuttle Atlantis no earlier than July 12. The official launch
             date will be announced after the Flight Readiness Review
             scheduled for June 28. The Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test
             is scheduled for June 28-29 at KSC. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 6/20/2001)

             On Thursday, May 31, 2001, NASA managers announced that Space
             Shuttle Atlantis will not launch before early July. The
             additional time will enable the International Space Station
             Program time to evaluate a problem with the Station's new robot
             arm. Shuttle and Station managers will reconvene in mid-June to
             assess a new launch date. The Flight Readiness Review has been
             postponed with a new date to be announced. Orbiter Atlantis
             rolled over to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) last night,
             and workers are preparing to mate the orbiter to the external
             tank in VAB high bay 1. Once fully stacked, the Space Shuttle
             will remain in the VAB until a new rollout date is selected.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/31/2001)

             Managers announced a target launch date of no earlier than June
             8 for Atlantis' next flight on mission STS-104. This shift
             accommodates an on orbit sun angle condition between May 18 and
             June 7. This so-called beta angel cut-out is an undesirable
             thermal condition for Shuttle/ISS docking operations. Previous
             launch date was no earlier than February 8, 2001. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 1/25/2001)

             Atlantis was given "a go" for an on time deorbit burn to bring
             to an end missions STS-104.

             The second landing attempt for KSC was waived off and landing is
             now scheduled for 11:39 p.m. Tuesday July 23, 2001.
             At 11:20 pm EDT, a "no go" was given for the first landing
             attempt due to rain showers in the area. The second landing
             attempt is scheduled with a deorbit burn at 1:08 am with a
             touchdown at 2:14 am EDT.
