   Item Description
   Preventing Medi-Cal Provider Fraud The Department of Health Services is
   targeting Medi-Cal provider fraud through extensive anti-fraud efforts,

   re-enrollment project.
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
   HIPAA requires that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
   Services adopt standards for electronic transactions, including data
   elements, standard code sets, unique health identifiers, and security
   standards and safeguards.
   Expansion of Healthy Families Coverage The State of California is
   proposing to expand Healthy Families program coverage to parents of

   federal Health Care Financing Administration.
