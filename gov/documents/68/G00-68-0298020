   Privacy]
          ________________________________________________________

    1. The U.S. Small Business Administration provides this World Wide Web
       (WWW) site as a public service.
    2. For site management, we use software programs to collect and create
       summary statistics on the following information for statistical
       purposes.
        [arrow.gif] the date and time
            [arrow.gif] the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address
            [arrow.gif] the object requested
            [arrow.gif] the address of the web site from which you linked
            to our site
            [arrow.gif] the type of browser you use to access our web
            site, and
            [arrow.gif] the completion status of the request.
    3. This government computer system uses these gathered statistics for
       such purposes as:
        [arrow.gif] assessing what information is of most and least
            interest,
            [arrow.gif] determining technical design specifications, and
            [arrow.gif] identifying system performance or problem areas.
    4. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
       available to all users, this federal government computer system
       employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
       unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise
       cause damage.
    5. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, this web site
       makes no other attempts to identify individual users or their usage
       habits. We use raw data logs for no other purposes and scheduled
       these logs for regular destruction in accordance with National
       Archives and Records Administration General Schedule 20.
    6. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information
       on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under
       the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National
       Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
    7. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting
       our site -
        a. If you visit our site to read or download information, such as
            consumer brochures or press releases:
        [arrow.gif] We collect and store only the following information
            about you: the name of the domain from which you access the
            Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an
            America Online account, or psu.edu if you are connecting from
            Pennsylvania State University's domain); the date and time you
            access our site; and the Internet address of the website from
            which you linked directly to our site.
            [arrow.gif] We use the information we collect to measure the
            number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and
            to help us make our site more useful to visitors.
       b. If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:
        [arrow.gif] You also may decide to send us personally identifying
            information, for example, in an electronic mail message
            containing a complaint or compliment.
            [arrow.gif] We use personally identifying information from
            viewers in various ways to further the usefulness and accuracy
            of the information contained on our Web site or to add new
            sections and services. If you include personally-identifying
            informatioin in your e-mail because you want us to address
            issues specific to your situation, we may use that information
            in responding to your request. In other limited circumstances,
            including requests from Congress or limited other parties, we
            may be required by law to disclose information that you
            submit.
            [arrow.gif] Be aware that despite anything we do to protect
            electronic information, e-mail is not necessarily secure
            against interception. If your communication is very sensitive,
            or includes personal information, you might prefer to send it
            by regular mail instead.
    8. Information Collected from Interactive Forms
        [arrow.gif] On some of our Web pages we may offer interactive
            forms that let you voluntarily submit personal information
            (such as your e-mail address, name, or organization). This
            occurs when you are registering for various conferences,
            workshops, or training sessions offered by SBA, ordering
            publications for SBA Pubs, or submitting comments to various
            web discussion forums. In those cases, all submitted
            information is used only for the express purposes for which it
            is intended and is not made available to any third party.
            However, when you submit a comment to an SBA web discussion
            forum, if you supply your name, e-mail address, or other
            personal information, that information is posted along with
            your comment.
    9. Cookies:
        [arrow.gif] With the exception of the HUBZone Certification Area,
            our Listserver, Chat and Forum Servers (when live only on
            special occasions), submitting an online Foia request,
            SUB-Net, and Business Cards, SBA does not normally use
            cookies.
            [arrow.gif] Cookies are small files that web servers place on
            a user's hard drive. They can serve several functions:
            [arrow.gif] they allow the web site to identify you as a
            previous visitor each time you access a site;
            [arrow.gif] they track what information you view at a site
            (important to commercial sites trying to determine your buying
            preferences);
            [arrow.gif] in the more advanced cases they track your
            movements through many Web sites but not the whole Web;
            [arrow.gif] businesses use them for customer convenience to
            allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them
            all at one time and to garner information about what
            individuals are buying at their sites;
            [arrow.gif] advertisers use them to determine the
            effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into
            consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from many
            Web sites; and
            [arrow.gif] they can be used to help a web site tailor screens
            for each customer's preference.
   10. Links to Other Sites
        [arrow.gif] SBA provides many links to other web sites. When you
            leave any SBA Web site (xxx.sba.gov), you will be going to
            sites that are beyond our control. We try to ensure that links
            that leave our site are clearly labeled, usually with a
            disclaimer and a "Goodbye Message". These other sites may send
            their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal
            information. The privacy policies and procedures described
            here for SBA do not apply to any external links. We encourage
            you to read the privacy policies of any site you link to from
            ours, especially if you share any personal information. Be
            informed. You are the person best qualified to protect your
            own privacy.

   NOTE: We will not obtain personally identifying information about you
       when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such
       information to us.
       If you have any questions or comments about the information
       presented here, please forward them to Web Comments.
