   HOW TO VOTE
   Voting in King County is as easy as 1-2-3
   Where to vote:
   You must vote in your own precinct's polling place. Its location is
   shown on your voter registration card and also will be listed in a
   major newspaper the Friday before election day. You may also vote by
   absentee ballot.

   When to vote:
   The polls are open on election day from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

   Voting by absentee ballot:
   Even if you expect to be in town on election day, you may apply for an
   absentee ballot as early as 45 days prior to any election. Requests may
   be made by mail, telephone or in person at the Elections Office. All
   requests must indicate which election the ballot is for and must
   include your name, registered address, registration number if
   available, and ballot mailing address. Ballots are available in the
   Elections office approximately 20 days before the election through 4:30
   p.m. the Monday before the election. State law prohibits distribution
   on election day.

   For your convenience, you may print the
   absentee ballot request form, fill it out, and mail it to our office.
   You may also request an absentee ballot by phone (206) 296-VOTE (8683)
   or by fax (206) 296-5080.

   You may vote and return your ballot immediately after you receive it.
   To be valid for counting in an election, the returned voted ballot
   envelope must be signed by the voter and postmarked no later than the
   date of the election.

   Ongoing absentee request:
   Any voter may apply in writing or by telephone for status as an ongoing
   absentee voter. Each voter will receive a ballot for every election in
   which they are entitled to vote. Status as an ongoing absentee voter
   shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the following:
     * the cancellation of the voter's registration record
     * the written request of the voter
     * the death or disqualification of the voter
     * the return of an ongoing absentee ballot as undeliverable

   Submarine ballot:
   A "submarine ballot" is a special absentee ballot for voters residing
   or stationed outside of the Continental U.S., who believe they will be
   unable to vote a regular absentee ballot by normal mail delivery. Such
   voters may apply in writing to this office to receive a write-in ballot
   listing major offices and measures. These requests can be accepted
   starting ninety days before a general election. The special absentee
   ballot will be mailed as soon as possible after a request is received.

   If you are hospitalized:
   A voter admitted to a hospital no earlier than five days before an
   election and confined to the hospital on election day may apply in
   writing for an absentee ballot to be delivered by messenger on election
   day if a signed statement from the hospital administrator or designee
   is attached to the absentee application.
