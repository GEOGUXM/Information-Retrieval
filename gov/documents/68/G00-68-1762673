   TASK FORCES

   Task forces are special "teams" of officers who work together in order
   to achieve investigative goals. Our task forces are generally comprised
   of FBI Special Agents who work very closely with our local law
   enforcement partners.

   Gary Response Investigative Team (GRIT)

   Indianapolis Violent Crime/Major Offender Fugitive Task Force

   Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF)

   Gary Response Investigative Team (GRIT)

   In 1997, at the direction of Attorney General Janet Reno, the FBI
   initiated the GRIT Task Force comprised of members of the FBI, the DEA,
   the Gary Police Department, the Indiana State Police, the United States
   Attorney's Office, the Lake County Prosecutor's Office, and the Indiana
   Army National Guard to combat the high crime problem in the city of
   Gary, Indiana.

   In that same year, Congress designated Northwest Indiana a High
   Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) and forwarded a $3 million
   dollar grant to the area.

   GRIT was formed specifically to combat drug trafficking organizations
   and violent crime attributable to gangs in the City of Gary, Indiana,
   and is the first task force of its kind.

   GRIT's Accomplishments:
     * 616 arrests;
     * Over 200 federal convictions;
     * 283 handguns, assault rifles and shotguns seized;
     * Dozens of gang operations disrupted, and numerous operations
       totally dismantled; and,
     * Drop in homicide rates (1997 - 98 homicides; 1998 - 79 homicides;
       1999 - 74 homicides; 2000 - 67 homicides)

   Indianapolis Violent Crime/Major Offender Fugitive Task Force

   To address fugitive matters, the Indianapolis Violent Crime/Major
   Offender Fugitive Task Force was created in 1992. The task force
   consists of investigators from the Indianapolis FBI Office, Indiana
   State Police, Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis
   Police Department. The mission of the task force is to combine the
   resources of federal, state and local law enforcement in order to
   provide a more effective and efficient approach to identifying,
   locating, and apprehending those fugitives wanted for the most serious
   crimes of violence and drug related offenses. As of December 31, 2000,
   the task force has made 1,077 arrests and obtained 102 federal warrants
   for individuals who fled the state of Indiana.

   Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF)

   In an effort to more efficiently investigate acts of domestic and
   international terrorism, the Indianapolis Division initiated a Joint
   Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in 1999. The JTTF brings together other
   federal as well as state and local law enforcement officers into a task
   force environment for the purposes of combating terrorism. These agents
   and officers complement each other by bringing together special skills
   and knowledge about local violations to better target terrorism.
