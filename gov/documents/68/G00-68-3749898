                        UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES (ULPs)

   The Office of the General Counsel (OGC), through the seven Regional
   Offices, investigates, settles, and prosecutes ULP charges.  The Unfair
   Labor Practice Case Handling Manual (ULPCHM) provides comprehensive
   guidance to OGC staff in preventing, resolving, processing and
   investigating ULP charges.  The Litigation Manual provides
   comprehensive guidance to OGC Trial Attorneys in prosecuting those
   cases that the Regional Director has determined have merit.  Summarized
   below are FAQs pertaining to the ULP process with appropriate links to
   the two Manuals (requires Adobe Acrobat Reader) and Regulations and
   Statute.  If the answer to your question is not provided, please check
   the two Manuals on the web site or contact the Regional Office within
   your jurisdiction.

     __________________________________________________________________

   PRE-CHARGE

   Before a charge is filed will the Regional Office provide technical
   assistance?

   Yes.  Each Region is available to provide various types of technical
   assistance such as:
     * General explanation of the rights and obligations under the
       Statute;
     * Explanation of the ULP procedures under the Regulations;
     * Furnishing various forms and reasonable technical assistance
       regarding the completion of the forms, including drafting language
       describing the basis of the charge
     * Providing public written materials as well as helping to locate
       information at the FLRA web site:  http://www.flra.gov/.

   Who may file a charge?

   "Any person may charge an activity, agency or labor organization with
   having engaged in, or engaging in, any unfair labor practice prohibited
   under 5 U.S.C. 7116."  Section 2423.3 of the Regulations.  A person can
   be an individual, labor organization, or agency.  5 U.S.C. 7103.

   If you decide to file a charge, what should you file?

   If you decide to file a ULP charge, you should complete Form 22 if the
   charge is against an Agency, or Form 23 if against a Labor
   Organization.  The back of these forms provides instructions for
   completion.  You should provide a clear statement of the ULP allegation
   which includes specific sections of the Statute allegedly violated.  Be
   as succinct as possible, i.e., longer is not necessarily better.  See
   section 2423.4 of the Regulations.  Make sure to complete the
   certificate of service section of the form by indicating the method of
   service and name, title, location and the date that service is
   completed.  You need only file one copy of the charge.

   Where should you file your charge?

   A charge should be filed with the Regional Director for the Region in
   which the alleged ULP has occurred or is occurring.  If the alleged ULP
   is occurring in more than one Region, you may file a charge in any of
   the Regions where the alleged ULP is occurring.  If you are unsure
   which Region has jurisdiction over the charge, consult the Regional
   Map.

   Are there any time constraints with respect to when a charge must be
   filed?

   Yes.  Normally a charge may not be acted upon if the alleged ULP
   occurred more than six months before the filing of the charge.  5
   U.S.C. 7118(a)(4)(A).  Consult section 7118 of the Statute for
   exceptions to this rule.

   Are there other reasons why you may be prevented from filing a charge?
     * An agreement between a union and an activity, which contains a
       requirement for pre-charge filing, notification, or settlement
       efforts, is enforceable.  Therefore, if your collective bargaining
       agreement contains a pre-charge notification requirement, you must
       follow the terms of that agreement and first notify the agency or
       union before you file a ULP charge.  A pre-charge notification is
       not applicable to individuals who seek to file a charge.
     * Under section 7116(d) of the Statute, a charge may be barred by a
       previously-filed grievance if the alleged ULP arose from the same
       set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the legal theory
       supporting the charge and the grievance are substantially similar.

   Should you attach supporting evidence and documents to the charge?

   No.  A charge is a stand-alone document.  Supporting evidence and
   documents may be submitted to the Regional Office at the same time.
   Once a charge has been filed and has been assigned to a Regional Agent,
   s/he will discuss with you if any additional evidence and documents are
   needed.

   What documents should you prepare or gather to support a charge?

   You should prepare a witness list with a brief description as to what
   each witness will testify to, and include a telephone number for each
   witness.  You should also have available the collective bargaining
   agreement and other relevant supporting documents and be prepared to
   discuss what your underlying interest is in filing the charge -- what
   are you seeking and why.

   Can you file a charge by fax?

   Yes.  However, a charging party assumes responsibility for receipt of
   the charge, including the risk of a fax machine malfunctioning.

   What happens if you file a charge in the wrong Region?

   The Region which has received the charge will fax it to the proper
   Regional Office with jurisdiction over the charge.  Incorrect filing
   may delay the start of any investigation.

   Is it possible for your charge to be transferred to another Region even
   though you filed in the proper Region?

   Yes.  The OGC implements the concept of "parity" which requires, on
   occasion, that a Region transfer cases to other Regions to address
   caseload imbalances among the Regions.  The adjustment in a Region's
   caseload helps the OGC to process cases throughout the country in an
   expeditious fashion.

   Is there a page limitation to the charge?

   No, except fax filings have a two-page limitation.  In any event, you
   are encouraged to be succinct.


   PRE-INVESTIGATION

   After a charge is filed what does the Regional Office look for when it
   reviews the charge?
     * The Region reviews each charge for sufficiency. The charge will be
       deemed deficient and returned to the person who filed it if any of
       the following are present:  (1) There is no signature; (2) the
       charging party or charged party is not identified; (3) there is not
       at least some basis for the charge stated; or (4) the matters in
       each block of the charge are not addressed in some way.
     * If the review does not uncover any deficiencies, the charge is
       docketed and is given a number.
     * The charge is also reviewed to see if any clarification is required
       which necessitates that an amended charge be filed.  For instance,
       if the charging party identifies a local facility as the charged
       party but it appears from reading the charge that the Department
       should have been named as the charged party, it may be necessary to
       obtain an amended charge.  Another example when it may be necessary
       to file an amended charge is if the underlying basis of the charge
       is not clear.  In these circumstances, the charge is docketed and
       the Region will give the charging party 10 days to submit an
       amended charge.  If not submitted within the required time frame,
       the charge will be dismissed.

   When the Region reviews a new charge will it consider whether
   injunctive relief should be sought even if not requested?

   Yes.  The substance of every charge is reviewed to determine whether
   the purposes of the Statute would be frustrated if the status quo
   (existing) is not maintained while the charge is investigated in the
   normal manner.  In those extraordinary circumstances that require that
   the status quo be maintained, the General Counsel may seek approval of
   the Authority's Members to seek appropriate temporary relief in a
   United States District Court.  In this regard, the General Counsel
   first conducts an initial inquiry with the charging party  and also
   determines whether to conduct an expedited investigation.  Then the
   General Counsel determines if the charge has merit, and if so, whether
   to seek approval of the Authority Members to seek a temporary
   injunction.  Even after an investigation begins, a determination may be
   made to seek appropriate temporary relief.  See section 7123(d) of the
   Statute which sets forth the criteria for granting appropriate
   temporary relief and the ULPCHM, Part 2, Chapter E for a discussion of
   the criteria evaluated to determine if injunctive relief should be
   sought.

   Will a Region consider whether the use of Alternative Dispute
   Resolution techniques would help to resolve the underlying basis of the
   charge?

   Yes.  From the outset, and throughout the processing of a ULP charge,
   Regions consider whether the parties would benefit from the use of
   interest-based techniques to resolve the underlying issues.  See
   Alternative Dispute Resolution Services for a description of the
   services offered by the OGC.  Also throughout the processing of a ULP
   charge, the Region will ask the parties to consider settlement options,
   if appropriate.

   THE INVESTIGATION

   What is the purpose of an investigation?

   A Region determines which, among many methods of investigation, best
   achieves the objectives of:  (1) developing all relevant factual
   evidence to assist the Regional Director in making a determination on
   the merits of the charge; and (2) providing fair and consistent
   application of OGC policies and procedures.

   When does the investigatory process begin?

   After the Regional Director sends out an opening letter to the parties
   the case is assigned to an Agent.  The Agent becomes familiar with the
   case file and then contacts both parties' representatives by telephone
   or in writing to begin the investigatory process.

   What should you be prepared to discuss during the initial contact with
   the Regional Office Agent?

   The purpose of this contact is for the Agent to introduce him/herself
   to you and to explain the ULP process.  Among other things, you make be
   asked to:
     * clarify the issues underlying the charge
     * send certain documents to the Region
     * make available certain documents if there is an on-site
       investigation
     * prepare a witness list with a short description of what information
       the witness will provide
     * complete a questionnaire to be returned to the Region
     * provide an assurance or cooperation during the investigation
     * discuss, if appropriate, the possibility of using an Alternative
       Dispute Resolution technique

   What happens during an investigation?

   The Region seeks to determine the factual basis underlying each ULP
   charge.  Depending upon the circumstances of the case, the
   investigation may consist of:
     * taking affidavits and documentary evidence in person
     * taking a sworn affidavit by telephone
     * requesting the completion of sworn interrogatories by mail
     * requesting the completion of unsworn questionnaires by mail
     * confirming, in writing, information a Regional Agent receives
       orally

   What happens if the charging party fails to cooperate during an
   investigation?

   A charging party is required to cooperate with the investigation of a
   charge.  See section 2423.8(b) of the Regulations.  Cooperation
   includes:
     * making charging party wtinesses available to give sworn/affirmed
       testimony
     * producing documentary evidence requested

   If a charging party fails to cooperate, and the charging party's
   representative has been duly cautioned, the charge may be dismissed for
   lack of cooperation.

   How does a charged party cooperate during an investigation?

   Section 2423.8(b) contemplates that a charged party will cooperate with
   an investigation so that the Regional Director will have the best
   evidence to rely upon in making a merits determination.  Among other
   things, a charged party cooperates by:
     * arranging for official time for the interview of employee witnesses
     * submitting a position statement
     * making management witnesses available
     * submitting documents upon request
     * providing background information

   When is an investigation considered complete?

   Every case is different in some way.  However, the same rule applies
   with respect to the investigation of each case:  an investigation is
   considered complete when the record contains sufficient information for
   a Regional Director to render a determination on the merits of the
   charge.  Therefore, if it has been determined that the charge is
   untimely, it is possible that an investigation will be terminated even
   before the taking of any witness statements.  However, there are other
   cases where it is necessary, in order to complete an investigation, to
   arrange an on-site investigation to take witness statements and to
   obtain documentary evidence so that record contains sufficient evidence
   on all of the elements of proof of each allegation of the charge. See
   ULPCHM, ATTACHMENT 2G1 for a list of the elements of common
   violations.  It is important to note, in keeping with the General
   Counsel's neutral posture in each case, that this includes any evidence
   that may refute the allegations.


   POST-INVESTIGATION

   After an investigation has been completed, what happens next?

   Once the investigation has been completed, the Agent makes either an
   oral or written presentation to the Regional Director for his/her
   review.  Among other things, this presentation addresses the following
   matters:  jurisdiction; method of the investigation; the allegations;
   material facts; applicable law; analysis (application of the law to the
   facts in the case); and recommendations for disposition of the
   charge.

   What options does a Regional Director have with respect to making a
   merit determination on the charge?

   Absent settlement, if the charge has merit, the Regional Director will
   issue a complaint and notice of hearing before an Administrative Law
   Judge.

   If the Regional Director determines that the charge does not have
   merit, s/he will issue a dismissal letter, absent withdrawal by the
   charging party.

   It is also possible that the Regional Director may issue a dismissal
   letter with respect to certain allegations and issue complaint with
   respect to one or more of the other allegations.

   Will the Regional Director explain in a dismissal letter the basis for
   making the decision to dismiss the charge?

   Yes.  Each Regional Director's dismissal letter is required to set
   forth the facts; applicable law with case citations for your reference;
   application of the law to the facts in the case; conclusion; and a
   paragraph explaining your appeal rights to the General Counsel.  See
   Appeals FAQs.

   Will you be given an opportunity to withdraw a charge before the
   Regional Director issues a dismissal letter?

   Yes. It is OGC policy to give each charging party an opportunity to
   withdraw the charge before the Regional Director issues a dismissal
   letter.

   Is it possible that the Regional Director will dismiss your charge even
   if it has been determined to have merit?

   A Regional Director may exercise prosecutorial discretion to dismiss a
   meritorious charge if s/he determines that litigation would not advance
   or further the purposes and policies underlying the Statute. If this
   determination is made the dismissal letter will discuss the criteria
   which the Regional Director relied upon to make this decision.  See
   ULPCHM, Part 4, Chapter F for a discussion of Prosecutorial Discretion
   criteria that guides a Regional Director in making this determination.


   POST-ISSUANCE OF ULP COMPLAINT

   What happens after a Regional Director issues a ULP Complaint and
   Notice of Hearing?

   The case is assigned to a Trial Attorney in the Regional Office who
   reviews the case file and begins to prepare the case for a hearing
   before an Administrative Law Judge.  Efforts continue, up until the
   trial date, to obtain a settlement of the case.

   How long after issuance of complaint does a respondent have to file an
   answer?

   A respondent has 20 calendar days after the date of service of a
   complaint to file an answer to each allegation contained in the
   complaint.

   How long after issuance of complaint will the hearing take place?

   Generally, absent settlement, a hearing will be held within two to
   three months after issuance of a complaint.

   After issuance of a complaint and notice of hearing, are attempts still
   made to reach a settlement?

   Yes.  This may occur in many ways.  As always, the parties are
   encouraged to reach a settlement on their own, if possible.  Often,
   though, the Agent's involvement in working with the parties is
   necessary to arrive at a settlement.

   Yet another way in which settlement may be pursued is through the
   Office of Administrative Law Judge's Settlement Judge Program.  Either
   in response to a party's request or on his own discretion, the ALJ may
   assign another ALJ (who will not preside over the hearing) or other
   settlement official to conduct settlement negotiations by telephone or
   in person.  Should settlement efforts prove unsuccessful and a hearing
   occurs, the settlement official is barred from discussing the case with
   the hearing judge.  See section 2423.25(d) of the Regulations.

   What does the Trial Attorney do to prepare for a hearing?

   Among other things, the Trial Attorney does the following things to
   prepare for a trial:
     * reviews the case file to determine what motions, if any, to file.
       For example, if the respondent does not file an answer to a
       complaint, the Trial Attorney will file a motion for summary
       judgment
     * prepares witnesses for trial
     * requests issuance of subpoenas, as necessary

   Are the parties required to engage in pre-hearing disclosure?

   Yes.  To facilitate earlier resolution of cases and to avert "trial by
   ambush," the FLRA promulgated a regulation in 1998 to require parties
   to engage in pre-hearing disclosure.  See section 2423.23 of the
   Regulations.

   What is required under pre-hearing disclosure and when does it occur?

   The parties are required to disclose to the opposing party the
   following:
     * a witness list with a brief description of expected testimony
     * copies of documents to be offered into evidence
     * a brief statement of the theory/ies of the case, including the
       relief sought, and any and all defenses that the charged party
       intends to rely upon to defend the allegations in the complaint.

   Pre-hearing disclosure takes place at least 14 days before the date of
   the hearing.

   Do the parties confer with the Administrative Law Judge before the
   hearing?

   Yes.  At least seven days before the date of the hearing, the parties
   have a pre-hearing conference with the Administrative Law Judge.  All
   parties are required to participate in the conference to:
     * Discuss, narrow, and resolve issues set forth in the complaint and
       answer
     * Address any other pre-hearing matters such as outstanding motions
     * Discuss settlement
     * Agree to stipulations of fact
     * Discuss subpoena requests or motions to revoke

   See section 2423.24(d) of the Regulations.

   Generally, what happens at the trial?

   Generally, the stages of a trial are as follows:
     * The Administrative Law Judge opens the record and makes opening
       remarks
     * The parties appear on the record
     * Preliminary matters are considered (including those not ruled on in
       pre-hearing conference)
     * Parties deliver opening statements
     * The General Counsel presents his/her case which includes
       examination of witnesses and introduction of evidence; and the
       respondent has the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses
     * The respondent presents its case including examination of
       witnesses, introduction of evidence; and the General Counsel has
       the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses
     * Rebuttal evidence is presented by the parties
     * Closing argument is presented (may be optional)
     * The Administrative Law Judge closes the record which includes a
       discussion of the post-hearing briefs

   What role does the charging party's representative have at the hearing?

   The charging party has a right to fully participate in the hearing by:
     * Calling witnesses
     * Presenting evidence
     * Presenting oral argument
     * Receiving documentary evidence presented by respondent
     * Making objections to testimony and documents offered into evidence
     * Submitting a post-hearing brief

   How many trials are held during the year?

   Through the first ten months of FY '00 there have been 31 trials.

   After an Administrative Law Judge issues a decision and recommended
   order, what happens next?

   If a party disagrees with the decision and recommended order exceptions
   may be filed with the Authority within 25 days after the date of
   service of the Judge's decision.  See section 2423.40 of the
   Regulations.
