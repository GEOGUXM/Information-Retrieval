     Marshall Space Flight Center:
     Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) Version 3.0
     The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a general
     purpose computer program for analyzing fluid-flow rate, pressure,
     temperature and concentration in rocket engines, turbo pumps and
     fuel tanks. The program is capable of modeling liquid fuel phase
     changes including compressibility, mixture thermodynamics and the
     effects of external influences, such as gravity and centrifugal
     force.  The development of the GFSSP software eliminates the need to
     develop specific-purpose software.
