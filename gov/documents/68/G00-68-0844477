   INTACT TEAM PERFORMANCE SUPPORT
   Did you know that the NASA Academy of Program and Project Leadership
   (APPL) makes intact team support available to NASA Project Teams that
   ask for help? Whether you need to prepare for an upcoming review, need
   help in getting the right programmatic documents in place, need to gain
   a better understanding of the next critical steps for your project's
   success, or want to build a high performance project team APPL can
   help!

   APPL is extending the learning environment beyond the classroom to
   deliver development support to new and existing project teams. The
   objective of this support is to enhance the project's probability of
   success by delivering the right support to the project team, just in
   time to support the team's needs.

   The Center for Systems Management (CSM) is under contract to help meet
   those needs. CSM is familiar with all NASA project guidelines and
   documents and with the NASA culture and environment. They either have
   or can acquire expertise in all areas related to project management.
   The development consultation can include all aspects of managing a
   project. Support can be provided in areas ranging from team performance
   and effectiveness consultation, to instruction and consultation on the
   establishment of system engineering and project management approaches
   and products. Specific developmental activities can be provided on
   topics such as the construction of work breakdown structures, risk
   management, requirements definition and management, earned value
   management, preparing for your next critical review, etc. with the
   objective of enabling the team to produce the needed project products.

   After arrangements have been made for intact team support, both the
   project and the contractor evaluate the project's development needs.
   The contractor will propose one or more development activities in
   response to these evaluations and will negotiate a mutually agreeable
   task statement with the project and the APPL prior to initiating work.
   Specific project issues discussed with the contractor are considered
   private. The contractor will not share project specific information
   with the APPL unless authorized by the Project Manager being supported.
   The contractor will also sign a non-disclosure for project information
   if requested.

   The development events must be designed to achieve specific goals and
   are to be conducted over a defined period of performance. Recurring
   activities may also be planned for the project team. The development
   activities are geared at enabling the team to produce the high quality
   products that they need now while teaching them both "why" and "how to"
   for application in future undertakings.

   Either the NASA APPL or the Centers can provide the funding for Intact
   Team Performance Support. Because APPL funds are limited, the following
   criteria and questions will be considered prior to APPL agreement to
   fund the development support:

     * Is the program/project recognized (e.g. authorized by an Associate
       Administrator - post selection process)?
     * Is the project part of the primary Roles and Mission for the
       Center? Where is the project in its lifecycle? (earlier development
       is better, but recovery situations are also possible)
     * Is there a high probability of success from the support?
     * Is the project highly visible or a top NASA strategic priority?
     * Is the project team requesting support?
     * Is there management buy-in or support for the intervention?

   Performance Support is also available to help facilitate proposal
   development. However, for proposal support the Center or project must
   invest their own funds, but may negotiate separate task statements
   under the existing contract with APPL to provide that support.

   Project personnel can request Intact Team Performance Support by
   contacting Jo Gunderson at (202) 358-2517 or jgunders@hq.nasa.gov
