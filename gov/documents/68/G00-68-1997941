                       TALENT BANK gets great response

   By Eileen A. Hotho
   CSW Assistant Executive Director
   The Erie County Commission on the Status of Women has seen an
   overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from local women and organizations
   to its TALENT BANK, the nation's first on-line interactive data bank,
   which was launched April 24.
   The TALENT BANK aims to match women who wish to serve on public,
   not-for-profit and for-profit boards with organizations seeking
   talented, qualified women to increase their influence in the affairs of
   their community as the makers of policies and decisions. In 2001, women
   are still far under-represented on the boards that will impact the
   Western New York of the new century.
   To date, nearly 600 women and 90 organizations have registered with the
   TALENT BANK, with new e-mail responses and phone calls coming in daily
   to The Commission. Once an organization is approved, its officials may
   peruse candidate profiles detailing qualifications, areas of interest,
   skills and experience to find a match. Personal information, such as
   name, address and e-mail address are not revealed. Organizations must
   register and be approved by The Commission to access candidate
   profiles. The process is fast and simple and once approved, an
   organization can use the TALENT BANK to learn about candidates who fit
   its specific criteria for skills. The candidate is then notified of
   that board's interest and is invited to contact the organization.
   Clotilde Perez-Bode Dedecker, Executive Director of the CSW, said she
   is thrilled with the response and expects the TALENT BANK to continue
   to generate interest. "It's very exciting to see the numbers changing
   every day and to see so much interest in the website," said Dedecker.
   "We are looking for more women and organizations to join us." Potential
   TALENT BANK members and organizations can visit the website, or contact
   The Commission at 858-8307 for more information.
   The Erie County Commission on the Status of Women, established in 1987
   to remove gender-based inequities for women, works to assure that the
   women of Erie County have full participation on the issues that affect
   their lives. CSW became a department of Erie County government in 1988.
   The Commission is composed of 15 appointed members and is supported by
   additional volunteers at the committee level. To register, click on
   TALENT BANK to fill out the on-line questionnaire.
