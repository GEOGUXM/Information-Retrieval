Overview

   The Mars Global Surveyor Magnetometer/Electron reflectometer
   investigation was implemented without the usual "magnetometer boom"
   often used to separate the sensitive magnetic sensor and spacecraft.
   This separation is important, as it allows for attenuation (as 1/r**3)
   of spacecraft-generated magnetic fields and helps achieve the most
   accurate measurement of the ambient magnetic field. To save valuable
   spacecraft resources (e.g., mass), the fluxgate magnetometer sensors
   were mounted at the very ends of the two solar panels (see
   illustration). These solar panels were specially engineered (Acuña, M.
   H., et al, JGR, in press, 2001) to minimize any stray magnetic fields.
   To fully calibrate the magnetic field observations, we conducted
   in-flight calibration maneuvers to characterize the magnetic field
   produced by the spacecraft. We then used these data to develop a model
   of the spacecraft magnetic field so that this contribution could be
   removed from the data.

   The figures below show some examples and illustrate how well the
   spacecraft field is modeled. This work was completed within six months
   of the February 2000 receipt of calibration data, and fully calibrated
   magnetometer data began to flow into the PDS in August 2000 (please see
   schedule).

   Fully calibrated MGS MAG/ER data are available at the PDS.

   The following diagram shows the different configurations of the solar
   arrays and High Gain Antenna (HGA) during the different phases of the
   mission. Please note that the location of the HGA was fixed during
   cruise and aerobraking. However, the HGA is mobile during the mapping
   phase of the mission.

   The plots provided are intended to give you some insight into the High
   Gain Antenna (HGA) magnetic mapping and the model used to approximate
   the field of the HGA in our data reduction. In this test, the solar
   panels (upon which the magnetic sensors sit) are positioned and held
   fixed, while the High Gain Antenna is articulated about one axis. This
   was done while the spacecraft was in the shadow of Mars to avoid
   confusion with effects related to the power subsystem. The difference
   field (mag #1 - mag #2) reveals a magnetic signature due to the HGA
   movement which we used to estimate the position and magnetic moment of
   the assembly. The light blue line shows the modeled difference field;
   you can judge how well the spacecraft model works by how well the
   difference field is approximated by the light blue line.

   The following plot shows a HGA articulation, the white line is the
   DIFFERENCE between the vector fields measured by the two sensors in
   spacecraft payload coordinates. Subtracting one from the other removes
   (the much larger) variations in the ambient field and allows us to
   isolate movements of the HGA. The blue line shows the corresponding
   DIFFERENCE in the model field at each sensor location for comparison.

   NOTE that the model included a constant adjustment for each test that
   is not reflected in the plots. What you are interested in is not the
   constant offset of the data and the model, but how well the VARIATION
   in the model difference compares with the VARIATION in the data
   difference.

   Why do we allow for a constant offset from one test (HGA articulation)
   to the next? The tests must all be done when the spacecraft is in
   darkness (shadowed by the planet) in order to avoid confusion with the
   dynamic field associated with currents in the power subsystem. The time
   it takes to complete an articulation of the HGA is a large fraction of
   the eclipse period so we can only get one articulation per orbit. In
   the time between test, the static spacecraft field may have changed a
   bit, so we allow for this by allowing a constant (throughout any one
   HGA articulation) offset from eclipse to eclipse.

   The HGA model was derived from these data (differences in vector field
   at each sensor) using a generalized inverse matrix method (Connerney,
   1981). We found that a simple offset dipole model (where offset is with
   reference to the HGA coordinate system) did as good a job in modeling
   the field of the HGA as did a quadrupole or octupole expansion (about
   the same origin) so this is the model we adopt for data reduction.

   The following plot shows the variation in the model HGA field at each
   sensor location for one of the HGA articulation tests conducted in
   early 2000.
