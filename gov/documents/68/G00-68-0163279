                          Plasma Applications Group



     The Plasma Applications Group researches and develops plasma and ion
     beam tools for materials modification and thin film synthesis. We
     have many years of experience in producing metal plasmas by vacuum
     arc discharges (sometimes also called cathodic arc discharges).
     Fully ionized metal plasmas are used in vacuum arc ion sources to
     form energetic metal ion beams (up to several hundred keV). High
     energy ion implantation has been extensively used to modify surface
     properties of materials.

     The plasmas can also be used to deposit thin metal or ceramic films
     such as oxides, nitrides and carbides. For most of our deposition
     work we use magnetic macroparticle filters such as the one shown in
     the picture above.

     A relatively new and emerging technology is Metal Plasma Immersion
     Ion Implantation and Deposition (MePIIID), a hybrid technology
     combining ion implantation and thin film deposition. Films produced
     with this method have interesting properties, and many applications
     have been demonstrated. One  interesting and promising example is
     the well-controlled deposition of highly adherent diamond-like
     carbon films.

     Other research areas include the growth of diamond films by
     microwave plasma-assisted CVD, and nitriding of metals using the
     in-house developed Constricted Plasma Source.

     In 1996, we hosted the International Symposium on Discharges and
     Electrical Insulation in Vacuum.
