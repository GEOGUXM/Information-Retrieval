   NOAA's CoastWatch Program makes environmental satellite data products
   and in-situ data available to Federal, state and local marine
   scientists, coastal resource managers, and the public. Managed by the
   National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS),
   the CoastWatch Program routinely processes satellite data in near
   real-time, which means that images are just a few hours old.

   NOAA CoastWatch consists of two components: Central Operations and
   Regional Nodes. Eight regional nodes and a central office provide for
   the distribution pathway for CoastWatch data products. Central
   Operations, operated within NESDIS, coordinates the processing,
   delivery, quality control and storage of data products. Other NOAA line
   offices participate in the NOAA CoastWatch Program by hosting equipment
   and personnel that make up a CoastWatch Regional Node providing for
   near real-time data distribution and regional scientific expertise to
   the local user community.
