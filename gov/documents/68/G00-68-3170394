  ABSTRACT

   Information on the occurrence and distribution of selected
   organophosphorus pesticides in surface and ground water of the United
   States, 1992-97, is provided in a CD-ROM and summary report prepared by
   the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Pesticide Programs.
   All water-quality data presented were collected and analyzed by the
   USGS as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) and
   National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN). The 11
   organophosphorus pesticides studied are: azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos,
   diazinon, disulfoton, ethoprop, ethyl-parathion (parathion), fonofos,
   malathion, methyl-parathion, phorate, and terbufos.

   The summary of the occurrence and distribution of these 11
   organophosphorus pesticides is included as a 4-page PDF file on the
   CD-ROM or may be viewed on-line.

   The data are presented in a series of 11 ArcView projects and
   supporting geographic and tabular data.

   Note: To view and use the ArcView projects, the user must have the
   software package ArcView 3.1 or higher from ESRI.

   The geographic data are in ArcView shape format. The tabular data are
   in dBase. It is not necessary to have the ESRI ArcView software to use
   the data; both file types may be imported into other software packages.
