      Summary of H.R. 3338, the FY 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations
                               Act Conference Report
          _______________________________________________________________

        WASHINGTON - Calling its passage, a clear indication of Americas
        resolve to defeat terrorism and defend freedom, Congressman David
        Dreier (R-San Dimas), Chairman of the House Rules Committee, voted
        today to approve defense funding and additional funds needed in the
        wake of the September 11th attacks. The Department of Defense
        Appropriations Act Conference Report, H.R. 3338, provides FY02
        funding for defense and intelligence activities, and contains $20
        billion in supplemental spending for homeland security. It also
        includes nearly $5 million for cancer research at the City of Hope
        Beckman Research Institute. H.R. 3338 passed by a strong bipartisan
        vote of 408-6.

        This bill provides the Department of Defense with the resources
        needed to defend America both at home and abroad, said Dreier. With
        $20 billion in additional funding for national defense, homeland
        security and recovery, we have taken the steps necessary to protect
        America and rebuild. H.R.3338 not only strengthens our defenses, it
        also recognizes the important medical research supported by the
        military. Funds included in this bill ensure that the City of Hope
        continues to conduct the groundbreaking cancer research that has
        been responsible for saving so many lives.

        H.R. 3338 provides $317.4 billion in new discretionary spending
        authority for the Department of Defense, an increase of $19.2
        billion over FY01. In addition, the bill directs the use of $20
        billion in supplemental spending initially approved on September
        14th as a component of the $40 billion Antiterrorism Emergency
        Supplemental Spending Bill, H.R. 2888. The bill contains $399.7
        million for increased border and seaport inspections and public
        health and bio-terrorism activities are funded at $2.5 billion.

        Dreier commended Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on
        Defense Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) and Ranking Member John Murtha
        (D-PA) for crafting a bipartisan bill that meets Americas defense
        needs and supports the war on terror. H.R. 3338 is an example of the
        bipartisan commitment the President and this Congress have made to
        waging an effective war on terror and protecting the American
        homeland, said Dreier.
