   Americans With Disabilities Act

      Americans With Disabilities Act THE FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF
      PENNSYLVANIA complies with THE AMERICANS with DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
      which requires that all court services and facilities be as reasonably
      accessible to persons with disabilities as those without disabilities.
      If you have a disability and require reasonable accommodation to file a
      claim, participate in a court proceeding, or use any service provided
      by THE FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, please call the
      appropriate ADA coordinator below. Requests for reasonable
      accommodation must be made at least three business days in advance of
      the court activity or within three business days following notice of
      the court activity, whichever is later. Because some accommodations
      require additional time, as much notice as possible is requested. On
      occasion, the court activity will be postponed until accommodation is
      achieved.
