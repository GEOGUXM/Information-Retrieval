   The U.S. Embassy to Kenya opened in 1964. Through twelve Ambassadors
   since then, the Embassy has enriched the ties between the American and
   Kenyan people and served the needs of Americans in and around this East
   African hub. Chief among the U.S. Mission's goals are fostering the
   development of a sound Kenyan economy, strengthening the institutions
   of Kenyan democracy, helping to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, and
   promoting U.S./Kenyan business ties. Double click for bio-data
