                     red ball Research Using CHTN Tissue

   PURPOSE

   The Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) is supported by the
   National Cancer Institute to provide biomedical researchers with access
   to human tissues. Six member institutions coordinate the collection and
   distribution of tissues across the US and Canada in six regional
   divisions. The CHTN specializes in the prospective procurement,
   preservation and distribution of human tissues for research. In
   addition to normal, benign and malignant tissues, tissues from patients
   with specific diseases such as ulcerative colitis, a premalignant
   state, are provided. Trained personnel coordinate the retrieval,
   preservation and delivery of specimens obtained from surgical
   resections and from autopsies.

   RESEARCH USING CHTN TISSUE

   Since its establishment in 1987, the CHTN has provided more than
   200,000 high quality specimens from a wide variety of organ sites to
   over a thousand investigators. Human tissues provided to investigators
   by the institutions involved in the CHTN have been utilized in a wide
   variety of research projects. Publications have ranged from reporting
   mutations of protooncogenes in human tumors using mRNA to a wide range
   of other studies in the following areas: growth factors, isoenzymes,
   development of monoclonal antibodies and cell lines, studies of
   subcellular organelles, gene isolation/gene deletion, flow cytometry,
   and DNA hybridization.

   Requirements for collection, storage and distribution vary depending on
   the type of research and type of tissue. Some studies of mRNA and
   labile proteins should be conducted on tissues from surgical resection
   which are fresh or are snap-frozen and stored at ultra-low
   temperatures. Other studies of more stable biological molecules can
   easily be investigated using tissues obtained from autopsy; these
   tissues can also be used in a wide range of studies including the
   establishment of viable tissue cultures and cell lines. The CHTN
   encourages all investigators to consider the necessary tissue
   requirements for their individual research projects. Such information
   provides investigators with the broadest possible number and range of
   research specimens.
