   Half of all automobile accidents are caused by drunken drivers. The
   lives of countless innocent victims are taken each year. Even with
   tougher laws nationwide as a deterrent, many individuals still get
   behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol. How can we keep
   ourselves and our loved ones safe? Driving defensively is a good
   strategy.

Watch Out for Drivers Who:

     * drive too fast or too slow
     * swerve or drive too close to the center line or the shoulder
     * approach a signal or stop sign too fast or too slow
     * drive with their windows open in cold or rainy weather
     * ignore traffic signals
     * ignore other drivers
     * make jerky starts and stop quickly
     * overshoot signals or stop signs
     * follow other cars too closely
     * speed erratically
     * pass other cars too quickly or too slowly
     * make frequent lane changes
     * drive without lights on after sundown
     * are partying with their passengers

What Should You Do?

     * If you come across drivers displaying any of these traits, get away
       from them.
     * If the car is in front of you, slow down and let it get farther
       away. Don't try to pass; it may swerve into you.
     * If the car is behind you on the freeway, speedup enough to put
       distance between you, or take the next exit. On surface streets,
       turn at the next right turn.
     * If the driver is coming toward you from the opposite direction,
       slow down and move off the road if necessary.
     * When you come to intersections, don't assume that the driver of the
       car coming towards you is sober and paying attention. Be cautious
       before you cross, making sure that the other car has come to a
       complete stop, especially after a light change. Your right-of-way
       will not always protect you.
     * Any time you see a driver obviously under the influence and you can
       safely get the license plate number, immediately report it to the
       nearest law enforcement agency.

        Approximately three in every 10 people will be involved in an
             alcohol-related crash at some time in their lives.
                      Be prepared and take precautions.
