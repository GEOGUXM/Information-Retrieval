   These are Tools which I find useful in day-to-day R&D tasks. Basically
   I am converting my Microscopy & Microanalysis software library into a
   platform independent code - namely Java so that I can use the code
   where ever I am working.

   Since I'm employing Java, this means that anyone with a modern WWW
   browser can also run the code, hence I am also making their access
   freely available to anyone interested through this WWW Site.

   Nothing on this site is in a final form and the programs are
   continuously evolving, and being "debugged". The version number of each
   program incorporates the date of the last update in case your
   interested. Updates will happen as I get to them, but since the
   programs run as java applet's these updates are immediately available
   to everyone using the code. I would appreciate reports of problems
   and/or errors (Email) and of course comments on making things better
   and/or more generally useful.

   Remember, you must be running a Java Aware Browser like NetScape 4.0 to
   use these programs.
