                         Custom Tools and Documents

   Custom tools and documents are those developed by different sites as
   part of their daily operations, and that have applicability outside of
   their developing organizations. Custom tools and documents are expected
   to be not as polished or well documented as the DOE-developed tools,
   but having access to them will give another site a large head start in
   developing a similar capability of their own. DOE sites who have or are
   developing information security tools and documents are encouraged to
   make those materials available for inclusion on the server.

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] SCRUB 1.3 - UNIX Disk Sanitization Tool ( 10/25/2001
          )
          - This disk sanitization tool was developed by Jim Garlick at
          the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The SCRUB utility is
          a program for sanitizing UNIX files or disk drives. It has been
          tested on Linux, Solaris, and AIX. The utility can overwrite a
          single file, all unused space on a disk, or a whole disk drive
          with six different patterns to make it highly unlikely that
          anyone could retrieve the original data from the disk. Scrub is
          available as an archive of the source code (scrub-1.3.tgz) and
          as Linux rpm files of the source code (scrub-1.3-1.src.rpm) and
          the executable (scrub-1.3-1.i386.rpm).

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] Random Password Generator ( 5/27/1997 )
          - This password generator was developed at Westinghouse Savannah
          River Company and was presented at the 1997 DOE Information
          Security Training Conference by Wendall Mayson. This utility
          creates reasonable, random passwords in a user-friendly way that
          satisfy the DOE Order requirements. The utility is written in
          Visual Basic and runs on Windows computers.

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] Windows NT Security Advisor (v. 1.3) ( 5/27/1998 )
          This document was developed at the Lawrence Livermore National
          Laboratory by Jim Rothfuss of the computer security department.
          The document describes all the settings that must be made in
          Windows NT 4 to have a secure system. The settings are in a
          checklist format.

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] Windows NT Security Guidelines: ( 6/4/1998 )
          Study by Trusted Systems for NSA Research

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] Security for a Public Website ( 4/26/2000 )
          Study by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon
          University for the DoD SEI Joint Program Office.

   [CSTCBlueBall.gif] doesecwar Macintosh Login Banner ( 7/26/1999 )
          A login banner program for the Macintosh computer. Created by
          Dave Moore of NAWCWD, China Lake (Navy). The program displays a
          dialog box at system startup displaying the DOE warning banner
          and two buttons. If you press I Accept, the system starts up
          normally. If you press I Decline, the system shuts down.
