   Preface
   It has been two years since the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)
   reorganization and the establishment of the Information Systems Center
   (ISC) within the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD).
   It has been a busy, and at times, somewhat chaotic two years, as we've
   worked to implement a new organization - while still fulfilling our
   project and functional obligations. This period has been a highly
   successful one for ISC. Not only have we launched a new organization
   and established an exciting course to the future, we have also
   contributed substantially over a broad range of GSFC missions and
   technologies.
   With our formative years behind us, I see "YR 2K" as one of building on
   what is currently working well and aggressively fixing areas that need
   improvement. For example, improving communication and dissemination of
   information down, up, and across ISC is a target objective.
   This report provides some highlights from 1999, the ISC branch
   structure, summary of awards, technical papers, key academic
   collaborators, support contractors and some key points of contact
   within ISC. It is intended to give the reader an insider's view of the
   organization.
   I'm looking forward to working with ISC employees and customers in the
   new century. The upcoming GSFC missions are exciting with many project
   management and engineering challenges. ISC is made up of exceptionally
   committed and talented professionals, and the ISC Management Team will
   be looking for more opportunities this year to listen to your ideas,
   concerns and recommendations about better ways of achieving our
   customer's needs and mission goals.
   But no need to wait for an occasion! Got an idea? Suggestion? Contact
   any of us on the ISC Management Team and share your thoughts. We'd love
   it!

   ISC Mission Statement
   To provide high value information systems products, services and
   expertise, and to advance information technologies, which are aligned
   with customer needs.
   The ISC is an innovative center of expertise in the formulation and
   implementation of information systems in support of National
   Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) programs and projects,
   specifically the GSFC Earth Sciences, Space Sciences, and Technology
   focus area. The ISC collaborates with the science community and other
   customers to meet their information systems and technology needs
   through the design, implementation, and integration of information
   systems and data system components. The ISC provides technology,
   capability and products in design, development, implementation, test,
   integration and operations. Additionally, the ISC provides leadership
   and vision in identifying and sponsoring new and emerging information
   systems technologies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Strategy Objectives
   The ISC has five primary strategy objectives:
     * Deliver high value products and services that satisfy customer
       needs
     * Advance leading edge information systems technology
     * Build a diverse, talented, innovative, energized, internationally
       recognized workforce of employees and managers
     * Establish open, flexible, collaborative relationships with

   from anywhere in order to optimize an onboard observation and maximize
   science return.

   Advanced Scientific Analysis Tools and Data Systems

     Enabling science knowledge discovery through seamless and transparent
   access to information Rapid

   VISION: Academic and research community has continuous and transparent
   access to data and information for scientific research.

   Collaborations with Universities and Research Laboratories
   It is critical for an advanced information systems group to be able to
   efficiently infuse new approaches and software components into
   operational systems and to stay abreast of current world-wide research
   activities. An effective method to fulfill this information requirement
   is to develop relationships and collaborative activities with other
   Centers, government laboratories and universities. The following list
   highlights the active research projects and university collaborations
   during the past year:
