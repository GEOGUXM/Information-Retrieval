   INTERLIBRARY LOAN
       Primary Clients Only

   Before submitting a request, please check the Parklawn Health Library
   System's (PHLS) online catalog. If the library does not own the
   material, you will need to submit an interlibrary loan request.

   Journal Article: Journals NOT OWNED by the PHLS will be borrowed from
   other institutions for our
   primary clients only. Interlibrary loan requests are accepted from our
   primary clients via fax, phone, in-person or electronically.

   Book/Technical Report: Books/Technical Reports NOT OWNED by the PHLS
   will be borrowed from other institutions for our
   primary clients only, with the exception of those located in HHS
   Regional Offices. HHS Regional Office staff should contact their local
   library. Interlibrary loan requests are accepted from our primary
   clients via fax, phone, in-person or electronically.

   Delivery Time
   Usual delivery time is one to two weeks from the date the request was
   ordered. However, some requests may take as long as a month. A few may
   never become available for borrowing. In this case, the library will
   inform you of its inability to fill the request. Please allow adequate
   time when making requests.
   Renewal and Returning Material
   Photocopies of journal articles are yours to keep. For books and other
   formats, most lending institutions will set a loan period of two to
   four weeks from the date on which the material is received in our
   library. If you must ask for a renewal, please notify the ILL office at
   least two days before the due date listed in your book. Please bear in
   mind that it is the lending institution's decision to renew, and not
   all renewal requests are honored. Failure to return materials on time
   jeopardizes our ability to provide this service. As the borrower, you
   are responsible for any loss or damage to ILL materials while they are
   in your possession. Please ensure your materials are returned on time.
   You may drop the books in the bookdrop at the Circulation Desk or hand
   them directly to the library staff.
