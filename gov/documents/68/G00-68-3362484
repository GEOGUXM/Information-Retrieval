   The following legal opinion summaries are provided for informational
   purposes only. Each opinion is based on the specific facts presented to
   FCA's Office of General Counsel (OGC). Different facts may result in a
   different determination. Additionally, each opinion is based on
   then-current statutes and FCA regulations. Legislative or regulatory
   amendments subsequent to any particular opinion may also result in OGC
   reaching a different determination.
