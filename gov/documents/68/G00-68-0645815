   Denver Water building new water system

   What, you may ask, was wrong with the old one? Nothing really. We're
   keeping it, too, because it still delivers the highest quality drinking
   water to our million customers.  The new system will be to provide
   a new kind of water for irrigation and industrial uses.  It's called
   recycled water and it will extend Denver's water supply years into the
   future... more

                                DENVER WATER
                     TAKES STEPS TO PROTECT WATER SUPPLY

   Immediately following the September 11th attack on the World Trade
   Center towers and the Pentagon, Denver Water moved to tighten security
   at all its facilities.  Denver Water operates several dams and
   reservoirs where water is stored for the city's water supply along with
   three water treatment and numerous other facilities.  While all such
   facilities are routinely monitored by electronic surveillance and
   critical facilities are staffed around the clock, additional safety
   procedures were put into place at once.  All Denver Water personnel are
   on heightened alert.  There have been no threats against the city's
   water supply, and Denver Water is not discussing what security measures
   it has taken.
