   Current Functions

   The State Education Department is responsible for general supervision
   of all educational institutions in the State, for operating certain
   educational and cultural institutions, and for certifying teachers and
   certifying or licensing practitioners of thirty-eight professions. The
   department's supervisory activities include chartering all educational
   institutions in the State, including schools, libraries, and historical
   societies; developing and approving school curricula; accrediting
   college and university programs; allocating State and federal financial
   aid to schools; and providing and coordinating vocational
   rehabilitation services.

   In addition, the commissioner exercises a quasi-judicial authority to
   review, upon appeal, the actions of any local school official or board.
   The department operates the New York State School for the Blind at
   Batavia and the New York State School for the Deaf at Rome. The Office
   of Cultural Education includes the State Museum and Science Service,
   State Library, State Archives and Records Administration and the Public
   Broadcasting Program, which maintain scientific and cultural research
   collections and provide services to State government and the public.

   Organizational History

   New York State's education system has antecedents in both English and
   Dutch colonial education. The Dutch, concerned with providing
   widespread general education, established tax-supported common schools
   under church and state control in most of New Netherland's communities.
   Under the English, who established a system of private or
   church-supported academies, emphasis was placed on advanced education
   of the elite, and the common school system of the Dutch all but
   disappeared.

   In 1754 the first college in the colony, King's College,was founded in
   New York City under a royal charter and was ruled by aboard of
   governors designated by the colonial government. In 1784 (Chapter 51)
   the legislature enacted the first University of the State of New York
   to act as governing body of King's College, which was renamed Columbia
   College. This board was also authorized to found and endow additional
   colleges in the State. This act designated the governor, lieutenant
   governor, president of the senate, speaker of the assembly, mayors of
   Albany and New York, attorney general, secretary of state, and
   twenty-four other persons as the Board of Regents.

   Three years later (Laws of 1787, Chapter 82) board membership was
   changed to the governor, lieutenant governor, and nineteen members
   appointed by the legislature, and the functions of the Board were
   significantly altered. Relieved of direct operating responsibility for
   Columbia College, the board was authorized to charter new colleges and
   to exercise general supervision over Columbia and any new colleges. At
   the same time the board was charged with supervision of all academies,
   authorized to charter new ones, and empowered to make monetary grants
   to colleges and academies.

   During its first year of operation the reorganized Board of Regents
   recommended State support for public schools. However, no action was
   taken until 1795 (Chapter 75), when the legislature appropriated
   $100,000 a year for each of the next five years to encourage the
   establishment of common schools under the supervision of town
   commissioners.Further action to encourage public education was taken in
   1805(Chapter 66) when the comptroller was authorized to sell certain
   Statelands and use the proceeds to establish a "permanent fund for the
   support of public schools."

   In 1812 (Chapter 242), the Common School Act provided the basis for a
   statewide system of public elementary schools. The act created a
   superintendent of common schools, appointed by the Council of
   Appointment, to "prepare plans for the improvement and management of
   the common school fund, and for the better organization of common
   schools." The office of superintendent was abolished in 1821 (Chapter
   240) and its duties transferred to the secretary of state, who served
   ex officio as superintendent of common schools. The following year
   (Chapter 256) the ex officio superintendent was given the authority to
   hear and decide appeals from the decisions of local school officials
   and boards.

   The Department of Public Instruction

   In 1854 (Chapter 97) the superintendent's responsibilities were
   transferred to a newly created Department of Public Instruction under a
   superintendent of public instruction who was elected by the legislature
   and also served as an ex officio regent. This department exercised
   steadily increasing advisory and supervisory powers over public
   elementary schools and teacher-training programs while the Board of
   Regents continued general control of colleges and universities and
   private academies.

   Meanwhile, the Union Free School Act of 1853 (Chapter 433) permitted
   common school districts to consolidate for the purpose of organizing
   tax-supported public schools. These union free school districts could
   include "academical departments" for secondary-level instruction. The
   superintendent of public instruction supervised these new union free
   schools, but there was overlap with the authority of the Regents
   because the 1853 law provided that all "academical departments"
   established in union free schools were subject to the supervision of
   the Board of Regents.

   The State's educational system, which had expanded rapidly in the
   second half of the nineteenth century, was given a constitutional
   foundation in 1894. Article IX of the new constitution stipulated that
   "the Legislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a
   system of free common schools, wherein all of the children of this
   state may be educated," and it also provided for the continuation of
   the Board of Regents of The University of the State of New York, with
   powers to be defined by the legislature.

   Formation of the State Education Department

   Dual administrative responsibility for education continued until
   enactment of the so-called Unification Act of 1904 (Chapter 40). This
   law abolished the Department of Public Instruction and created the
   State Education Department, headed by a commissioner who was also the
   chief executive officer of the Board of Regents. The first commissioner
   was elected by the legislature for a six-year term, and thereafter the
   commissioner was selected by the Board of Regents.

   Although the language of the Unification Act left some doubt as to the
   relationship between the Board of Regents and the commissioner, actual
   practice followed the intent of the law to establish the Board of
   Regents as a policy-making body and the commissioner as chief
   administrative officer. The State Education Department was continued
   after the State government reorganization of 1925-26.

   A constitutional amendment in 1925 clarified the role of the
   commissioner as chief administrative officer of the department serving
   at the pleasure of the Board of Regents. During the nineteenth and
   early twentieth centuries the Board of Regents was given responsibility
   for several cultural and scientific activities. In 1844 (Chapter 255)
   the New York State Library, created in 1818 (Chapter 276), was placed
   under control of the Regents, and in 1889 (Chapter 529) the Regents
   were empowered to charter local libraries and museums.

   The scientific collections of the New York State Geological and Natural
   History Survey, established in 1836 (Chapter 142), were placed under
   the Regents in 1845 (Chapter 179) and known as the State Cabinet of
   Natural History. Several later laws added or removed the work of
   various State scientists to the purview of the Regents until the
   Unification Act of 1904 finally brought them altogether in the New York
   State Museum under the Regents.

   The state historian, whose position was first created in 1895 (Chapter
   393) as a gubernatorial appointee in the Executive Department charged
   with publishing public records, was placed in the Education Department
   in1911 (Chapter 380). At the same time, the department was given
   responsibility for supervising the condition of public records in local
   government offices. In 1971 (Chapter 869) a State Archives was created
   in the department as the official repository for historically valuable
   State government records and to continue the State's responsibilities
   relating to local government records. The State's records management
   program was transferred to the Education Department from the Office of
   General Services in 1987 (Chapter 42), and combined with the archives
   to form the State Archives and Records Administration.

   The Professions

   Beginning with the Medical Board in 1872, a number of newly created and
   existing professional examining boards were placed under the
   supervision of the Board of Regents.

   These boards now issue licenses or certificates and discipline
   practitioners in the following professions: architecture, certified
   shorthand reporting, chiropractics, dentistry, engineering, land
   surveying, landscape architecture, massage, medicine, nursing,
   occupational therapy, ophthalmic dispensing, optometry, pharmacy,
   physical therapy, podiatry, psychology, public accountancy, social
   work, speech-language pathology and audiology, and veterinary medicine.

   Summary

   The State Education Department is governed by a Board of Regents
   consisting of sixteen members elected by the legislature. The board is
   also head of The University of the State of New York (different from
   the State University of New York, which is the public university system
   of the State) consisting of all public and private schools, colleges
   and universities, and chartered libraries, museums, historical
   societies, and other educational institutions in the State. The
   department's chief executive officer is the commissioner of education
   and president of the university, who is appointed by the Board of
   Regents.
