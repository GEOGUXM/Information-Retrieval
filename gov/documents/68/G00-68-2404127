   Source:  Marina Nechaeva, BISNIS Representative in the Samara Region

   January 2002


   Geographical Position
   The Ulyanovsk Region is located in the central part of European Russia.
   It is a part of the Middle Volga Valley. It occupies a territory of
   37,300 sq. km. The population is 1,488,300 people. The Ulyanovsk Region
   has 21 administrative areas (rayons) and six cities. The administrative
   center is Ulyanovsk with a population of around 700,000 residents. It
   is located 441 miles east of Moscow. The largest cities are Ulyanovsk
   and Dimitrovgrad (134,000 inhabitants). Approximately 73 percent of
   residents are Russians, 11.4 percent are Tatars, 8.3 percent are
   Chuvash, and 4.4 percent are Mordva. The prevalent religions are
   Orthodox Christianity and Islam.
   Political Status and Branches of Power
   The Ulyanovsk Region is a territory under the jurisdiction of the
   Russian Federation. The Head of the Ulyanovsk Region is the Governor
   and the regional legislative body is the Legislative Assembly. The
   Ulyanovsk Regional Administration represents the executive branch of
   power.
   Natural Resources, Oil and Gas
   One of the most important assets is the forests of the region. They
   cover 946,200 hectares of land, 343,000 hectares of which are
   coniferous trees.

   Eighty-two oil fields have been discovered in the Ulyanovsk Region with
   overall reserves of 35 million tons. Twenty-four oil fields are
   currently under development. The regional territory is transversed by
   the oil pipeline Druzhba and a gas pipeline from Buguruslan.
   Throughout 2000 Ulyanovskneft Oil Company extracted 286,000 tons of
   oil, which exceeded last year's figures by 20 percent. The plant is
   based in Novospassky district and provides a lion's share of budgetary
   revenues. The Slavneft Oil Company is expected to become the Ulyanovsk
   region's strategic investor. In 2001 alone the company is ready to
   offer US$32m worth of direct investment, or almost half of the region's
   2000 budget. In addition, the oil company contemplates repaying the
   Ulyanovsk region's debt to its creditors, which roughly accounts for
   US$25m.

   The region also has substantial deposits of quartz, diatomite, peat
   (12.5 million tons), chalk, marlstone, and clay. It also has
   considerable spring water resources.
   Industry
   In 2000 the Ulyanovsk region's total corporate output amounted to
   US$2.04b worth of products. Production growth was reported in machine
   building, metal working, fuel, lumber, printing and publishing, and
   light industries. Large industrial companies employ over 200,000
   workers. The most important industrial centers within the region are
   the cities of Ulyanovsk and Dimitrovgrad.


   The key regional industry sectors are aircraft-building, the automotive
   industry, electronic engineering and textiles.  The machine-building
   sector accounts for 56 percent of the regional industrial output.


   The automotive industry is represented by AvtoUAZ automobile company
   which specializes in UAZ cross country vehicles, small trucks and
   mini-buses. The board of directors of the UAZ Automotive Plant reported
   that in 2000 UAZ manufactured 84,872 automobiles, a rise of 4,6
   percent. Dispite the increase, the company still sufferred losses.  At
   present, Russia's Ministry of Defense is testing the Bars military
   vehicle produced by the Ulyanovsk Automotive Plant. It has military
   capabilities and can handle the same length of track as Ural and
   GAZ-66.  The Bars is still expected to be purchased by Russia's Armed
   Forces.

   The aircraft industry is represented by Aviastar Aircraft Building
   Plant. It manufactures freight and passenger air planes AN-124 and
   TU-204. The plant's administration has announced that its An-124-100 C
   Ruslan freighter has been certified by the Intergovernmental Aviation
   Committee to extend its service life to 24,000 from 6,000 hours before
   overhaul. The An-124 was previously   a military aircraft. The plane
   now is being used commercially. Also, Aviastar  will cooperate with the
   Togliatti-head-quartered AvtoVAZ Automotive Plant (Samara Region).
   Aviastar will make 30 different components for VAZ automobiles.
   Together with Atlantsyuz Air Company,  Aviastar has signed a leasing
   agreement on the production of TU-204 aircraft. The company is to
   receive four planes.

   Other economic sectors include light industry, the food-processing
   industry, construction, and wood production/wood-working.  Two leading
   food-processing companies are the confectionery factory VOLZHANKA and
   the beer brewery VITYAZ.

   The Ulyanovsk Region is also a large Russian supplier of fabrics,
   knitwear and clothing.
   There is a Research Institute of Nuclear Reactors in the Ulyanovsk
   region which is located in Dimitrovgrad.
   Agribusiness
   Agricultural land with fertile black earth amounts to 3.7 million
   hectares or 59 percent of the whole territory. The Ulyanovsk region
   specializes in producing grains (largely wheat), fodder, sugar beets,
   and sunflowers, as well as dairy and beef cattle breeding. The annual
   yield of grains averages 1.5 million tons. In addition, such crops as
   buckwheat, barley, oats, and green peas are cultivated throughout the
   area. In 2000 the agricultural sector generated US$132.1m worth of
   products. However this sector was characterized by the decline of main
   indicators. Meat, milk and egg production went down 5-10 percent. In
   addition, a considerable decrease was reported in cattle- breeding.
   Transportation
   The Ulyanovsk Region is connected to other Russian areas by road, rail,
   river and air. Its Railroad system totals 729 km. The most significant
   rail lines run from Ryazhsk to Orenburg, from Ryazan to Ufa, from
   Ulyanovsk to Samara, and from Inza to Syzran.
   The Ulyanovsk Region is crossed by the Volga river. It is navigable for
   passenger and freight vessels in spring and summer. The largest river
   ports are Ulyanovsk and Sengiley.
   The network of roads equals 7,840 km., including three federal
   highways: Ulyanovsk - Saratov, Ulyanovsk - Samara, and Ulyanovsk -
   Cheboksary. The Ulyanovsk Region occupies the 33rd place in Russia in
   terms of the density of roads.


   The Ulyanovsk Region has two airports for domestic flights. However,
   flights to many Russian areas and CIS countries have been reduced in
   the past few years as a result of the difficult financial situation of
   many regional Russian air carriers, as well as an overall decline in
   the number of passengers.
   Travel from Moscow
   There is one direct and three transit trains from Moscow to Ulyanovsk.
   They depart from the Kazansky Train Station in Moscow daily. Trains
   cover the distance of 873 kms within 16 hours.   One direct daily air
   flight is outbound from Moscow (Vnukovo Airport) to Ulyanovsk with a
   flying time of 1 hour and 25 minutes.
   Telecommunications
   Local telecommunication providers offer ground line telephone service,
   and cellular, paging and Internet/e-mail services. The largest
   telecommunications operator is ELEKTROSVYAZ.
   Foreign Trade & Investments
   Currently, the region exports 5 percent of its overall industrial
   output. The most exportable products are automobiles and machinery. The
   most important foreign trade partners are from Great Britain, Germany,
   Turkey, the USA, and the Netherlands.

   Over 70 joint ventures are operating in the Ulyanovsk Region, the
   majority of which are located in Ulyanovsk. Sixty percent of joint
   ventures have foreign partners, including those from the USA, Germany,
   Great Britain and others.


   One Joint Venture has reached its conclusion.  The CEO of the
   Ulyanovsk- based Volga- Dnepr Air Company, Aleksei Saikin, has
   announced the liquidation of the Heavy Lift- Volga- Dnepr Ltd. joint
   venture established ten years ago with Britain's Heavy Lift. The joint
   venture was created with the primary goal of promoting the Russian
   An-24-00 Ruslan aircraft in international cargo transportation markets.
   The British partner provided its marketing know-how. The objective has
   been fully reached, and from now on Volga- Dnepr intends to operate
   internationally on its own, although the company is determined to
   further cooperate with Heavy Lift in marketing. Some time ago the
   Ulyanovsk- based air carrier established two subsidiaries in Great
   Britain and the United States.


   Canada's International Development Agency has visited the Ulyanovsk
   region. The visit is aimed at supervising the implementation of
   Russian- Canadian joint projects. The Ulyanovsk region is carrying out
   two projects, specifically the creation of a social- business center
   and an innovation center for clothing producers.
   Hotel Accommodations
   Four hotels are available for travelers in Ulyanovsk. None are
   certified internationally or managed by a Western company. U.S.
   business people, however, are recommended to stay at the Oktyabrskaya
   hotel which is located in the central part of the city in the
   neighborhood of the governmental buildings. The hotel has a restaurant
   and a bar. Domestic and international calls are made through a
   telephone operator.
