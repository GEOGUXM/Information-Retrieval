METEOROLOGICAL ROCKETSONDE SYSTEMS

    Small rocketsondes used to measure the atmosphere to altitudes of
    approximately 90 km are manufactured in the United States and have been
    launched to obtain meteorological measurements since the late 1950's.
    Launchings take place from the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administrations (NASA) Wallops Island Facility, and other locations required
    by the specific mission. These systems are simple in their design and can be
    launched in weather conditions in which other rocketsonde system would have
    trouble. The rocketsonde systems used almost exclusively by NASA for
    meteorological measurements are the Super Loki Datasonde® and Super Loki
    Sphere. A slightly larger and higher performing rocket motor, called the
    Viper 3a, is now used at Wallops Island and at other launch sites outside of
    the US.

   Super Loki Inflatable Falling Sphere (PWN-12a)

    The Super Loki rocket motor is capable of propelling instrumented darts to
    altitudes from approximately 65 km (PWN-10D) to 80 km (PWN-11D), and the
    inflatable sphere payload (PWN-12A) to 115 km. altitude. The motor consists
    of an aluminum case with an internal-burning solid propellant. The forward
    closure is designed to accept any of the above dart payloads using special
    interstage adapters. The propellant is polysulfide polymer with an oxidizer
    of ammonium perchlorate. The Super Loki motor weights 23 kg and burns for
    approximately two seconds.

    The falling sphere dart is a 4.1 cm. diameter, 70 cm. withg an ogive and
    tail assembly containing an explosive charge that ejects the sphere payload
    near apogee. The sphere dart reaches an apogee of approximately 115 km where
    a 1-meter diameter metalized mylar sphere is ejected. The sphere is inflated
    at ejection to a super pressure of 12 hPa by the vaporization of
    cis-C-butane. It is important to track the sphere using a high-precision
    tracking radar. Data reduction depends on the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the
    radar position over time. Thus, a poor quality radar introduces too much
    noise and error which seriously affects data quality. The sphere collapses
    when its internal pressure approaches the external ambient pressure.

   Viper Inflatable Falling Sphere (VIPER-12a)

    The Viper 3a is a slightly larger version of the Super Loki motor and has a
    higher performance and weighs about 36 kg and burns for slightly longer than
    two seconds. The Viper 3a currently is used to boost the falling sphere dart
    to apogee.

    The falling sphere dart is a 4.1 cm. diameter, 70 cm. withg an ogive and
    tail assembly containing an explosive charge that ejects the sphere payload
    near apogee. The sphere dart reaches an apogee of approximately 115 km where
    a 1-meter diameter metalized mylar sphere is ejected. The sphere is inflated
    at ejection to a super pressure of 12 hPa by the vaporization of
    cis-C-butane. It is important to track the sphere using a high-precision
    tracking radar. Data reduction depends on the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the
    radar position over time. Thus, a poor quality radar introduces too much
    noise and error which seriously affects data quality. The sphere collapses
    when its internal pressure approaches the external ambient pressure.

   Super Loki Datasonde® (PWN-11D)

    The PWN-11D Datasonde(TM) dart is similar in dimension to the sphere dart
    and carries a meteorological temperature sensor (~0.012-mil diameter
    aluminized bead thermistor) and a small telemetry transmitter operating on
    1680 MHZ. The package is ejected at the apogee of the dart (~80 km from a
    sea-level launch) by a time-delayed pyrotechnic expulsion charge and
    descends on a 2.2-meter square radar-reflective decelerator, called a
    STARUTE(TM). Temperature information is transmitted to a ground receiver
    while radar track of the STARUTE(TM) provides altitude and wind information.
    The dart diameter is 4.1 cm and weighs about 6 kg.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Super Loki Datasonde® (PWN-10D)

    The PWN-10D Datasonde® dart is similar to the PWN-11D dart with three
    exceptions: the PWN-10D dart is larger (5.4-cm diameter) and heavier (6.8
    kg), the transmitter contains a transponding capability to permit a ground
    tracking technique to be used other than radar, and the tail assembly is
    different. However, NASA Wallops Flight Facility does not used the
    transponder system, opting instead to use high precision tracking radars.
    The Wallops telemetry station tracking system is used to acquire the dart's
    telemetry signal.

   TELEMETRY AND RADAR EQUIPMENT TYPICALLY REQUIRED

  Telemetry

    The Super Loki Datasonde® (PWN-10D and PWN-11D) operates at 1680 MHZ and is
    tunable over the range of 1660 MHZ to 1700 MHZ. The ground receiving system
    should have the same frequency range for receiving the signal. Because of
    the long distance (>150 km) sometimes encountered between the receiving
    system and transmitter a high-gain receiving antenna is necessary,
    especially during the winter when westerly winds in the stratosphere are
    very strong. The antenna may be either a helical-wound type, or a parabolic
    dish of at least 2-meters diameter (larger is more desirable). After the
    signal is received, the modulated frequency is recorded as a function of
    time. Alternatively the recorded frequency data are processed using a
    computer program design for the purpose of reducing the signals to
    temperature data. The time recordings are usually elapsed time from the time
    of rocketsonde launch, although at Wallops the real-time of day also is used
    . Real-time is better since it can be correlated to radar position data
    (copied separately) more precisely. Strip-chart recordings can be used but
    are best used when digital temperature reduction capability does not exist.
    Either recording method requires the use of specially designed computer
    programs that outputs temperature, wind, etc. data at about one-half second
    resolution.

   Radar

    Position information vs time is required for two purposes. The first is to
    relate altitudes to the measured temperatures; the second, is to determine
    the wind direction and speed over the altitude range of the measurements.
    The quality of the radar used is important to the extent that the size of
    the errors caused by radar tracking imprecision can be tolerated. A
    reasonably inexpensive radar can provide height and wind information that
    would be adequate for reducing the Datasonde® information, but is not be
    adequate for the falling sphere. Corrections must be made to the target's
    motion to achieve the true wind. This requires that the 1st and 2nd
    derivatives of the radar position be determined vs time. Therefore, the more
    precise that the radar tracking is, the better will be the quality of the
    reduced data. Corrections that are applied to the Super Loki Datasonde®
    (PWN-10D and PWN-11D) temperature and wind data below 50 km are relatively
    small. At altitudes above 50 km the requirement for a better radar becomes
    more stringent.

    On the other hand, the Super Loki, or Viper 3a inflatable sphere requires a
    very high precision tracking radar. This radar should be equivalent to a
    FPS-16 C-band tracking radar. Inflatable sphere data would contain large
    errors and considerable noise if a less accurate radar is used, and if a
    poor quality radar is used the data are not of any use.

   Data Analysis

    Reduction of data from the Datasonde® instrument is basically similar to
    reduction of data from a radiosonde instrument. Once temperatures vs times
    are available the data are correlated to a radiosonde observation made close
    in space and time. The radiosonde data provide the initial level required to
    solve the hypsometric equation which integrates pressure and density data
    from the temperature and height information. There is a considerable amount
    of detail involved in the reduction process to obtain the best data, but if
    digital information is available computer reduction will increase the
    efficiency and quality of the final product.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Launch Site

    The location of the launch site is important for safety reasons. The rocket
    vehicle must be aimed so that it does not fly over populated areas, and must
    impact in an area large enough to cover the dispersion radius of the
    vehicle. In the United States all launch range impact zones are in the
    ocean, desert, or non-populated areas. However, there is usually some human
    activity in all of these areas. The radar should be located at a safe
    distance behind the launcher. This permits the radar operators the advantage
    of acquiring the rocket vehicle target as soon after lift-off as possible.
    Such a location is desirable for the telemetry station, as well, although
    not critical. There must also be sufficient electrical power available, and
    alternate sources of such power, to enable operations to continue without
    interruption.
