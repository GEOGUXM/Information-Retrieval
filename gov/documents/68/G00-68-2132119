     This program brings together a small group of young scientists to
     study topics including the physics of the early universe, inflation,
     cosmic nucleosynthesis, dark matter, neutrino astrophysics,
     topological defects, structure formation, microwave background
     anisotropies, gravitational lensing by large-scale structure, and
     the statistics of large-scale structure.

     This small and highly selected group is meeting over a two-year
     period to develop new research programs in the above areas through
     close interactions with each other and with the convenors and
     lecturers listed below. Half of the participants come from Germany
     and half from the United States. The first meeting of the institute
     was held at the Aspen Center for Physics, September 7-19, 1998.
     The second meeting, will take place on 6-17 September 1999. The
     meeting will convene in Munich and Garching until 13 September. On
     September 13. the institute moves to Schloss Ringberg, a Bavarian
     mountain castle operated as conference center by the Max Planck
     Society. All costs for the selected participants (travel, lodging,
     local expenses) are covered by the Study Institute.

Format

     The first meeting in Munich of the GAAC Institute will be on Monday
     Sept. 6 in the lecture hall of the Max Planck Institute for
     Astrophysics located on the research campus near Garching. This will
     begin at 11:15 and the session before lunch will deal with financial
     and organisational matters. The afternoon will be spent in
     presentations of research programmes in the Munich area related to
     the scientific interests of the group, particularly those of the
     MPA, of the Max Planck Institute for Physics, and within the Special
     Research Area # 375 funded by the German Research Foundation. The
     afternoon will finish with a reception at the MPA.

     Activities through this first week will consist of discussion groups
     in each of the 8 areas highlighted in the programme (see below), of
     two colloquia which should be of interest to the group as a whole
     and to a wider community, and of informal working discussions
     between the GAAC participants. We expect at least a couple of group
     outings to some of the famous Munich beer-gardens in the evenings.
     (Note that the Munich Oktoberfest begins on September 18 and that
     travel and accommodation can become difficult at this time.)

     During this period roughly half of the participants will be given
     office space at the Max Planck Institute for Physics
     in north Munich, and the other half at the Max Planck Institute for
     Astrophysics in Garching. This split will be primarily according to
     scientific interest with the more physically inclined in Munich and
     the more astrophysically inclined in Garching. The goal, however,
     will be to maximise the opportunities for effective interaction.

     On Monday 13th the Institute will transfer to Ringberg castle where
     the programme will be more structured with a mix of talks and
     discussion aimed at the full group with smaller discussions within
     each thematic area. The programme will finish after lunch on Friday
     17.

     This Study Institute is not a conference, workshop, or school in the
     standard sense. The Munich meeting is set up with the aim of
     stimulating collaborations between the participants themselves, and
     between the participants and scientists with similar interests in
     the Munich area.

     Discussion leaders/lecturers for the programme are:
     * Gerhard Boerner -- MPI fuer Astrophysik -- observed large-scale
       structure
     * Josh Frieman -- Fermilab/Chicago -- inflation and large-scale
       structure
     * Angela Olinto -- Chicago -- cosmic rays and magnetic fields
     * Edward Kolb -- Fermilab/Chicago -- field theory in the early
       universe
     * Georg Raffelt -- MPI fuer Physik -- neutrino astrophysics
     * Peter Schneider -- MPI fuer Astrophysik -- gravitational lensing
     * Albert Stebbins -- Fermilab -- microwave background
     * Michael Turner -- Fermilab/Chicago -- cosmological nucleosynthesis
     * Simon White -- MPI fuer Astrophysik -- evolution of structure

Travel Arrangements

     URGENT:If you have not yet done so, you should book your air tickets
     to Munich NOW and strive to obtain the cheapest fare possible. Our
     travel budget is predicated on average cost of US$300 for those
     coming from within Germany and US$1000 for those coming from the US.
     You should plan to arrive in Munich on Sunday, Sept. 5 or Monday
     morning Sept. 6th. and to leave on Friday, Sept. 17 evening or
     Saturday Sept. 18. Accommodation will be arranged in Munich/Garching
     on Sunday 5 and at Ringberg castle on Friday 17 for those who need
     it.

     IMPORTANT: Once you have purchased your ticket, please e-mail your
     itinerary (airline flight nos. and departure/arrival times) and the
     COST of your ticket to both Liz Duty (duty@fnal.gov) and Cornelia
     Rickl (car@mpa-garching.mpg.de), so we have this information. If
     your ticket price is substantially in excess of the guidelines
     above, please contact them before making your purchase. There are a
     number of Web sites where you might hunt down bargain fares, e.g.,
     http://www.lufthansa.com/ or http://www.travelocity.com/. (If you
     find an exceptionally cheap fare to Germany, please let us know so
     we can inform the other participants/convenors.)

     REIMBURSEMENT:Soon after your arrival in Munich, you will be
     reimbursed for your air ticket and (except for convenors and locals)
     a per diem of US$20 per day while you are in Munich. There are no
     registration fees for this meeting.

     More detailed travel information will be sent to you once the hotel
     arrangements are fixed.

Housing Information

     Participants may stay in Hotels in Munich or Garching during the
     first part of the meeting and should e-mail their preference for the
     location of their office (MPA or MPP) and hotel (Munich or
     Garching). Please make sure to send email to Cornelia Rickl
     car@mpa-garching.mpg.de indicating your preferences.
     Spouses/significant others can accompany you, though the GAAC will
     not cover their travel expenses.or additional lodging expenses. Let
     us know if you will be accompanied because accommodation at Ringberg
     is quite limited.
