   GENERAL QUESTIONS

   1 What is ODIN?

   The Outsourcing Desktop Initiative for NASA (ODIN) is a long-term
   outsourcing arrangement with the commercial sector that assumes the
   duties and risk for providing and managing the majority of NASA's
   desktop, server and intra-center communications assets and services.
   The ODIN Delivery Order* at NASA Headquarters will replace the majority
   of the desktop and server support currently provided under SAIC's
   Information Resources and Management Support (IR&MS) contract.

   (*Note: the term "Delivery Order" is used instead of "contract." The
   implementation of ODIN at NASA HQ is a delivery order, which is part of
   the NASA-wide ODIN Master Contract.)

   ODIN has already been implemented at most of the NASA centers;
   including GSFC, KSC, JSC, SSC, and MSFC. The Code R Centers are
   planning to implement ODIN in 2000. Implementation at NASA Headquarters
   is planned for February 28, 2000.

     The six major objectives of ODIN are:

     * To shift asset management responsibilities and risk from the
       Government to the ODIN contractor.
     * To facilitate information technology management
     * To increase systems and product interoperability across the Agency.
     * To allow civil servant resources to focus on core R&D missions.
     * To optimize service delivery using commercial best practices.
     * To reduce the cost of IT services.

   2 What does "outsourcing" mean?

   "Outsourcing" refers to the placement of those services under the
   responsibility of a contractor that until now had been the
   responsibility of NASA. Some of the responsibilities that will be
   outsourced include computer equipment, property management; acquisition
   of equipment, and software; and managing assets and services.

   3 What is covered under ODIN?

   Computer hardware, software, peripherals, phones, faxes, servers (for
   file sharing, web site, etc.), local video and remote communications. A
   Loaner Laptop Pool will continue to be operated for short-term use of a
   laptop while away from NASA HQ.

     3a Is there anything being done on the IR&MS contract that will NOT
     be done under ODIN?

     Yes. Applications and web site development and delivery; some
     hardware/software engineering; computer training; operation of the
     User Resource Center; and some server support will not be covered
     under ODIN. These areas of support will continue to be covered under
     the existing IR&MS contract until the beginning of the Information
     Technology Systems, Engineering & Management (ISEM) support contract
     on May 30, 2000.

   4 When does the ODIN Delivery Order begin?

   On February 28, 2000.

   5 How is service under ODIN different than it is under the current
   IR&MS Support Contract?

   Click here for a table comparing many services performed under IR&MS,
   and how they will be performed under ODIN.

   6. What kind of impact will this change make in technological
   improvements?

   Under ODIN, technological improvements are achievable as they are
   today. HQ still plans to maintain a two year Information Technology
   Plan that is approved by the IT Board of Directors. This will be the
   focus for ODIN. "Technology refresh" (upgrades to existing software and
   hardware) and "technology infusion" (assessment and deployment of new
   hardware, software, and systems) will continue under ODIN.

   7 Can other contractors purchase services through ODIN? Are contractors
   at NASA affected by ODIN?

   Yes. Headquarters plans to provide ODIN services to on-site contractors
   as it does today. Other off-site HQ contractors have the ability to
   purchase services directly from the ODIN vendor. HQ will continue to
   provide connectivity to off-site contractors that support HQ
   activities.

   ODIN SEATS AND SUPPORT

   1 What is an ODIN "Seat?" What do I get for the cost of a seat?

   ODIN services are "bundled" and referred to as "seats." Seats are
   identified as desktop, server, phone, and fax. A seat includes
   necessary IT support services for hardware, software, installation,
   maintenance, technology refreshments (upgrades), administration,
   relocation, and network access. Service also includes customer support,
   telecom, and server services.

   2 How will new workstation configurations (processor speed, memory,
   etc.) be determined?

   The National Software Testing Laboratory (NSTL), under contract to
   NASA, will test and measure the performance of currently-available
   workstations. Performance measurements will test the workstation
   components -- processor, speed, memory, etc. From that testing, the
   NSTL will develop and maintain Performance Ratings. These ratings will
   determine the minimum performance standards vendors must meet under the
   ODIN contract. These ratings will be updated quarterly.

   3 What if the standard ODIN Seat does not meet all of my needs?

   If the user requires hardware or software that is covered under the
   ODIN Catalog, he/she may order it and receive it, pending Code POC and
   Code CI approval. If the user requires hardware and software that is
   not in the Catalog, he/she may request through Code CI that the item be
   added to the Catalog. (See Catalog-related questions in Part 4, below.)

   4 Can I install non-ODIN hardware or software in an ODIN Seat (e.g.
   software from home, a zip drive my Code purchased on itsí own with a
   credit card, etc.)?

   No, HQ users may not install hardware or software unless it is ordered
   through ODIN.

   5 Who gets to decide what type of service level I get? Who determines
   what is a priority service?

   The IT Board of Directors -- comprised of a senior management
   representative from each code -- established most the ODIN desktop
   service levels chosen for HQ. Other levels not specified by the Board
   were established by Code CI, the HQ Information Technology and
   Communications Division. In general, all service levels selected were
   those that most closely matched those that we have today.

   A priority service will be determined by the severity of the problem as
   expressed by the user when he/she contacts the IntelliCenter (ODIN Help
   Desk).

   6 How can I upgrade my ODIN Seat?

   ODIN Seats will be "refreshed" (upgraded) on a 3-year cycle (See
   Question 2.9 for more details.) A request for changing the seat type
   ahead of schedule must be made through Code CI.

   7 Can I move an ODIN desktop?

   NO, the user may not move or relocate an ODIN seat on his/her own. ODIN
   is responsible for IT asset management and tracking of all ODIN seats.
   Also, each ODIN seat include the Moves, Adds and Changes service within
   the seat price. Moves will be coordinated by an authorized Code
   Point-of-Contact by way of a call to the IntelliCenter (ODIN Help
   Desk).

   8 How long will it take (i.e., what is the metric) for setting up a new
   user?

   Under ODIN new users must be setup within three working days after
   approval has been obtained from Code CI and Space Planning.

   9 How can I guarantee that I will receive a quality workstation?

   There is a provision in the ODIN Master Contract that establishes a
   technology refreshment baseline and machine performance levels. Any
   equipment proposed for technology refreshment shall be tested and
   certified to meet or exceed the performance specifications in the
   Technology Refreshment Baseline. The National Software Testing
   Laboratory (NSTL) will update the performance specifications based on
   market surveys and testing. The baseline is updated quarterly and
   posted at http://nasa.nstl.com.

   10 When will I get a new ODIN workstation?

   ODIN seats are scheduled to be "refreshed" (replaced) every three
   years. Under the ODIN Delivery Order, Operating System upgrades will be
   deployed within one year of production release. For example, Windows
   2000 and Mac OS X are expected to be released this year. Within one
   year of their release, ODIN will deploy them on all workstations under
   the Delivery Order. In the case of Windows 2000, we know that we will
   refresh every desktop PC with a new PC with Windows 2000 pre-loaded.
   Some PC laptops will also be replaced; the rest of the laptops and
   portables that will work well with Windows 200 will not be replaced --
   we will load Windows 2000 on those existing portables.

   Macintosh workstaions below a G3 will be refreshed with a new Mac (with
   Mac OS X re-loaded). Macs at at a level of G3 or higher will not be
   refreshed when OS X is deployed -- we will load OS X on those existing
   workstations.

   Assuming Microsoft's announced schedule that Windows 2000 will be
   released in February 2000, we anticipate refreshing all desktop PCs
   with new systems pre-loaded with Windows 2000 between October 2000 and
   February 2001.

   Assuming Apple's announced schedule that Mac OS X will be released in
   the Second Quarter of 2000, we anticipate refreshing all Macintosh
   systems below a G3 during November and December 2000 with new systems
   pre-loaded with OS X. We will install OS X on all other Macs.

   ODIN seats not refreshed according to this schedule will be refreshed
   before the end of their 3-year life cycle. A schedule will be published
   in the near future.

   11 I am used to having a technician appear in my office within a couple
   of hours. Now I hear it will take a day or more before I can get help.
   How long do I have to wait for service?

   Under ODIN, the emphasis will be on resolving problems and questions
   during the initial phone call to the IntelliCenter,* rather than simply
   dispatching a technician to the callerís office. The IntelliCenter will
   be staffed by personnel with unique knowledge of NASA HQ software,
   hardware, and processes. They will have an extensive Knowledge Base of
   troubleshooting information, and other tools that will equip them to
   resolve most calls over the phone. Calls that in the past required a
   technician visit (such as "inability to print," "How Do IÖ?" and many
   application errors) will be handled in just a few minutes over the
   phone. Naturally, this approach means that the caller remain on the
   line and work cooperatively with IntelliCenter staff to achieve the
   quickest resolution. This call may take from 2 to 10 minutes.

   (*Note: The HELP Desk will be renamed the IntelliCenter when ODIN
   begins on February 28. See Section 3, "THE INTELLICENTER" for more
   information on HELP Desk services.)

   If the problem can not be resolved by this initial phone call, the
   IntelliCenter will transfer the ticket to an on-site technician, who
   will meet the goal (metric) of restoring the equipment to service
   within eight working hours. That technician may be either a Hardware,
   Software, or other type of technician, depending on the nature of the
   problem.

   There is no longer a metric for when the initial visit to the userís
   office should occur (under the IR&MS contract, that metric was four
   hours). However, since it is anticipated that most calls can be
   resolved during the phone call to the IntelliCenter, we urge all users
   to remain on the line and allow us to assist over the phone; the result
   will be faster and improved service.

   THE INTELLICENTER

   1 How will the IntelliCenter be different than the current HELP Desk
   under ODIN?

   As stated in the previous question, above ("How long do I have to wait
   for service?"), the emphasis will be on resolving most problems and
   questions during the initial phone call to the IntelliCenter, rather
   than simply dispatching a technician to the callerís office. The
   IntelliCenter, located in Cleveland Ohio and designed by IntelliSource
   specifically for NASA HQ employees, is equipped with Knowledge Base
   tools, on-line resources, and a knowledgeable staff. Many problem calls
   that used to be dispatched to an on-site technician will be resolved by
   the IntelliCenter over the phone.

   Additionally, the IntelliCenter will perform the following functions:
     * Be the single point-of-contact for all calls (ODIN and non-ODIN);

     * Provide Help Desk contact, resolution and tracking services for
       ODIN supported capabilities;

     * Provide customers and service providers with system status and
       alert messages;

     * Handle informational requests or calls pertaining to existing
       service tickets by providing status information;

     * Request for service from a non-ODIN service provider (in the event
       a HELP Desk call requires a non-ODIN provider for resolution).

   2 When can I call the IntelliCenter?

   The IntelliCenter will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
   Customers can reach the IntelliCenter at any time using the telephone,
   email, web page, voice mail, or fax. The service level included with
   the NASA HQ desktop seats includes full support, including on-site
   support, Monday through Friday, 6:00 am to 6:00 pm.

   3 What can I expect the IntelliCenter to resolve during "off-hours"?

   IntelliCenter staff will be able to assist in a variety of problems and
   issues during evenings and weekends. Users can expect help in using
   features in the core software suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Netscape,
   etc.); troubleshooting NASA dial-in problems; assistance installing
   NASA software requested for home; and other similar issues. If
   IntelliCenter staff are unable to resolve the issue the phone, a
   service ticket will be created for on-site staff and put in a queue for
   the next business day.

   4 Can I still leave an email or phone message?

   Yes. The phone number and email to the IntelliCenter will not change
   from what you use to contact the current HQ Help Desk. The phone number
   remains 358-HELP, and the email address remains service@hq.nasa.gov.

   Additionally, there will be National and International Toll-Free
   numbers for the IntelliCenter; these numbers will be published on
   February 28.

   THE CATALOG

   1 What is the ODIN "Catalog?"

   The ODIN Catalog is an automated web-based system to order hardware,
   software, and other services not included in a standard ODIN Seat. The
   ODIN Catalog is designed to streamline request, approval, purchase and
   installation. This process will automate the portion of the Service
   Request process where new hardware and software are required.

   For example, currently, users must complete a Service Request form,
   print it out, have their ADP/T Point-of-Contact sign it, and have it
   routed to a Service Manager, Code CI Approval Point-of-Contact and/or
   others for approval signatures before the request can be processed and
   assigned to a team to begin work. This process often takes several
   days.

   Under ODIN, the process for approvals is performed electronically using
   the Catalog web site and email. This will significantly decrease the
   flow time to acquire goods and services.

   Once all approvals are made, the ODIN vendor will purchase and deliver
   the Catalog item within 10 working days.

   2 Where can I get a copy of the Catalog?

   The ODIN Catalog will be completely web-based. The location of the web
   site will be announced once the ODIN Delivery Order begins on February
   28, 2000.

   3 Can I request anything I want from the Catalog?

   Yes, but all items in the Catalog will still be subject to approval by
   your ADP/T Point-of-Contact, Code funding official, and Code CI. As
   with the current Service Request process, users will still need to
   justify their work need for a Catalog item.

   4 When the NSTL benchmark moves, is the ODIN vendor obligated to
   upgrade existing PC's at NASA HQ?

   No, not immediately. Existing workstations will be replaced on a
   three-year cycle, or when software upgrades require hardware baselines
   that are higher than what some users have. For details on workstation
   refresh schedules, see Question 2.10, above.

   5 Will home software for home use continue under ODIN?

   Yes. The process for requesting software for home remains the same.

   6 What if something I really need is not in the Catalog?

   If the user requires hardware and software that is not in the Catalog,
   he/she may request through Code CI that the item be added to the
   Catalog. The process for doing so will be announced by the beginning of
   the Delivery Order on February 28.

     6a What if I purchase hardware or software on my own (or with my
     Codeís credit card) and install it myself?

     HQ users may not purchase or install hardware or software on their
     own. All hardware and software must be ordered through ODIN.

     If hardware or software not requested through ODIN is installed, the
     following procedure is in effect:
     * The ODIN vendor will not support the hardware or software
       component.

     * If the new hardware or software component breaks the system, there
       is a "Restore to Service" fee paid to the ODIN vendor. Te ODIN
       contractor will restore the seat to the original ODIN-supported
       configuration (minus the added component).

     * If the ODIN seat fails after the component is installed, then ODIN
       is not responsible for making the component work, but simply to
       return the seat to standard configuration.

     * When the seat is refreshed, the ODIN vendor is not responsible for
       transferring the component to the new system nor ensuring that it
       will function on the new system.

   7 I can go to CompUSA or Best Buy and buy an item in the Catalog for
   less money. Why is the Catalog price higher than that advertised in the
   store?

   The price of an item in the Catalog is not simply based on the actual
   cost of the item. The price includes the product, installation,
   integration, and full maintenance support for the remainder of the
   Delivery Order.

   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRANSITION

   1 Will there be any change to an employees personal liability for NASA
   equipment?

   No. HQ employees will continue to be liable for property loss.
   Specifics will be published by Code C in the near future.

   2 Will there be new property procedures for NASA HQ in equipment
   handling?

   Yes. These are currently being defined, and new procedures will be
   distributed by the beginning of the ODIN Delivery Order. From the
   customer interface stand point the changes should be minimal.

   3 When ODIN computers are excessed under ODIN, will data be erased as
   they are now?

   Yes. Comparable procedures for wiping excessed computer hard drives
   will be utilized under ODIN.

   4 Will data be backed up under ODIN? How much data?

   Data on the servers will be backed up by ODIN daily as is done today.
   Data storage available to each user on the server is specified by each
   users service level. For HQ, users are permitted up to 500 MB storage
   as the standard service level.

   The policy for hard drive back up will be the same under ODIN as it is
   today: users are responsible for backing up their own data to the data
   servers or to other storage media.

   5 What happens to the Service Request I turned in under the IR&MS
   Contract? Will I still receive the service I asked for in that Service
   Request?

   Yes. Service Requests that are currently in work and not expected to be
   completed by the beginning of ODIN will be redistributed to ODIN or
   IR&MS personnel, depending on the service request.

   6 What will happen to my favorite computer technician? Will I still see
   my Service Manager?

   ODIN will be staffed to maintain continuity of support levels. There
   will be ODIN Service Manager support personnel.

   WHAT YOU CAN DO/LEARN MORE ABOUT ODIN

   1 What is my role as an HQ employee? What more can I do to be ready for
   ODIN as an HQ employee?

   The employees at NASA Headquarters are encouraged to review the ODIN
   web site, attend future Code meetings, Town Hall events and any
   additional briefings pertaining to ODIN as offered. By reviewing
   available information and attending these meetings, you will gain
   knowledge and understanding of what the ODIN has to offer. We encourage
   you to revisit this FAQ regularly: as new questions and issues arise,
   this FAQ will be updated.

   2 Will there be any meetings about ODIN?

   Yes. There will be special meetings offered to each Code to brief staff
   on how ODIN will work, and how users can access ODIN services. When you
   are invited to these meetings, please make every effort to attend. Many
   of your questions or concerns will be addressed at these meetings.

   All HQ employees will be invited to one of two Town Hall meetings, at
   which ODIN will be discussed and questions answered. You are encouraged
   to attend one of these meetings. They will be held on the following
   dates:

     February 15   11:00 am - 12 noon   Auditorium
     February 22  1:00 pm - 2:00 pm   Auditorium

   After the Delivery Order begins on February 28, IT Exchanges will be
   held to instruct users on how to submit Service Requests, use the
   Catalog, the IntelliCenter, and access other ODIN services.

   3 Where can I get more information?

     1. Revisit this FAQ on a regular basis for updated information.

     2. The ODIN Ombudsman

     The ODIN Ombudsman, Woody Williams, has been designated to assist
     NASA users with problems during the transition (until February 28).
     His role includes: facilitator; problem solver; troubleshooter;
     mediator; investigator; and complaint handler. The Ombudsman
     provides an additional means for NASA HQ personnel to elevate
     issues, concerns and problems.

     The Ombudsman can be reached at 358-0611 or via email at
     Woodrow.Williams@hq.nasa.gov.
