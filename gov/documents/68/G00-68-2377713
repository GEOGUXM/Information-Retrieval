     Complete all information requested. Reservations are made after the

       that sites are in great demand for family reunions, birthdays,
   anniversaries, work parties, community barbeques and/or just plain fun.
    You will receive an email to confirm the availability of your 1st or
   2nd preferred site selection. Reservations are not final until receipt
   of your payment to the above address is received within 10 days of your
    shelter confirmation. A Valid Permit will only be issued when payment
                          is received by due date.
