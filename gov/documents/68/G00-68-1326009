         The Official Source for Information About the House Oceans Caucus

      Ocean Exploration Meeting - April 27, 2001 from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM

   Our Mission

      The House Oceans Caucus will create a voice within the Congress on
      ocean issues by building a constituency of interested members. The
      Caucus will serve as the focal point for increasing House of
      Representatives awareness on issues of ocean policy by developing
      legislation to meet national and international needs. During the
      remainder of the 106^th Congress the issues that the Caucus will
      emphasize are security, governance, biology, and pollution.

      The House Oceans Caucus will:
      prepare and distribute summaries of key national and international
          ocean issues
          establish a World Wide Web site providing summaries of issues and
          information and links to diverse information sources about ocean
          issues
          organize and present briefings
          host policy and science meetings
          serve as a focal point for formulating policy, and
          develop outreach products to educate the Congress and public about
          ocean-related policy issues.

   Our Vision

      As our quality of life, security, health, and economic well being are
      fundamentally tied to the Worlds ocean, the House Oceans Caucus will be
      a bipartisan forum, building awareness, exchanging information and
      ideas, exploring important issues, and developing and implementing
      ocean policy legislation to meet national and international needs.
