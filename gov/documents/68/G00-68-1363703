About Us

   In the FY 2001 budget, Congress approved a new Office of Disability
   Employment Policy for the Department of Labor. Programs and staff of
   the former President's Committee on Employment of People with
   Disabilities have been integrated in this new office.

   The mission of ODEP, under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary,
   will be to bring a heightened and permanent long-term focus to the goal
   of increasing employment of persons with disabilities. This will be
   achieved through policy analysis, technical assistance, and development
   of best practices, as well as outreach, education, constituent
   services, and promoting ODEP's mission among employers.

   The President's FY 2002 budget proposes an additional $20.3 million and
   10 new full-time positions in the Office of Disability Employment
   Policy. To support the President's New Freedom Initiative, ODEP will
   provide competitive grants to One-Stop Career Centers to make the
   centers more accessible to people with significant disabilities in a
   variety of ways. The centers will be expected to utilize assistive
   technology, provide appropriate staff training and use best practices
   in order to provide greater access to people with significant
   disabilities and provide them the services they need to get into the
   economic mainstream.

   In announcing the President's budget request for the Department of
   Labor, Secretary Elaine L. Chao said, "It is not only important to give
   people with disabilities training and access to assistive technology -
   but also the ability to become more active citizens in their
   communities."

   Some information that originally appeared on the former President's
   Committee's website remains on this site.

   This site will be undergoing modification during the coming weeks to
   reflect the programs and initiatives of the new agency.
