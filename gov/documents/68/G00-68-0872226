                        Sustainability and Societal Need

   As the population continues to grow, so does the demand for natural
   resources. The USGS maintains national databases, develops assessment
   and analysis methods, and conducts applied research that provides the
   objective scientific tools for decision-making related to sustaining
   our Nation with adequate mineral resources in an environmentally
   acceptable manner. USGS is a world leader in understanding mineral
   occurrence and developing methodologies for quantitative and
   qualitative mineral and environmental assessments. USGS deposit
   research provides the fundamental knowledge used to understand where
   minerals occur and how they interact with the environment. USGS
   assessments of the distribution, economic significance, and
   environmental impact of development of the Nation's mineral resources
   are conducted on regional, national, and global scales to meet the
   needs of land management agencies and national policy makers. In
   response to the need to update and maintain urban infrastructure,
   program emphasis is shifting toward assessments of industrial and
   aggregate resources, such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone. Current
   program activities include development of environmental models, tools
   for economic analysis of mineral deposits, materials flow models, and
   assessment techniques for industrial minerals.
