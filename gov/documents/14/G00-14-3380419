                        United States District Courts

    The United States district courts are the trial courts of the federal
    court system. Within limits set by Congress and the Constitution, the
     district courts have jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of
   federal cases, including both civil and criminal matters. There are 94
     federal judicial districts, including at least one district in each
    state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Three territories of
   the United States -- the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana
     Islands -- have district courts that hear federal cases, including
                              bankruptcy cases.

    There are two special trial courts that have nationwide jurisdiction
   over certain types of cases. The Court of International Trade addresses
     cases involving international trade and customs issues. The United
    States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over most claims for
       money damages against the United States, disputes over federal
      contracts, unlawful "takings" of private property by the federal
    government, and a variety of other claims against the United States.
