      Advanced Communications Technology Satellite
      Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) logo Work Area
      Manager: Robert Bauer
      NASA Strategic Enterprises: Space Flight, HQ Operations

      The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) is an
      experimental satellite that opened Ka-band for space communications and
      demonstrated the use of narrow spot beam antennas, ultra-wideband
      transponders (900 MHz), and on-board digital processing and switching.
      The project supported experiments from industry, academia, and the
      government which have acted as a catalyst in the acceptance and
      implementation of the technologies developed into next generation
      satellite systems.

      NASA Glenn entered into a Space Act Agreement in March 2001 with the
      Ohio Board of Regents and the Ohio University to extend operations for
      collaborative educational and research-based activities through the
      formation of a university-based consortium. The agreements allows for
      up to four more years of operations for the consortium to use ACTS.

      Role of SCP: To provide for spacecraft operations and technical
      oversight of the consortium.

      Accomplishments/Achievements: The flawless operation of the spacecraft
      and continued user interest allowed a broad-based experiments program
      to expand over three times its originally planned duration. ACTS has
      received numerous awards including the R&D 100 Award in Significant
      Technology, the Federal Technology Leadership Award, and has been
      inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame.


      Advanced Communications for Air Traffic Management (AC/ATM)

      for global and national air transportation systems by testing and
      demonstrating technologies and architectures that will increase the
      capacity and throughput of the National Airspace System in the future.
      Key technologies of AC/ATM include advanced networks and communications
      system architectures, phased array antennas, and air mobile terminals.

      Role of SCP: To provide research in communications system and network
      modeling and simulation, development and testing of air-mobile
      satellite communications terminals, and development of advanced

      in-depth study of communications requirements for aeronautical
      applications including advanced free flight air traffic management
      methods. AC/ATM has also developed and tested an advanced Ku-band
      aero-mobile terminal, including Ku-band electronically scanning phased
      array antennas. AC/ATM has supported and co-sponsored flight test using
      the NASA Dryden DC-8 research aircraft, demonstrating the first
      broadband satellite communications networked aircraft link.


      Direct Data Distribution Project (DÂ³)

      The Direct Data Distribution (D3) Project is the planned demonstration
      of a high rate kA-band based communications link from a low earth orbit
      (LEO) platform direct to a tracking ground station, using a solid state
      electrically-steered phased array and an OC-12 (622 mbps) modulation
      scheme that is both bandwidth and power efficient. The primary goal of
      this project is to enable the eventual transition of LEO-based NASA
      science users from government-owned communications services to
      commercially-provided services at kA-band

      Role of SCP: To develop, integrate, and demonstrate, via a spaceflight
      opportunity, the key technologies needed to enable high rate direct to
      ground services for NASA users at kA-band

      Accomplishments/Achievements: D3 has developed a Hitchhiker-based
      canister as the basis for the flight payload, complete with the initial
      safety and integration assessment needed for flight. D3 has also
      developed cryoreceiver-based electronics necessary for deployment of an
      inexpensive tracking ground terminal needed as part of the technology
      that enables the direct to ground service.


      High Rate Data Delivery (HRDD) Thrust Area

      High Rate Data Delivery (HRDD) logo High Rate Data Delivery (HRDD) is a
      thrust area within the Cross-Enterprise Technology Development Program
      (CETDP ), and is NASA's primary vehicle for undertaking basic research
      within the agency to enable planned missions, stimulate new concepts
      for missions not yet conceived, and to confront directly the grand
      challenges that face the agency in the year 2000 and beyond. The
      primary goal of HRDD is to architecture the next generation space-based
      Internet, provide end-to-end solutions and technology inventions, and

      NASA Strategic Enterprise: Space Flight

      Technology for Space Internet Services (TSIS) is developing and
      demonstrating communications and network technologies that are helping
      to enable the near-Earth space Internet. The goal of TSIS is to develop
      the network technology necessary to make every future NASA space asset
      Internet Protocol (IP) compliant and act as a "node on the Internet".

      Role of SCP: To provide overall management of the project including the
      development of network products such as NIC's, LAN, Routers, and
      Protocols for eventual use in space.

      Accomplishments/Achievements: TSIS is a new project but has already
      been involved with IP experiments over ACTS and has financed the design
      of a miniaturized secure router breadboard. Next year TSIS is planning
      to pick up the IP development activities currently being funded as part
      of the Cross-Enterprise Technology Development Program.

      NASA Strategic Enterprise: Space Flight

      NASA Spectrum Management Office Logo Spectrum Management coordinates
      the process for NASA projects that need to obtain US and/or
      International authorizations to transmit on radio frequencies and
      actively participates in the US and International process that defines
      the usage of the radio frequencies; representing NASA's interests.

      Accomplishments/Achievements: The Spectrum Management Office led NASA
      participation on the US Delegation to the 2000 World
      Radiocommunications Conference where all NASA objectives were
      successfully achieved to benefit current and future Agency missions. A
      primary allocation status for space science operations in the 2025-2110
      MHz band was achieved, thus providing protected operations in the band
      for virtually all NASA missions. A Group Achievement Award was
      presented to the WRC 2000 Team at the NASA Honor Awards located at NASA
      Glenn Research Center on August 23, 2001.
