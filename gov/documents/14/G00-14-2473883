                            Welcome to "The Coral Kingdom."

          Within this realm you will find one of Earth's most diverse
     ecological communities and see many beautiful, strange, and even
     bizarre creatures.

     Coral reefs exist throughout the tropical ocean regions of our
     planet; but, in spite of their broad geographic range, they are in
     danger of destruction from man-induced and natural causes.

     Widespread harmful fishing practices, changes in ocean chemistry
     from pollutants, and recent widespread coral bleaching events from
     El Ni√±o-related ocean temperature increases have caused many reef
     systems to be highly stressed.

     Besides the many wonderful photographs found here that will help you
     learn more about coral reefs in this album, visit the following
     sites to learn more about what is being done to preserve and protect
     these fragile environments.

Red Sea Reefs

     This site is dedicated to the preservation and conservation of Red
     Sea coral reefs and in particular those found in the Red Sea Marine
     Peace Park which is located in the Gulf of Aqaba. The Red Sea Marine
     Peace Park was founded in 1994 by the governments of Jordan and
     Israel to preserve and protect these most northerly of all coral
     reefs to be found anywhere on our planet. NOAA was a participant in
     the formation of this park and is particularly indebted to
     professional diver Mr. Mohammed Al Momany, of Aqaba, Jordan, for
     donating the following images to help educate all to the beauty and
     wonder of the spectacular marine life and vistas associated with the
     Red Sea reefs.
