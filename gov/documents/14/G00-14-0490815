   Mechanics of Granular Materials Fluid physics is the study of the
   motion of fluids and the effects of such motion. Since three of the
   four states of matter (gas, liquid and plasma) are fluid and even the
   fourth (solid) behaves like a fluid under many conditions, fluid
   physics is vital to understanding, controlling, and improving all of
   our industrial as well as natural processes. The engines used to propel
   a car or an airplane, shape of the wings of an airplane that allow it
   to fly, operation of boilers that generate steam used to produce over
   90% of the world's electric power, understanding of how cholesterol is
   transported in our bloodstream and how it affects heart disease, and
   how pollutants are transported and dispersed in air and water are just
   a few examples of how fluid physics affects our everyday life and forms
   the very basis for an industrial society.

   A low-gravity environment nearly eliminates buoyancy and sedimentation
   and provides scientists near ideal conditions to probe into flow
   phenomena otherwise too complex to study on Earth (such as physics of
   colloids and suspensions) and also allows study of flows (such as
   surface tension driven flows) that are nearly completely masked in
   Earth's normal gravity. This has the potential to revolutionize our
   understanding of growth of colloidal crystals that will enable
   tomorrow's photonic (using light in place of electrons) information
   technology. Understanding of liquid-vapor flows and heat transfer in
   microgravity is also vital to the design of spacecraft and life support
   systems needed for humans to explore and exploit the unlimited
   potential of space.
