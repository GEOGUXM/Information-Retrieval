   News: Ames Lab 2001 CMP and MC Program Review
         'Superconductor' Gain Holds Promise of Energy Efficiency
         Ames Lab Scientists in Energy 100 Awards

   Scientists in this wide-ranging program are experts in the synthesis,
   characterization and modeling of new materials. High-Tc
   superconductors, fullerenes, magneto-optic materials, and quasicrystals
   are the focal point for new synthesis methods and for characterization
   measurements using NMR, photoemission, Auger spectroscopy, high
   temperature x-ray, and neutron scattering techniques. [bend_t.jpg]

   Scientific initiatives include the design and demonstration of photonic
   band gap crystals, a geometrical arrangement of dielectric materials
   that allows light to pass except when the frequency falls within a
   forbidden range. These materials would make it easier to develop
   numerous practical devices, including optical lasers, optical
   computers, and solar cells. A new facility at the Lab allows scientists
   to study the high-temperature crystal structures of new
   superconductors, intermetallic alloys, magnets, and ceramics. This
   information is providing the insight needed to develop and modify
   processing techniques for the microstructuring of new materials. A new
   Ames Lab spectrometer will have the world's highest resolution to
   measure the energy and angle of photoemitted electrons. The first
   application will be the study of high-temperature superconductors.

   Work in Photonic Bandgap sturctures helped K.-M. Ho, C. Soukoulis, and
   C.- T. Chan eran a spot in the DOE Energy 100 Awards Theorists at the
   Lab are world leaders in modeling large molecular systems. With the aid
   of advanced parallel computers, systems with up to 10,000,000 atoms are
   being simulated, and the melting of diamond is being studied.

   For those of you new to Condensed matter physics, it is simply the
   study of materials and their properties. The ultimate goal is to
   develop new materials that have better properties such as being
   stronger, more durable, or lighter in weight. Other materials are being
   studied and developed for specific purposes such as semiconductors that
   allow computer chips to run faster, superconductors that have no
   resistence to the flow of electrons, metals that exhibit a high level
   of magnetism, solar cells that are more efficient at converting
   sunlight into electicity, and photonic materials that may be used to
   make optical computers in the future. In order to improve upon the
   properties of these materials, we must first understand why they
   exhibit their unique properties. Scientists at Ames Laboratory are
   performing experiments to characterize materials, modeling the systems
   at the atomic level using some of the worlds fastest supercomputers,
   and developing theoretical models to explain these properties. A better
   understanding of the underlying physics will point us in the right
   direction in the search for new and better materials.
