   Who We Are
   Seal of the Public Health Service Federal Occupational Health (FOH) is
   part of the Program Support Center of the Department of Health and
   Human Services. FOH is a component of the United States Public Health
   Service, our nation's foremost health agency, created by Congress in
   1798.

   FOHs mission is to improve the health and safety of the government
   workforce by designing and providing innovative, customized,
   cost-effective
   occupational health, environmental and work/life solutions that exceed
   customer expectations.

   Federal Occupational Health was created in 1946 by an amendment to the
   Public Health Service Act. Beginning in 1984, FOH became fully
   reimbursable, operating without any direct congressional
   appropriations. In 1996, FOH became one of only six government-wide
   franchises under the Government Management and Reform Act of 1994
   (Public Law 103-356). This select designation means that both the
   Office of Management and Budget and the Chief Financial Officers
   Council have given their Seal of Approval to our fiscally sound
   management, quality standards, and attention to customer satisfaction.

   Here is a message from our Director.
