   21st Century Project

                                 What's New

   21st Century Project Funding Denied

   Funding for the 21st Century Project for Fiscal Year 2001-2002 was not
   approved. As such, the project has been put on hold.

   During this fiscal year, staff from the Controller's Office will work
   with the Legislature and the Administration to obtain funding for
   Fiscal Year 2002-2003. If this effort is successful, the 21st Century
   Project will be re-started. A new Request for Proposal will have to be
   issued and a vendor selected. When funding is secured, the Controller's
   Office will notify all Stakeholders.

   The 21st Century Project staff would like to take this opportunity to
   thank all Stakeholders, vendor community, and participating departments
   for their support and participation in this project.

              This document was last amended on August 9, 2001.
