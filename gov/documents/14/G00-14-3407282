      Acute Toxicity Database

      The following database summarizes the results from aquatic acute
      toxicity tests conducted by the Columbia Environmental Research Center.
      The acute toxicity test provides a relative starting point for hazard
      assessment of contaminants and is required for federal chemical
      registration programs such as the Federal Insecticide Fungicide
      Rodenticide Act (PL 80-104) as amended by the Federal Environmental
      Pesticide Control Act of 1972 (7 USC 136-136y) and the Toxic Substances
      Control Act of 1976 (PL 94-469).

      Missouri River InfoLINK

      The InfoLINK is as an Internet-based Missouri River information
      clearinghouse. It is a multi-year project initiated in 1998 by a
      partnership of Federal agencies. The Missouri River drains one-sixth of
      the nation and management decisions affect a wide range of Americans
      from Montana to Missouri who represent diverse river interests. The
      InfoLINK was created for these stakeholders who want to understand how
      the river functions and make informed decisions about the river's
      future use and management. The InfoLINK seeks to be a center point for
      common ground, uniting interests through information sharing that
      facilitates communication among all of the basin's citizens.

      Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends Program (BEST)

      The Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) Program was
      initiated, in part, as a revision and expansion of the National
      Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (NCBP). One aspect of the BEST
      program focuses on monitoring contaminants and effects across broad
      geographic areas. This approach is currently being tested in the
      Mississippi, Columbia, and Rio Grande basins. The overall objectives of
      this project are to describe the occurrence and distribution of
      contaminants and their effects on fish in the three basins; to
      quantitatively evaluate the performance of aquatic methods used by the
      BEST program; and to evaluate potential collaborations with the
      National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) and the National
      Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) programs of the USGS-Water Resources
      Division. Fish were collected from 46 sites in the Mississippi River
      basin (1995); 16 sites in the Columbia River basin (1997); 10 sites in
      the Rio Grande basin (1997); and from a reference site in West
      Virginia. Sites were located at the historic NCBP fish monitoring
      stations in all three basins; at NASQAN water quality sampling sites in
      the Columbia and Rio Grande basins; and at NAWQA sites in the
      Mississippi Embayment and Eastern Iowa Basins study units within the
      Mississippi River basin. The primary species targeted at each site were
      common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and largemouth bass (Micropterus
      salmoides); other species, mostly other black basses (Micropterus
      spp.), percids (Stizostedion spp.), salmonids, suckers (Catostomidae),
      and catfish (Ictaluridae) were collected as alternates, depending on
      habitat and location. Individual fish (about 40 per station) were
      analyzed for reproductive biomarkers (vitellogenin and sex steroid
      hormones), histopathological alterations, macrophage aggregates, EROD
      activity, lysozyme activity, and general fish health measures
      (organosomatic and ponderal indices, observations of grossly visible
      lesions, deformities, and parasites). Organochlorine (pesticides and
      total PCBâ€™s) and elemental (heavy metals and metalloids) contaminant
      analyses and the H4IIE bioassay for dioxin-like activity were performed
      on fish samples composited by species and sex.

      NCBP Data (National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program)

      The National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (NCBP) was established
      to document trends in the occurrence of persistent toxic chemicals that
      may threaten fish and wildlife resources. Begun in the early 1960s as
      part of the National Pesticide Monitoring Program, the NCBP has
      expanded its initial focus on persistent organochlorine insecticides to
      include industrial chemicals, herbicides, and potentially toxic
      elemental contaminants. The program also provides necessary feedback to
      the regulatory process by documenting the success (or failure) of
      regulatory actions related to environmental contaminants. The NCBP
      provides a nationwide source of material that is searched analytically
      for the occurrence of new or previously undetected environmental
      contaminants to provide information on emerging problems and for the
      development of new and improved analytical methods. Through its
      archival function, the NCBP also provides a means for retrospective
      analyses and documentation of historical trends for newly identified
      environmental contaminants. Information from this historical program
      has also provided an impetus for developing a revised and expanded
      monitoring program (Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends
      BEST), which was transferred to USGS in 1996.

      Sediment Effects Concentrations Databases

      The Sediment Effect Concentration Databases contain sediment
      information about the benthic diversity, laboratory toxicity,
      contaminant bioaccumulation, geographic locations, chemical
      concentration, and physical characteristics of samples from the Clark
      Fork River/Milltown Reservoir system in Montana, the Great lakes, the
      Upper Mississippi River, the Trinity River in Texas, Mobile Bay in
      Alabama and Galveston Bay in Texas. Sediment Effect Concentrations
      (SECs) are defined as the concentrations of individual contaminants in
      sediment above which toxicity is frequently observed.
