   The UNICAT Synchrotron Radiation Program is a collaboration between
   scientists from the University of Illinois, the Oak Ridge National Lab,
   the National Institute of Standards & Technology, and UOP LLC. The
   UNICAT mission is to instrument and operate x-ray research facilities
   at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)  to support the scientific goals of
   its members.

   The UNICAT is pleased to announce the commencement of our Independent
   Investigator Program in November, 2000 on our insertion device beamline
   in Sector 33.  The objective of this program is to provide
   opportunities for qualified researchers who are not affiliated with the
   UNICAT to productively utilize UNICAT X-ray facilities at the APS.  The
   UNICAT intends to award 25% of scheduled operations beamtime to
   Independent Investigators, and 75% to UNICAT members.
