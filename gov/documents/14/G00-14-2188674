   The VDB Search page allows the user to locate specific data in a single
   VDB table, based on a parameter or set of parameters that the user
   specifies. Most date fields can be search by a range of dates specified
   by the user. Most text fields can be search by substring.

     How do I conduct a Data Search?


     Does the VDB support boolean searches of fields?


     This Search function doesn't meet my needs. What now?
