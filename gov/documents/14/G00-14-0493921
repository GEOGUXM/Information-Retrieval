   Principia Cybernetica Web


                                 Table of Contents


   The following provides a kind of "standard" ordering of the nodes in
   the Principia Cybernetica Web, in the form of an outline. This outline
   can be read as if it were the table of contents of a book, with
   subsequent chapters, sections, subsections, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

      The outline corresponds to a tree structure with different hierarchical
      levels: a node on level n is the "parent" of its "children", the nodes
      of level n+1 which are linked to it. In the outline below the children
      are written immediately under the parent, but indented to the right.
      Some of the nodes are only planned, which means their text is still
      [empty].

      Of course, a hypertext can be read in many different orderings, but we
      thought to provide some kind of a default order as a general guide to
      the reader. Many other "guides" or "paths" through the network are
      possible.

      This outline is not in general complete or up-to-date. Consult the
      recent changes for new nodes. It does not include entries in the
      Dictionary, list of basic concepts, papers or books in the Library.
