   Governor's Initiatives

   Governor's Teaching Fellowship Program Awardees

   California faces the need to attract and retain 300,000 new teachers
   over the next ten years. In order to help meet the enormous demand.
   Governor Davis last year signed SB 1666 (Alarcon), which included a
   rich menu of incentives to bolster teacher recruitment. One aspect of
   this bill, the Governor's Teaching Fellowship Program provides a
   financial incentive to attract both veteran and fully credentialed new
   teachers to teach in low-performing schools. By rewarding quality
   individuals with a desire to teach, this program ensures that
   California will meet its demand with teachers who have satisfied the
   highest of standards.

   Governor's Teaching fellows who have committed to teach in low
   performing schools for four years will receive a $20,000 award which
   may be used for education and living expenses at any certification
   program in California. All of the awardees are either currently
   enrolled in an accredited teacher preparation program or will begin one
   this fall.

   The California State University, in association with the University of
   California and other independent higher education institutions,
   administers the teaching fellows program. Governor Davis has appointed
   a 12-member candidate review committee comprised of university faculty,
   administrators, and public school educators.
   The following is a list of the 944 Governor's Teaching Fellows:
     * Alameda - Kings County (pdf)
     * Los Angeles - Nevada County (pdf)
     * Orange - San Benito County (pdf)
     * San Bernardino - San Diego County (pdf)
     * San Francisco - Solano County (pdf)
     * Sonoma - Yuba County (pdf)

   In subsequent years 1,000 teaching candidates will be chosen to receive
   the $20,000 award.

   Upon successful completion of each fellow's credentialing program,
   California's statewide teacher recruitment centers will assist teacher
   fellows in finding a low-performance school in need of a well-trained
   teacher. The six centers, established by Governor Davis, provide
   assistance to school districts and teacher preparation agencies in
   seeking, screening, referring, and supporting potential new teachers.

   a teacher career please visit the CalTeach website at: www.calteach.org
