   This site contains information relevant to the Earth Science Data
   Information System (ESDIS) Project mission and science processing
   networking activities. The mission portion of the networks are referred
   to as the EOSDIS Mission Support network (EMSn). The science processing
   portion of the networks are provisioned through EOSDIS Science Support
   network (ESSn). The NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) is the
   primary service provider for ESDIS wide area requirements.

   EMSn consists of both a routed data and serial clock & data transport
   infrastructure. The AM-1 spacecraft commands and telemetry (both low
   rate and high rate) are handled as serial clock & data. All other
   traffic is carried over Internet Protocol.

   ESDIS science processing traffic consists of science product outflows
   from the DAACs , Science Computing Facility (SCF) traffic, basic user
   traffic, and Quality Assurance (QA) site traffic. It is all carried
   over Internet Protocol.
