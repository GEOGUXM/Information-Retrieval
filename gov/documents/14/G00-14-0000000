                              Property Research

   The Department of Development and Environmental Services strives to
   assist our customers in accessing critical information about specific
   parcels of property. Whether you are checking on property you own, or
   are simply interested in a piece of property you have seen, we have
   assembled the following maps and search engines to help you with your
   research:
     * GIS Property Search (Parcel Locators) (maps and descriptions of
       individual parcels).
     * Development Conditions Search Engine (showing p-suffix information
       and special district overlays).
     * County-wide Zoning Map (showing parcel specific zoning)
     * County-wide Land Use Map (showing larger zoning configurations).
     * Recent Incorporations (Complete with Boundary Maps)
     * Annexation and Incorporation Activity Within King County

   If you need assistance with any of these applications, please send us
   an e-mail and DDES staff will respond to you quickly.
