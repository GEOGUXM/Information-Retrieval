Nutrients

   The Bay was listed as an "impaired water body" under the Clean Water
   Act due to low dissolved oxygen that has killed fish and other
   organisms. Nutrient sources in the watershed must be further reduced to
   meet new dissolved oxygen standards by 2010. Enhanced predictive tools
   are needed to simulate the relation between nutrient sources and
   delivery to the bay, monitoring must be expanded to document and
   evaluate water-quality improvement, and studies must be conducted to
   understand the processes affecting nutrient delivery to the bay. The
   USGS will help meet these needs by:
     * Partnering with the CBP to refine the Chesapeake Bay Watershed
       Model (Phase 5) to improve simulation of nutrient sources and their
       delivery to the bay.
     * Linking information on ground-water discharge, loads, and residence
       times to improve simulation of nutrient delivery to streams in the
       watershed model.
     * Developing a watershed-monitoring network to document improvements
       in water quality and enhance monitoring and trend analysis of
       nutrients in the watershed.
     * Conducting investigations of nutrient dynamics in streams to
       determine their effect on biological communities.

   Please visit the Programs and Projects page to find links to the USGS
   programs that monitor the nutrients in the Bay. For links and
   information on various USGS data and spatial information sites on the
   Bay area's water quality and nutrients visit the Data page. Many
   reports and publications are available visit the Publications page to
   find them.

   We welcome comments and suggestions on this redesigned site.
