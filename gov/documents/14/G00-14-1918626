              Amendments to the Rules of Practice and Procedure

      Several amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure took effect on
    December 1, 2001, including changes to Rules 5, 6, 65, 77, 81 and 82.
      The amendments will govern all proceedings commenced on or after
   December 1, 2001, and "insofar as just and practicable" all proceedings
       then pending. The text of the amended rules can be found on the
                 judiciary's Federal Rulemaking web site at
                       http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/.

       As of January 2002, copies of the 2001 revised Local Rules are
          available at each of our clerk's offices free of charge.
