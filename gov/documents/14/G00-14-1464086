   What is Spinal Cord Injury?
   Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs when a traumatic event results in
   damage to cells within the spinal cord or severs the nerve tracts that
   relay signals up and down the spinal cord. The most common types of SCI
   include contusion (bruising of the spinal cord) and compression (caused
   by pressure on the spinal cord). Other types of injuries include
   lacerations (severing or tearing of some nerve fibers, such as damage
   caused by a gun shot wound), and central cord syndrome (specific damage
   to the corticospinal tracts of the cervical region of the spinal cord).
   Severe SCI often causes paralysis (loss of control over voluntary
   movement and muscles of the body) and loss of sensation and reflex
   function below the point of injury, including autonomic activity such
   as breathing and other activities such as bowel and bladder control.
   Other symptoms such as pain or sensitivity to stimuli, muscle spasms,
   and sexual dysfunction may develop over time. SCI patients are also
   prone to develop secondary medical problems, such as bladder
   infections, lung infections, and bed sores.

   Is there any treatment?
   While recent advances in emergency care and rehabilitation allow many
   SCI patients to survive, methods for reducing the extent of injury and
   for restoring function are still limited. Immediate treatment for acute
   SCI includes techniques to relieve cord compression, prompt (within 8
   hours of the injury) drug therapy with corticosteroids such as
   methylprednisolone to minimize cell damage, and stabilization of the
   vertebrae of the spine to prevent further injury.

   What is the prognosis?
   The types of disability associated with SCI vary greatly depending on
   the severity of the injury, the segment of the spinal cord at which the
   injury occurs, and which nerve fibers are damaged. Most people with SCI
   regain some functions between a week and 6 months after injury, but the
   likelihood of spontaneous recovery diminishes after 6 months.
   Rehabilitation strategies can minimize long-term disability.

   What research is being done?
   NINDS research on trauma-related disorders such as SCI focuses on
   increasing scientific understanding of how changes in molecules, cells,
   and their complex interactions determine the outcome of SCI, and
   finding ways to prevent and treat these injuries. There is also
   increasing interest in neural stem and progenitor cells and their
   potential application in cell replacement therapies for the treatment
   of complex neurological disorders such as SCI.
