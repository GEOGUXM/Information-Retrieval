     In 1997, HPCC in conjunction with the NOAA Network Operations Center
     (NOC), created the Silver Spring Campus Web Farm Virtual Hosting
     Services to test and evaluate the benefits and/or drawbacks of
     consolidating multiple NOAA web sites in one location. The virtual
     hosting services at that time consisted of a single server that
     hosted three NOAA web sites.

     Over the years the virtual hosting concept demonstrated its value as
     a web site management paradigm in several ways. First, by
     consolidating their web sites on the "Farm," NOAA organizations were
     able to realize cost savings in hardware and personnel associated
     with the administration of web servers. Some users decommissioned
     their existing UNIX web servers after moving to the web farm. Others
     were able to avoid entirely, the need to acquire, maintain and
     operate expensive web servers.

     Secondly, because the Web Farm virtual server was connected to a
     secure isolated network, it offered additional security and a more
     robust, higher speed connection to the Internet.

     Today, the "Farm" virtual hosting servers are managed by HPCC and
     house over 52 NOAA web sites on various platforms including NT and
     UNIX workstations. In the near future, HPCC plans to test and
     evaluate the merits of LINUX servers.
