   What Does The Business, Transportation & Housing Agency Do?

   There are 14 departments within the Business, Transportation and
   Housing Agency (BT&H). We oversee and direct the administration of our
   departments, and act as a liaison between them and the Governor's
   Office.

   Our Agency oversees programs that plan, build, and maintain
   California's transportation systems, that ensure efficient and fair
   markets for the real estate industry, and that assist state and
   community efforts to expand the availability of affordable housing for
   a growing workforce.

   The Agency also regulates managed health care plans as well as the
   banking, and financial and securities industries. We contribute to
   public safety through the law enforcement activities of the California
   Highway Patrol and the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.

   Most important, we are here to carry out the Governor's vision for
   business, transportation and housing in California.
