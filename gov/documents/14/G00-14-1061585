Introduction

     Fig.1 This page is a CGI interface to my program GID_sl simulating
   dynamical x-ray diffraction from strained crystals, multilayers, and
   superlattices. The name 'GID_sl' comes from the original aim of this
   program to simulate grazing incidence x-ray diffraction from
   multilayers and superlattices [1-3]. Later on, GID_sl was extended to
   extremely asymmetric geometries and usual Bragg-case [4]. At present
   this program is applicable to any coplanar and non-coplanar Bragg-case
   geometry with diffraction scans round arbitrary axes. Some typical
   examples of grazing-incidence geometries where the GID_sl can be used
   are shown on Fig.1.

   The program can simulate the following profiles of structure parameters
   and defects in multilayers:
    1. Normal lattice strains, da(z)/a;
    2. Crystal polarizabilities x0(z), xh(z), [chi[0], chi[h]] including
       the Debye-Waller profiles wh(z), w0(z);
    3. Interface roughness sigma(z) in multilayers.

   The effects of lateral strains (relaxed multilayers, misfit
   dislocations, etc) or crystal curvature are NOT simulated by this code.
   GID_sl is not aimed either for the truncation rod scattering (for very
   big deviations from Bragg peaks).

   The program implements a "discrete" algorithm, i.e. the surface layer
   of crystal is subdivided onto "perfect" sublayers, each one possessing
   its own x0, xh, normal strain da/a, thickness t, and the rms height
   sigma of interface roughness. After solving the dynamical diffraction
   problem for each of the layers, the reflection from the whole system is
   calculated with the help of the (2x2) recursive matrix algorithm, RMA
   [6], which is a development of our earlier (4x4) transfer matrix
   approach, TMA [1-5]. While the TMA was an extension to the Abeles
   matrix solution [7] for x-ray specular reflection by multilayers, and
   the RMA can be viewed as a generalization of Parratt's and Bartels'
   recursive methods [8,9] for the specular reflection and non-grazing
   Bragg diffraction by multilayers respectively. The RMA works about 2
   times slower than the TMA, but it is free of some principal
   divergencies which might happen with the TMA. In fact, GID_sl
   dynamically selects between the TMA and RMA depending on the conditions
   of calculations.

   Acknowledgments: The idea of this X-ray Web Server appeared under the
   influence of excellent x-ray server by Eric Gullikson at the LBL. The
   solution to the plots outputs was prompted by William Lavender. Some
   ideas on making GID_sl user-friendly were suggested by Pavel Petrashen.
   I am grateful to all of my co-authors listed in the References below
   and to many others for the collaboration and helpful discussions
   resulted in the development of the TMA and RMA methods. Finally, since
   the server was launched, I have received a number of valuable comments
   and suggestions from many users. This response cannot be overestimated
   because it helps to improve the algorithms, extend the services and
   avoid possible bugs. Among many othes I am especialy grateful to Dr.
   Marius Grundmann for the communication helped to extend the
   calculations to larger strains and for comparing GID_sl with available
   commercial software [10].

Program Guide

   This short guide provides some explanations on the GID_sl data input
   and outlines the restrictions of this Web interface.

   The GID_sl program is executed on my PC, which runs a Web server under
   Windows-98. Since this old 166Mhz PC is shared by all of the WEB users
   of my x-ray library, please, avoid overloading the server by running
   multiple tasks at the same time.

   To obtain the results from GID_sl one needs to fill out the input form
   and click on the SUBMIT button. If the input is correct, the results
   will be presented as a figure and a reference to downloadable ZIP file
   containing the data and the listing of calculation parameters.
   Otherwise, an error message will be returned.

   The specification of x-rays should not cause any problems. If mixed
   polarization is chosen, the results for sigma- and pi- polarizations
   are added with the weight contributions 1/(1+|cos(2*QB)|) and
   |cos(2*QB)|/ (1+|cos(2*QB)|), respectively. The weights are
   interchanged for the special case of scan which simulates GID takeoff
   spectra measured with position-sensitive detector (PSD). In these
   measurements the monochromator is turned by 90 degr. and it collimates
   the incidence angle instead of beam divergence in the Bragg plane.

   The crystal substrate material is specified by the "crystal code"
   referring to the X0h database which is used for automatic calculation
   of the scattering and absorption factors x0 and xh (chi[ 0] and chi[
   h]) respectively. See the X0h page for more information on the
   scattering factors calculations. Here is the list of crystals currently
   available in the X0h database.

   Then, "Reflection" stands for the Miller indices of the Bragg
   reflection; "Sigma" is the rms height of substrate roughness expressed
   in Angstrom; "W0" and "Wh" are the Debye-Waller like corrections to the
   values provided by the X0h database for x0 and xh respectively.
   Finally, "da/a" is the correction to the Bragg planes spacing (the X0h
   data are used as a reference value).

   The geometry of Bragg diffraction can be specified by 9 different ways.
   Basically one has to distinguish between the coplanar diffraction cases
   (those where the incident wave vector k[0], the reciprocal lattice
   vector h, and the diffracted wave vector k[h] lay in the same plane
   perpendicular to the surface -- Fig.1a) and the non-coplanar cases
   (Fig.1b,c) where the above condition is not satisfied, i.e. the
   scattering plane defined by k[0] and h is not perpendicular to the
   surface. The coplanar geometries are more commonly used in the x-ray
   experiments since they are simpler to implement. On the other hand, the
   non-coplanar geometries provide a greater flexibility in choosing the
   x-ray incidence and exit angles as well as in scanning around the Bragg
   peaks.

   If one knows the orientation of crystal surface, then the coplanar
   diffraction cases (Fig.1a) can be specified as either grazing
   incidence, or grazing exit, or the symmetric Bragg case. In the latter
   case the Bragg planes must be chosen parallel to the surface.

   New of April-2001: Four simplified inputs were added to define the
   coplanar diffraction geometries. Those do not requre the knowledge of
   crystal surface orientation, but instead thy expect one of the four
   parameters: either the incidence angle of k[0], or the exit angle of
   k[h], or disorientation angle of the Bragg planes, or the asymmetry
   factor beta=g[0]/g[h]. Use the SIMPLIFIED TEMPLATES below to access the
   new interfaces.

   The non-coplanar cases (Fig.1b,c) always require the specification of
   crystal surface orientation and an additional parameter -- either the
   incidence or exit angle for the exact kinematical Bragg position (the
   actual position of the Bragg peak may deviate from the kinematical
   value due to refraction). The specification of additional angle is not
   required for symmetric non-coplanar cases (Fig.1c). The grazing
   incidence diffraction geometry (Fig.1b) as a particular case of
   non-coplanar geometries, always requires specifying the incidence or
   exit angle of x-rays. A common mistake is specifying GID as a symmetric
   Bragg case. Then, as one can see on Fig.1b, the incidence and exit
   angle will be taken zero. This happens because GID is a symmetric Laue
   case, not the Bragg one, and the wave yielding the crystal in GID is a
   specular component of diffracted wave, not the real one.

   For more details on the specification of coplanar and non-coplanar
   geometries to GID_sl click here.

   Here are some examples for GaAs crystal with the (001) surface plane
   specified:
     * The (004) reflection can only be specified as a symmetric Bragg
       case (there is no choice).
     * Reflection (113) can be specified as an extremely asymmetric
       coplanar case with grazing incidence. For E=8.5 keV this gives the
       incidence angle of 0.09 degr.
     * If a higher incidence angle is required, one can proceed to
       non-coplanar case and select the incidence angle equal to e.g. 1.00
       degree.
     * Finally, the same (113) plane can be brought into the symmetric
       non-coplanar geometry (in this case the incidence and exit angles
       will be equal to 22.77 degr.)

   The crystal surface orientation (if needed) is specified via the
   indices of external surface normal, the angle and the direction of
   maximum miscut. Please, do not specify non-integer indices if the
   miscut direction does not coincide with some crystallographic axis: use
   an integer approximation instead. Example: enter (111 322 4) instead of
   (1.11 3.22 0.04).

   Fig.2 The scan axis for coplanar cases is usually a vector
   perpendicular the scattering plane and parallel to the surface. Such a
   vector can be presented as [k0 x h] or [k0 x N_surface] -- Fig.2. For
   the grazing incidence diffraction (Fig.1b) the scan vector is usually
   N_surface (the crystal is rotated round the surface normal). GID_sl can
   also simulate the special case of GID where the incidence beam is not
   collimated in the Bragg plane and the sample is not scanned. Instead of
   scanning, the diffraction curve is recorded by PSD. For other
   non-coplanar cases there is a choice of several "natural" scan axes, or
   an arbitrary axis can be specified (please, use integer indices).

   The scan range is that around the Bragg peak along chosen scan axis.
   The GID_sl allows plotting the diffraction curve depending on the scan
   angle, the incidence angle, or the exit angle. However, in all of the
   cases one has to specify the scan range as the deviations from the
   Bragg peak. It is a frequent mistake when users request the plot
   depending on the incidence angle of x-ray and then attempt to specify
   the incidence angles in the scan range fields.

   The specification of crystal surface layer profile is implemented with
   a simple script language. A typical syntax is:

;
!
period=5
t=10 code=GaAs x0=(5e-4,7e-6) xh=(3e-4,5e-6) xhdf=1. w0=1, wh=.5 da/a=2e-4 sigma
=2
t=10 code=GaAs x=0.3 code2=AlAs x2=0.7 w0=1, da/a=auto,  sigma=2
t=10 wh=.5 da/a=2e-4 sigma=2
t=10 da/a=2e-4
t=10
end period

   -- where:
     * ";" and "!" are the comment signs. The lines starting with these
       symbols are ignored and if these symbols are present at the middle
       of a line, everything to the right of them is ignored too.
     * "period=" and "end period" mark the beginning and the end of a
       periodic group of layers. The maximum of two enclosed periods is
       allowed.
     * "t=10" is the layer thickness in Angstroms. NOTE: this is the only
       parameter of layer which cannot be skipped.
     * "code=" is a code of material in the X0h database. Use this code
       for automatic calculation of layers x0 and xh (chi[0] and chi[h]).
       For the reference of available codes see the menu for the
       substrate. Please, be advised that the codes are case sensitive
       (while the script keywords are not).
       If none code is specified, the substrate code is used by default.
       NOTE: the choice of crystal code does not affect the value of
       lattice spacing in the layer used by GID_sl. Initially, the Bragg
       spacings for all the layers are set equal to that in the substrate
       and their variation is solely specified through the parameter
       "da/a".
     * "x=",   "code2=",   "x2=",   "code3="   are the parameters to
       specify composite materials and solid solutions. For example, a
       structure like Ga[0.3]Al[0.7]As can be specified as: "code=GaAs
       x=0.3 code2=AlAs", or even shrter: "x=0.3 code2=AlAs". One can also
       specify "x2=0.7", but this is redundant, because the program
       automatically takes care of the sum of all "xN" being equal to one
       (e.g. the input like "x2=0.8" in the above example would cause an
       error message). Maximum of 4 codes are allowed and all of them must
       be valid ones in the X0h database.
     * "x0=" and "xh=" are the layer chi[0] and chi[h]. These parameters,
       when specified, replace the data given by the X0h database.
     * "xhdf=" is the difference in the phases of real and imaginary parts
       of chi[h] (divided by pi). This is an additional data to "xh=" in
       the case of non-centrosymmetric crystals. For centrosymmetric
       crystals one has either xhdf=0, or xhdf=1 (depending on the Bragg
       reflection).
     * "w0=" and "wh=" are Debye-Waller-like factors for x0 and xh. They
       may be used to correct the x0 and xh values provided by the X0H
       database:
                   x0=w0*x0
                   xh=wh*xh

       By default, these factors are equal to one. Unlike the usual
       Debye-Waller factors, w0 and wh can be greater than one, because
       they simply provide one more way to specify x0 and xh.
       HINT: use wh=0 to specify amorphous layers (e.g. surface oxide
       films) or the layers where Bragg planes are very far from the Bragg
       condition.
     * "da/a=" is the relative variation on perpendicular lattice spacing
       in the layer with respect to the reference value (which is usually
       the value in the substrate). The specification "da/a=a" or
       "da/a=auto" causes the automatic calculation of da/a of the layer
       with respect to the substrate via the diffrence of the free-state
       lattice parameters of the substrate and the layer and Poisson
       ration for the layer. In this case the layer must be specified by a
       code in the X0h database (or several codes in the case of a
       composite layer). The automatic calculation can be used for cubic
       structures only, since for the other structure symmetries the
       Poisson ratio is not relevant.
     * "sigma=" is the rms roughness at the upper layer interface
       expressed in Angstroms. This value should not exceed the layer
       thickness. Besides, the values of sigma > 5A should be used with
       care, since GID_sl accounts for roughness with a method [3] similar
       to that by Nevot and Croce, which presumes small roughness.

   Here is a practical example -- a profile for 20-period AlAs/GaAs
   superlattice with 100 Angstroms of GaAs and 70 Angstroms of AlAs in
   each period; the structure is covered by additional 200A of GaAs and,
   finally, there is some 20A amorphous oxide layer on the surface:
; Oxide layer:
t=20. w0=0.7 wh=0.
; -- w0=0.7 because of reduced layer density
; -- wh=0 since the layer is amorphous

; Cap layer:
t=200.
; -- when the code is not specified, the substrate code (GaAs) is used

; Superlattice:
period=20
  t=100.
  t=70. code=AlAs da/a=2.775e-3
  ; The strain value is taken from Bocchi et al., J.Cryst.Growth, 132 (1993) 427
end period

   For the rest of parameters users are suggested to follow their common
   sense. To ensure that the input was correct, please verify respective
   listing file -- a file with the ".TBL" extension in the ZIPped archive
   returned by GID_sl.

Access to GID_sl

   To simplify understanding the GID_sl interface, users are provided with
   the templates listed below. All of the templates link to the same
   program and provide the same functionality (except for the simplified
   templates which are designed for coplanar diffraction only). The
   templates differ by preloaded data to demonstrate some possible
   applications of the GID_sl.

   When submitting the GID_sl task, it is possible to check the progress
   watching option. The progress watching is obviously more comfortable,
   but it might not work with some old Web browsers. Also, it is a bit
   slower because of putting an additional load on the network and
   launching each 5 seconds a status query program on my computer. Welcome
   to try both of the ways and choose the most convenient for your needs.

                         (coplanar geometries only)

   1. Symmetric Bragg diffraction from perfect crystals
          Use this to check the width and shape of Darwin curves and to
          analyze monochromator crystals.


   2. Symmetric Bragg diffraction from multilayers and superlattices
          This template can be used for unrelaxed semiconductor structures
          where no misfit dislocations are present. The example structures
          are A3B5, A2B6, SiGe, etc.

   1. Symmetric Bragg diffraction from perfect crystals
          Use this to check the width and shape of Darwin curves and to
          analyze monochromator crystals.


   2. Symmetric Bragg diffraction from multilayers and superlattices
          This template can be used for unrelaxed A3B5, A2B6, SiGe and
          other semiconductor structures as an example.


   3. Coplanar extremely asymmetric diffraction of synchrotron radiation
          See Fig.1a; the template is filled for a monochromator, but this

          semiconductor multilayers.


   4. Grazing incidence ("surface") diffraction from perfect crystals

   5. Grazing incidence ("surface") diffraction from multilayers in the
          scheme with position sensitive detector (PSD)
          See Fig.1b; this kind of scheme is often used for studies of
          semiconductor multilayers by several groups in Germany.


   6. Non-coplanar Bragg-Laue diffraction from crystals with a few degrees
          surface miscut
          See Fig.1c; the template is filled for symmetric Bragg case and
          it is aimed at demonstrating the Yoneda effect on the tail of
          Darwin curve. You can easily modify it for extremely asymmetric
          case with grazing incidence or exit by choosing respective
          incidence or exit angle in the geometry specification.

Retrieve results

   Here is a tool to retrieve the results of finished jobs if you know the
   job ID. Some possible uses of this tool are:
    1. You started a job with the progress watch option; the server
       returned the job ID and began reporting the progress. However, you
       found that the calculations would take too long. Then, you may
       break the connection and retrieve the data later on with this tool.
       If the calculations are not finished, the tool will resume the
       watch process.
    2. The data are accidentally deleted from your client computer and you
       want another copy of them. In this case you should be aware that
       results are usually stored on the server for about one day after
       respective job is finished.
