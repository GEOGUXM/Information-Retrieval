            Wind Energy Technology (WET) Subject Portal Site Help

General Information

   The Wind Energy Technology (WET) Subject Portal site is a searchable
   gateway that integrates diverse WET resources into one location. It
   provides a means of searching and accessing databases that can be
   linked to or searched via either the WET distributed search engine or
   the WAIS search engine that retrieves information from the WET Archive.
   Information on the WET Subject Portal Web site appears below.

New Releases

   The WET New Releases brings together technical report and journal
   literature entered into the DOE Information Bridge and PubSCIENCE
   within the past six months. This page, which is updated biweekly,
   highlights new information of interest to WET users. When updated, the
   last two weeks of New Releases are removed from this list but remain
   available through the DOE Information Bridge and PubSCIENCE.

The Distributed Search

   The Distributed Search button takes you to a list of databases that
   contain WET information and can be searched as a single database or in
   parallel with the Distributed Explorer search engine. Each of the
   target resources must have a search functionality on the host server
   for its Web site or a database built and maintained within the
   parameters of a database management software. Distributed Explorer will
   then "talk" to each of these target search engines, causing them to, in
   turn, query their own Web sites or databases. The results are returned
   via the Distributed Explorer technology to the common interface on WET.

Search Tips

   You may choose which combination of databases you want to search.
   Simply click on the check boxes of the sites you wish to query; the
   system will put a checkmark in that box and include that server or
   database in the final search. Use the "Clear" button to search or mark
   new sources.

   The WET Subject Portal site utilizes the function of the individual
   server and database searches. All search capabilities and options may
   not be available for each database. Specifics on each database and a
   link to each site may be found under Database Description.

   While the target Web sites may employ different search options, the
   following search tips are generally true:

     * Limiting the number of collections searched at one time will return
       faster results.
     * Full text is searched when it is searchable in the individual
       database.
     * Author and title searches are an option for most databases.
     * The search engine is not case sensitive; you may enter either case.
     * Single word or word phrases may be entered in the query box to
       submit.
     * If a phrase is entered, the "And" operator is assumed.
     * The "Or" operator is recognized and will work regardless of "case."
     * The wildcard character * (asterisk) may be used to match the word
       stem.

     Search Examples:

          photons and colliders

          photons or electrons

          linear colliders

          comput*

   The resulting document titles or "hits" from your search query will be
   segmented by database.   You may specify how many items you wish to
   have displayed from each database, up to 250. However, there are cases
   in which a target database has its own rules about how many documents
   can be returned. In those cases, the target's rules override the
   functionality of the WET Network.

   Distributed searching, of necessity, exposes the differences between
   databases. The WET Subject Portal site sorts your results by target
   resource. This will help you to see these kinds of differences between
   sites.

   Distributed Explorer

   Distributed Explorer is a system that provides a common user interface
   for searching and retrieving information across heterogeneous datasets
   over the Internet. Distributed Explorer can be configured to access a
   variety of Web databases, independent of the full-text search engine or
   database package being used. Distributed Explorer is driven by a set of
   configuration files that define how Distributed Explorer interacts with
   the full-text search engine of the Web database being searched. Access
   to these Web databases is performed at a low-level using libwww, a
   software library that is able to interact with Web servers simulating
   user input into the search form of the Web database being accessed.

   A configuration file must be written for each Web database being
   accessed.   The configuration file specifies the parameters that must
   be specified to access search form. The configuration file also
   specifies how to parse the result list that is returned by the search
   software of each Web database being accessed. This is needed to be able
   to extract an author, title, etc. from each result list item.

   Distributed Explorer does not index any of the Web databases that it
   provides access to. User search requests are translated by the
   Distributed Explorer server into the syntax that is understood by the
   search engine of the Web database being searched. Search requests are
   submitted in parallel to the various databases selected by the user.

   Search the Archives  WAIS

   Searching with a single term (oil):

   Type a single word such as oil into the blank "Search terms(s)" line of
   the form and then click on the Submit Query button. The next screen you
   see will be the search results screen.

   Searching for/with a multiple-word term/phrase (oil ADJ deposits, not
   oil deposits):

   Use ADJ between the two or three words in your phrase (oil ADJ
   refining). The capitalized ADJ tells the WAIS software to retrieve only
   those documents in which these two words appear adjacent to each other
   somewhere in the full text.

   Note: If you forget to insert ADJ, the WAIS software will automatically
   assume an OR between the words in your phrase (multiple-word term).
   This may bring you a much larger set of search results than you want.

   Searching with Boolean Logic (AND, ADJ, OR, NOT):

   Boolean logic will help you narrow and focus your searches to limit the
   number of documents you retrieve.
     * Use AND (capitalized) between words when you want to retrieve all
       documents that mention both terms and you don't care if the two
       terms appear next to each other.
     * ADJ allows you to retrieve only those documents in which the two or
       more search terms you input are adjacent to each other somewhere in
       the full text.
     * OR retrieves every document in which one of the words in your
       search appears as well as every document in which both words
       appear. As a result, you may have many documents returned.
     * NOT is useful if you want to deliberately exclude a set of
       documents that you think might otherwise show up in your search;
       for example, you may search waste NOT nuclear

   When forming complex queries, ones that use more than one Boolean
   operator, it is generally best to use parentheses around pairs or
   groups of terms that are, in turn, joined by a Boolean operator; for
   example: (snowstorms OR tornadoes OR hurricanes) AND (safety ADJ
   procedures).

   Ensuring you retrieve all spellings of your search term (Stemming with
   wildcards):

   You can do one search that retrieves all words beginning with a
   particular stem by adding an asterisk (*) at the end of the word stem.
   The asterisk acts as a wildcard.
