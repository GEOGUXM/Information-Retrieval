     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Surface waters, sediments, and sediment pore
     waters were collected from the Burt-Izard drain, which transects the
     ASARCO Omaha facility, and from the Missouri River adjacent to the
     facility. Groundwater was also collected from the facility. Waters
     and sediments were analyzed for inorganic contaminants, and the
     toxicity of the waters was evaluated with the Ceriodaphnia dubia
     7-day test. Concentrations of several elemental contaminants of
     concern were highly elevated in the groundwater, but not in sediment
     pore waters. Lead concentrations were moderately elevated in whole
     sediment at one site, but lead concentrations in pore waters were
     low due to apparent sequestration by acid volatile sulfides.

     The groundwater sample was highly toxic to Ceriodaphnia dubia,
     causing 100% mortality. Survival was reduced relative to controls
     (100% survival) at all dilutions. Even when diluted to 6.25% with
     reconstituted river water, Ceriodaphnia survival was only 78% in
     groundwater; however, Ceriodaphnia reproduction in the 6.25%
     dilution was not significantly different from upstream porewater
     reference samples. Reproduction in pore water collected from one
     downstream site was somewhat reduced. This difference was
     significantly different from one upstream reference but not from the
     other. However, reduced reproduction at this site could not be
     attributed to measured elemental contaminants.
