   Hanford's Decision Level for Alpha Spectrometry Bioassay Analyses Based
   on the Sample Specific Total Propagated Uncertainty J.A. MacLellan,
   Radiation and Health Technology Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
   Richland, Washington 99352. The bioassay program for the entire Hanford
   workforce is managed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
   Until April 2000, the decision levels by which samples containing
   elevated quantities of radioactive material were identified were all
   specified in the contract with the analytical laboratory as absolute
   activity values. The contract specified an upper bound for the minimum
   detectable activity (MDA) for each analysis (the contract limit), and
   established the decision level at one-half the contract limit (CL). For
   most alpha spectrometry analyses the CL was 0.02 dpm per sample. The
   decision level was applied to the activity result, rather than the
   count data. The detection criterion was therefore insensitive to sample
   specific variables such as chemical yield and detector efficiency. In
   order to select a better procedure, an investigation of the ANSI N13.30
   and other proposed decision level equations was initiated (Strom and
   MacLellan, 2000). The investigation concluded that the ANSI N13.30
   equation significantly underestimates the number of false positive
   results. The maximum number of false-positive results peaks at about
   one background count during the counting period, but remains
   significant up to an expected 100 counts. The ANSI N13.30 equation
   answers the question "For a given background count rate, how large a
   net count will be observed less than "alpha" percent of the time, if
   there is no activity in the sample?" An equation proposed by Altshuler
   and Pasternack in 1963 (Eq.1) was found to be far superior: 2 k k = k
   2n a + 1+ a 1 a b Eq. 1 8n 8n b b where -1 is the decision level, nb is
   the background count, and k is the abscissa of the standardized normal
   distribution corresponding to the probability level 1 - . That equation
   answers the question "How much activity can be in a sample, and the
   confidence interval for the net count still include zero?" The decision
   level obtained from the Altshuler and Pasternack equation remains
   unbiased down to an expected three counts during the counting period.
   The concept of the Altshuler and Pasternack (1963) equation was adopted
   for the Hanford bioassay program, but an additional simplification was
   incorporated. The actual form of the equation used in our previous
   investigation calculates the decision level based only on the number of
   observed background counts. However, the original form of the equation
   used in the derivation equates the decision level with a multiple of
   the standard deviation estimate of a net count value (-1). That is, the
   decision level is derived from the following equation: = k n + = k 1 a
   b n g + 2 a 1 b n Eq. 2 where ng is the gross count, nb is the
   background count, and (ng+nb) is used as the estimate of the net count
   variance. Equation 1 is derived by solving Equation 2 for -1. Hanford
   uses Lc to represent the decision level, rather than -1. The Hanford
   bioassay contract requires an estimate of the total propagated
   uncertainty (TPU) for each result reported, and the analytical
   laboratory uses the following equation for that calculation: t t a a C
   + C × C + C × a ba t bt t t Eq. 3 b b 2 2 2 TPU = AC [ + + U + U + U C
   - C C - C a ba ]2 [ t bt ]2 v t S where, (C - a C ba ) AC 1 = × ( A × C
   - C V t ) t bt a At =Yield monitor activity Ca = gross counts in the
   sample region of interest (ROI) Cb = gross background counts in the
   sample or tracer ROI, as appropriate Cba = background gross counts in
   the sample ROI for the same counting time as the sample, Cba = Cb x
   (ta/tb). Cbt = background gross counts in the yield monitor ROI for the
   same counting time as the sample, Cbt = (ta/tb). Ct = gross counts in
   the yield monitor ROI. tb = background counting time in minutes. ta =
   sample counting time in minutes. Va = sample size in the appropriate
   reporting units. e.g. grams, kg, etc. Us = systematic procedure error,
   typically 3% (0.03) Ut = random tracer-activity error, typically 3%
   (0.03) Uv = random volume-measurement error, estimated to be 1.5%
   (0.015). It is therefore simple to implement a sample specific decision
   level based on the TPU. Rather than using equation 1 , Hanford alpha
   spectrometry decision levels are set from equation 2, substituting the
   TPU for the radical. A kI value of 2 was chosen in order to maintain
   the average decision level near historic levels. The decision level
   then takes the following simple form: LC = 2(TPU) Eq. 4 This decision
   level has been used by many laboratories in its empirical form for many
   years. With this equation, about two percent of the results are
   expected to be false positives assuming a normal distribution of the
   net count. Table 1 is a summary of data produced by a Monte Carlo
   simulation program (Crystal Ball ) when the alpha spectrometry process
   was modeled, and the Altshuler and Pasternack decision rule applied.
   The model assumes a 2500-minute count time, 70% chemical yield, and 32%
   detector efficiency. All count data are assumed to follow a Poisson
   distribution, chemical yield a normal distribution, and detector
   efficiency a triangular distribution. The count uncertainty is by far
   the most significant contributor to the total propagated uncertainty.
   The Hanford decision level methodology is expected to provide an
   unbiased decision level at least down to 3 background counts, and will
   not result in excessive false positive results even for detectors with
   a background count of one. Decisioneering, Denver, CO. Table 1.
