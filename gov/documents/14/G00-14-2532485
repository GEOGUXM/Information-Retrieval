Overview

   The Recycler is an 8 GeV kinetic energy antiproton storage ring of
   circumference 3.3 km built only with permanent magnets. In order to
   efficiently cool antiprotons recycled from the Tevatron Collider and
   fight intrabeam scattering during storage, electron cooling is desired.
   The sketch above shows an inline tandem electrostatic accelerator which
   guides a 4.3 MeV kinetic energy cold electron beam parallel to the hot
   antiproton beam. It is in the drift tube that the heat transfer takes
   place which cools the antiproton momentum and transverse distributions.

   This project is the first attempt at acheiving medium energy electron
   cooling. Previous electron cooling systems were built at an order of
   magnitude lower beam energy. Therefore, a number of technologies for
   accelerating cold electron beams are (or have been) under
   investigation. They are listed below in order of favor, where the
   criteria for favor include technical feasibility, beam dynamics
   considerations, civil construction cost, reliability, etc.
    1. Inline Tandem Electrostatic Pelletron
    2. Vertical Tandem Electrostatic Pelletron
    3. Fast Cycling Modified Betatron
    4. Inline Tandem with Solid Multilayer HV Insulation
    5. Rapid Firing Induction Linac with Stretcher Ring
    6. Conventional Linac and Storage Ring
