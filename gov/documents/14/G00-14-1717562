   The Work Stoppages Program provides information on major work
   stoppages. These are stoppages that involve 1,000 workers or more and
   last a full shift or longer. Because of the complexity of disputes, BLS
   does not attempt to distinguish between strikes and lockouts in its
   data; both are included in the term "work stoppages."

   The Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) program gathers agreements
   for bargaining units of 1,000 or more workers.
