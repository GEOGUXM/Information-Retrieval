Searches Using Explorer

   From within any document under Explorer the search screen may be
   accessed by clicking on the Search button on the Explorer Tool Bar. On
   the search screen click once in the search criteria field, type the
   words or phrases for your query, and click on the Submit button to
   launch the search.

   Explorer returns a list of documents arranged by score in descending
   order (1.00 is highest). From this results list, click on the
   highlighted ID for the document you wish to view.

   Most documents under Explorer are in ASCII or PDF format. To return to
   the results list from within a document, close the Acrobat Reader (in
   the case of a PDF document) or use the Up button on the Explorer Tool
   Bar.

   Focus and refine your searches by becoming familiar with the examples
   hyperlink found on all Explorer search form screens and by reading the
   following tips. The more you fine tune your queries, the greater your
   success will be in finding the exact information you need.

   To avoid long irrelevant results lists focus your query by using more
   specific terms and various operators. If you are getting little or no
   results from a search query, try broadening your search using stemming
   and wild cards, or by simply broadening your terms.

   Searches under Explorer are not case sensitive. The search results list
   will be the same regardless of whether you use uppercase or lowercase
   letters in your query.

   The TOPIC search engine that underlies Explorer uses stemming. The
   search engine will automatically search for multiple stems of words in
   any query submitted. To avoid stemming and search for an exact phrase
   only, enclose your query entry in double quotes.

   The default connector for words in a phrase is <or>. To override this
   default and search for an exact word or phrase enclose your query in
   double quotes.
