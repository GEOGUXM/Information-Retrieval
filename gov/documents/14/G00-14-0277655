MBDA MED Week 2001 Discussion Brief - Automotive Industry

New findings link strategic opportunities for minority businesses and the
Automotive Industry.

   September 21st, 2001

   Long-term competitiveness of a corporation lies in developing business
   models which create both shareholder and stakeholder value
     * Minority Business Development initiatives creates value for both
       shareholders and key stakeholders
     * Automotive Manufacturers realize the strategic value of Minority
       Businesses


   Automotive Manufacturers are in search for new market revenue
   opportunities
     * Minority Automotive markets are estimated at $112 Billion and
       growing
     * Minority consumers will account for significant share of future
       revenues


   Positive correlation exists between market share gains and minority
   suppliers and dealers development
     * Minority suppliers and dealers contribute to Automotive Revenues


   Minority suppliers weak value chain positioning largely a function of
   current metrics and measurements
     * Focuses on "quantity of spend" rather than "quality of spend"
     * Metrics not reflective of industry realities Supply Chain
       transformation and competitive dynamics


   Automotive Industry experiencing a slowdown in sales from record sales
   year in 2000
     * Industry analysts forecast continued sales decline through 2003


   Slowdown has created a difficult business environment for small to
   mid-sized businesses
     * Minority suppliers not immune to these problems


   Evolving Supply Chain roles present challenges to MBEs in Tier I
   positions
     * Higher degree of cost surveillance, high demands for investment in
       innovation and manufacturing
     * Some MBEs will have to focus on Tier I and II Suppliers to achieve
       sustainable growth
     * Tier I Suppliers beginning to push cost pressures down the Supply
       Chain


   Operating risks associate with industry sales slowdown can be reduced
   through diversification
     * By platform, customer group and targeting Tier I Suppliers


   Growth opportunities identified in different areas of the Supply Chain
     * Will require focused strategies to achieve sustainable value
       creation
