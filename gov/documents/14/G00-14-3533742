   To place an order, go to the detail page of the publication you wish to

   publications ordered is listed at the top of each page in the yellow
   bar. You may order 1 copy each of up to 10 items from the Web site.

   When you select items to order, the option to view, edit, or submit the
   order will appear in the yellow bar at the top of the page. You may
   remove items from the order list by clicking on the appropriate links
   on the publication detail page or the order form page.

   Once the list of publications to be ordered is correct, complete the
   rest of the order form and click the button labeled "Place this order."
   This will send the order to the HRSA Information Center. After clicking
   this button, you will see an order confirmation page with a list of
   what was ordered and the contact information you provided. You may
   print this page if you wish to keep a record of your order.
