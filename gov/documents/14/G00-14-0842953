                       Training Requirements at the TVDG

   In response to changing regulations, the Tandem has revised the
   training program for outside users of the facility. As of January 1996,
   users will be required to complete BNL's General Employees Radiological
   Training (GERT) once every two years. The training can be obtained by
   reading the 13 page GERT Study Guide and passing a simple ten question
   multiple-choice test. The test is based on course objectives listed on
   the first page of the Study Guide. Retraining is provided if anyone
   fails the test. The Guide can be mailed to users before their visit.
   The Guide is also available at:

             General Employee Radiological Training Study Guide.
          Adobe Acrobat Reader is required to access this document.

   There are also minor changes in the orientation provided by Tandem
   operators. We will try to minimize any inconvenience these changes may
   cause and we hope we can count on the understanding of our users.
