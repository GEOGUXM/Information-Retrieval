   Definitions:

     Acquisition Policy

     Agency-wide, mandatory requirements of the Acquisition Management
     System, applicable to all activities associated with the analysis of
     agency needs for products and services, determination of
     requirements, analysis of investment alternatives, establishment of
     acquisition programs, allocation and expenditure of resources,
     procurement, deployment of products and services, in-service
     management of fielded capabilities, and eventual disposal of
     obsolete products. Acquisition policy applies to all acquisition
     programs of any cost and any appropriation, including programs
     managed at headquarters and those managed at regions, centers, and
     other field activities.

     The Administrator approves acquisition policy. Waivers or deviations
     may only be approved by the FAA Acquisition Executive.

     The official record of acquisition policy is located in the FAA
     Acquisition System Toolset (FAST). FAST contains the entire
     Acquisition Management System (AMS). The policy is within a site
     marked "AMS Policy", accessed from the FAST Homepage. Policy changes
     are incorporated within one month after approval by the
     Administrator.

     Acquisition Guidance

     A set of agency-endorsed processes, instructions, templates,
     databases, handbooks, checklists, and other information that
     supplements, expands, or illustrates acquisition policy. This
     information guides and supports the workforce in the planning and
     execution of acquisition policy, as well as all related lifecycle
     phase and functional discipline activities and processes.

     Acquisition guidance is derived from acquisition policy and should
     be followed unless there is rational basis for adopting a different
     approach.

     The official record of acquisition guidance is located in the FAA
     Acquisition System Toolset (FAST). All guidance is clearly marked on
     the screen whenever accessed in FAST. Guidance changes are
     incorporated within one month after approval by the Director, Office
     of Acquisition.


   Core Terminology:

   The following terms, when used throughout AMS, shall be interpreted as
   follows:

     Shall, Must, and Mandatory

     The terms "shall", "must", and "mandatory" are used to indicate
     requirements where it is necessary to comply. Waivers are required
     from the FAA Acquisition Executive if there is intent to not abide
     by the requirements.

     Should

     The term "should" is used to indicate requirements or procedures
     that are not mandatory and allow some discretion to adopt different
     approaches consistent with applicable law and acquisition policy of
     AMS. Acquisition personnel are expected to use principles of
     reasoned decision making and to document, to an appropriate extent,
     the rational basis for adopting a different approach*.

     *Note: In certain circumstances due to the nature of the rational
     basis, a team may determine that a responsible official shall
     document the rationale for deviating from AMS guidance. Such
     documentation shall be filed in the official program records.

     Examples of rational basis include factual statements showing that:
     * a deviation from the guidance will clearly enhance one or more
       factors of cost, schedule, requirements, or benefits.
     * Congressional direction requires adopting a different approach.
     * circumstances of the program clearly show that deviations from
       guidance are required.

     May

     The term "may" is used to confer authority to exercise full
     discretion by the user in implementing the applicable part of AMS
     where the term is used.


   How to access and identify:

     Acquisition Policy

     Acquisition policy is accessed from the FAST Homepage by activating
     the button marked "AMS Policy". Any other documents containing
     policy, retained by reference, are located from the FAST Homepage by
     activating buttons marked "Toolsets", then "References". Within
     FAST, policy or guidance is clearly marked at the top of every
     screen with flashing words, either "policy" or "guidance", to aid
     the user in identifying which category is being accessed.

     Acquisition Guidance

     All information within AMS, displayed in FAST, is officially
     designated as acquisition guidance unless it has been specifically
     and clearly marked as acquisition policy. All guidance is officially
     sanctioned and approved using the same formal AMS Configuration
     Management process as used for policy. (Refer to AMS Policy, Section
     1.9) Within FAST, policy or guidance is clearly marked at the top of
     every screen with flashing words, either "policy" or "guidance", to
     aid the user in identifying which category is being accessed.
