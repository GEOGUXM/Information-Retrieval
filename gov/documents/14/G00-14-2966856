   This sequence of mesoscale eddies originates from the Global Near
   Real-Time Altimeter Data Geostrophic Velocity Viewer
   (http://www-ccar.colorado.edu/~realtime/global-real-time_vel/)
   maintained by the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR).
   The maps are produced from TOPEX and ERS-2 altimeter data processed in
   near real-time, usually within 18 hours of overflight (18:00 GMT). This
   animation has 52 frames and covers the period of March 1 through August
   10, 2000. The sea surface height is calculated using a mean circulation
   derived form the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) at the Stennis Space
   Center in Slidell Mississippi, with superimposed velocity vectors for
   regions that are 25° x 25° in the globlal oceans. For this subset a
   reference depth of 400 meters was used.
