     The Scalable Computing Laboratory (SCL) was created in 1989 as a
   joint effort of the Department of Energy (DOE) through Ames Laboratory
   and Iowa State University (ISU) through the Center for Physical and
   Computational Mathematics (CPCM).

     The mission of the Scalable Computing Laboratory is to improve
   parallel computing through clustering techniques for use in scientific
   and engineering computation. We deliver supercomputing power at a
   fraction of the cost of traditional supercomputers.
