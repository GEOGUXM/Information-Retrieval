                                                            Cell Wars

                             Immune cells vs. invaders: it's a war going on in every healthy human
   body. When the combatants travel to space, say NASA scientists, curious
                              things happen...

      [scott04_med.jpg] January 23, 2002:  When you wake up, maybe you yawn,
      switch off your alarm clock, and listen for the perking of an automatic
      coffee maker -- a normal morning routine on Earth.

      But if you were in orbit, the first thing you'd do is take a little
      roll of cotton, swish it around in your mouth, and then drop it in a
      tube filled with preservative. The cotton collects viruses, and the
      goal of that good-morning ritual is to help determine why astronaut
      saliva contains more viruses in space than it does on the ground.

      It's not a trivial question.

      Our bodies are chock-full of tiny invaders: bacteria, viruses,
      protozoans. Multitudes inhabit our gut, more slip in on the food we eat
      and through the air we breathe. Usually they're not a problem. Indeed,
      some are even helpful -- and the ones that aren't are kept in check by
      our vigorous immune system, which marks and destroys pathogens before
   they get out of control. Without immune systems, humans would die.

   In space, our immune system functions differently. This complex system
   consists, essentially, of disease-fighting cells that can travel
   throughout the body. There are many kinds of immune cells; two of the
   most important are B-cells, which send out antibodies -- proteins that
   latch onto germs or other problem-causing invaders, flagging them as
   invaders to be destroyed, and T-cells, which are the soldiers of the
   system, physically attacking and destroying pathogens.

   In space, these cells don't work the way they do on the ground.
   T-cells, for example, don't multiply properly; there aren't as many of
   them as there should be. They can't move well. They don't signal each
   other as effectively. Overall, they seem less able to destroy invading
   germs.

   larger influenza virus-infected target. See the movie and learn more

   Here on Earth, doctors have learned that stress can suppress the immune
   system by causing the body to release hormones that affect the way
   T-cells behave. Likewise, the unique physical and psychological
   stresses of space flight (takeoff and landing, for example) might
   trigger immune-altering hormones. Another possibility is that something
   about space itself -- weightlessness, perhaps, and not hormones at all
   -- might affect immune cells directly.

   To help solve the mystery, researchers are using a NASA-developed
   "rotating bioreactor," which provides a reasonable analog of
   microgravity here on Earth. Neal Pellis, chief of the Biological
   Systems Office in the Johnson Space Center, explains: The core of the
   bioreactor is a soup-can size container that spins at the leisurely
   rate of 14 rpm. It allows cells to remain suspended for months at a
   time in continual free fall. Within their fluid environment, the
   tumbling cells fall toward Earth as fast as they can -- just as they
   would in Earth orbit.

   [rwv2.jpg] Using the bioreactor, researchers can separate the immune
   system from its hormonal controls. Rather than looking at the human
   immune system as a whole, Pellis and his colleagues can examine the
   possible effects of low-gravity on individual immune cells.

   Right: The heart of the bioreactor is a rotating wall vessel, shown
   here without its support equipment. [more]

   In the bioreactor, says Pellis, cells begin to change within the first
   15 minutes. Indeed, one of the first alterations researchers observe
   could possibly trigger all the other effects: T-cells are somehow
   forced to remain round.

   It's an important change. On Earth, these cells can alter their shape.
   They're able to protrude portions of themselves -- an ability that they
   use to move around, just like amoebas do. And they need to move in
   order to do their job: They travel to the sites of infections, where
   they attack germs. They move to the sites of tumors. They locomote in
   and out of immune system organs, such as the appendix and tonsils,
   where other T-cells share samples of invading pathogens.

   But it's not only the ability to move that's hampered by roundness.
   This simple change also makes it harder for cells to communicate. Round
   cells, explains Pellis, find it harder to touch each other. Their
   ability to interact is reduced.

   Below: This animation illustrates the basic cell-to-cell interactions
   that lead to antibody production. T-cells must move and communicate
   with their cellular cousins to make the process work. [more]

   [antibody.gif] Imagine two balloons, he says. "If you put them side by
   side, and pressed them together, the surface area that's in contact can
   be quite large." But, he says, if you have two bowling balls, no matter
   how hard you press them together, only a tiny fraction of their
   surfaces will meet. Such cells have less ability to exchange the
   chemical signals that command them to go into action

   It's still unclear what these findings mean for the health of space
   travelers. Astronauts do show an increase in virus levels. For example,
   notes Duane Pierson, head of microbiology for the Johnson Space Center,
   when astronauts cough or sneeze, the droplets released contain 8 to 10
   times more of the common Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious
   mononucleosis) than normal Earth sneezes. Although that's an indication
   of immune system suppression, the astronauts themselves have remained
   completely without symptoms.

   Nor is it yet clear exactly what keeps T-cells round. Without the usual
   effects of gravity, explains Pellis, other forces --perhaps
   intermolecular or submolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding -- must
   play a larger role, so that in microgravity, these other forces control
   the shape that the cell takes. "But exactly which forces are doing what
   to whom, where and how, to arrive at a spherical cell, I don't think
   anybody knows.Â”

   [immunesystem_med.jpg] Finding out is important ... and not only for
   astronauts. This research will also help people on Earth.

   T-cells protect us from all kinds of problems, says Pellis, but they
   don't always behave as we would like. "There are times when we don't
   want them to invade -- transplants, for example. And there are cases
   when we want them to act vigorously, like in tumors."

   Understanding the way physical forces affect T-cells could eventually
   allow scientists to control them -- "taming" them so that they help us,
   as they're meant to, in far more effective ways.

   Space research about the human immune system began in the Apollo era
   when blood samples from astronauts (collected in orbit and analyzed on
   the ground) revealed fewer-than-normal lymphocytes. Since then immune
   system studies have also been conducted on Skylab, in the space
   shuttle, on the Russian space station Mir -- and will be done on the
   International Space Station. Follow the links below to learn more:

   The Biotechnology Space Support Center and the Space Biology Group in
   Zurich, Switzerland, have conducted many immune system experiments
   aboard space station Mir, NASA's space shuttle, rockets and
   stratospheric balloons. Highlights include the first in vitro
   activation of lymphocytes in space in 1983 on the STS-9 Spacelab 1
   mission, and cosmonaut skin tests, which measure how forcefully the
   body responds to pathogens.

   Two immune system experiments recently flew to space on board shuttle
   Endeavour (STS-108): "Spaceflight-induced Reactivation of the
   Epstein-Barr Virus" and "Space Flight and Immune Function." Learn more
