                             Summary of Comments


   Background

   The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) held a public hearing on
   November 14, 2001 in Tacoma to receive public and stakeholder input on
   the draft statewide electronic court filing technical standards.

   The Judicial Information System (JIS) Committee drafted the technical
   standards in Spring 2001 for possible presentation to the Washington
   Supreme Court in support of electronic filing projects in the
   Washington court system.

   AOC also encouraged interested parties to submit comments by telephone,
   email or hardcopy on or before a deadline of November 30, 2001. In
   response, approximately 15 persons or organizations submitted comments
   to the AOC for consideration.

   Submitted comments are summarized below by technical standard.
