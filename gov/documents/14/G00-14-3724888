  How do I participate in future exchanges?

   Interested school districts should send a formal letter to CIRF
   requesting participation in the program.   The school district should
   determine whether to host or send students the first year, and
   designate a coordinator who can work in cooperation with CIRF officials
   in setting up the proper infrastructure needed to establish the
   program.

  When is the best time to send the formal request letter?

   The best time to send the formal request letter is in the spring, one
   year before the expected exchange date.  California school districts
   and Japanese Prefectrual governments typically complete the next year's
   fiscal budget before the end of summer, allowing program costs to be
   factored in to both District and Prefectural operational costs.

  Why should we participate in the program ?

   The program helps districts prepare their participants for the
   realities of a globalized society.  Students are introduced to foreign
   languages and cultures, as well as the basics of the global economy,
   politics, and social infrastructure.  Students will witness firsthand
   the importance and influence that the Pacific Basin has on global
   affairs.  Participants are able to compliment their studies by
   experiencing the differences of non-Western educational methods and
   introduces international relations type classes in district
   curriculum.  This allows a district to be on the forefront of global
   education in California.

  Who determines the match in the Sister School District Model?

   New school districts are matched to Prefectures in Japan based upon a
   variety of criteria including expressed desire to participate in the
   program, prior or ongoing relationships with a California city or
   region, and the advice and consultation of the Japanese Consulate of
   San Francisco.

  What is the commitment to California School Districts?

   The program consists of a two year commitment by both districts and
   Prefectures in Japan.  We require that district and Prefectures host
   and send students in alternate years to ensure a meaningful exchange.
   While there is some financial assistance to districts for student
   scholarships, there are certain financial responsibilities placed upon
   the District.
