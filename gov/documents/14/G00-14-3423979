   If you or someone you know has a problem with alcohol or drugs,
   services are available. Those services range from emergency counseling
   to residential treatment. Each county has an alcohol and drug program
   office that can help you find the right services in your area. Use the
   following link to find the alcohol and drug program office for your
   county. This information is also available from the Department of
   Alcohol and Drug Programs Resource Center at 1-800-879-2772 during
   business hours.
     * County Alcohol and Drug Program Offices - This is a statewide
       listing of alcohol and drug county offices. Use this list to locate

       other drug-related service providers.

   Program Directories
