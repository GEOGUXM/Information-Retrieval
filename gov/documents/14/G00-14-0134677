                Oral History of Seattle Politician Published

   NEWS RELEASE
   Issued: December 18, 2001
   For interviews, contact: Trova Hutchins (360) 902-4140
   OLYMPIAThe Secretary of States office recently released the life story
   of R.R. Bob Greive, a master strategist and campaigner, considered by
   some the hardest working politician of his time. The account tracks
   Greives career as a State Senator from the Thirty-fourth District (West
   Seattle) and King County Council Member.
   R.R. Bob Greive: An Oral History reveals the story behind some of
   Washingtons most contentious political years. This is a window of
   history in which legislative redistricting still fell under the
   responsibilities of the Washington State Legislature. Greive is
   remembered by many as a key player in the redistricting battles. His
   recollections provide valuable insight into this intriguing chapter of
   Washington State political history.
   A highly skilled politician, Senator Greive served as Democratic
   majority leader for sixteen years. Greives oral history details his own
   methods for success. It includes his widely noted sign-shops, one of
   the first instances of mass produced political yard signs in the state.
   Senator Greive is also an accomplished artist. Several of his drawings
   and cartoons, many of which figured into his political life, can be
   found in his oral history. Senator Greives book is the sixteenth volume
   published in the Washington State Oral History Program Series.
