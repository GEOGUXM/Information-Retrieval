                    S-Check Team Wins 1997 R&D 100 Award

   S-Check, an advanced software performance improvement tool developed by
   ITL's scalable parallel systems and software group of the High
   Performance Systems and Services Division, in collaboration with the
   Statistical Engineering Division, has been selected by a jury for R&D
   Magazine[1] to be an R&D 100 Award Winner for 1997. The R&D 100
   competition "highlights 100 of the year's most technologically
   significant products and processes."

   S-Check is especially suited for improving code running on parallel
   systems, where component interactions are common but difficult to
   evaluate with conventional profiler tools. Displayed in color graphical
   formats, results from S-Check provide programmers with quantitative
   predictions on the effect of code improvements in their programs
   without actually requiring the changes to be made, saving a lot of
   time.

   Specific strengths seen only in S-Check's analyses are that a
   programmer does not have to understand the specimen program; results
   show effects of code changes directly and quantitatively; the tool
   detects and ranks interactions among parallel processes, e.g.,
   producing and consuming pairs; and tests are independent of program or
   host size. In addition, S-Check results are reliable regardless of what
   type of parallel (or serial) system used to run the test code.

   Started from an idea of Gordon Lyon and developed and managed by Robert
   Snelick, S-Check has included team members John Antonishek, Michel
   Courson, Nathalie Drouin, Micheal Indovina, Joseph Ja'Ja', Raghu
   Kacker, and Dominique Rodriguez. Support has come from NIST and the
   Advanced Research Projects Agency.
