   Subject: Implementat1on of the Use of Generic Codes in the Coastal
   Marine  Great Lakes Forecasts

   Reference(s): This OML modifies WSOM Chapter D-51, Issuance 86-4, dated
   June 1, 1986, and WSOM Chapter D-52, Issuance 91-2, dated March 21,
   l991

   1.    Effective at 00Z, 60 days after issuance date, all Great Lakes
   Open Lakes and Nearshore Marine Forecasts (AFOS identifiers GLF and
   NSH) and all Coastal Marine Forecasts (AFOS identifier CWF) including
   locally adapted marine forecasts shall contain a Universal Generic Code
   (UGC).

   The UGC is to be in the form "SSZNNN-DDHHMM-" where:
   SS = two-letter state or lake identifier
   Z = an indicator noting that an area designator follows
   NNN = a three-digit code specifically defining a Basic Marine Area for
   an individual state or lake
   - = code separator/end of address
   DDHHMM = Scheduled expiration time (day, hour, and minute in UTC) of
   current product. This coincides with the next scheduled issuance time
   of this product.

   2.    In this OML a Basic Marine Area is considered to be the marine
   equivalent of the public forecast zone. For clarity and conciseness,
   the marine forecaster can, in the body of the forecast, subdivide a
   Basic Marine Area or can combine two or more Basic Marine Areas as
   shown in the examples below. However. it is not permissible to combine
   one Basic Marine Area with just a part of another. All Basic Marine
   Areas are listed in attachment 1 to this OML.

   3.    The following are examples of various marine forecast formats to
   show how the UGCs are to be placed.
   A. One Basic Marine Area with no subdivisions:
