   National Water Quality Laboratory

                              Denver, Colorado.
   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory
   (NWQL) is a full-service laboratory that specializes in environmental
   analytical chemistry. The NWQL's primary mission is to support USGS
   programs requiring environmental analyses that provide consistent
   methodology for national assessment and trends analysis.

      This mission directly supports the USGS, which, in part, is charged
      with providing the Nation with reliable, impartial earth-science
      information to help decisionmakers manage the Nation's water resources.
      To contribute to this information base, the NWQL provides the
      following:
        * High-quality chemical data
        * Consistent, published, state-of-the-art methodology
        * Extremely low-detection levels
        * High-volume capability
        * Biological unit for identifying benthic invertebrates
        * Quality assurance for determining long-term water-quality trends
        * Professional staff


   The NWQL has a highly trained and talented work force, and a history of
   quality and leadership in development of analytical methods for water,
   sediment, and tissue. The NWQL offers comprehensive services through a
   modern facility designed for efficient and safe operation. It was moved
   into a new building in spring 1999 on the Denver Federal Center campus.

         Glass-walled center module connects the north and south wings.

      The NWQL provides environmental analyses to meet a variety of
      water-quality objectives for the USGS and its customers. Some USGS
      customers have data-quality objectives that require routine methods of
      analysis, such as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for
      trace metals. Other customers ask the NWQL to detect minute quantities
      (low levels) of organic compounds, thus requiring more advanced methods
      of sample preparation and analysis. These "trace" and "ultratrace"
      concentrations require methods of analysis that, in some instances, are
      more stringent than that required for many present standards of water
      quality and include compounds that are not available from any standard
      analysis. Detections of even trace amounts of compounds can be
      important when classifying or defining the environment in which water
      quality might be changing.

      Whatever the need他chain-of-custody requirements, development of new
      analytical methods for emerging contaminants, custom methods, or
      biological assessment他the NWQL is prepared to meet the request for
      analytical services. NWQL data are used by the USGS to describe and
      understand the earth's hydrology through the professional application
      of science and technology to physical, chemical, and biological
      analyses of water, river and lake sediment, and aquatic biota.
