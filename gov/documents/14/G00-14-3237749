                     FAQ's - Frequently Asked Questions

                         Q. How do I take a course?

    A. Depending on what your organization has subscribed to, you may be
    able to take courses from the SkillSoft catalog, the NETg catalog, or
        both. Please check with your Training Officer to see if your
   organization has purchased SkillSoft and/or NETg courses. HHS learning
       resources and references are available to all employees. To add
   learning to your Learning Plan, you must go to the Learning Catalog and
    navigate to what you want to take. Click the "Add to Plan" to add the
   course to your Learning Plan. Once the course is in your Learning Plan,
    go to your Learning Plan by clicking the Learning Plan button on the
     left side of the screen. This will display your Learning Plan. Find
   what you want to take in your Learning Plan and click on "Launch." This
                   will let you participate in the course.

             Q. How do I navigate through the Learning Catalog?

     A. Click on the Learning Catalog on the left side of the screen for
        instructions on how to navigate through the Learning Catalog.

                 Q. How do I know if I have passed a course?

   A. For SkillSoft courses, "passing" a course means passing each module
   of the course at a 75% score or better on the post-assessment. For NETg
   courses, "passing" course means passing each module of the course at an
     80% score or better on the post-assessment. To view the courses you
   have passed, you must navigate to your Transcripts. Your Transcripts is
   listed within your Learning Plan. To see your Transcripts, click on the
           "Learning Plan" button on the left side of the screen.

              Q. Are passed courses listed on my Learning Plan?

   A. Yes. This is accomplished automatically once a month. Therefore, it
    may take up to a month for the completed course to be listed on your
                               Learning Plan.

                      Q. What if I forgot my password?

     A. If you have forgotten your password and you have set a password
   hint, click on "Forgot Your Password?" and you will be taken to a page
   that prompts you for your username. Enter your User ID and you will get
      your password hint. If this jogs your memory, you can enter your
    password and log in. If not, please contact the THINQ Help Desk and a
      representative will assist you. See Help Desk Contact Information
                                   below.

                        Q. Can I change my password?

   A. Yes. After your initial login where you had to change your password
     from dhhs, you can change your password at any time. AFTER you have
    logged in, click on your name on the left side of the screen and you
      will be taken to a page that asks for your old password, your new
                    password, and your new password hint.

         Q. What browser versions are required for playing courses?

      A. The vendor courseware requires that the user have at least: ·
       Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.02 or greater · Netscape
                      Navigator version 3.04 or greater

                  Q. Do I have to configure my web browser?

   A. SkillSoft courseware runs through Java applets. This means that, if
       you have access to SkillSoft courses, your web browser must be
    configured to enable Java applets. To configure your browser, please
   look at the Configuration Information below for instructions on how to
                      properly configure your browser.

    Q. When I try to play a course, nothing happens or I just get a gray
                    screen. I am using Internet Explorer.

    A. The most common cause of this symptom is an outdated Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM). The JVM that ships with Internet Explorer has problems
   that sometimes impact the execution of our Java Applet. The solution is
   to update the JVM. This update is available from the Microsoft web site
                      at http://www.microsoft.com/java.

      Q. But I am using Internet Explorer 4.0. Why do I have to update?

        A. It is a common misconception that Internet Explorer 4.0 is
   up-to-date, because it is a 4.0 browser. IE was originally released in
   1997. This is ancient in the computer industry. Since IE was originally
   released, there have been frequent updates to the Java component. These
      updates fix bugs and add more functionality to Java for Internet
                                  Explorer.

     Q. What about the Java component that ships with Internet Explorer
         3.02? Does it need to be updated to play SkillSoft courses?

   A. Yes. Anyone who wants to use our product with Internet Explorer 3.02
    will need to update the Java Virtual Machine by installing the latest
         version that is available at http://www.microsoft.com/java.

     Q. When attempting to Play a course, it is taking an unusually long
                        time for the course to start.

    A. Do you use McAfee VirusScan version 4.x or higher, and do you use
    VShield with Download Scan set to Scan All Files? This has been found
    to slow the download of the Java Applet when starting the course. You
   can set VShield Download Scan to Scan Program Files only instead of All
                                   Files.

       Q. The Play button is not appearing on the Course Summary page.

    A. The most common cause of this symptom is an outdated Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM). The JVM that ships with Internet Explorer has problems
   that sometimes impact the execution of our Java Applet. The solution is
   to update the JVM. This update is available from the Microsoft web site
                      at http://www.microsoft.com/java.

                        Q. Can I turn the audio off?

   A. Yes. You can turn the audio off at any time by clicking the turn off
   audio button located just above the page back and page forward buttons
    at the lower right-hand side of the screen within the course player.
            You can turn it back on my clicking the same button.

     Q. Should I have other applications open when running the courses?

     A. Occasionally, having other applications open on the desktop can
      affect course performance. We recommend closing all non-essential
                     applications when playing courses.

                  Q. Can I play two courses simultaneously?

               A. No. You can only play one course at a time.

                 Q. Who do I contact for Technical Support?

   A. Under the Help Index, click on Help Desk Contact Information for the
                            appropriate contact.
