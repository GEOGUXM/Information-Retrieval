                              November 2, 2001

             Circuit Judge Procter Hug Jr. to Take Senior Status
               Former Chief Judge Will Continue to Hear Cases,
                             Serve on Committees

   SAN FRANCISCO â€” Circuit Judge Procter Hug Jr. of Nevada, a veteran
   federal jurist and former chief judge of the United States Courts for
   the Ninth Circuit, has announced plans to take senior status, effective
   Jan. 1, 2002.
   Nominated in 1977 by President Carter, Judge Hug has served on the
   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for 24 years, which ranks him third
   among the longest-serving active circuit judges in the nation. Judge
   Hug, 70, made known his plans to retire from active service in a letter
   sent yesterday to President Bush and released to court staff earlier
   today.
   "I decided that the time was right," Judge Hug said in an interview. "I
   will continue to hear cases. But there will be more time for seeing
   family, traveling and for other interests."
   Judges in senior status carry a reduced workload, while maintaining
   chambers and staff. Judge Hug, who maintains chambers in Reno and at
   the Court of Appeals in San Francisco, said he expects to be hearing
   cases "a little more than half-time." He plans to continue serving on
   several Ninth Circuit committees, and will remain an active member of
   the board of directors of the National Judicial College in Reno.
   As the chief judge from 1996 to 2000, Judge Hug worked diligently to
   keep the Ninth Circuit intact, despite repeated attempts in the Senate
   to divide the circuit into smaller jurisdictional units.
   "I'm pleased that we were able to prevent any kind of circuit split or
   modification to the way the Ninth Circuit operates. Our current
   organization and operation is the most effective way of keeping the law
   consistent in the western states," said Judge Hug.
   Judge Hug also is credited with promoting greater collegiality among
   circuit judges and for his efforts to listen and respond to lower court
   judges in the circuit's far-flung districts. He recalled traveling
   extensively throughout the circuit to meet with judges.
   "We have great diversity within our circuit and that's a strength
   because we are able to consider a great many different viewpoints," he
   said.
   "I think one of the most satisfying things was that we remained a very
   collegial circuit, that we worked well together, both judges and
   staff," he added.
   In addition to his leadership within the circuit, Judge Hug also served
   on the Judicial Resources Committee of the Judicial Conference of the
   United States, the national policy making body for the federal
   judiciary. The committee was responsible for developing workload
   formulas used to determine the need for new judgeships and staff.
   With his newfound free time, Judge Hug said he and his wife of 47
   years, Barbara, plan to catch up with their three children, a daughter
   and son in Reno, and another daughter in San Rafael, Calif., and their
   eight grandchildren.
   Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder, who succeeded Judge Hug last December,
   said she and her fellow circuit judges "will miss Procter's cheerful
   guidance as an active judge. But we know he will continue as a senior
   judge to be a mentor and role model for us all."
