      Andrew S. Natsios, Administrator of the United States Agency for
    International Development (USAID) arrived in Amman, Jordan on January
                12, 2002, on a four-day visit to the Kingdom.

   Natsios and his delegation will meet with His Majesty King Abdullah II
        and senior Jordanian officials. They will also visit several
        USAID-funded development projects and will attend a number of
   USAID-related events. These events will include a ceremony to dedicate
          the cornerstone for Aqaba International Industrial Estate
        Administration Building, the official launching of the TIJARA
   Initiative for the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, and the signing of
               Greater Amman Water Rehabilitation agreements.

     U.S. assistance to Jordan supports a forward-looking government and
        non-governmental organizations in efforts to enhance economic
    prosperity for Jordanians and stability in the region. Strategically
    positioned both geographically and politically, Jordan has in recent
     years been a consistent and positive force in the search for peace.
    Jordan is a moderating influence and important "bridge builder" among
        the various political and economic actors within the region.
