                   Palm products from the Particle Data Group

   The Particle Data Group is porting some of our databases and
   information to the Palm computing environment. This is just a
   beginning. We also give other physics related links below. Keep those
   comments and suggestions flowing to PDG consultant John Krane
   (jkrane@fnal.gov) or PDG contact Tom Trippe (trippe@lbl.gov).

Particle Data Book, Palm Version 1.1

Sep. 19, 2001: This version solves the recently reported crash problems on
Palm OS 4.0 as well as an older problem preventing beaming.

   Doug Lowder has contributed this Palm implementation of the Particle
   Physics Booklet containing tables of physical and astrophysical
   constants, and particle properties. Numerical values can copied/pasted
   into Palm calculators. Download the file pdbook11.zip (17KB), unzip it,
   and install the file pdbook11.prc on your Palm device. This new version
   is a stand-alone application which includes the data, so no separate
   database is needed. See his Particle Data Book page for more
   information and the same download files.

Table of Particle Masses, Widths, ID#'s

   This is a table of all elementary particles, listing particle name,
   charge, mass, width, and Monte Carlo Particle ID number.

Confidence level vs chi-squared/n and n d.o.f.

   This figure gives contours of fixed confidence level as a function of
   the "reduced chi-squared" (=chi-squared/n) and the number of degrees of
   freedom n. Curves are labeled by the probability that a measurement
   will give a value of chi-squared/n greater than that given on the y
   axis; e.g. for n=10, a value of chi-squared/n > 1.8 can be expected 5%
   of the time.

Confidence level vs chi-squared for n d.o.f.

   This figure gives the confidence level versus chi-squared for n degrees
   of freedom. The curve for a given n gives the probability that a value
   at least as large as chi-squared will be obtained in an experiment;
   e.g., for n=10, a value chi-squared >18 will occur in 5% of a large
   number of experiments.

   Install the required application(s) for the file(s) you want to use,
   and install the .pdb file(s) using the Install tool in your Palm
   Desktop application.

Required Palm Application

   MobileDB Lite is a free database reader. Further information on this
   reader and the MobileDB shareware reader used to create databases is
   available from Mobile Generation Software.

   Image Viewer III is a shareware viewer for all kinds of bitmap images.
   The free evaluation version works fine.
