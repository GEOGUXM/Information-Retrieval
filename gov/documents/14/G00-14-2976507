                                               The United States Tax Court

        A $60 filing fee must be paid when the petition is filed. Once the
            petition is filed, payment of the underlying tax ordinarily is
                                postponed until the case has been decided.

    In certain tax disputes involving $50,000 or less, taxpayers may elect
       to have their case conducted under the Court's simplified small tax
   case procedure. Trials in small tax cases generally are less formal and
     result in a speedier disposition. However, decisions entered pursuant
                          to small tax case procedures are not appealable.

     Cases are calendared for trial as soon as practicable (on a first in/
          first out basis) after the case becomes at issue. When a case is
      calendared, the parties are notified by the Court of the date, time,
                                                       and place of trial.

    The vast majority of cases are settled by mutual agreement without the
   necessity of a trial. However, if a trial is conducted, in due course a
          report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth
    findings of fact and an opinion. The case is then closed in accordance
     with the judge's opinion by entry of a decision stating the amount of
                                    the deficiency or overpayment, if any.

   The U.S. Tax Court is a Federal court of record established by Congress
        under Article I of the Constitution of the United States. Congress
       created the Tax Court to provide a judicial forum in which affected
     persons could dispute tax deficiencies determined by the Commissioner
         of Internal Revenue prior to payment of the disputed amounts. The
          jurisdiction of the Tax Court includes the authority to hear tax
          disputes concerning notices of deficiency, notices of transferee
        liability, certain types of declaratory judgment, readjustment and
           adjustment of partnership items, review of the failure to abate
        interest, administrative costs, worker classification, relief from
      joint and several liability on a joint return, and review of certain
                                                       collection actions.

   The Tax Court is composed of 19 presidentially appointed members. Trial
        sessions are conducted and other work of the Court is performed by
    those judges, by senior judges serving on recall, and by special trial
   judges. All of the judges have expertise in the tax laws and apply that
     expertise in a manner to ensure that taxpayers are assessed only what
     they owe, and no more. The Tax Court is located at 400 Second Street,
    N.W., Washington, D.C. 20217. Although the Court is physically located
          in Washington, the judges travel nationwide to conduct trials in
         various designated cities. Trials are conducted before one judge,
    without a jury, and taxpayers are permitted to represent themselves if
    they desire. Taxpayers may be represented by practitioners admitted to
     the bar of the Tax Court. A case in the Tax Court is commenced by the
    filing of a petition. In deficiency cases, the petition must be timely
   filed within 90 days (150 days if the notice of deficiency is mailed to
    a taxpayer outside the United States) after the date of the mailing of
                                                    the deficiency notice.
