About Our Mission

     What is the Biological Resources Discipline (BRD) Mission?

     The BRD mission is to work with others to provide the scientific
     understanding and technologies needed to support the sound
     management and conservation of our Nation's biological resources.

     Does the BRD have the power to regulate how I can use my land?

     The BRD is non-regulatory, non-managerial, and non-advocacy. Our aim
     is to make the best possible scientific information available to
     resource managers, landowners, and the public. We do not make
     recommendations. Our scientists and biologists provide unbiased,
     factual scientific information to Federal agencies, State, and
     non-profit research institutions, landowners, businesses, industry,
     and private citizens. Regulatory and management decisions are made
     elsewhere in the government and in the private sector.

     Who has access to the information you're assembling?

     Everybody. BRD research and information is in the public domain.
     It's available through the Internet on the National Biological
     Information Infrastructure (NBII) at http://www.nbii.gov/.

     Where does BRD funding come from?

     The BRD budget is based on funds allocated by Congress to the USGS.

     How are you organized?

     We have a Headquarters in Reston, VA, regional offices, science
     centers, cooperative research units, and field stations. (BRD
     Organization)

     Does BRD also have science libraries?

     Yes. BRD science libraries are located at many of our science
     centers. Holdings and services at each library tend to reflect the
     center's research specialties.

     What is "informatics"?

     Research on, development of, and use of technological, sociological,
     and organizational tools and approaches for the dynamic acquisition,
     indexing, dissemination, storage, querying, retrieval,
     visualization, integration, analysis, synthesis, sharing (which
     includes electronic means of collaboration), and publication of data
     such that economic and other benefits may be derived from the
     information by users from all sections of society.

     Do you use volunteers to collect data?

     Volunteers assist on some BRD programs. In all cases, first the
     volunteers are carefully trained. Then they are supervised by a
     Federal employee while they work. In addition, to ensure
     quality-control, their data are checked by BRD supervisors.
     Volunteers must abide by the same rules, regulations, policies, and
     laws as BRD employees.

     What is the BRD policy about coming onto private property to conduct
     your studies?

     When conducting surveys on private property, BRD researchers comply
     with State and Tribal laws, including trespassing and privacy laws.
     BRD researchers are required to obtain written permission from the
     landowner when conducting new surveys, not to trespass, and, at the
     landowner's request, to make the data available at no cost.

     How does BRD benefit industry?

     This differs by industry sector. To give you a few examples, we work
     with the agriculture and ranching industry on the problem of noxious
     weeds, wildlife and soil conservation techniques, and integrated
     pest management. We have also provided information in support of
     aquaculture.

     Potentially, the industry that may benefit the most from knowing
     where rare plants can be found is the pharmaceutical industry. In
     the U.S. and elsewhere, new drugs are constantly being developed
     from both rare and common plants.

     What are some of your external sources of information?

     We are exchanging information with State fish and game offices,
     universities, research laboratories, individual researchers, and
     local libraries and museums. This information is already being
     shared through the National Biological Information Infrastructure
     (NBII), an electronic federation of biological data and information.
     The NBII is available through the Internet at http://www.nbii.gov/.

     What is Gap Analysis?

     The Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is a state-based cooperative effort
     to map major indicators of biodiversity over states, along with the
     existing network of conservation lands. The indicators of
     biodiversity that the GAP state projects map using geographic
     information system (GIS) technology are dominant vegetation types
     (e.g., oak-hickory-hemlock forest) and distributions of each native
     vertebrate species.

     Although coordinated by the BRD, the program is made up of over 400
     cooperating organizations nationwide, including businesses,
     governments, and universities.

     What is the Breeding Bird Survey?

     The Breeding Bird Survey is a cooperative effort using over 2,000
     skilled amateur and professional ornithologists to collect
     information on the North American bird population. This program was
     transferred to BRD from the Fish and Wildlife Service. Survey data
     enables us to measure bird population changes.

     What is a Co-op Unit?

     A BRD Cooperative Research Unit is a partnership among the BRD, the
     State fish and game agency, a host university, and the Wildlife
     Management Institute. Staffed with Federal personnel, the units
     conduct research on renewable natural resource questions;
     participate in the education of graduate students destined to become
     natural resource scientists; provide technical assistance and
     consultation to parties who have legitimate interests in natural
     resource issues; and provide various forms of continuing education
     for natural resource professionals. These units contain more than
     160 Ph.D. scientists who oversee as many as 600 graduate students
     per year.

     Can you assure me that the information you gather won't be used by
     another Federal agency to take my property or regulate me in some
     other way?

     The information we gather will be available to everyone: government
     officials and private citizens. We cannot guarantee it won't be used
     in a regulatory decision. But we can guarantee it will be accurate,
     timely, and unbiased. Accurate and sufficient scientific information
     should produce fair decisions.

     How can I, as a private citizen, access BRD data?

     It's easy. BRD information is public information and in almost all
     cases, is available by request. (Limited exceptions exist that
     protect the interests of property owners and to protect sensitive
     species.) In addition, information about a wide range of
     geographical areas and species are available to you through BRD,
     which can help you locate and gain access to information in Federal,
     State, and private institutions. Much of this information is also
     available through the Internet at http://www.nbii.gov/.

Wildlife

     Where can I find out about wildlife diseases?

     Please visit the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Web pages at
     http://www.emtc.usgs.gov/nwhchome.html. The National Wildlife Health
     Center was established in 1975 as a biomedical laboratory dedicated
     to assessing the impact of disease on wildlife and to identifying
     the role of various pathogens in contributing to wildlife losses.

     I am an avid butterfly enthusiast. Please tell me where I can find
     information about them.

     Have you visited our Children's Butterfly Site? Although it is
     geared toward young people, the site contains a wealth of
     information on butterflies, including photo galleries (Common
     Butterflies of Western Europe and Great Britain, and Common
     Butterflies of North America), as well as links to other Internet
     sites, including the online version of Butterflies of North America,
     hosted by the USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center.
     Northern Prairie's extensive butterfly pages begin at
     <http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/taxa_I.htm>.  The North American
     Butterfly Association Web site also contains a great deal of
     information on butterflies, along with many links to additional
     information--including state-by-state links for local information.

     If you have specific questions, you may wish to contact your local
     university or college entomology department or extension office.

     I have bats in my attic. What should I do?

     Bats are among the world's least appreciated and most endangered
     animals. I suggest that you visit Bat Conservation International's
     Web site, which has links to a great deal of information on bats,
     including a link that provides information on how to find a
     reputable bat removal service -- one that does not harm the bats.
     Your local university extension office may also provide information
     and assistance.

     Our Web site contains much information on bats.  For a starter,
     check out the USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center's Bat Web
     Sites  page at http://www.mesc.usgs.gov/links/bat_web_sites.html.
     The USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center pages on bats
     begin at
     http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/othrdata/okbats/okbats.htm#conten
     ts and include links to other sources of information.  A delightful
     educational site, "Echo the Bat," can be accessed at
     http://imagers.gsfc.nasa.gov/.  The Teachers' Guide contains links
     to bat conservation organizations and other sources of information.
     Finally, Bat Conservation International's extensive site at
     http://www.batcon.org/index.html provides a wealth of information,
     including volunteer opportunities and bat workshop schedules.

     I am interested in learning how to estimate animal populations. What
     methods are used, and how do scientists go about doing this?

     Figuring out clever ways to estimate animal population sizes and
     their trends involves a lot of research time at the USGS Patuxent
     Wildlife Research Center. You may be interested in the Web pages
     beginning at http://www.mp1-pwrc.usgs.gov/ to learn about these
     activities.  As you probably know, animals do not particularly want
     to be counted and it becomes quite a tricky business!

     We found a dead bird with a band around its leg.  Where do I report
     this information?

     You can access the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center's Bird
     Banding Laboratory Web pages at
     http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/default.htm; the page on How to Report
     a Bird Band is at http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/homepage/call800.htm.
     Call toll-free, 1-800-327-2263, from anywhere in Canada, the United
     States, and most parts of the Caribbean. Please have all the
     information on the bird band with you when you call (band number,
     location, date, and how you got the band). You may also report the
     band electronically, through a link from the Web page.

 Hot Topics

     Why is it important to save manatees?

     The USGS Florida Caribbean Science Center administers the Sirenia
     Project, which encompasses a team of scientists dedicated to
     long-term research on the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus)
     in Florida.

     Why save the manatee? It boils down to a fundamentally basic
     concept: Manatees are part of a system. If you remove any component
     from a system, you have changed something. Change something and you
     see an effect on something else. An example of this concept is what
     we worry about most for manatee survival; that is, what if we kill
     most of the plants? If we do, the manatees will not be able to eat
     and they will die. On the other hand, manatees help control the
     vegetation that can choke Florida waterways. They also provide a
     benefit by processing the vegetation they eat and passing it back
     out into the environment as a form of fertilizer.

     Ecotourism forms the basis for a flourishing tourist industry in
     Florida.  Close to 70,000 people visit Crystal River every year just
     to see and swim with manatees, thus helping the local economy.

     There is an aesthetic value to manatees as well. They are fun to
     watch and we can learn a lot from their non-aggressive, passive
     demeanor.

     Manatees are indeed gentle giants. Making laws to protect the
     manatees, like slowing boats in waterways, also makes it safer for
     people. Many boaters tend to travel too fast anyway, and having a
     law to slow them down will make it safer for everyone. No Entry
     zones or sanctuaries set up for manatees protects many kinds of
     plants and animals in the water. Building codes to make construction
     in Florida comply with laws to protect manatees also helps fish and
     bird life.

     Protecting endangered and threatened species and restoring them to a
     secure status in the wild is the primary objective of the endangered
     species program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of
     the Department of the Interior. The Endangered Species Web site can
     be accessed at http://www.fws.gov/r9endspp/endspp.html.
     I read in the paper that frogs and toads are becoming scarce and
     that many of them have extra legs and other deformities.  Is this a
     sign of disease that is causing them to die?

     Declines in several amphibian species have been studied for the past
     20 years.  More recent concern about deformed frogs arose with the
     discovery of large numbers of deformed leopard frogs in Minnesota in
     1995.  But scientists who have studied amphibian declines and
     deformities agree that deformities are unlikely to have caused the
     extensive, well-documented declines of many amphibian species
     worldwide.  USGS scientists have described severe declines of
     several amphibian species in Colorado and California.  Although they
     have observed that many species are absent from historically
     documented localities, often in national parks and wilderness areas,
     they have rarely observed deformities.  For example, USGS scientist
     Dr. Gary Fellers has studied declining amphibian populations in
     California for the last 9 years.  He and his field crews have
     visited over 4,500 sites and examined over 8,000 frogs and toads.
     Fewer than 10 of these individuals had any type of deformity.

     The recent research on deformities provides additional evidence that
     deformed frogs may occur naturally as a result of parasite
     infections. But it does not prove that all deformities are caused by
     parasites nor that global species declines are associated with
     deformities.  It is probable that deformities in different
     localities have different causes.  In the Upper Midwest, deformities
     similar to those in wild frogs have been produced in
     laboratory-reared frogs exposed to water and soil extracts from
     sites where deformed frogs have been studied.  Extracts did not
     contain the parasite (metacercariae) but did contain chemicals
     present when samples were taken. Thus, chemical causes of
     deformities should continue to be explored.  In studies of deformed
     leopard frogs in Midwestern and Northeastern states, scientists at
     the USGS National Wildlife Health Center did not find parasites
     (metacercariae) in the limb buds of the developing tadpoles and they
     have not yet found evidence that a parasite influenced limb
     development in these tadpoles.

     A variety of mechanisms, including habitat alteration and
     destruction, introduction of exotic predators, disease, and possibly
     airborne contaminants, have brought about amphibian declines. For
     several declining species, such as the boreal toad in the Rocky
     Mountains or several species studied by Dr. Fellers in the Sierra
     Nevada, the agents have not been discovered.  This is cause for
     concern because these studies have been conducted in undisturbed or
     protected locations.

     The USGS is continuing research on the causes of amphibian
     declines.  We believe that this research will lead to a better
     understanding of why we are losing frogs and toads in the very parks
     and wilderness areas where we would expect them to be best
     protected.

     If you have an interest in these topics, we suggest that you visit
     http://biology.usgs.gov/frog.html,
     http://www.mp2-pwrc.usgs.gov/frogwatch/, and
     http://www.frogweb.gov/index.html.  All of these sites contain many
     links to related amphibian information.

     Why do animals become endangered?

     There are many different reasons that animals are endangered,
     especially loss of their habitat -- where they live, eat, and raise
     their young. Protecting endangered and threatened species and
     restoring them to a secure status in the wild is the primary
     objective of the endangered species program of the U.S. Fish and
     Wildlife Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The
     Endangered Species Web site can be accessed at
     <http://www.fws.gov/r9endspp/endspp.html>.

     Is the USGS studying the problems with the Yellowstone bison and
     brucellosis?

     USGS scientists are collaborating with university, State, and
     Federal groups on a number of studies. Ecological studies focus on
     forage availability, habitat use, and bison population dynamics.
     Brucellosis research includes examining the risk of transmission of
     the disease from wildlife to cattle, identification of exposed
     animals in the field, and the safety of vaccines to wildlife
     species. The information gained from these studies assists national
     park managers, Federal and State officials, Congress, and others in
     developing future bison management plans.  See
     http://www.mesc.usgs.gov/research_briefs/Bison_Brucellosis.html  for
     summaries of the current bison and brucellosis studies being
     conducted by USGS and collaborating scientists.

     Could you provide me with information on the problems in the Salton
     Sea?

     Birds:  Information on Salton Sea bird die-offs can be found through
     the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Web site at
     http://www.emtc.usgs.gov/nwhchome.html. Information has been issued
     by the center through their Quarterly Wildlife Mortality Report and
     Current News and Events page.

     Fish:  There are several species of Tilapia in the Salton Sea. By
     far, the most abundant is Tilapia mossambica. This fish was
     accidentally introduced by nearby fish-rearing facilities in the
     1960s, and it has proliferated as the salinity has increased.  This
     is the species that now comprises the majority of fish involved in
     massive die-offs and is suspected of having a role in the deaths of
     fish-eating birds from avian botulism.

     Another good information resource is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
     Service Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge Web page. You can also
     download the document "Saving the Salton Sea" at their Web site at
     http://www.r1.fws.gov/text/salton.html.

     Why can't we use zebra mussels' filtering abilities to our advantage
     by using them to help clean our water? Are they edible? Can zebra
     mussels be of benefit to humans in any way?

     Zebra mussels have caused negative shifts in zooplankton populations
     in the Great Lakes and have nearly wiped out all native mussels in
     western Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair. No one has been able to come
     up with any commercial use for them so far. As for them cleaning up
     the water, algae in the water is a good thing, unless it gets out of
     control -- which means that something else is out of balance. In
     that case, zebra mussels would only be a temporary solution -- and
     would, in fact, create a new problem. Then, what do we do with all
     the zebra mussels that have eaten all the algae that other native
     organisms depend on? Zebra mussels may be edible, but are far too
     small to bother with.

     Economically speaking, zebra mussels have costs millions of dollars
     in cleanup and control in industrial settings. These costs are
     passed on to the consumer or taxpayer. Unfortunately, zebra mussels
     are here to stay. But precautions should still be taken to keep them
     from uninfested waters.  We suggest that you visit the USGS Florida
     Caribbean Science Center "Zebra Information Resources" Web pages at
     http://nas.er.usgs.gov/zebra.mussel/.  In addition to providing
     information on this destructive invasive species, the site contains
     a zebra mussel sighting link, and links to U.S. distribution maps,
     status reports, datasets and digital products, nonidigenous aquatic
     species meetings and contacts, zebra mussel books and journals, and
     to the National Zebra Mussel and Aquatic Nuisance Species
     Clearinghouse.

     I heard that honeybee populations are declining.  What effect does
     this have on pollination?

     Purdue University maintains a Web page with links to many honeybee
     pages, including several addressing population declines (for
     example, see http://www.guildford.ac.uk/beehive/adibra.htm).
     Another page, the Internationl Bee Research Association, also
     contains a wealth of information and pertinent links.

     Where can I find information on gypsy moths?

     The USDA Forest Service maintains a Web page on the Gypsy Moth in
     North America <http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/morgantown/4557/gmoth/>.
     This page contains many links to additional gypsy moth information.

     How can I find the scientific names of plants and animals?

     Systematics, or taxonomy, is the branch of biological sciences that
     deals with identification, description, naming and classification of
     the world's biota.  Taxonomic information can be found through the
     National Biological Information Infrastructure -- the NBII -- at
     http://www.nbii.gov/index.html.  Just click on "Biodiversity,
     Systematics, and Collections" , and then on "Systematics" .  Here
     you will find links to a number of excellent sources for the
     information you are seeking, including the Integrated Taxonomic
     Information System, or ITIS.   ITIS   is a partnership of U.S.,
     Canadian, and Mexican agencies, other organizations, and taxonomic
     specialists cooperating on the development of an online,
     scientifically credible list of biological names focusing on the
     biota of North America.  ITIS is also a participating member of
     Species 2000, an international project indexing the world's known
     species.

     Can you help me design a science fair project?

     The National Biological Information Infrastructure the NBII is a
     USGS-led initiative dedicated to the development of an electronic
     federation of biological data and information sources. The NBII
     maintains an Education site containing links to a variety of
     age-specific materials.  The "College/Adult Level" pages provide
     links to many interesting biology projects, including the University
     of Wisconsin's Amphibian Embryology Tutorial and the Whole Frog
     Project.  The Baltimore Public Library's Science Fair Web pages take
     you through a step-by-step science fair primer. And the U.S.
     Department of Agriculture site, Your Science Fair Project, contains
     a wealth of information and links. Finally, Showboard's Web site
     provides a large number of topics for consideration.

     Thousands lady bugs were clinging to the outside of my house.  I was
     wondering why.  Do they bite?

     A good place for the information you seek is a university extension
     office or entomology department. The home page of the Iowa State
     University Department of Entomology has a link from the question
     "Are lady beetles invading your home?"  that will take you to a fact
     sheet on lady beetles (also known as lady bugs). According to Iowa
     State University's Information Notes Web page, "The Asian lady
     beetle, like boxelder bugs, pine seed bugs and elm leaf beetles, is
     an outdoor insect that becomes a nuisance pest as an accidental
     invader. As with other accidental invaders, the Asian lady beetles
     are harmless. They cannot bite or sting, they do not carry diseases,
     and they do not feed or reproduce indoors."

     How can I tell if a dog food is nutritious? Do you have information
     on pet care?

     A good source for the information you are seeking would be a school
     of veterinary medicine.  The University of Pennsylvania's Web site
     contains a page with links to all North American schools, which you
     can access at <http://cahpwww.nbc.upenn.edu/vetmed/vetmed1.htm>.

     What do you know about water pollution and cancer in humans?

     Our focus is not on human health nor do we maintain expertise in
     that area. We suggest that you direct your inquiry through the
     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their Web site provides
