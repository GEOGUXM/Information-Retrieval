Selected ICM Publications

   In this section we first feature new publications, and then provide a
   brief list of several major references on ICM which present a good
   introduction to the field, as well as information on where these
   references may be obtained. We then provide a more detailed list of
   publications in the field, including materials on ICM concepts,
   methods, and case studies. A link to GPA's Document Library is a recent
   addition to this section.

   Integrated Coastal Zone Management. NOAA/NOS Office of Ocean Resources
   Conservation and Assessment, Silver Spring, Maryland. (65 pages).

     The booklet provides a brief introduction, definitions, and basic
     approaches for planning and analysis of integrated coastal
     management.

   Aspects of Integrated Coastal Area Management in National Legislation.
   Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;
   Development Law Service, Legal Office. (118 pages).

     The report, which is the result of a study for the Development Law
     Service, Legal Office, FAO, focuses on design of the legal and
     institutional framework for the management of coastal resources. It
     examines why various countries have introduced legislation to
     promote integrated coastal management, what these laws seek to
     achieve and the main legal issues which arise. The study reviews the
     legislation of a wide range of jurisdictions worldwide to highlight
     how different jurisdictions have dealt with legal issues in the
     field. Examples from around the world of promising legal innovations
     are presented, and their legal antecedents and implications are
     discussed.

   Management: Concepts and Experiences. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.
   (517 pages).

     This book, written in collaboration with the Intergovernmental
     Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO, introduces Integrated Coastal and
     Ocean Management (ICM) and its basic concepts and methodologies;
     examines the development of international prescriptions on ICM;
     provides a practical guide to all phases of ICM -- from building
     political support to the nuts and bolts of implementation;
     emphasizes the institutional aspects of ICM; and provides advice on
     methods of achieving intersectoral and intergovernmental
     collaboration on ICM; presents case comparisons drawn from the
     authors' survey of twenty-nine developed and developing nations, and
     makes observations on ICM approaches that are most successful.

   Clark, John R. 1996. Coastal Zone Management Handbook. Boca Raton, FL:
   Lewis Publishers (694 pages).

     This reference book is a compilation of information from various
     disciplines. The information is structured by four major categories:
     a description of the strategic approach to integrated coastal
     management, including concepts, problems, and solutions; a
     prescription of specific management techniques, planning
     instructions, and outcomes; a general compilation of information
     about coastal resources and management; and a collection of
     mini-case histories of coastal situations along with management
     techniques and their trials.

   Coastal Management. Manuals and Guides IOC, no. 36. Paris, France:
   UNESCO. (47 pages)

     Produced within the context of a working party, in cooperation
     between the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the
     Intergovernmental Man and Biosphere Programme (MAB), the
     Intergovernmental Hydrology Programm (IHP) and the International
     Geographical Correlation Programme (IGCP), this essentially
     practical guide provides a tool for an integrated coastal management
     system to assist decision-makers and developers. The guide presents
     a proposed methodological approach, which comprises six stages:
     analysis of the problem, definition of coherent management units,
     qualification of coastal space, indicators and indices, information
     systems and orientation and proposals for objectives. Each stage is
     illustrated by a case study.
