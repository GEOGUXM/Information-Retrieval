    Facilitating U.S. Trade in Electricity

       U.S. trade in electric energy with Canada and Mexico is rising,
       bringing economic and reliability benefits to the United States and its
       trading partners. Within the Office of Fossil Energy's Coal & Power
       organization, an electricity import/export team is responsible for
       authorizing the export of electric energy and the issuance of permits
       for the construction, connection, operation, and/or maintenance of
       electric transmission facilities at the international border.

       The electricity import/export team acts as a facilitator with other
       governments and U.S. industry by supporting:

                                      BENEFITS

       Through its activities, the electricity import and export team is
       promoting efficiency, environmental sustainability, and competition in
       the electric power industry both domestically and internationally.
       Benefits include:
         * Improved reliability in the transmission of electric energy
         * Decreased electric prices for consumers throughout North America
         * Increased export earnings to U.S. industry

       section of the Office of Fossil Energy supports economic and
       realibility analyses that will enable all three countries to more fully
       realize the potential of cooperation in electric trade.
