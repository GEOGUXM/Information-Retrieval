     The Edwards eLIST

   The Edwards eList is a newsletter periodically e-mailed to subscribers.
   It enables interested constituents to receive updates on legislative
   issues before the United States Senate. The eList also allows me to
   inform you of my visits to North Carolina so you might share your views
   and concerns with me while I'm there.

   Signing up is easy. Simply fill in the information below and click on
   the Join the eLIST button.
