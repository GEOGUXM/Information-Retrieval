   The principle of measuring total solar irradiance involves comparing
   the heating effect of irradiant flux on a detector to the electrical
   power dissipated in a heating element in intimate contact with the
   detector. Various corrections will be applied to the observed signal.
   ACRIM's Sun position sensor signals and temperature are used to correct
   solar pointing errors and temperature dependencies. Astronomical
   ephemeris data are used to reduce the irradiance data to the mean
   Sun-Earth distance. These corrections include the annual Sun-Earth
   distance variation, the orbital Sun-satellite distance variation, and
   the relativistic effect of the Earth's and satellite's orbital
   velocities relative to the Sun.
