   qualifying part-time employees participate in one of the following
   statewide retirement systems administered by the Washington State
   Department of Retirement Systems, under cost-sharing multiple-employer
   public employee defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
   plans. The Department of Retirement Systems (DRS), a department within
   the primary government of the State of Washington, issues a publicly
   available comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) that includes
   financial statements and required supplementary information for each
   plan. The DRS CAFR may be obtained by writing to: Department of
   Retirement Systems, Communications Unit, P.O. Box 48380, Olympia, WA
   98504-8380. The following disclosures are made pursuant to GASB
   Statement No. 27, Accounting for Pensions by State and Local Government
   Employers. Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) Plans 1 and 2
   Plan Description PERS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement
   system. Membership in the system includes: elected officials; state
   employees; employees of the Supreme, Appeals, and Superior courts
   (other than judges in a judicial retirement system); employees of
   legislative committees; college and university employees (not in
   national higher education retirement programs); judges of district and
   municipal courts; and employees of local governments. The PERS system
   includes two defined benefit pension plans. Participants who joined the
   system by September 30, 1977, are Plan 1 members. Those joining
   thereafter are enrolled in Plan 2. Retirement benefits are financed
   from employee and employer contributions and investment earnings.
   Retirement benefits in both Plan 1 and Plan 2 are vested after
   completion of five years of eligible service. Retirement benefit
   provisions are established in state statute and may be amended only by
   the state legislature. Plan 1 members are eligible for retirement at
   any age after 30 years of service, or at age 60 with five years of
   service, or at age 55 with 25 years of service. The annual pension is
   two percent of the average final compensation per year of service,
   capped at 60 percent. The average final compensation is based on the
   greatest compensation during any 24 eligible consecutive compensation
   months. If qualified, after reaching age 66 a cost-of-living allowance
   is granted based on years of service credit and is capped at three
   percent annually. Plan 2 members may retire at age 65 with five years
   of service, or at age 55 with 20 years of service, with an allowance of
   two percent per year of service of the average final compensation. Plan
   2 retirements prior to 65 receive reduced benefits. If retirement is at
   age 55 with 30 years of service, a 3 percent per year reduction
   applies, otherwise an actuarial reduction will apply. There is no cap
   on years of service credit and a cost-of-living allowance is granted,
   capped at three percent annually. There are 1,177 participating
