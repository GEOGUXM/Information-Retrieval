                               Quantum Computing
     __________________________________________________________________

   A quantum computer is a device in which data can be stored in a network
   of quantum mechanical two-level systems, such as spin-1/2 particles or
   two level atoms. The quantum mechanical nature of such systems allows
   the possibility of a powerful new feature to be incorporated into data
   processing, namely the capability of performing logical operations upon
   quantum mechanical superpositions of numbers. In a conventional digital
   computer each data register is, throughout any computation, always in a
   definite state "1" or "0"; however in a quantum computer each data
   register (or "qubit") will be in an undetermined quantum superposition
   of two states |1> and |0>. Calculations would then be performed by
   external interactions with the various two-level systems that
   constitute the device, in such a way that logic gate operations
   involving two or more different qubits can be realized. The final
   result would be obtained by measurement of the quantum mechanical
   probability amplitudes at the conclusion of the calculation. The
   "killer application" for quantum computers is a quantum algorithm
   called Shor's algorithm after its inventor, Peter Shor of AT&T Bell
   Labs. This algorithm allows the determination of the prime factors of
   large composite numbers efficiently, which has tremendous potential
   applications. So far, the most promising hardware proposed for
   implementation of such a device seems to be the cold-trapped ion system
   devised by Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller of the University of
   Innsbruck, Austria.

   Their design, which is shown schematically in figure 1, consists of a
   string of ions stored in a linear radio-frequency trap and cooled
   sufficiently that their motion, which is coupled together due to the
   Coulomb force between them, is quantum mechanical in nature. Each qubit
   would be formed by two internal levels of each ion, a laser being used
   to perform manipulations of the quantum mechanical probability
   amplitudes of the states; conditional two-qubit logic gates being
   realized with aid of the excitation or de-excitation of quanta of the
   ions' collective motion. At Los Alamos we are building a prototype
   quantum computer based on this scheme. For various reasons, singly
   ionized Calcium seems to be the best choice of ion. A simplified energy
   level diagram is shown in figure 2, with transition wavelengths and
   decay times. The engineering problems associated with making such a
   device work are formidable. Firstly an ion trap had to be designed and
   built; in January of 1997, Calcium ions were confined in the ion trap
   that has been built by the quantum information group here at Los
   Alamos. Next the ions have to be cooled down to their ground state; we
   are currently performing numerical simulations of the laser cooling
   procedure to establish the optimum laser powers and wavelengths to do
   this job. Once the ions are cooled, the computation will be performed
   by a series of laser pulses directed at one or other of the ions; each
   pulse must transfer population from one level of the ion to a different
   level, without exciting any third level, or affecting any of the
   adjacent ions. Sometimes the laser will be used to excite a quantum of
   the ions' oscillations, requiring the that the laser be in a standing
   wave. Chosing the best combination of lasers and energy level of the
   ion, and then inventing ways in which these operations can be performed
   reliably with the available technology is a complicated problem of
   atomic and optical physics. Of course, it will be impossible to perform
   all of the operations required to execute a quantum algorithm
   completely reliably, and so there is also a lot work being done here on
   the theory of fault tolerant quantum computation.
