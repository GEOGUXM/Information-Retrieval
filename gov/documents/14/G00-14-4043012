   expertise.                                                             Earth

   Government auditors and CPAs must receive up-to-date and accurate

   with courses that meet the CPE requirements mandated by the Government
   Auditing Standards and state boards of accountancy. Public accounting
   organizations performing government audits will also benefit from our
   training.
