   Tips for the office Have a good work ethic and good work product Don't
   be afraid to say ``I don't know'' Don't be satisfied, always seek to do
   more Be courteous to everyone Follow directions and ask questions
   Report to work on time Be careful of personal phone calls Let someone
   know when you're leaving the office and when you expect to return Don't
   let your lunch hour be a lunch day, you technically only get 30 minutes
   for lunch Try to meet with your supervisor regularly for feedback Stay
   teachable, always be willing to learn Don't burn your bridges, you
   never know which way you'll have to cross again Learn as much as you
   can about your job and how it fits in the mission of NINDS Be
   recruiters, always look for other students who might be assets to the
   program????????????
