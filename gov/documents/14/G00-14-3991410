     B Specific Memoranda of Understanding B-1

   1. Background. The National Weather Service (NWS) is facing a dilemma
   in meeting the growing needs of communities requesting assistance in
   developing local flood warning systems (LFWS). A local flood warning
   system is defined as a community or locally based system consisting of
   volunteers, rainfall, river and other hydrologic gages, hydrologic
   models or procedures, a communications network and a community flood
   coordinator responsible for issuing a flood warning. Local flood
   warning systems are classified as manual or automated. Currently the
   NWS provides specific flood forecast and warning services for over
   3,100 communities in the United States. With approximately 900 LFWS's
   in operation in 1985, nearly 4,000 communities in the Nation are now
   receiving site-specific flood warning services. The Federal Emergency
   Management Agency has determined that 20,000 locations in the Nation
   are flood prone. The remaining 16,000 communities receive warnings
   through general county-wide flash flood warning services. These
   services are limited because of a lack of data. The data problem occurs
   because many of the 16,000 communities are located on small, flashy
   streams which may crest in a period ranging from a few hours down to
   less than 1 hour following the occurrence of heavy rainfall. Very
   little lead time is available in these situations to warn residents.
   Because of the scarcity of hydrologic data in these river basins and
   because floods occur in such short time periods, the NWS is presently
   unable to provide specific warning service to these vulnerable
   communities.

   LFWS's offer communities maximum potential benefits in a flood warning
   service. Various types and levels of sophistication of LFWS's exist to
   meet community needs. Because community officials recognize the value
   of an LFWS and because the NWS has increased its community awareness
   publicity program, the demand by communities for LFWS's has increased
   significantly. Many state, county, and local governments are turning to
   the NWS for assistance. Also some communities are, in essence, setting
   up their own LFWS, which may or may not meet their needs. The demand
   for assistance in implementing LFWS's continues to increase. In order
   to meet its basic flood warning mission, the NWS must be prepared to
   respond to this growing problem.

   2. General Policy. Recognizing the importance of LFWS's in improving
   flood warning service to communities, the NWS will continue to provide
   technical assistance to communities to the extent resources are
   available. The main objectives of implementing LFWS's are: (1) to
   provide communities with an effective warning system and thus reduce
   the risk of disaster and (2) to provide a data base to the NWS to
   support the NWS flood and flash flood warning program. NWS resources
   will be directed to support only LFWS's that meet both of these
   objectives. When providing technical assistance to communities, the NWS
   will: (1) ensure data collected by the system are made available to the
   appropriate NWS office(s) in as near real time as possible; (2) require
   coordination between cooperators and the NWS in providing real-time
   flood forecasts and warnings; (3) encourage development and use of an
   emergency action plan by cooperators; and (4) clearly define the
   responsibilities of the NWS and cooperators with regard to the design,
   installation, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the LFWS.
   In this policy, the term cooperator usually refers to the community but
   can include agencies such as the Corps of Engineers or Federal
   Emergency Management Administration.

   NWS offices are limited in staff and monetary resources. Each community
   request for NWS technical support should be evaluated carefully in
   determining the permissible level of involvement. The meteorologist in
   charge of the Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) and the
   hydrologist in charge (HIC) of the servicing River Forecast Center
   (RFC) should coordinate with each other before any commitment is made
   external to the NWS.

   The basic NWS philosophy behind an LFWS is that it is a cooperative
   venture between the Federal Government and a cooperator with a
   requirement for a flood warning system. The types of LFWS's are
   described in Appendix A. As explained in that appendix, many of the
   systems have evolved in the past few years to take advantage of new
   electronics technology.

   The Memorandum of Understanding (MOW) between the NWS and the
   cooperator (see Appendix B for examples) is established to set forth
   the responsibilities of the NWS and the cooperator.

   NWS assistance to communities consists of:

     (1) recommending alternative LFWS's to meet the economic
     capabilities of the community and

     (2) supporting the system depending on the type of LFWS chosen and
     the NWS's available resources.

   Communities are usually in the best position to understand their local
   flood problems, to observe events during flood periods, and to take
   appropriate action to limit flood losses. During a flood event, LFWS's
   provide a cooperative basis for local officials and the NWS to work
   together efficiently to produce reliable, timely local warnings. In the
   event communication fails between the community and the NWS, local
   officials should have enough information to act independently.

   In general, the cooperator is expected to procure, install, maintain,
   and operate all LFWS equipment necessary to meet its requirements. The
   NWS will procure, install, maintain, and operate only that equipment
   necessary to provide data from LFWS's directly to appropriate NWS
   office(s) in a usable format and only if funding is available. The MOU
   states, in concise terms, the NWS's warning responsibilities and how
   these responsibilities are to be integrated into the operation of the
   LFWS. Prior to any NWS procurements or software development pertaining
   to an LFWS, a fully executed MOU will be in place. The MOU must require
   the cooperator to develop an emergency action plan and to work with the
   NWS to ensure appropriate data, forecasts, and warnings are exchanged.
   The MOU should also spell out as clearly as practicable the technical
   support to be provided by the NWS, as well as the specific
   responsibilities of both the NWS and the cooperator with regard to
   design, procurement, installation, operation, and maintenance of the
   LFWS.

   3. NWS Office Responsibilities.

   3.1 Office of Meteorology. The Office of Meteorology (OM) is
   responsible to see that activities of LFWS's integrate into the overall
   watch/warning activities of the NWS. OM is also responsible for
   direction and technical support of preparedness for floods and flash
   floods. Additional OM activities include preparation of training
   materials for area managers, MIC's, OIC's, and warning preparedness
   meteorologists in coordination with the Office of Hydrology (OH). OM
   also has the responsibility, working closely with OH, to develop a
   national flash flood verification program.

   3.2 Office of Hydrology. OH is responsible for providing overall
   guidance and coordination for LFWS's at the National Headquarters. This
   includes: setting national standards for LFWS's including data formats,
   software compatibility, and functional characteristics of both software
   and hardware, and providing technical guidance to the OM in formulating
   model emergency action plans and training material for local offices to
   assist in LFWS's. These activities include preparation of training
   materials for area managers, MIC's, OIC's, and warning preparedness
   meteorologists. OH will coordinate the NWS role with the headquarters
   of various Federal agencies.

   3.3 Regions. Regional Directors are responsible for implementation of
   this policy and overall management of LFWS's. This includes training,
   planning, and allocation of resources to provide assistance to
   cooperators (state, county, or municipal governments), where possible,
   in establishing them. The Regional Director will be the responsible NWS
   agent to sign MOW's with cooperating agencies.

   3.4 Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO). The WSFO is responsible for
   issuing flash flood watches for state and county warnings, and
   therefore must have access to real-time data and forecasts generated by
   LFWS's. The area manager of the appropriate WSFO is responsible for
   coordinating NWS assistance to communities. The WSO, RFC, regions, and
   WSH will support the area manager in meeting this responsibility. This
   includes maintaining any equipment installed in an NWS office and
   belonging to the NWS. Coordination and support will be required from
   the RFC's, WSO, regions, and OH. It is necessary for the WSFO/WSO to
   have access to real-time LFWS hydrologic data and forecasts to support
   the NWS flash flood watch/warning program. The WSFO can offer the flood
   coordinator (the community official responsible for collecting
   hydrologic data, generating a flood forecast, if appropriate, and
   disseminating the warning to community officials) currently available
   information during the flood event, such as quantitative precipitation
   forecasts, radar, and satellite information. The WSFO can also offer
   rapid preparation and dissemination of warnings back to the
   cooperator's area threatened by flooding. As stated earlier, this is
   one of the primary reasons for implementing an LFWS. The WSFO will be
   responsible for rapid dissemination of warning messages developed
   either within that office or in conjunction with the cooperator. The
   area manager is also responsible for ensuring that interagency
   coordination occurs. Interagency coordination refers to coordination
   with the state flood plain management or emergency services officials
   and any local federal agency involved in the system implementation.

   3.5 Weather Service Office (WSO). The WSO is responsible for county
   flash flood warnings and must therefore have access to real-time data
   and forecasts generated by LFWS's in its area of responsibility. The
   WSO may also assist in the implementation of LFWS's. The WSO will be
   responsible for rapid dissemination of warning or alert messages
   developed either within that office or in conJunction with the
   cooperator.

   3.6 River Forecast Center (RFC). The RFC assists the community through
   the WSFO in implementation of an LFWS as resources permit. The RFC role
   in terms of technical support varies according to the type of LFWS
   involved. For the manual self-help system, the RFC provides assistance
   to the WSFO and community in the site selection of the hydrologic
   observation network and development of hydrologic procedures to
   forecast floods and provides real-time headwater advisory and flash
   flood guidance to the appropriate WSFO/WSO.

   For automated systems, the RFC can provide assistance to the WSFO and
   community in the site selection of the hydrologic observation network;
   provide generic automated local flood warning system standards for
   hardware, software, and hydrologic models to a requesting community;
   act in an advisory capacity to the community for the calibration of
   hydrologic models; coordinate radio frequency usage; assist in the
   composition and evaluation of an emergency action plan; monitor and
   evaluate system performance.

   For flash flood alarm gages, the RFC assists the WSFO/community in site
   selection of the gage(s), technical advice on the location/operation of
   the base station, and general monitor and evaluation of the system
   performance. The RFC must have access to real-time data and forecasts
   from the LFWS to support the flood forecast program. The RFC's furnish
   guidance products to the WSFO/WSO, such as flash flood guidance,
   headwater advisory guidance, and downstream crest forecasts.

   RFC technical support may be limited by the availability of personnel
   and time. Each request by the community or WSFO should be evaluated
   individually, and the level of involvement of the RFC should be
   determined by the HIC.

   APPENDIX A

                 Types of Local Flood Warning Systems (LFWS)

   A.1 General Information.

   There are two basic types of LFWS's: manual and automated. These are
   described below. Both manual and automated systems are designed to make
   full use of local skills. They offer a range of options in cost and
   technical complexity to fit the local situation. Experience with
   automated systems is growing rapidly. This experience is described
   below in terms of Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time (ALERT)
   systems that were first developed on an individual community
   stand-alone basis and Integrated Flood Observing and Warning Systems
   (IFLOWS) that is being developed to serve many communities on an
   area-wide basis in Appalachia. The same technology is used in both
   ALERT and IFLOWS.

   A.2 Manual Self-Help LFWS's.

   Most of the LFWS's in operation today are manual self-help systems.
   These systems are inexpensive and simple to operate. However, if not
   well managed, they can become extremely personnel intensive and very
   expensive to operate. The manual self-help system is comprised of a
   local data collection system, a community flood coordinator, a simple
   to use flood forecast procedure, a communication network to distribute
   warnings to appropriate emergency/response officials, and an
   emergency/action plan (see exhibit E-12-A1).

   The simplest and least expensive approach to data collection is to
   recruit volunteer observers to collect rain and stream gage data.
   Inexpensive plastic rain gages are supplied to volunteer observers who
   report rainfall amounts to a community flood coordinator. The flood
   coordinator must maintain the volunteer rainfall networks and plastic
   rain gages. More sophisticated automated rain gages may be necessary in
   remote areas or in situations where observers are not available. Stream
   gages also vary in sophistication from those receiving site
   observations (i.e., tape down points, staff gages, etc.) to remote
   observations (i.e., telemarks, satellite, radio, etc.).

   The River Forecast Center (RFC), at the request of the meteorologist in
   charge/area manager, can provide the flood coordinator with a simple,
   easy to use forecast procedure. These procedures normally consist of
   tables, graphs, or charts which compare observed rainfall with an index
   for flooding as input and provide a flood forecast as output (see
   exhibit E-12-A2). These indices to flooding are determined by the RFC
   and provided to the Weather Service Forecast Office and Weather Service
   Office as well as the cooperator. Flood forecasts vary from a
   categorical forecast of flooding to a numerical crest value. Forecasts
   may also include the time remaining before flood stage will be reached
   or the time when the crest will occur. Once a forecast is generated,
   the coordinator should then contact the responsible National Weather
   Service (NWS) office for final coordination

   A.3 Automated LFWS's.

   In the past decade, a substantial growth in technology and a decrease
   in the cost of computer systems have resulted in the development of
   automated flood warning systems. The specific systems that have evolved
   so far are described below. There are many private vendors now
   marketing automated LFWS's.

   A.3.1 Flash Flood Alarm Systems.

   Flash flood alarm gages consist of water level sensor(s) connected to
   an alarm or light located at a community agency with 24-hour operation.
   Water levels exceeding one or more preset levels trigger the alarm. The
   alarm is located upstream of the community. The lead-time warning is
   given when the alarm sensor is set at a pre-determined critical water
   level. Exhibit E-12-A3 illustrates the installation of a typical flash
   flood alarm gage. Communication between the gage and base station can
   be achieved by a dedicated land line or via radio waves. Flash flood
   alarm gages can also be used as part of the manual and automated LFWS's
   as described below.

   A.3.2 Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time (ALERT).

   The ALERT system was developed by the California-Nevada River Forecast
   Center in Sacramento, California. This system consists of automated
   event reporting river and precipitation gages, automated data
   collection and processing equipment, a hydrologic model,
   hydrometeorological analysis, and processing software. as well as
   communications and display software.

   The precipitation gages are modular, self-contained event reporting
   units. A tipping bucket mechanism (lmm) causes transmission of a radio
   signal containing the station identifier and an accumulated
   precipitation value. The river gage is a simple event-reporting unit
   which transmits preselected incremental changes in river elevation. The
   same electronics and radio package used in the rain gage is utilized
   with the river gage. Both are powered by self-contained batteries.

   Data collection and processing hardware consist of a radio receiver to
   collect event reported radio signals and a dedicated microcomputer
   system. Radio transmissions from the gage locations to the local agency
   are line-of-sight.

   The data collection system operates continuously in a fully automatic
   mode, receiving data and processing information for display to the
   user, including precipitation maps. The Sacramento streamflow
   simulation model can provide updated streamflow forecasts every 12
   minutes.

   A.3.3 Integrated Flood Observing and Warning Systems (IFLOWS).

   The NWS in cooperation with the Appalachia Regional Commission, the
   Tennessee Valley Authority, and the States of Kentucky, Virginia,
   Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Tennessee has implemented a prototype
   IFLOWS. This system combines event-reporting sensors, data and voice
   communications, and minicomputer technology to each county in a
   100-county region.

   Data, forecasts, and warning products are distributed to state and
   county authorities responsible for the provision of emergency services
   to people in flood-threatened areas. NWS offices are directly linked to
   IFLOWS.

   The sensors trigger the transmission of radio signals that include the
   station identifiers and values of the monitored parameters. The sensors
   and transmitters are powered by batteries and are independent of
   commercial power sources.

   Radio transmissions from the sensors are line-of-sight to strategically
   located receivers. Data are then relayed by microwave radio to the
   dedicated, central processing minicomputer. The counties/communities
   can receive data, forecasts, and warning products over this same
   communication system from the minicomputer. IFLOWS operates
   continuously to monitor local conditions for the counties and for NWS
   offices in the IFLOWS region.

   APPENDIX B

                     Specific Memoranda of Understanding

   This appendix contains guidelines for constructing a Memorandum of
   Understanding (MOU). The first MOU is for a community sponsored flood
   warning system that can be applied to an automated LFWS, such as
   Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time or flash flood alarm systems.
   The second MOU pertains to manual self-help systems. While these MOW's
   are primarily to be used as guidelines, the basic content and intention
   of these samples should be contained in any MOU between the NWS and a
   cooperator.
