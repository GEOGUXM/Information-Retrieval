                         NCEP/DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis

                               (Reanalysis-2)

   The NCEP/DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (Reanalysis-2) is based on the widely
   used NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. The goal of Reanalysis-2 is to improve upon
   the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis by fixing the errors and by updating the
   parameterizations of the physical processes.

   While we think that Reanalysis-2 is better; we know that it should not
   be considered the "next generation" of reanalysis. Improvements such as
   higher horizontal and vertical resolution, direct assimilation of
   radiances, (proper) use of SSM/I data, assimilation of rainfall data,
   need to be incorporated.

   [new.png] 1/11/01: A problem was found in the program that created the
   monthly means. The mean values are correct but the GRIB header is
   flawed. Naturally GrADS and wgrib users are unaffected by the problem.
   If they were, the problem would have been fixed during the software
   development stage. For those who want the gory details, the scan mode
   is wrong for the 2.5x2.5 grids and the longitude increment is wrong for
   the Gaussian grids. A program to fix the headers will be made
   available.

   [new.png] 12/22/00: NCAR (Roy Jenne's group) has R2 analyses.

   [new.png] 12/19/00: Computed 30 year (79-98) climatologies for the flx
   and pgb monthly means. These climatologies are available for download
   and have been integrated into the web plotting system. Now you can plot
   R2 anomalies from climatology.

   [new.png] 12/1/2000: Analyses from August 1998 to February 1999 have
   been redone. By mistake, automatic programs have downloaded the old
   March 1999-December 1999 analyses. Please eliminate all copies of
   August 1998+ data that were obtained prior to Nov 16, 2000 and March
   1999+ data that were obtain prior to Dec 2, 2000.

   10/17/2000: All analyses from August 1998 are being redone. More
   problems found with converting the surface fields (snow and sea-ice) to
   the R2 assimilation system.

   7/27/2000: A computer glich was uncovered in 06Z 19 March 1982, flx,
   dg3, znl files. The PRATE was corrupted with a unrealistic wavey
   pattern and the problem went away when the model was rerun. We suspect
   a hardware glitch. The continuity of the assimilation was not affected
   as 3/19/82 is part of the "rerun" assimilation (1/79-9/82). (A change
   in the stratiform cloud tuning was done mid-way through the
   assimilation, Since the change in the cloud tuning would have only a
   small effect on the pressure level analyses, it was decided to keep the
   sigma/pgb analyses and just run the forecast model with the new cloud
   tuning.)

   6/22/2000: All analyses from August 1998 to March 2000 are being
   redone. The sea-surface temperature data set was not converted from
   Celcius to Kelvin.

   1/1/2000: The analyses for 1996 are being redone. An analysis of the
   observation counts found that all the observational data were not being
   incorporated into the analyses. Please discard all 1996 analyses
   obtained prior to 1/7/2000. (Between 1/1/00 and 1/6/2000, the cron jobs
   were downloading the old analyses.)

   Reanalysis-2 will will be run in real-time starting in 2001. When that
   happens, it will cover Jan 1979-present.

   Version C: The cloud temperatures should have been set to undefined in
   cloud free regions. Unfortunately the cloud temperatures were set to
   zero. When the monthly means were computed, the zero were used making
   the cloud tempertures too low. A similar problem also affects the cloud
   top pressure, cloud base pressure, The only on-line cloud field that is
   unaffected by this problem is the cloud fraction (TCDC).

   (7/99) The flux files have a problem with two bad entries in the GDS
   section of the GRIB message. Most programs do not use these entries but
   copygb does. We have a program to rewrite the entries if anyone wants
   it. BTW we plan to fix the GDS.

   (7/99) The monthly averages for 199205 were affected by a computer
   problem. The files have been updated.

   The cloud temperature can be calculated from the 4x daily file by
   ex. ave(maskout(TMPhct,TMPhct-1),time=00z1jan1982,time=18z31jan1982)

   The precipitation adjustments are stored the fields "BGRUN". If the
   adjustment adds water, BGRUN is positive.
