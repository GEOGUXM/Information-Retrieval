                  Functions and Features of Interagency Edison
       _______________________________________________________________

     When you log into the Interagency System, you will be able to:
     * Enter a new Invention Disclosure
     * Confirm your input
     * Modify an existing disclosure or its related patent and licensing
       information
     * Query the database to prepare various reports of your existing
       data.
     * Utilize the Tickler System

     You will be entering information via 3 data entry forms. Whether you
     are entering a new invention disclosure or modifying an existing
     invention disclosure or its related patent and/or licensing and
     utilization data, you will want to complete the new invention
     disclosure form first. The invention disclosure form must always be
     created first since it is information on this form that formally
     establishes a the relational link in the database for this invention
     and for all patents and licensing that follow from the invention.
       _______________________________________________________________

Entry of a New Invention Disclosure

     You will find that within the invention disclosure form some of the
     fieldsmust be completed, while others are optional. This distinction
     is based on the fact that the database requires certain minimal
     information to establish and maintain the relational aspects of
     Interagency Edison/Edison. Should confusion arise at any time during
     data input, you have the option of accessing help screens for every
     data field by clicking on the "?".

     Once you have completed the invention disclosure form you can scroll
     to any previous point on the form to review data. When you are
     satisfied with your data, you can submit the data by scrolling to
     the bottom of the form and clicking on the "Submit New Invention
     Disclosure" button.

     From the invention disclosure form you can navigate to the Patent
     form or the Licensing and Utilization form to add information. Each
     of these forms will allow for data input similar to that of the
     invention disclosure form.

Input Confirmation Screen

     Immediately after you click the "Submit Form" bar, the information
     will be sent via the Internet to the Sybase server at NIH. At that
     point, the data is put through more than 40 vigorous tests to insure
     its accuracy and validity. If there are any problems with the data
     you will be presented with a list of the problems and will get
     achance to rectify them. When there are no further problems with the
     data, you will get a verification screen suitable for printing (if
     your browser offers that option). If all of the data is correct,
     click on the "All Data is Correct" button to submit the data to
     Sybase. The information will be put into the database with no
     further prompting. Upon either establishment of a file within the
     database for that invention disclosure, or updating of existing
     information, you will receive an immediate confirmation that the
     data has been recorded. In the case of adding a new disclosure to
     the database, it is not until the data has been successfully
     submitted that a new invention disclosure number will be assigned to
     that invention. You may, at that time, prior to terminating the
     on-line session, want to make note of the NIH invention disclosure
     number that has been assigned to that invention. The information may
     prove useful when you go on-line to make modifications to that
     disclosure, add patents or utilization information.

Modify an existing invention disclosure or its related patent and licensing
information

     Modification of an existing invention disclosure or its related
     patent and licensing information first involves locating the
     invention disclosure of choice by searching the database. To carry
     out such a search, you will need a unique identifier for that
     particular invention disclosure. A similar search is necessary to
     modify patent or utilization information, since either of these
     types of information is always inextricably associated with the
     information disclosure from which the patent and licensing arise.

     Interagency Edison/Edison is designed such that you can use any of 9
     different identifiers to find the invention disclosure you are
     seeking. That is, when you enter the "MODIFY EXISTING INVENTION
     DISCLOSURE", "MODIFY EXISTING PATENT", or "MODIFY UTILIZATION
     INFORMATION", in every case you will be asked for one or more of the
     following:

    1. the NIH Invention Disclosure Number
    2. the docket # unique to your grantee organization
    3. a patent application serial number of a patent derived from that
       invention disclosure
    4. an issued patent number of a patent derived from that invention
       disclosure
    5. the disclosure date associated with the invention disclosure
    6. the title of the invention disclosure
    7. the name of one of the inventors listed on the invention disclosure
    8. a keyword you have given the invention disclosure
    9. the status of the title to the invention associated with the
       invention disclosure, (i.e. elected by the institution, waived,
       under evaluation, returned to the inventors(s), or transferred to
       different institution).

   Using this information, Interagency Edison/Edison will provide you with
   the disclosure number of interest, or, in cases where several invention
   disclosures fit the data you have provided (e.g. when two or more
   disclosures have the same disclosure date), Interagency Edison/Edison
   will list all applicable invention disclosures.

   Once you have arrived at the invention disclosure of interest, you will
   beable to scroll to any point on the form to make modifications. In the
   case of modifying patent and/or utilization information, once you have
   confirmed that you are viewing the correct invention disclosure, you
   can navigate to the area of interest on either the patent or licensing
   and utilization forms. Having made changes on any of the forms, you
   will then scroll to the bottom of the form to submit the updated
   information using the "Submit Form" bar.

Query the database to prepare various reports of your existing data

   As is sometimes the case even at Disney World, this feature of
   Interagency Edison/Edison is still under construction. We hope to have
   this feature complete within the next several months. For those of you
   old enoughto remember when there was only a Disneyland, suffice it to
   say that it is planned to be an "E" ticket.

Tickler System

   The Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration freely
   acknowledges that it is difficult to keep track of all the time
   sensitive eventsa ssociated with each invention disclosure and related
   patent(s). Accordingly, Interagency Edison/Edison has been designed to
   include a tickler system that will remind you of reporting requirements
   and decisions that you must make in a timely manner. Internal clocks
   associated with the Interagency Edison/Edison are begun upon submission
   of the new disclosure. At any time subsequent, when you begin an
   on-line session, you will be reminded automatically as to the status of
   time sensitive events and obligations upon which you should place high
   priority.

   For example, you may be reminded that you have only X days left to
   elect title, based on the date of disclosure of the invention related
   to a particular invention disclosure. Such reminders will be
   encountered at the beginning of each session, and will remain in the
   tickler system until you have acted upon them. In the case of an
   election of title, for example, the reminder will be removed once NIH
   has received the hard copy of the election or waiver. Alternatively,
   you will have the option of terminating the reminder by acknowledging
   that it has been read and understood.
