   WBS

     This WBS has been developed jointly with International ATLAS. U.S.
     and International ATLAS WBS's are derived from the same source. They
     are predominantly the same but different in some areas;
     'projections' out of the common sources for U.S. and International
     ATLAS take account of these differences. The WBS here is the U.S.
     version. The International ATLAS projection can be found on the
     ATLAS planning page.

     Schedule and personnel associated with WBS items are cross-linked on
     the WBS pages (and vice versa). WBS entries also indicate U.S.
     activity; U.S. ATLAS manager; U.S. contact person. WBS subsections
     from a given item down can be viewed by clicking on a WBS number.
     Cross-reference links to the ATLAS WBS are given.

   Computing Schedule

     The schedule shown here encompasses the complete ATLAS computing
     schedule, supplemented by the U.S.-specific schedule items. The U.S.
     program follows the International ATLAS schedule for the most part.
     U.S.-specific schedule items are primarily related to facilities and
     US-based grid projects.

     Each schedule item is associated with a WBS item as indicated.
     Schedule items can have their own ID eg. to link items with an
     'after' criterion (supported but not much used as yet). Schedule
     items which are expired and completed are shown in green. Items
     which are expired but not marked as completed are shown in red.
     Milestones are indicated; they have only one associated date. Major
     milestones are indicated in bold.

     Schedules are ordered by start date unless otherwise specified.

   Personnel

  U.S. ATLAS Personnel

     * U.S. personnel breakdown by WBS activity and year
       All U.S. activity -- project funded professionals, base program
       funded professionals, and physicists -- are shown by year. Funding
       level by year and source are shown for professionals. Activities by
       WBS area are shown (to varying levels of detail). Activities of
       professionals are resource loaded by FTE fraction at level 4 (three
       levels down in the WBS identifier; the top 'physics and computing'
       level is suppressed). Incorporation of physicist activity is not
       complete.
     * Software Project Personnel by Year
       Only project funded people are shown. Total FTEs for principal
       project activities are shown by year.

  Required Effort Estimates

     Provided here are estimates of the total ATLAS effort required by
     fiscal year in the Architecture, Framework and Database WBS
     subprojects (ie. those with major U.S. activity). Estimates are
     broken down to WBS level 5.

   XProject: Software Project Planning Software and Sources

     The project planning materials shown here are based on source
     materials and software developed in the U.S. (the 'XProject'
     package) and since adopted by International ATLAS. Sources for the
     WBS, schedule and personnel information are text files, processed
     using a combination of Perl, XML and Java to yield the static and
     servlet-based web materials presented here. Also generated are input
     sources (CSV files) for Microsoft Access and Microsoft Project which
     are used in official project management by the U.S. ATLAS Project
     Office.

     Planning sources and software are maintained in the ATLAS CVS
     repository; check out 'offline/Planning' and see the README files.
     Materials can also be browsed using the CVS browser.

     Principal data and software files:
     * XProject README
     * WBS source
     * Schedule source
     * XProject software

     Generated Microsoft inputs:
     * WBS CSV file for MS Access
     * Manpower CSV file for MS Access
     * WBS+schedule CSV file for MS Project
       To load into MS Project 2000, use Open, set the file type to csv
       (comma delimited), and select "Task export table map" as the
       import/export map to use. Ignore the "start of task... is before
       the project starts" error. Here is an outdated MS Project file
       (from 10/3/2000) generated this way
