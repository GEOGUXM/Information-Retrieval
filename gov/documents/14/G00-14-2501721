                 from its aeronautics and space research..."

                               Project Mercury
    Initiated in 1958, completed in 1963, Project Mercury was the United
                     States' first man-in-space program.

                               Project Gemini
     The second U.S. manned space program was announced in January 1962.
   Gemini involved 12 flights, including two unmanned flight tests of the
                                 equipment.

                                Apollo-Soyuz
     The mission started with the Russian Soyuz launch on July 15, 1975,
   followed by the U.S. Apollo launch on the same day. Docking in space of
   the two craft occurred on July 17, and joint operations were conducted
      for two full days. Both spacecraft landed safely and on schedule.

                               Project Apollo
     "I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,
    before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning
     him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be
       more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range
     exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to
                                accomplish."

                              - John F. Kennedy
                       Special Joint Session of Congress
                                 May 25, 1961
                                   Skylab
     Designed for long duration missions, Skylab program objectives were
   twofold: To prove that humans could live and work in space for extended
     periods, and to expand our knowledge of solar astronomy well beyond
                          Earth-based observations.

                                 Shuttle-Mir
   Phase 1 was a NASA program encompassing 11 space shuttle flights over a
     four-year period. It used existing assets - primarily U.S. shuttle
      orbiters and the Russian Space Station Mir - to build joint space
               experience and start joint scientific research.

                                Space Shuttle
   The Space Shuttle is a viable part of American History. Standing as one
    of NASA's foremost projects, the shuttle has accomplished many tasks
   that have enhanced the quality of life on Earth. View archives of every
