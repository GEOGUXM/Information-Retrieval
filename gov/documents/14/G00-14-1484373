        Rep Barton: Power-Relief Bill Will Halve California Blackouts

                             Dow Jones Newswire

   WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The House Energy and Commerce Committee will
   vote next week on a bill to provide electricity relief this summer for
   power-starved California and neighboring Western states, Rep. Billy
   Tauzin, R-La., the panel's chairman, said Thursday.

   Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, the bill's author, said the
   measure "would cut the number of blackouts in half this summer (at a)
   minimum."

   The bill will add 1,500 megawatts of power to the grid this summer
   during peak demand, while cutting demand between 1,000 megawatts to
   1,500 megawatts, he said.

   Barton's bill, coupled with legislation implementing the Bush
   administration's energy policy blueprint, represents an "excellent
   response (to) California's needs," said Rep.
   Christopher Cox, R-Calif.

   The House Republicans spoke at a press conference in response to the
   national energy policy plan released by the White House Thursday.
