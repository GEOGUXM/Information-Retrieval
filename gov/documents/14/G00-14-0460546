                       NASA Website Privacy Statement

    This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
                         utmost importance to NASA.

                         If you visit a NASA site...

     * To read or download information: We may collect and store
       information for statistical purposes. For example, we may count the
       number of visitors to the different sections of our site to help us
       make them more useful to visitors. Similar information is gathered
       for anonymous ftp, remote account login, or for other comparable
       types of connections.
     * To send us an E-mail: By sending us an electronic mail message, you
       may be sending us personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail
       address), as in an official Freedom of Information Act request. We
       may store the name and address of the requester in order to respond
       to the request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your
       E-mail.
     * To register: Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific
       information to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors
       looking for marketing opportunities by visiting our Electronic
       Grants or NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites may be asked to
       "register" to obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or other NASA
       opportunities. Other information which may be collected at these
       sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means,
       enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of
       providing better service to our customers.

        We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
    transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
                            with applicable law.
