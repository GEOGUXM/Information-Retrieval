   The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is one of more than 560
     regional planning agencies across the nation working to help solve
   problems in areas such as land use, housing, environmental quality, and
                            economic development.

      ABAG is owned and operated by the cities and counties of the San
       Francisco Bay Area. It was established in 1961 to protect local
      control, plan for the future, and promote cooperation on areawide
   issues. In recent years, ABAG has answered the needs of its members by
       providing low-cost services that save the taxpayers millions of
                                  dollars.

   The General Assembly is the overall governing body of the organization.
       Each member city and county designates a representative. ABAG's
    operations are directed by an Executive Board composed of 38 elected
      officials from member cities and counties. Much of ABAG's work is
    carried on by committees appointed by the Executive Board, including
    joint committees with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and
    the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Advisory committees and
   task forces are appointed from time to time to oversee special programs
      in areas such as air quality, water quality, energy, and economic
              development. All meetings are open to the public.

                              Regional Planning

   In ABAG's region there are 100 cities and the nine counties of Alameda,
      Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara,
      Solano, and Sonoma. More than 6 million people live in this 7,000
                              square mile area.

     Where will they live, where will they work, will transportation be
      adequate? How can we control air and water pollution, will water
    supplies be sufficient? Are we prepared for a major natural disaster?
      These are the kinds of questions that cannot be addressed easily
   without cooperative action among many agencies, organizations, and the
   general public. One of ABAG's vital functions is to provide a forum to
     resolve local differences through workable compromises. Its active
    public information program encourages citizen involvement in planning
                            and policy decisions.

     Through its role as an association of cities and counties, ABAG has
    been designated by the state and federal governments as the official
     comprehensive planning agency for the Bay Area. Its locally adopted
       Regional Plan provides a policy guide for planning the region's
    housing, economic development, environmental quality, transportation,
                     recreation, and health and safety.

     The association also sponsors workshops and conferences where local
   officials, business and industry leaders, special interest groups, and
     private citizens can discuss programs, regulations, and legislation
                        affecting their communities.

                                ABAG Services

     As city and county budgets are tightened in the slipknot of rising
    costs and diminishing income, ABAG stretches its services to ease the
      effect. ABAG offers cost-saving services to its members including
   demographic information and data analysis, capital financing, liability
        and property insurance, workers' compensation administration,
      conference services, and specialized training programs including
       introductory and advanced HTML and web graphics to assist local
   government agencies in designing and maintaining their online presence.
