   The image above shows a vertical section (through the atmosphere) of
   the radar reflectivities measured by the SIR-C radar aboard the space
   shuttle Endeavour during a pass over Tropical Cyclone Odille off
   Madagascar in the Indian Ocean on April 11, 1994, around 12:42 GMT.
   This was the first detection of rain from space using radar, a
   remarkable milestone in environmental remote sensing.
   In order to make measurements such as those in the image above, we had
   to monitor the weather around the clock and around the globe during the
   two SIR-C flights, in April 1994 and October 1994. The capability to
   overlay real-time weather data (obtained thanks to the University of
   Hawaii and the University of Reading) with the projected Shuttle tracks
   was crucial in allowing us to predict and request 48-hours ahead of
   time a specific "data take":

   Megabytes) with Endeavour track overlaid
   As you can see, the pass over Odille could easily have turned into a
   near-miss. We had better luck during the second Shuttle flight. On two
   different occasions over the Western Pacific (orbits number 54 and
   103),
     * our data take requests coincided with the passage of Endeavour over
       and across Typhoon Seth,
     * our request to have the Shuttle roll so the radar antenna beams
       were perpendicular to the Earth was granted,
     * and the data takes were executed with the correct radar operating
       parameters!

   The resulting images are spectacular. First, it is important to mention
   that precipitating systems fall into two general categories, namely
     * "convective systems" extending vertically over a significant
       fraction of the troposphere, and
     * "stratiform systems" with negligible vertical air motion, in which
       the precipitation is largely confined to the lower troposphere.

   The former are associated with more intense precipitation, and,
   consequently, greater backscattered signals over several kilometers,
   while the latter are usually characterized by weak signals with the
   strongest backscatter occurring near the melting level.

   The 3 panels above show vertical sections (through the atmosphere) of
   the radar reflectivities measured over a convective cell during the
   beginning of data take 103.0, at C-, X- and L-bands (VV polarization).
   The X-band signal shows some residual contamination by the echo from
   the surface. The blue horizontal tick marks are 3 km apart.

   These 3 panels show vertical sections of the radar reflectivities
   measured over another convective cell towards the end of data take
   103.0, at C-band (VV and VH polarizations), and L-band (VV
   polarization). The cross-polarized returns are due to "frozen
   hydrometeors", located mostly near the freezing altitude but showing
   some spread around it due to the convection in the cell.

   The 4 panels above show vertical sections of the radar reflectivities
   measured over a stratiform system during data take 54.0, at C-band (VV
   and VH polarizations), and X- and L-bands (VV polarization). The
   "bright band" at the freezing level is quite visible, particularly on
   the cross-polarized return.
