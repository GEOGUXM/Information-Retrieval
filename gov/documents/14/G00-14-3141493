   OLYMPIA -- The state Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS)
   has received a three-year grant to help up to 300 younger people with
   disabilities move from nursing facilities into living arrangements in
   local communities.

   The $770,000 grant, which will go to the DSHS Aging and Adult Services
   Administration, is from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services'
   Supported Transitions Project.

   "Multiple barriers can make it difficult for someone with disabilities
   to move from a nursing facility into a community setting," said Kathy
   Leitch, assistant secretary for the DSHS Aging and Adult Services
   Administration. "The person may not have the necessary durable medical
   equipment, such as a wheelchair that can withstand the wear and tear of
   using public transportation. The person may need ramps in place of
   stairs, lifts to use with vehicles, or communication devices. It's also
   very, very difficult to locate low-cost and accessible housing."

   With this grant, DSHS will remove barriers by helping clients pay for
   wheelchairs and home modification projects. The department also will
   train clients in independent living skills, help them learn how to
   shop, to budget and to hire and supervise personal care workers.

   DSHS also will work with housing authorities across Washington to meet
   the critical need for low-cost housing for people with disabilities.
   Three housing authorities, in Seattle, King County, and Thurston
   County, will make 50 U.S. (HUD) housing subsidies available to people
   with disabilities who currently reside in a Department of Housing and
   Urban Development nursing facility but who desire to live independently
   in the community.

   These strategies will empower people who have disabilities to become
   more autonomous in their decision-making and give them the opportunity
   to live more independently in the community, according to Leitch.
