   Principle of Heating

   As a heat source of the double elliptic image furnace, a halogen lamp
   is installed on the focus of each elliptic reflecting mirror. The
   infrared rays radiated from the lamps converge on another focus by the
   elliptic reflecting mirrors, heating material rod and the seed crystal
   set on the focus to material's melting temperature.

   Principle of Crystal Growth

   A material rod and a seed crystal are set where the infrared rays
   radiated from the heat source lamps converge, and the lamp power is
   gradually increased to heat to melt where the light converges on the
   material rod and the seed crystal rod. Then, the shaft translation
   mechanism is driven to connect both rods to form a floating zone. The
   floating zone is lowered to create a temperature gradient to grow a
   crystal. To make the temperature distribution on the crystal horizontal
   surface more uniform, the upper shaft and the lower shaft are
   continuously rotated.
