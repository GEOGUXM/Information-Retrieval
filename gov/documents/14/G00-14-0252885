   [w08.gif] Who we are...........
   The Airway Facilities Division of FAA is charged with supporting and
   maintaining the National Airspace System by serving the flying public.
   This is done by installing and maintaining navigational aids such as
   ILS’s, VOR’s, NDB’s, and DME’s. The Airway Facilities Division also
   installs and maintains equipment used at the Anchorage Air Route
   Traffic Control Center, in air traffic control towers and at flight
   service stations. The Airway Facilities work force is comprised of
   engineers who design the systems and electronic technicians who install
   and maintain the systems.

   In the Alaskan Region, our workforce is streamlined to approximately
   400 positions.  They support all Alaskan Region equipment, from Barrow
   to Annette Island, and across the Aleutian Chain to Shemya - 586,412
   sq. miles.  Our folks are on the job 24/7, securing the system for our
   customers on local, national and international flights.  The service
   our workforce provide to our customers and the skills required to
   maintain them are unique within the State of Alaska.  For example, our
   Alaskan NAS Interfacility Communications System (ANICS) was the first
   satellite communications system developed and deployed in the Agency’s
   history.
   We are a customer-driven organization. Organizations depend upon their
   customers. We actively seek out customer input. We engage in activities
   that ensure we understand current and future customer needs, meet
   customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.
   Continual improvement is a permanent objective of our organization.

   Our leaders establish unity of purpose, direction and the internal
   environment of the organization. Our managers and supervisors fully
   involve employees in achieving the organization’s objectives. Employees
   are the essence of our organization and their full involvement enables
   their knowledge and experiences to be used for the organization’s
   benefit. We are working in partnership with the Professional Airway
   Systems Specialists (PASS) employee union, and the National Air Traffic
   Controller's Association (NATCA).

   The Airways Facilities Division of the Alaskan Region consists of two
   System Maintenance Offices (SMOs) to maintain and modify services to
   one of the busiest international hubs in the world. Support personnel
   are centrally located in the Regional Office.

   Our South Alaska SMO is co-located with Air Traffic personnel at the
   Air Route Traffic Control Center in Anchorage. Our North Alaska SMO is
   located in Fairbanks, approximately 375 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   System Service Centers (SSCs) attached to each SMO are located at key
   positions throughout the state. The Regional Office is physically
   located in the Federal Office Building at the corner of 7th and "C"
   Street, Anchorage.

   The two SMOs have a lot of area to cover, and usually under extreme
   weather conditions. Temperatures have ranged from 100 degrees
   Fahrenheit at Fort Yukon, to minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit at Prospect
   Creek Camp. With wind chill factors, the cold temperatures are life
   threatening to our employees. The heaviest snowfall recorded was 974.5
   inches at Thompson Pass near Valdez.

   Air commerce in Alaska carries the equivalent of four times the state's
   population each year, compared to about 1.7 times the U.S. population
   carried by air commerce in the other states.  Alaska has about six
   times as many pilots per capita and 14 times as many aircraft per
   capita as the rest of the world.  In Anchorage alone, there are over
   4,000 registered aircraft.

   Alaska has 325 public use land-based airports and approximately 1,100
   recorded landing areas.  Of course, Alaskan pilots land on many of the
   thousands of lakes and gravel bars across the state where no
   constructed facility exists.  Our navigational aids make it happen.
   Also, Alaska has the most seaplane bases in the country - 105.  Lake
   Hood in Anchorage is the largest and busiest seaplane base in the
   world.  On a yearly basis, an average of 300 takeoffs and landing occur
   daily, and more than 1,000 on a peak summer day.
