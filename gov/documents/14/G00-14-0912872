               Transferring Securities Into, Out Of, or Within
                               TreasuryDirect

   TreasuryDirect is flexible.

   Though designed for investors who wish to own their Treasury bills,
   notes, or bonds from issue to maturity, TreasuryDirect makes
   transferring securities easy.

   You can transfer marketable Treasury securities . . .
     * between existing TreasuryDirect accounts,
     * out of TreasuryDirect and into the commercial book-entry system,
       where your broker or dealer holds them for you, or
     * into TreasuryDirect from the commercial book-entry system.

   If you're interested in selling Treasury securities before they mature,
   you have two options:
     * Transfer them to the commercial book-entry system
     * Take advantage of Sell DirectÂ®

   Here's what you do:
     * To transfer your securities between existing TreasuryDirect
       accounts, or to the commercial book-entry system, simply fill out
       and mail to your TreasuryDirect office a properly certified
       Security Transfer Request (PD F 5179).
     * To transfer marketable Treasury securities from the commercial
       book-entry system to an existing TreasuryDirect account, ask your
       financial institution or government securities broker or dealer to
       transfer them. If you don't have a TreasuryDirect account, you'll
       need to open one before transferring securities. Open an account by
       completing and submitting to your TreasuryDirect office either of
       two forms: New Account Request (PD F 5182) or, if you're buying a
       security, Treasury Bill, Note & Bond Tender (PD F 5381).
     * To take advantage of TreasuryDirect's Sell Direct service, fill out
       a properly certified Sell Direct Request (PD F 5179-1) and mail it
       to:
              Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
              Investment Division for Sell Direct
              230 S. LaSalle St.
              Chicago, IL 60604
       For each security it sells in the secondary market, FRB Chicago
       will charge you only $34. Plus, you'll get the highest of multiple
       bids.
