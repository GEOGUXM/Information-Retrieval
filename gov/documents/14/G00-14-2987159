   FAQ on Asteroid and Comet Impacts
   A number of media events (a TV miniseries, several TV documentaries, a
   feature article in New Yorker, and many newspaper stories) in early
   1997 have focused public interest on the hazard of asteroid and comet
   impacts. This short primer on the impact hazard provides answers to
   many of the questions raised by these films and stories.
   The Earth orbits the Sun in a sort of cosmic shooting gallery, subject
   to impacts from comets and asteroids. It is only fairly recently that
   we have come to appreciate that these impacts by asteroids and comets
   (often called Near Earth Objects, or NEOs) pose a significant hazard to
   life and property. Although the annual probability of the Earth being
   struck by a large asteroid or comet is extremely small, the
   consequences of such a collision are so catastrophic that it is prudent
   to assess the nature of the threat and prepare to deal with it.
   Studies have shown that the risk from cosmic impacts increases with the
   size of the projectile. The greatest risk is associated with objects
   large enough to perturb the Earth's climate on a global scale by
   injecting large quantities of dust into the stratosphere. Such an event
   could depress temperatures around the globe, leading to massive loss of
   food crops and possible breakdown of society. Such global catastrophes
   are qualitatively different from other more common hazards that we face
   (excepting nuclear war), because of their potential effect on the
   entire planet and its population. Various studies have suggested that
   the minimum mass impacting body to produce such global consequences is
   several tens of billions of tons, resulting in a groundburst explosion
   with energy in the vicinity of a million megatons of TNT. The
   corresponding threshold diameter for Earth-crossing asteroids or comets
   is between 1 and 2 km (approximately 1 mile). Smaller objects (down to
   tens of meters diameter, or the size of a large house) can cause severe
   local damage but pose no global threat. One historic example of such a
   "small" impact was the explosion of an asteroid which took place in the
   Tunguska wilderness of Siberia in June 1908.
   At the request of the U.S. Congress, NASA has sponsored two studies of
   ways to discover Earth-crossing asteroids or comets before they pose
   any direct threat to the planet. The first study, chaired by David
   Morrison of Ames Research Center and completed in 1992, developed the
   idea of an international Spaceguard Survey of specially-designed
   ground-based telescopes to detect and catalogue all asteroids larger
   than 1 km in diameter within the next 25 years. The follow-up study,
   chaired by Eugene Shoemaker of Lowell Observatory and completed in
   1995, concluded that advances in astronomical imaging systems could
   allow the Spaceguard Survey to be completed in just 10 years at a total
   cost of less than $50 million. Of approximately 2000 Earth-crossing
   asteroids inferred to exist, fewer than 200 have so far been
   discovered.
   The proposed Spaceguard Survey would assess the population and identify
   any large objects that could impact the Earth through a systematic
   search that effectively monitors a large volume of space around our
   planet and detects these objects as their orbits repeatedly carry them
   through this volume of space. In addition, the survey would deal with
   the long-period comets, which are thought to constitute about 10
   percent of the flux of Earth impacts. Long-period comets do not
   regularly enter near-Earth space; however, nearly all Earth-impacting
   long-period comets could be detected with advance warning on the order
   of a year before impact with the same telescopes used for the asteroid
   survey.
   Although the Spaceguard Survey has not been funded in the United States
   or elsewhere, NASA currently supports asteroid and comet search
   programs at a level of about $1 million per year. These funds support
   the development of new detectors and computer software for automated
   sky searches. Currently this support goes primarily to three groups of
   astronomers. Tom Gehrels of the University of Arizona carries out the
   Spacewatch survey from Kitt Peak, Arizona. Eugene Shoemaker and Ted
   Bowell are completing a new search camera for the Lowell Observatory
   Near Earth Object Survey (LONEOS) at Flagstaff, Arizona. And Eleanor
   Helin and her colleagues from the NASA/Caltech Jet Propulsion Lab carry
   out a Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program in collaboration with
   the U.S. Air Force and Livermore National Laboratory, with instruments
   on Haleakala in Maui, Hawaii. All of these programs use modern
   electronic detectors and automated detection algorithms to identify
   moving NEOs against the background star fields.
   At present no asteroid or comet is known to be on a collision course
   with the Earth. The chances of a collision within the next century with
   an object 1 km or more in diameter are very small (roughly 1 in ten
   thousand), but such a collision is possible and could happen at any
   time. If we did have sufficient warning, however, the incoming object
   could be deflected or destroyed.
   Cosmic impacts are the only known natural disaster that could be
   avoided entirely by the appropriate application of space technology.
   Possible defenses against a threatening asteroid or comet have been
   discussed at six international meetings of astronomers and defense
   experts held over the past few years at the UN in New York, at Los
   Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories in New Mexico and
   California, at Erice Italy, and at Snezhinsk (Chelyabinsk-70), Russia.
   In order to plan an effective defense, it is necessary to have long
   warning (as would be provided by the Spaceguard Survey) and to learn
   more about the properties of Earth-approaching objects. To learn more
   about the asteroids, the NASA Galileo spacecraft flew past the
   main-belt asteroids Gaspra and Ida en route to its 1995 rendezvous with
   Jupiter, and in February 1996 we launched a dedicated asteroid mission
   called NEAR (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous) to go into orbit around
   the asteroid Eros for an extensive year-long investigation. Imaging of
   near-Earth asteroids is also possible using powerful planetary radars
   supported by NASA at Goldstone, California, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
   Close up studies of asteroids have also been among the objectives of
   the Department of Defense Clementine 1 and Clementine 2 deep-space
   missions.
