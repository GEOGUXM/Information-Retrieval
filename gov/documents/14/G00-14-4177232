                         Donor Consultative Group Meeting

       The Consultative Group (CG) process involves the periodic calling of
       donor conferences to address development issues around the world. The
      major donor countries -- including the U.S., countries of the European
           Union, Japan, Canada and others, as well as the multilateral
       development banks and the International Monetary Fund -- periodically
       meet to receive country presentations and make pledges of assistance.
       The Inter-American Development Bank functions as the secretariat for
      the CG process for Central America, while the World Bank manages the CG
      process for South America and the Caribbean. The May 1999 CG meeting in
          Stockholm was the first major gathering to focus on the Central
           American region as a whole rather than on a specific country.

                                   Madrid, Spain

                                January 18-19, 2001

        The CG meeting scheduled to meet in Madrid was postponed due to the
                       January 13 earthquake in El Salvador.

                                  Washington, DC

                                  May 23-24, 2000

        The Consultative Group for the Reconstruction and Transformation of
       Nicaragua met May 23-24, 2000, in Washington, at the headquarters of
          the Inter-American Development Bank to review progress to date
        implementing principles of the Stockholm Declaration. Donors urged
         Nicaragua to maintain macroeconomic stability, step up the fight
      against poverty, improve transparency with special emphasis on fighting
        corruption, strengthen democratic governance and promote electoral
      participation. The IDB press release provides a detailed summary of the
                                   proceedings.

      The U.S. Statement outlined U.S. views and endorsed the G-5's Report of
                               the Follow-up Group.

   A regional Consultative Group meeting on all of Central America is
   planned for Madrid for January 18-19, 2001. It will focus on promotion
   of regional sustainable development issues. Consultative Group meetings
   for Honduras and Guatemala are tentatively planned to take place in the
                               spring of 2001.

    In February, 2000, USAID issued a Special Report, Hurricanes Mitch &
    Georges: From Relief to Reconstruction, the United States' Response.

                            Tegucigalpa, Honduras

                             February 7-9, 2000

       The purpose of the meeting was to review progress to date, with
   particular attention to implementation of the Stockholm Declaration and
   to review the status of donor commitments.The U.S. Delegation Statement
      outlines U.S. views and provides an update on the status of U.S.
                   reconstruction activities in Honduras.

    While in Honduras, on February 9, 2000, donors received an update on
      the status of the reconstruction activities in Costa Rica and El
                                  Salvador.

                              Stockholm, Sweden

                               May 25-28, 1999

    In May 1999, the U.S. government joined over 50 other donor nations,
       international organizations, and financial institutions at the
      Consultative Group meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. The countries of
     Central America formally presented their reconstruction plans, and
     donor countries and institutions made pledges of support. The U.S.
       delegation worked with other donors and the host governments to
        establish a set of guiding principles known as the Stockholm
                                Declaration.

   Key aspects of the Declaration had already been established in USAID's
                       own approach to reconstruction:
    1. Construction work should follow sensible land use practices;
       environmental and disaster risk will determine what is built, where
       and how.
    2. Activities should address the equity issues of the poorest, elderly
       and indigenous who suffered the most from the hurricane.
    3. Implementation relies upon the cooperative forces and dynamism of
       local government and civil society wherever possible.
    4. All reconstruction partners will commit to transparency and
       accountability in the use of funds.

                            Stockholm Declaration

     * Reduce the social and ecological vulnerability of the region, as
       the overriding goal.
     * Reconstruct and transform Central America on the basis of an
       integrated approach of transparency and good governance.
     * Consolidate democracy and good governance, reinforcing the process
       of decentralization of governmental functions and powers, with the
       active participation of civil society.
     * Promote respect for human rights as a permanent objective. The
       promotion of equality between women and men, the rights of
       children, of ethnic groups and other minorities should be given
       special attention.
     * Coordinate donor efforts, guided by priorities set by the recipient
       countries.
     * Intensify efforts to reduce the external debt burden of the
       countries of the region.
