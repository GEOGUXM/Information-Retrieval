   Only NCI-Frederick personnel may check out books and other circulating
   materials.  All new books are displayed on the new book shelf for 2
   weeks before they circulate.  Circulation times for library materials:

                            Journals, reference books and microforms do
   not circulate

   Books may be renewed ONCE by phone or in person, unless another patron
   has placed a hold on the item.  Thereafter, items must be returned to
   the shelves before being checked out again.  Microform and microfiche
