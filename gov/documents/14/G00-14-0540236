   Whether you're saving for your kids' education, a new boat, your dream
    home, retirement, or something else, savings bonds can help you reach
   your financial goals. Use our growth calculator to see how quickly your
   savings can add up to your dreams! You know how much money you'll need,
     but you're not sure what you need to do to reach that goal. Use our
    savings planner to find out how setting up a regular savings plan can
    help you reach your financial target! When you only look at the rate
    your savings bonds are earning, they may not seem like a competitive
   investment. But take a closer look-- when you factor in tax advantages,
       your bonds are really earning more than you think. Use our tax
                advantages calculator to see the difference!
