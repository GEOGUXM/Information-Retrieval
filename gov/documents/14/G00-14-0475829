      OVERVIEW

      DPM DOES NOT AWARD GRANTS. DPM does provide a mechanism for awarding
      agencies to deliver funding to grantees.

      There are currently two methods recipients can use to request funds.


   Request Methods
    SMARTLINK - Request funds via a Personal Computer with an Internet or
   Dial-Up Networking Connection.
    CASHLINE - Request funds via a Touch Tone Telephone. Menu driven.
      PLEASE NOTE: Recipients may be required to use SmartLink based on the
      type of account they have.

      Request methods are assigned on an account by account basis. Please
      contact your account representative to determine for which method your
      account qualifies. SmartLink is the preferred method.

      Both Request Methods deliver funds to the recipient via Electronic
      Funds Transfer (EFT). Federal agencies are required to use EFT to the
      "maximum extent practicable" in making grant payments.
