   DREAM-y technology advances proteomics
   While people may rely on counting sheep to fall asleep and then dream,
   scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are putting DREAMS
   before measurements with a powerful new mass spectrometry technique.
   This method, called DREAMS for Dynamic Range Enhancement Applied to
   Mass Spectrometry, analyzes more proteins in less time and with greater
   accuracy, providing a more thorough understanding of an organism.

   PNNL scientists designed DREAMS to automatically filter out signals
   from proteins that exist in large numbers from those proteins that
   appear in fewer numbers. Such low-level proteins often hold clues to
   important cellular processes, such as disease development. Globally
   studying proteins has become a major challenge and now is possible
   because of the near completion of the mapping of the human genome.

   The use of DREAMS has been shown to nearly double the information
   obtained on proteins in a single experiment. More importantly, the
   additional information largely relates to the low-level proteins
   normally missed using other methods.

   This research was conducted in the William R. Wiley Environmental
   Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a national user facility located at
   PNNL.
