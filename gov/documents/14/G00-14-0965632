   Since launch in 1993 the ACTS spacecraft was actively maintained at its
   assigned orbital station of 100° West longitude. When spacecraft
   retirement planning began in early 1999, updated fuel estimates
   indicated a very low amount of remaining hydrazine. The safest option
   to minimize orbital debris issues was to move the satellite to the
   orbital gravity well at 105.2° West longitude on the geostationary arc.
   In April 2000 as ACTS neared its planned end of mission, the routine
   East/West station keeping maneuvers that maintained this 100° position
   were discontinued. ACTS began a slow natural drift towards the gravity
   well at 105.2°. On June 18, 2000, a 5-minute burn of the West facing
   hydrazine thrusters on the spacecraft accelerated the drift rate to
   0.075 degrees per day. To move a spacecraft in orbit, the orbit height
   is either raised (moves West), or lowered (moves East) from the
   geostationary altitude.

   The activity of moving ACTS past the several active commercial
   satellites between 100° and 105° was an involved process since ACTS is
   very low on fuel. It could not be maneuvered far above its neighbors
   for the relocation. As a result, a daily conjunction analysis was done
   by NORAD/Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center (CMOC) to predict the
   minimum spacing between ACTS and the satellites it was about to pass.
   The commercial satellite operators were kept informed of ACTS current
   orbital elements and the ACTS project was advised of planned station
   keeping maneuvers by the satellites it was approaching.

   The westward drift of ACTS was stopped by a 4-minute burn on August 11,
   2000 followed by a 30 second trim burn on August 16, 2000. After
   monitoring the satellite orbital stability for nearly two months a
   final 3-second trim burn was done on October 12, 2000. Long term
   predictions for the natural gravitational effects on this parking orbit
   indicate less than 0.2° variation from 105.2°. This will assure that
   the retired ACTS satellite does not impinge on nearby active
   geostationary satellites.
