                               Executive Order
                                   by the
                       GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
                            Executive Department
                                Austin, Texas
                              January 17, 2002

                               EXECUTIVE ORDER
                                    RP 10

       Relating to the creation of the Governors Council on Science
                       and Biotechnology Development.

   WHEREAS, like the pervasiveness of semi-conductors, biotechnology is an
   increasingly broad field, touching crop science and animal health,
   patient care and biopharmaceutical development; and
   WHEREAS, fields historically thought of as information technology and
   engineering take on a new bio-identity when they are targeted for use
   in the fast growing areas of bioinformatics, genomics, and
   nanotechnology; and
   WHEREAS, intellectual property is the lifeblood of innovation,
   entrepreneurship, and economic growth; and
   WHEREAS, Texas universities are engines of intellectual property
   creation; and
   WHEREAS, technology transfer of university intellectual property has
   been found to be a critical resource to long term productivity gains as
   well as social and economic progress; and
   WHEREAS, Texas currently possesses many of the building blocks of a top
   tier biotechnology and life sciences industry, but has not yet fully
   leveraged those resources to their full potential; and
   WHEREAS, through thoughtful and deliberate action, Texas can build a
   solid foundation to become a global leader in biotechnology;

   NOW, THEREFORE, I Rick Perry, Governor of Texas, by virtue of the power
   vested in me, do hereby create and establish the Governors Council on
   Science and Biotechnology Development, hereafter referred to as the
   Council.

     The Council shall consist of members appointed by the Governor. Each
     member shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor.
     The Council shall:

   (1) Identify opportunities and means to promote cooperation and
   collaboration among universities to bring more federal research funds
   to Texas and to improve the universities and to contribute to economic
   growth; and
   (2) Propose state policies and actions that promote technology
   development and transfer in Texas including the creation of
   partnerships that support and benefit the establishment of new
   technology industries in all areas of Texas; and
   (3) Analyze and propose state policies that encourage ready
   availability and accessibility of venture capital and commercial
   lending, especially in areas of the state seeking to increase high tech
   development through the establishment of Regional Councils; and
   (4) Promote connectivity and synergy among sectors, including access to
   capital to create a statewide approach to make Texas a top biotech
   destination; and
   (5) Produce an annual report tracking the Councils progress to be
   presented to the Governor; and
   (6) Perform other duties as assigned by the Governor.

     The members of the Council shall receive neither compensation nor
     per diem, but shall receive reimbursement in an amount not to exceed
     the amount authorized by the Texas General Appropriations Act for
     reasonable and necessary travel expenses incurred in the direct
     performance of their official duties.
     The Office of the Governor may provide staff support as necessary
     for the Council.

   This executive order repeals GWB 96-6, which created the Texas Science
   and Technology Council, and shall remain in effect until modified,
   amended, rescinded, or superseded by me or by a succeeding Governor.

                  Given under my hand this the 17th day of January, 2002.
