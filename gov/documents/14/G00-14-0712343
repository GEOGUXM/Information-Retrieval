   "I am proud that the last great reform in this cause, the Americans
   With Disability Act, bears the signature of my dad. I see many in this
   audience who helped him get this important legislation through
   Congress, and I want to thank you for coming. Because of that law,
   millions of Americans can now compete for jobs once denied them; enter
   buildings once closed to them; travel on buses and trains once
   unequipped for them."

   President George W. Bush
