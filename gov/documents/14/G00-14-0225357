   Rovers and other autonomous robots will explore other planets.
   Miniaturizing our devices is essential for traveling greater distances.
   Humans can't venture far in space yet so our technology becomes our
   eyes and ears. Spacecrafts call home to Earth with sophisticated
   instruments. Testing spacecraft and instruments ahead of time is
   crucial to mission success. Discover how space technologies are used on
   Earth. See the look of the future.
