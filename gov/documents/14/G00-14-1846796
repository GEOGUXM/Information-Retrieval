                     How The SESTAT Variables Are Organized

   There are 3 ways to find the variable you want in the SESTAT System:

   Go to TOPIC page Variables are grouped by topic or subject area.
   Go to KEYWORD page Variables are grouped by keyword or phrase.
   Go to CROSSWALKS page Variables are cross-referenced by survey,
   question number and SAS name.
   Facsimiles of the survey questionnaires are also available here.
