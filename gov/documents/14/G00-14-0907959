                    SSC Related Products and Information

   The Satellite Situation Center also maintains a number of online list
   files of MAGNETOSPHERIC and HELIOSPHERIC trajectory data of wide
   interest. In addition, SPACEWARN BULLETIN, a monthly publication
   containing new spacecraft launches and descriptions, and three lists of
   collections of spacecraft of scientific or navigational interest are
   held for interested users.

   The data is broken up into the following categories:


          [red_bullet_half.gif] USSPACECOM Two-Line orbital elements for a
          number of science payload spacecraft: active.el, akebono.el,
          apex.el, de1.el, dmspf8.el, dmspf9.el, dmspf10.el, dmspf11.el,
          dmspf12.el, freja.el, goes6.el, goes7.el, goes8.el, hst.el,
          mir.el, noaa12.el, noaa14.el, sampex.el, uars.el, and others.



          [red_bullet_half.gif] Precomputed files of magnetic field
          conjunctions and auroral oval transits of eight spacecraft:
          Akebono, Apex, Dmspf10, Dmspf11, Dmspf12, Sampex, and Uars. File
          names are as Freja_MMMYY_CONJ.DEF , or Sampex_MMMYY_CONJ.DEF, or
          8SC_MMMYY_OVAL.DEF. Also included are files of solar wind times
          of IMP 8 spacecraft (IMP8.SOLWIND), GSE/GSM coordinates of Wind
          and Geotail spacecraft (WIND.GSE, GEOTAIL.GSEGSM),
          orbital,elements of high altitude s/c, and several other files.



          [red_bullet_half.gif] Computed lists of trajectories of all
          Heliospheric spacecraft. The file names begin with the
          spacecraft names. There are also files that provide times when
          two or more heliospheric s/c lineup radially with the Sun; their
          names are YY.RAL or RAL.YY, where YY is a two digit year. There
          are also three executable codes: Helicoor.exe (to provide
          coordinates of s/c at desired time intervals) Planet2.exe (to
          provide coordinates of planets), Konvert.exe (to convert
          coordinates from one system to another). See directory.



          [red_bullet_half.gif] Spacewarn Bulletin is a monthly
          publication of NSSDC/WDC-A-R&S;, as the World Warning Agency for
          Satellites, under the auspicies of COSPAR. It provides each
          month, a list of newly launched s/c, with descriptions and main
          orbital parameters. There is list of s/c with continuous beacons
          at < 150 MHz, that are of interest to ionospheric research. This
          is followed by cumulative lists of GPS s/c, and of GLONASS s/c,
          both of which enable calculation of observer's location within
          about 100 meters, on land or see. Finally, there is a list of
          s/c and rocket bodies that re-entered during the month. These
          monthly files, since January 91, are named as SPX.NNN; the
          February 95 file has NNN as 496, the number changing each month
          by one.
