Introduction

     The National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami, Florida issues 72 hr
     tropical cyclone track and intensity forecasts four times per day
     for all storms in the north Atlantic and eastern north Pacific east
     of 140 W. The track forecasts are the storm latitude and longitude
     (to the nearest tenth of a degree) and the intensity forecasts are
     the 1-minute maximum sustained surface wind (to the nearest 5 kt) at
     12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hr. The storm structure is quantified by the
     radial extent of the 34, 50 and 64 kt wind in four quadrants (NE,
     SE, SW, NW) relative to the storm center. Forecasts of these wind
     radii are issued four times per day out to 36 hr. The 50 kt wind
     radii are also forecast at 48 and 72 hr. The Central Pacific
     Hurricane Center (CPHC) in Honolulu, Hawaii issues similar forecasts
     for tropical cyclones in the north Pacific from 140 W to 180 W.

     The tropical cyclone guidance models that were available to the NHC
     and CPHC forecasters for the 1997 hurricane season are briefly
     described in this document. These models range in complexity from
     simple statistical models to three-dimensional primitive equation
     models. The statistical and two-dimensional models are maintained by
     the Tropical Prediction Center (TPC). The three-dimensional models
     are maintained by the National Centers for Environmental
     Prediction's (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC).

2. Track Models

     Table 1 lists all of the operational track guidance models used at
     NHC. All of these models except CLIPER require output from global
     forecast models. The global models are usually available about 4 h
     after synoptic time. However, the official NHC forecast is issued 3
     h after synoptic time. To overcome this problem, many of the models
     use forecast fields from the previous global model run as input, so
     the track predictions will be available in a timely manner. Models
     that use forecast fields are listed as "early" in Table 1, and those
     that wait until the global model run is completed are listed as
     "late". The late models are typically run twice per day and the
     early models are run four times per day, although plans are underway
     to run all of the models four times per day.

     As described above, the late models are not available to the
     forecasters until after the advisories are sent out. To overcome
     this problem, an interpolation technique was developed to transpose
     the previous forecast to the current storm position. The forecasts
     from the interpolated GFDL forecasts are designated by GFDI in Table
     1. This technique is applied to all the late models, but for
     simplicity, only the interpolated GFDL will be included in the
     verification. Further details on this interpolation technique are
     described by Horsfall et al (1997).

     AVN is the Aviation Run of the NCEP Medium Range Forecast (MRF)
     model. The MRF is a 28-level sigma vertical coordinate (terrain
     following) global spectral model with a triangular truncation of 126
     waves. It includes parameterizations of convective, radiative and
     boundary layer processes and has a specialized technique for
     initializing tropical cyclone circulations where synthetic wind
     observations are added to the global data assimilation system. The
     synthetic observations are constructed from the sum of a steering
     flow and a symmetric vortex. The steering flow is determined from
     the spectral truncation which produces a vertically averaged wind
     that is closest to the current motion of the storm. The symmetric
     vortex at low-levels is constructed from operational estimates of
     central pressure, radius and pressure of the outermost closed
     isobar, the radius and value of the maximum low- level winds and the
     four 34 kt wind radii described above. Synthetic winds are included
     at about 50 locations within about 200 nm of the storm center at
     each mandatory level from the surface to the maximum level of the
     storm circulation (typically 300 hPa). Empirical functions are used
     to extrapolate the low-level vortex to the upper levels. An
     automated tracking algorithm which combines six estimates of the
     storm center (minimum wind speed, maximum relative vorticity,
     minimum geopotential height at 1000 and 850 hPa) provides a track
     forecast out to 72 h. Further details on the MRF and the bogussing
     scheme are described by Surgi et al (1997) and Lord (1991).

     NOGAPS is the U.S. Navy's global spectral forecast model with 18
     sigma levels, a triangular truncation of 159 waves,
     parameterizations of physical processes and a tropical cyclone
     bogussing scheme. Generally speaking, the NOGAPS bogussing scheme is
     similar to that described for the MRF model, where synthetic
     observations that represent the storm circulation are added to the
     data assimilation system. Similar to the MRF scheme, the
     observations are created from the sum of an environmental flow and a
     symmetric vortex. The primary differences from the MRF scheme are
     that for NOGAPS, the environmental wind is determined from a T20
     spectral truncation of the model fields (rather than from a
     truncation which best matches the storm motion), and that fewer
     synthetic observations are added, but over larger radial distances
     from the storm center. In addition, the synthetic observations for
     NOGAPS are added at the mandatory levels up to 400 hPa, rather than
     up to a maximum of 300 hPa in the MRF model. Further details of the
     NOGAPS model and bogussing scheme are described by Hogan and Rosmond
     (1991) and Goerss and Jeffries (1994).

     UKMET is the global forecast model run by the UK Meteorological
     Office. Similar to NOGAPS and the MRF model, it includes extensive
     physical parameterizations and a tropical cyclone bogussing system.
     Further details on forcasting tropical cyclones with the UKMET model
     are described by Heming (1997).

     GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) is a limited area
     baroclinic model developed specifically for hurricane prediction. It
     includes 18 sigma levels and uses a horizontal finite-difference
     method with three nested grids. The two inner grids move to follow
     the storm, and the resolution of the inner domain is 1/6 degree. The
     GFDL model includes convective, radiative and boundary layer
     parameterizations and has a specialized method for initializing the
     storm circulation. The initial and boundary conditions are obtained
     from the Aviation run of the MRF model. The representation of the
     storm circulation in the global analysis is replaced with the sum of
     an environmental flow and a vortex generating by nudging the fields
     in a separate run of the model to an idealized vortex. This
     idealized vortex is based upon a few parameters of the observed
     storm, including the maximum wind, radius of maximum wind and outer
     wind radii. The environmental flow is the global analysis modified
     by a filtering technique which removes the hurricane circulation. A
     more detailed description of the GFDL model is given by Kurihara et
     al (1995).

     LBAR (Limited area sine transform BARotropic) is a two-dimensional
     track prediction model which solves the shallow-water equations
     initialized with vertically averaged (850-200 hPa) winds and heights
     from the Aviation Run of the MRF global model (Horsfall et al 1997).
     An idealized symmetric vortex and a constant vector (equal to the
     initial storm motion vector) are added to the global model analysis
     to represent the storm circulation. The boundary conditions are
     obtained from the global model forecast, and the model equations are
     solved using the spectral sine transform technique described by Chen
     et al (1997). To make LBAR timely, initial and boundary conditions
     are obtained from the 6 hr old MRF forecast. LBAR was developed as
     an operational version of the experimental VICBAR model (Aberson and
     DeMaria 1994).

     The BAM (Beta and Advection) model follows a trajectory from the
     Aviation Run of the MRF model to provide a track forecast. The
     vertically averaged horizontal wind is used for the trajectory
     calculation. To remove the global model representation of the storm
     circulation, a spatial filter is applied to the wind fields. This
     filter generates fields that are similar to what would be produced
     by a T25 spherical harmonic truncation. The trajectory also includes
     a correction term to account for the drift of the storm due to the
     beta-effect. The BAM model is run with shallow (850-700 hPa), medium
     (850-400 hPa) and deep (850-200 hPa) vertically averaged winds
     (BAMS, BAMM and BAMD, respectively). The BAM model is described by
     Marks (1992) and is based upon the theory developed by Holland
     (1983).

     NHC90/NHC91 and CLIPER are statistical track forecast models. The
     predictors for CLIPER (CLImatology and PERsistence) include the
     initial latitude and longitude of the storm, the components of the
     storm motion vector, the Julian day and the initial storm intensity
     (Neumann 1972). The CLIPER forecasts are often used to normalize the
     output from other track models, and as a benchmark for evaluating
     track forecasting skill. NHC90 is a more general statistical model
     which uses the output from CLIPER in combination with vertically
     averaged (1000-100 hPa) geopotential heights from the Aviation Run
     of the MRF model as predictors (Neumann and McAdie 1991). NHC90 was
     developed for the Atlantic and NHC91 was developed for the east
     Pacific.

3. Intensity models

     Table 2 lists the operational intensity models available at NHC. The
     GFDL model was described previously in the context of track
     prediction. The interpolation technique from the previous GFDL run
     is also applied to the intensity forecasts (GFDI).

     SHIFOR (Statistical Hurricane Intensity FORecast) is a simple
     statistical model, which uses climatological and persistence
     predictors to forecast intensity change (Jarvinen and Neumann 1979).
     Analogous to the CLIPER track model, it is often used as a benchmark
     for evaluating more general models. However, the developmental
     sample for SHIFOR excluded cases where storms made landfall, so it
     is only valid for storms over the ocean.

     Table 2. NHC Operational Intensity Guidance Models

     Model           Type           Timeliness
     SHIFOR Statistical             Early
     SHIPS  Statistical             Early
     GFDL   Limited-area baroclinic Late
     GFDI   Interpolated GFDL       Early

     SHIPS (Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme) is a
     statistical model that uses climatological, persistence and synoptic
     predictors (DeMaria and Kaplan 1997). The primary predictors include
     the difference between the maximum possible intensity (MPI) and the
     current intensity, the 850-200 hPa vertical shear of the horizontal
     wind, persistence (the previous 12 hr intensity change), the 200 hPa
     eddy flux convergence of relative angular momentum, and the 200 hPa
     zonal wind and temperature within 1000 km of the storm center. The
     MPI is estimated from an empirical relationship between sea surface
     temperature (SST) and intensity (DeMaria and Kaplan 1994). The SSTs
     are obtained from the weekly analyses described by Reynolds and
     Smith (1994). The MPI and vertical shear are averaged along the
     storm track, where the forecast positions are obtained from the LBAR
     model. Until 1997, only the initial analysis of the aviation run of
     the MRF model was used to determine the synoptic parameters, due to
     the difficulty of separating the tropical cyclone and its
     environment during the forecast period. However, for the 1997
     season, the model was generalized to include synoptic predictors
     from forecasts out to 48 hr. A special filter was developed to
     remove the vortex circulation from the MRF initial fields. These
     modified fields were then used to initialize a "no-physics" 11-level
     limited-area baroclinic model, with boundary forcing from the MRF
     forecast fields. Similar to SHIFOR, SHIPS was developed from cases
     where the storm track did not cross land. A version of SHIPS is
     available for the Atlantic and east Pacific.

4. Model Verification

     In principle, all of the baroclinic models forecast track, intensity
     and structure. However, no systematic procedures have been developed
     for extracting structure parameters (for example, wind radii) from
     the model forecasts. Also, the global models do not have adequate
     horizontal resolution to resolve the inner portion of the storm, so
     they are not currently used for intensity prediction. Therefore, no
     verification of the storm structure is available, and the track and
     intensity verifications will be discussed separately.

     After the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, significant improvements
     to the NCEP MRF model were implemented (Surgi, et al 1997). Because
     most of the other NHC models make use of the MRF model output,
     verification statistics prior to 1996 may not be relevant to the
     current versions of the models. Therefore, verification results for
     a sample of cases from the 1996 and 1997 hurricane seasons will be
     presented. The Atlantic hurricane season of 1996 was very active,
     while the east Pacific season was unusually quiet. In 1997, the
     Atlantic was relatively quiet, but the east Pacific was active, so
     the combination of these two years provides reasonable sample sizes
     in both basins.

     The model forecasts are evaluated by comparison with the best track
     positions and intensities, which are the post-storm estimates of
     these parameters based upon all available information. The track
     error is great circle distance from the forecast to observed storm
     position, and the intensity error is the absolute value of the
     forecast and observed maximum surface wind. Only those cases where
     the storm is of tropical storm strength (maximum winds > 34 kt) or
     greater are included in the verification sample, and the
     extra-tropical and subtropical cases are excluded. Also, the
     verification is restricted to forecasts that were obtained in
     real-time.

4.1 Track Verification

     Table 3 shows the Atlantic track forecast errors for the combined
     1996-97 sample for the early models. This table shows that all of
     the models except the shallow version of BAM (BAMS) have skill at
     all forecast periods because the average errors are less than those
     from the CLIPER model. The lack of skill for BAMS is not surprising,
     since it is only run as a comparison with BAMM and BAMD, and is
     occasionally used for sheared systems that might be steered by a
     shallow layer. The track errors from the medium and deep versions of
     BAM had comparable errors for this sample. Overall, the interpolated
     GFDL model (GFDI) had the smallest average errors, except at 12 hr,
     where the LBAR errors were the smallest.

     Table 4 shows the Atlantic track forecast errors for the late
     models, where the CLIPER errors are included for comparison. The
     sample sizes in Table 4 are considerably smaller than those in Table
     3 because the late models are currently only run twice per day,
     while the early models are available four times per day. Also, the
     NOGAPS and UKMET forecasts are sent to NHC from remote sites, and
     transmission problems sometimes prevent the transfer of data. Except
     at 12 hr, all of the late models had smaller errors than CLIPER. The
     GFDL and NOGAPS models had smaller track errors than the AVN and the
     UKMET models.

     No. Cases 93 88  77  67  51

     Table 5 shows the early model verification for the east Pacific.
     Comparing Tables 5 and 3 shows that the average CLIPER errors in the
     East Pacific are considerably smaller than those in the Atlantic.
     This reduction is consistent with the relatively smooth tracks and
     lack of recurvature of the east Pacific storms. In contrast to the
     Atlantic verification, very few of the models have skill relative to
     CLIPER. The statistical model NHC91 has the smallest errors, except
     at 72 hr, where BAMM has the smallest error. The GFDI, which was the
     best early model in the Atlantic, has the largest errors at 12 and
     24 hr, and is only slightly better than CLIPER at 36- 72 hr.

     Table 6 shows the late model verification for the east Pacific.
     Similar to the early east Pacific models, the skill relative to
     CLIPER is much less than for the Atlantic. Only the GFDL at 48 hr
     and UKMET at 36-72 hr have errors smaller than CLIPER. This lack of
     skill is partially due to the smaller CLIPER errors (CLIPER is
     harder to beat). It might also be due to the relative lack of
     observations, especially to the west of the storms. A complex
     numerical model can not make good forecasts with a poor
     initialization. The lack of observations may also explain why more
     the baroclinic models generally did not outperform the simpler LBAR
     and NHC91 models in the East Pacific. These simple models make
     greater use of the initial storm motion vector. In a data void
     region, this information may partially compensate for the lack
     observations.

4.2 Intensity Verification

     As described in Section 2, the SHIFOR and SHIPS models are only
     valid for storms over water. For this reason, the cases where the
     storm crossed land were eliminated from the intensity verification
     sample. Analogous to track models, the SHIFOR errors are used to
     evaluate the skill of the intensity models.

     Table 7. Average Errors (kt) of the Early Intensity Models for
     1996-97 Atlantic Tropical Cyclones.

                  Forecast Interval (hr)

     No. Cases 305 270  236  211  171

     Table 7 shows the early intensity model verification for the
     Atlantic. The SHIPS errors are smaller than SHIFOR at all forecast
     intervals, and the GFDI errors are smaller than SHIFOR at 36-72 hr.
     However, the improvement over SHIFOR was only about 2-10% at 12- 72
     hr. By comparison, the improvement of the best early Atlantic track
     models relative to CLIPER was 20-40% at 12-72 hr. This result shows
     that intensity skill is considerably less than track forecast skill.

     Table 8. Average Errors (kt) of the Early Intensity Models for
     1996-97 East Pacific Tropical Cyclones.

                   Forecast Interval (hr)

     SHIFOR    9.5  15.3 19.8 23.3 26.4
     SHIPS     9.6  14.7 17.6 20.4 21.8
     GFDI      13.0 19.4 24.5 29.5 37.2
     No. Cases 254  214  176  143  99

     Table 8 shows the verification of the early intensity models for the
     East Pacific. The SHIPS forecast improved upon SHIFOR by 4-17% at
     24-72 hr, which is better than for the Atlantic. The GFDI forecast
     errors were larger than SHIFOR at all forecast intervals, which is
     worse than for the Atlantic.

     A verification was also performed for the only late intensity model
     (GFDL) for the Atlantic and east Pacific (not shown), where SHIFOR
     and GFDI were included for comparison. The GFDL errors tended to be
     larger than the GFDI errors at 12-36 hr. This increase appears to be
     a result of the model initialization, where the vortex circulation
     goes through an adjustment period during the first 6-12 hr of the
     forecast, resulting in unrealistic fluctuations in intensity. The
     interpolation technique tends to smooth these fluctuations. At 48
     and 72 hr, the GFDL errors were smaller than those of the GFDI.
     However, the GFDL errors were greater than or equal to those of
     SHIFOR at all forecast intervals, except for the Atlantic sample at
     72 hr, where the errors were about 13% smaller than those of SHIFOR.
