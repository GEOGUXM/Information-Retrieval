    The GIM Group studies atmosphere-ocean-land-ice interactions through
   the use of direct and remote sensing techniques. The field programs are
    designed to further our understanding of the Global climate feedback
   mechanisms and how they influence the global climate change processes.
                   GIM Group projects are described below.
