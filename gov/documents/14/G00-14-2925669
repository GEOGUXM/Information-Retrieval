   Steve Grube
   District Conservationist
   Lewis & Clark NRD

   -- 1978 - Graduate of Johnson-Brock High School, Johnson, NE
   -- 1982 - Bachelor of Science Degree in Agronomy from Northwest
   Missouri State University, Maryville, MO
   Began employment with USDA Soil Conservation Service in 1984 as a Soil
   Conservationist in the Hartington Field Office. From 1988 to 1991
   served as District Conservationist in Neligh, NE. Returned to
   Hartington in 1991 as Liaison District Conservationist/District
   Conservationist. Have served in this capacity since that time.
   Resource Needs and Concerns
   The most serious resource concern throughout Dixon, Cedar, and Knox
   counties has been erosion of soil on the sloping uplands. Throughout
   the three-county area, there are 1,506,304 total acres. Approximately
   657,310, or 43% of the total land area is currently in row crop
   production. Over 608,000 acres, or 92%, are determined to be Highly
   Erodible.
   For this reason, the Lewis & Clark NRD Board of Directors have
   established "Soil Conservation" as the top priority. The following is a
   listing of all the priorities:
     * Soil Conservation
     * Water Quality and Pollution Control
     * Water Supply
     * Flood Prevention
     * Forestry and Range Management
     * Information and Education
     * Wildlife Management
     * Recreation Facilities

   In addition to these priorities, the Local Work Group has also
   identified grassland resources as an area of concern.
   Primary programs and services (Programs)
     * Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP)
       Through efforts of the local workgroup, a priority area was
       identified that encompasses 768,000 acres in the northern portions
       of Knox and Cedar counties. The priority area, entitled "Northeast
       Nebraska Grassland Improvement Project", is aimed at dealing with
       the management and improvement of grassland resources. This will
       include targeting CRP lands to remain in grass, assisting in the
       conversion of cropland to grassland, and the improvement of
       existing grasslands. The EQIP funds in the project area would be
       targeted towards conservation practices that will assist local
       producers in implementing a grazing management plan.
     * PL-556
       The Aowa Creek Watershed, located in Dixon county, was approved for
       federal funding in 1969. This 55,350 acre watershed was identified
       with problem areas of grade stabilization, flooding, erosion
       damage, and a need for additional water based recreation. As of to
       date, there have been 45 structures constructed, one currently
       under construction, and two remaining to be built.
     * Conservation Reserve Program
       Since its inception, this single program has addressed numerous
       resource concerns on well over 100,000 acres throughout Cedar,
       Dixon, and Knox county. Benefits have included soil erosion,
       wildlife habitat, and water quality.
