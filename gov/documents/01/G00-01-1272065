   You are visiting the web site of the EPSCI Program at the U.S. Dept. of
   Energy's Ames Laboratory, Ames, IA
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Ames Laboratory's Environmental & Protection Sciences Program is
          playing an important role in the U. S. Department of Energy's
          initiative to clean up hazardous waste, responding to
          remediation problems that need faster, safer, better or cheaper
          technological solutions. You'll find information here about
          those technologies, the scientists behind them, and our efforts
          to move these technologies into the marketplace.

          And because environmental issues affect everyone, not just
          scientists, we provide lay-level descriptions for many of our
          technology projects. We've also done this in our "Library"
          section, providing additional reference materials in
          nontechnical language, such as our summary of cleanup terms,
          environmental geology terms, an acronym list, and pointers to
          other Internet servers that specialize in environmental
          information.

          Enjoy your Internet surfing but please bear with us as some
          information is still under construction.
