   ECCO is a consortium formed by a group of scientists at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory (JPL), and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). It
   has been formed under the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP)
   with funding provided from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Office of
   Naval Research (ONR). The consortium intends to bring ocean state
   estimation from its current experimental status to that of a practical
   and quasi-operational tool for studying large-scale ocean dynamics,
   designing observational strategies, and examining the ocean's role in
   climate variability.
