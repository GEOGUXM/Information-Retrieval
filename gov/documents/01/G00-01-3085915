                                  What's up

   Welcome to IPPEX! The Interactive Plasma Physics Education Experience!

    Something for everyone: electricity, magnetism, energy an fusion. Use
                            the menu on the left.

     This site contains Interactive Plasma Physics Topics, ranging from
    electricity, magnetism, energy, and fusion. Please visit the "Virtual
     Tokamak" and our "Virtual Magnetic Stability Module" to learn about
                       Plasma and Fusion Containment.
