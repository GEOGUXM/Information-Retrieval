                 Welcome to the NASA Wallops Flight Facility

                               TOPEX Web Site

    Use the global links on the left side of the page to browse about the
                             WFF TOPEX web site.

   Overview

     The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility
     (GSFC/WFF) was responsible for specifying and providing the
     dual-frequency altimeter (ALT) which is the prime instrument for the
     TOPEX/Poseidon mission. The ALT hardware was developed and built for
     GSFC/WFF by the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics
     Laboratory. Within the GSFC Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes
     the Observational Science Branch (OSB), located at WFF, has been
     continuously involved in altimeter design studies and data analysis
     from the middle 1970's through the present time. The OSB TOPEX group
     has been involved throughout the entire life of the TOPEX project.
