   This 6th Eco-Informa conference is designed for those interested in
   gaining insights about a range of environmental issues and joining
   together to develop solutions to our major challenges. Participants
   include project managers, scientists, engineers, and communicators from
   government, commercial, academic, and public sectors.

   A central focus is the use of modern technology to share new
   information and develop integrated strategies for environmental
   solutions.

   The goal is to identify interdisciplinary, multi-organizational
   approaches that can lead to sustainable decisions for the global
   community.
