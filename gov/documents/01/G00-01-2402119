   The Biogeography Program is in NOAA's National Ocean Service, and is
   part of the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA),
   located in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.

   The goal of the Biogeography Program is to develop knowledge and
   products on living marine resource distributions and ecology throughout
   the Nation's estuarine, coastal and marine environments, and to provide
   managers and scientists with an improved ecosystem basis for making
   decisions.

   Activities of the Biogeography Program focus on developing products,
   applications and processes for defining and interpreting the
   relationships of species distributions and their environments. Most of
   our project are done in cooperation with other groups. Current or major
   project topics of the Biogeography Program include:
     * Benthic habitat mapping in coral reef areas
     * Reef fish ecology
     * Aerial photography for the U.S. Caribbean and Hawaii
     * Habitat suitability modeling using geographic information systems
     * Distribution and relative abundance of estuarine fishes and
       invertebrates (ELMR)
     * Life history information for estuarine fishes and invertebrates
       (ELMR)
     * Coastal ocean strategic assessment data atlases - maps of coastal
       species and other resources
     * Custom GIS applications for resource assessment and modeling: CORA
       and HSM
