   Sorry, but IRIS only works with Netscape at this time, because it
   utilizes Netscape-specific features.

   We do not yet know if there is sufficient usage at the Berkeley Lab of
   non-Netscape Browsers to warrant the investment required to make NetREQ
   compatible with other Browsers.

   If you would like to obtain Netscape, it is available at no cost to
   you. The Lab has a site license. Please contact the ICSD Mac-PC support
   group at extension 6858.
