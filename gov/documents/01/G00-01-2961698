   The Fermilab Linac is a negative hydrogen ion, 400 MeV accelerator. It
   includes a 25 keV H-minus ion source, a 750 keV electrostatic
   accelerating column, a 116 MeV drift-tube (Alverez) linac operating at
   201.25 MHz, and a 401 MeV side-coupled cavity linac operating at 805
   MHz. Many details can be obtained from the nice picture displays listed
   in the sidebar to the left.

                                  Pictures

   There are several indexes of photographs available for the Linac. (Some
   of these links contain fairly large amount of stuff, so downloads over
   a modem might be slow)

     This is a tour of the pieces, intended for the casual observer

     A collection of pictures taken during a shutdown in 1997 is found
   here

     This is alisting of about 200 pitcures taken in October, 2001, of the
   Fermilab Linac, front to back.. This covers most of the things you can
   see in the tunnel

     We have setup one of our PC's to serve up all the photos we take in
   the Linac. You may check this archive here.

                  Recent Performance of the Fermilab Linac

   The Fermilab complex gearing up for delievering physics-quality pbar-p
   collisions to CDF and DZero. At this moment, we are re-commissioning
   these detectors.

   The linac beam current over the last 24 hours (updated every every 10
   minutes, beginning at :02). Our beam lasts between 15 and 50
   microseconds, and repeats at 15 Hz, for a duty factor between 0.225%
   and 0.750%. Zero current usually means that we are not being asked to
   produce beam for the rest of the facility; The uptime of the Linac is
   97%.

   The linac ion source beam current oscilloscpe plot (updated every 15
   minutes, beginning at :01). The uptime of the ion source is better than
   99%.

   The transmission through the entire Linac is stored and this display is
   updated several times per day.
