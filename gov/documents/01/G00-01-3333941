              Welcome to the Surface Radiation Research Branch

   The Surface Radiation Research Branch (SRRB) of NOAA's Air Resources
   Laboratory is located in Boulder, Colorado. It was founded by, and is
   under the direction of, Dr. John DeLuisi. We are staffed by national
   and international scientists who conduct research in many aspects of
   surface radiation. Our primary emphasis is to provide quality surface
   radiation measurements and, in cooperation with NIST and the USDA, to
   operate the Central Calibration and Test Facility for national UV
   monitoring instruments. Other efforts at SRRB include research on the
   effects of surface UV radiation, improvement of surface radiation
   instruments and observing techniques, development of improved
   calibration and data quality control techniques, management of surface
   radiation networks, and basic research.
