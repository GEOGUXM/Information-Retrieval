   The Turning Goals Into Reality Conference is an opportunity for NASA
   and its industry partners to acknowledge major technological advances
   in the aeronautics and space access. The two day event, to be held May
   18-19 at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama,
   will include keynote addresses by top level NASA managers and other
   government leaders, awards for technology development leaders, and
   opportunities for potential partners to discuss the groundbreaking work
   that lies ahead. Technology status briefings, demonstrations, and tours
   of the Marshall Center are also part of the conference program.

   Turning Goals Into Reality recognizes major accomplishments on NASA's
   path to meeting its key aeronautics and access to space objectives, and
   is a milestone event for aircraft, spacecraft, and launch vehicle
   developers.
