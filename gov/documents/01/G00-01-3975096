      NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress

      Drop Cap Letter F or 100 years, the National Institute of Standards and
      Technology has helped to keep U.S. technology at the leading edge. Over
      the years, NIST has made solid contributions to image processing, DNA
      diagnostic "chips," smoke detectors, and automated error-correcting
      software for machine tools. NIST also has had major impact

     Ca. 1920--a NIST staff member listens with something like incredulity
                 to a radio broadcast picked up by a homemade crystal set.

      on atomic clocks, X-ray standards for mammography, scanning tunneling
      microscopy, pollution-control technology, and high-speed dental drills.

      Founded on March 3, 1901, as the National Bureau of Standards, NIST was
      the federal government's first physical science research laboratory.
      NIST's major accomplishments of the past 100 years and their impact on
      industry, science and technology, the nation's economy, and the
      publicare described in NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress, an
      extensive, illustrated web site. Another fact sheet briefly summarizes
      the benefits of NIST's research and services.
