   NASA Ames nanotechnology effort started in early 1996 and has steadily
   grown to establish a center for nanotechnology. The research work
   focuses on experimental research and development (R & D) as well as on
   a strong modeling and simulation effort. In addition, the center
   conducts research in computational electronics, computational
   optoelectronics, and computational modeling of processes encountered in
   nanofabrication and microelectronics manufacturing.

   The Center vision is:

   To develop novel concepts in nanotechnology for NASA's future needs on
   electronics, computing, sensors, and advanced miniaturization of all
   systems;

   To develop highly integrated and intelligent simulation environment
   that facilitates the rapid development and validation of future
   generation electronic devices as well as associated materials and
   processes through virtual prototyping at multiple levels of fidelity.
