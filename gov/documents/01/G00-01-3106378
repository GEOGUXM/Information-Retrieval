   More about the CSR

   For over 10 years, Sandia has been working with US industry and federal
   agencies on projects ranging from microelectronics processing tool
   design, to predictive maintenance software, to anticipating human
   errors made in nuclear power plant control rooms. In 1997, Robert
   Cranwell, a former mathematics professor from Arizona University, and
   department manager in systems reliability at Sandia National
   Laboratories, embarked on a mission to establish a formal conduit to
   Sandia's world-class resources in reliability and associated
   technologies. In 1998, the Center for Systems Reliability was chartered
   for the express purpose of stimulating and facilitating business
   relationships between the Labs and external customers. This was a
   significant accomplishment in making the nation's substantial technical
   resources, originally cultivated for the Department of Energy (DOE),
   available to US industry and non-DOE government agencies. Although the
   CSR is a well-defined subset of Sandia, it has the ability to draw upon
   the vast technological resources of Sandia to meet the needs of its
   partners.
