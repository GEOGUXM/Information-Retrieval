   The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent
   federal body that advises the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the
   Medicare program. The Commission's 17 members, who bring diverse
   expertise in the financing and delivery of health services, meet
   publicly to discuss policy issues and formulate recommendations to the
   Congress on improving Medicare policies.
