   THE INTERAGENCY GPS EXECUTIVE BOARD (IGEB) was established by
   Presidential directive in 1996 to manage the Global Positioning System
   (GPS) and its U.S. Government augmentations as a national asset.

   The IGEB is a senior-level policy making body chaired jointly by the
   Departments of Defense and Transportation. Its membership includes the
   Departments of State, Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, and Justice, as
   well as NASA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

   A permanent Executive Secretariat located in Washington, D.C., provides
   day-to-day staff support to the IGEB principals. The Executive
   Secretariat is a point of contact for inquiries regarding GPS policy.
   Mr. Greg Finley is the Director of the IGEB Executive Secretariat.
