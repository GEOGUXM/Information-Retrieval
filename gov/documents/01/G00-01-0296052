      REVISED Appendix 1007-b-5, Local Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure
      [thinrule.gif]

      Effective immediately, the Court has modified the procedures as
      delineated in Appendix 1007-b-5 of the Local Rules of Bankruptcy
      Procedure that prescribe the format of the master mailing list
      (Matrix).

      A section has been added titled "Guidelines for Submitting a Diskette".
      The section titled "Guidelines for Submitting a Hard (Paper) Copy have
      been revised to reflect that most master mailing lists are prepared
      using computer hardware and software rather than on typewriters.

      While it is currently optional as to which format attorneys can use to
      file the creditor matrix, the submission of a creditor matrix in an
      electronic format is expected to become mandatory at some point in the
      future in most instances. The Court strongly urges debtor attorneys to
      submit original or amended master mailing lists on a 3.4" High Density
      (HD) MS-DOS formatted diskette. 08/10/2001

      Procedural Form B 201 Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor
      [thinrule.gif]

      The Court has posted the procedural form titled Notice to Individual
      Consumer Debtor to our web site.

      Until recently, this form was available from the General Services
      Administration (GSA) but they have recently indicated to us that it
      will no longer be available.

      The purpose of the notice is to ensure that debtors are acquainted with
      the four chapters of the federal Bankruptcy Code under which a
      bankruptcy petition may be filed. The form acts as a pre-printed
      information sheet on basic debtor's rights under the different chapters
      of the different chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy law is
      complicated and not easily described. Court employees are prohibited
      from giving legal advice.

      In every case with individual consumer debtors, the debtor(s) must
      acknowledge receipt of the form by signing and dating the form. The
      original should then be filed, generally with the voluntary petition.
      08/02/2001

      Revised Form, Verification of Creditor Matrix [thinrule.gif]

      Effective immediately, the Court has modified the form required as
      Appendix 1007-b-6 of the Local Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure titled the
      "Verification of Creditor Matrix" to require the debtor(s) to specify
      if the creditor matrix is being submitted on diskette or on paper.

      There are no other changes in the form or in the verification process.

      While it is currently optional as to which format attorneys can use to
      file the creditor matrix, the submission of a creditor matrix in an
      electronic format is expected to become mandatory at some point in the
      future in most instances. In the meantime, the change on this form will
      provide the Court with a more accurate record of how the creditor
      matrix was filed in the particular case. 08/02/2001
