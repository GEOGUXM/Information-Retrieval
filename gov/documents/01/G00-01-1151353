   Welcome to the Indian Health Service Dental Recruitment Program. This
   Web Site introduces dental students and dentists alike to the many
   employment opportunities available in the IHS.

   Nearly 400 dentists provide comprehensive health care to Native
   American families in Indian Health Service hospitals and health centers
   throughout much of the country. Employed as Commissioned Officers in
   the U.S. Public Health Service, as Civil Servants, or as independent
   contractors, most IHS dentists serve for two or three years, while some
   enjoy 20 to 30 year careers. Regardless of your interest, the IHS
   offers a variety of assignment choices and superb benefits.

   Through this Web Site, you can explore the diverse professional
   opportunities, rich cultural experience, and unique geographic
   diversity that await you in the IHS. (internet)
