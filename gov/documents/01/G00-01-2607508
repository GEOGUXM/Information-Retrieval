                   How to Become an Organ and Tissue Donor

   Transplantations save lives, but only if you help. All you need to do
   is say yes to organ and tissue donation on your donor card and/or
   driver's license and discuss your decision with your family.

   Each day about 60 people receive an organ transplant, but another 15
   people on the waiting list die because not enough organs are available.

   Talk to your family members about organ and tissue donation so they
   know your wishes. (See Frequently Asked Questions, for more
   information.) Even if you've signed something, your family may be asked
   to give consent before donation can occur.

   Be an organ and tissue donor. You could save or enhance the lives of
   more than 50 people! To download and print your donor card, click here
