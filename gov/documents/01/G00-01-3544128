   USGS:Science for a changing world
   USGS Woods Hole Field Center, Woods Hole, MA

A Field Center for Coastal and Marine Geology

Located in Woods Hole, Massachusetts


   The Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Geology Team is one of three marine
   teams that conduct research within the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology
   Program. The team is located on WHOIÂ’s Quissett Campus. The team has a
   staff of about 100, including 24 research scientists and 75 scientific
   and administrative support staff. USGS earth scientists explore and
   study many aspects of the underwater areas between shorelines and the
   deep ocean, off the U.S. East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and in parts
   of the Caribbean and Great Lakes.

Research Highlights

      Boston's Sewage Outfall and the Fate of Sediment Contanminants in
                              Massachusetts Bay

   The United States Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the
   MWRA, has been conducting research to understand and predict the fate
   of contaminants introduced to Massachusetts' coastal waters.

                                Gas Hydrates

   Gas Hydrates are being studied for their potential as a future energy
   resource. When hydrate fills the pore space of sediment, it can create
   a gas trap which may produce highly concentrated methane and methane
   hydrate reservoirs.

   Reconnaissance mapping of the shallow Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),
   with initial emphasis on the heavily utilized areas of the sea floor
   offshore of major metropolitan centers, is be carried out to develop a
   detailed understanding of the sea-floor geology.
