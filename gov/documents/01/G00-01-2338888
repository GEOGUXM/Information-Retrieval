              California Department of Aging Address and Phone
     State Seal - Small Version The California Department of Aging
   administers a broad range of home- and community-based services
   throughout California, working primarily with 33 Area Agencies who
   serve seniors and adults with functional impairments.
   The Department also works with other public and private agencies in a
   variety of partnerships to implement our vision and mission. Our
   challenge is to think creatively about how services can best be
   structured to meet the current and future needs of California's diverse
   population as it grows, changes, and ages in the years to come.
