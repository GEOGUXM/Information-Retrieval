   The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL), located in Boulder, Colorado, is
   one of the NOAA Research Laboratories in the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

   Plot of LAPS 500-hPa Temperature analysis FSL conducts applied
   meteorological research and development to improve and create
   short-term warning and weather forecast systems, models, and observing
   technology. Supercomputing and other leading-edge technology are used
   in these applications. FSL then transfers the new scientific and
   technological advances to its clients which include NOAA's National
   Weather Service, the commercial and general aviation communities, the
   U.S. Air Force, many foreign weather forecasting offices, and various
   private interests.
