   General Mission


        This site reflects a recent NOS reorganization.  To access the old
        Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment (ORCA) web site, click
                                                                     here.

   The mission of the Special Projects Office is to provide expertise,
   products and services that help the National Ocean Service (NOS) to
   design and implement an effective program of coastal stewardship
   throughout the agency. This includes exploring ways to leverage the
   agency's considerable expertise into a force that directly supports and
   influences the sound management and protection of coastal areas. NOS
   Special Projects is in a unique position to bridge the gap between NOS
   scientific efforts and coastal management policy issues. For a detailed
   Program Summary, click on the link to the left.
