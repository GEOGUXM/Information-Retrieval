   CTED has changed! It is now two separate offices with two very distinct
   functions:

   The Washington State Office of Community Development (OCD) will work
   toward securing the basic needs of a viable community.

   The Washington State Office of Trade & Economic Development (OTED) will
   focus on creating economic opportunities and strengthening the
   competitiveness of Washington businesses.

   OCD and OTED will jointly share an Administrative Services Division and
   an Employee Services unit. If you have a question regarding CTED
   administration, please contact the Administrative Services Division
   directly.

   This change was ordered by Governor Locke. To view the text of the
   directive, click: Directive 00-03 - Establishing the Office of Trade
   and Economic Development and the Office of Community Development within
   the Department of Community, Trade & Economic Development.
