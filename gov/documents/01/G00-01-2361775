   Up-to-Date Information on the
   Tennessee River System

   The Tennessee Valley Authority manages an integrated, technically
   elegant system of dams, locks, and reservoirs in the Tennessee River
   watershed. This system is carefully balanced to facilitate navigation,
   control flooding, and produce hydropower to benefit all people in the
   Valley.

   TVA makes this happen by carefully planning the retention and release
   of water from its dams. This site tracks water levels as they rise and
   fall in reservoirs across the Valley.

   The water release schedule is subject to change without notice.
   Times are given in local time.
   Please use caution near dams.
   Hazardous conditions may develop without warning.

     To use this site, choose the name of a reservoir from the first box
   below, select the kind of information you want, and click View data.

   Observed water levels in the reservoirs are updated periodically
   throughout the day.

   Predicted water levels are updated at least once a day, by 1 p.m.
   Eastern time. That information may be updated more frequently when the
   amount of water flowing through the system is large. Predicted levels
   are given for midnight of the same day and the two days following.

   This site offers predicted daily average rates of water flowing into
   and being discharged from reservoirs. Predicted flow rates are given
   for the same day and the two days following. The site also tracks the
   flow of water in selected Valley streams, as well as precipitation
   across the Valley.
