   The Problem
   Obesity is a nationwide epidemic. More than half of all adults and 11
   percent of children and adolescents in the United States are estimated
   to be overweight or obese. Prevalence has nearly doubled among children
   and adolescents since 1980 and is increasing in both genders and among
   all population group of adults. Obesity has been identified as one of
   ten Leading Health Indicators from Healthy People 2010, the nations
   objectives for the decade.
   About the Surgeon Generals Listening Session
   This meeting is the inaugural event in the development of a national
   action plan to combat overweight and obesity. The listening session
   will allow concerned organizational and community leaders, and
   government representatives to share information about obesity
   prevention efforts. The meeting will include presentations by five
   panels of experts as well as time for discussion. The panels are
   organized around settings in which obesity prevention efforts take
   place. They include the family and community setting, schools,
   worksites, the health care delivery system, and the media.
