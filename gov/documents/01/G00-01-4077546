     Purpose of the Conference - This conference will explore the issues in
     providing a collaborative computational environment that is both open
     and secure. The open, unimpeded flow of information has been a
     foundation of scientific research, even more so today with the trend
     toward increasingly large and geographically dispersed teams. This
     trend has been enabled by advances in IT and has increased dependence
     on IT, which has exacerbated potential vulnerabilities. Thus, computer
     security has taken on increasing importance, with the profusion of both
     malicious and unintended compromises to computing and communications
     infrastructures. These seemingly divergent considerations must be
     resolved into a harmonious relationship if information technology tools
     are to be reliable and effective.

     This conference program draws on experiences and viewpoints of the
     university, industry, government and research laboratory sectors. It
     will provide a forum for collaboration tool providers, notable
     collaboration partners, computer security practitioners, and officials
     responsible for enforcing security provisions. The end objective of the
     conference is a clearer identification of the issues, and a roadmap
     that best meets the need of these constituencies.

     Who Should Attend - Management and IT professionals from University,
     Government, Research Laboratories and the private sector. Scientists
     involved in computer-intensive collaborative activities.

     The Conference Program - The program will feature eminent speakers who
     are conversant in the conduct of collaborative science as well as those
     whose specialty is computer and network security. Notable
     collaborations in the areas such as Nuclear Physics, Genomics, and
     Computational Grids will be described. New trends in security threats
     and protection tools will be presented. The tensions between the needs
     of open science and the need for responsible security will be
     identified, and solutions that have been proposed in science and other
     enterprises will be described. Finally there will be a workshop session
     to propose next steps to achieve the appropriate balance.

     The social program will include a cocktail hour and an optional dinner
     cruise on the Peconic Bay. Detailed information on the program,
     registration, and lodging can be found by using the links on the left
     sidebar.
