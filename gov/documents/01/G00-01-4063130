   Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science


   The NIST Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science

   The Center's mission is to:
     * investigate important problems in materials theory and modeling
       with novel computational approaches;
     * create opportunities for collaboration where CTCMS can make a
       positive difference by virtue of its structure, focus, and people;
     * develop powerful new tools for materials theory and modeling and
       accelerate their integration into industrial research.

   Opportunities at CTCMS: Resident Scholar Program, Workshops, and
   Postdoctoral Positions

   The NIST Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science is
   continuously soliciting proposals for

     * Workshops on materials theory and modeling.
     * Short-term and long-term visiting fellowships.
     * Guest researcher and NRC postdoctoral positions.
     * Creative and ambitious new projects in materials theory and
       modeling.

   The Center's Working Groups are:
     * Anisotropic Blends Working Group
     * OOF: Object-Oriented Finite Element Analysis of Real Material
       Microstructures Working Group
     * Solder Interconnect Geometry and Reactive Wetting Working Group
     * Green's Functions and Boundary Element Methods Working Group
     * Micromagnetic Modeling (muMAG) Working Group
     * Glasses and Amorphous Materials Working Group
     * Deformation of Metals Working Group
     * Phase Field Modeling Tools Working Group
     * Wulffman Working Group
     * First Principles Effective Hamiltonians Working Group

   The Center is a mirror site for femLego: Numeria l Simulation by
   Symbolic Computation, written by Gustav Amberg, Mechanics, KTH, S-100
