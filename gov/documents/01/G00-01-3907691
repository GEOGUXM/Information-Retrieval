   The Systems Acquisition Office (SAO) was established in 1991 as the
   primary program development and acquisition office under the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SAO's programs range from
   atmospheric surveillance to fleet modernization and from systems
   development to systems deployment. Also, SAO has an Information
   Technology Acquisition Office that supports government agencies with
   project and acquisition management services.

                               NEW INFORMATION

   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is procuring
   a new Fisheries Research Vessel (FRV) to support key National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS) research. The draft RFP and SOR have been
   refined in response to prior questions and additional refinements are
   anticipated in the near future.
   More information can be found on:
   http://www.omao.noaa.gov/frv/

   The GOES Data Collection System's (DCS) computers and interfaces are
   approaching the end of their service lives; therefore, the DCS
   Automated Processing System (DAPS II) procurement project will replace
   the current aging DAPS.
