        The Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of
       Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is one of the largest
   neuroscience research centers in the world. Investigators in the NINDS
    intramural program conduct research in the basic, translational, and
   clinical neurosciences. Their specific interests cover a broad range of
     neuroscience research including molecular biophysics, synapses and
   circuits, neuronal development, integrative neuroscience, brain imaging
         and neurological disorders. Through collaboration, pre- and
    postdoctoral training programs, jointly sponsored seminar series and
   special interest groups, NINDS investigators and investigators in other
   intramural programs (NIMH, NEI, NIDCD and NICHD) contribute to a vital
   and growing neuroscience research community at the National Institutes
                                 of Health.
