                               Welcome to the

                            PACER Service Center
                            U.S. Party/Case Index

                         Enter U.S. Party/Case Index

    Not all federal courts participate in the U.S. Party/Case Index. The
    courts that are listed under the option "Courts not on Index" do not
    have data available on this index. For a complete nationwide search,
    those courts need to be searched individually. In some instances for
   courts that provide data on the U.S. Party/Case Index, the data on the
   court's PACER system may be more current than what is available on the
    U.S. Party/Case Index. Use the option "Date Ranges" to determine the
               currency of data from each court on the index.
   Beginning October 1, 1999, an access fee of $.07 per page, as approved
    by the Judicial Conference of the United States at its September 1998
     session, will be assessed for access to this service. Traditional,
                      dial-up PACER is still available.
    A login and password, issued by the PACER Service Center, is required
   for access to PACER either through the dial-up service or the Internet
    service. If you do not already have a PACER account, you may register
              on-line from the PACER Service Center web site at
                       http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov.
    If you have comments, suggestions or questions, please send email to
       the PACER Service Center at pacer@aottsd.uscourts.gov. If your
   comment(s) pertain to a specific court, please include the name of that
                            court in your email.
