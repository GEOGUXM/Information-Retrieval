   Overview

   A number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presently exist, both
   domestically and internationally. Their payload weight carrying
   capability, their accommodations (volume, environment), their mission
   profile (altitude, range, duration) andtheir command, control and data
   acquisition capabilities vary significantly. Routine civil access to
   these various UAV assets is in an embryonic state and is only just now
   emerging.

   A buildup of domestic UAV configurations, promoted by the Department of
   Defense (DOD) occurred in the late 1980s and well into the 90s. This
   occurred as the DOD sought UAVs to satisfy their mission unique
   surveillance requirements in either a Close Range, Short Range or
   Endurance category of vehicle. Close Range was defined to be within 50
   kilometers, Short Range was defined as within 200 kilometers and
   Endurance as anything beyond. With the advent of newer technology and
   with the demonstrated performance of the UAVs provided to the DOD by
   industry, the Close and Short Range categories have since been
   combined, and a later separate Shipboard category has also been
   incorporated with them. The current classes or combination of these
   type vehicles are called the Tactical UAV, followed by the Endurance
   category.

   For the potential civilian user of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, rather
   than continue with this terminology for the various categories of UAV,
   the following category titles are used: LOCAL, REGIONAL, and ENDURANCE.

   Within these three categories of vehicles (LOCAL, REGIONAL, and
   ENDURANCE), approximately twenty-two companies domestically within the
   U.S. are or have been involved, and represent approximately forty-five
   different UAV configurations. See the UAV Categories Chart. The
   locations of these U.S. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Manufacturers/Sources
   are presented. Individual charts for the UAVs contained within the UAV
   Characteristics Database are provided. (A number of foreign
   manufactures also exist, but the information provided herein did not
   directly focus on these sources.) The appearance of these UAVs and
   their known performance capabilities and payload accommodations are
   presented. They range in size from hand-held to runway-operated
   behemoths, whose payload weight capabilities range from a few pounds to
   2000 pounds. Payload accommodation information is presented where
   available. A comparison of various Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Endurance,
   Payload Weight, and Altitude Capabilities is illustrated. Some cost
   information is also presented. It is pointed out, however, that these
   data are for information purposes only. Potential UAV users are
   encouraged to pursue in-depth discussions and analyses with the UAV
   provider community. It is extremely desirable for UAV providers to make
   their payload accommodation and cost information more readily
   available, such that potential users can more easily make tradeoff
   decisions. To the extent this Web Page can be useful to facilitate that
   process, an e-mail address is provided. Pertinent information will be
   posted. Microsoft Word files, JPEG images, etc. are welcome. The e-mail
   address to send this information to is: rossi@osb.wff.nasa.gov.

   Information that a potential UAV science user needs to consider is
   shown in the UAV Science Mission/Instrument User Questionnaire. Your
   responses to this questionnaire are encouraged and solicited.

   A recent operation was conducted at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility to
   define the Shock and Vibration characteristics of an Exdrone UAV
   Payload Bay. The results of this test are presented in the WFF Exdrone
   Test Report, available in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format. Similar testing
   for other UAV types is encouraged, and the UAV provider community is
   welcome to consider Wallops as a location to conduct such testing, as
   well as for other operational scenarios. Wallops Control Zone and
   Restricted Airspace and its ready access to adjacent Warning Areas are
   viewed as the Key Hole to the sky, thus providing immediate
   user-friendly airspace access. The Wallops Controlled Airspace and
   Runway Configuration are shown. Operations within these areas will be
   assessed by the Wallops Range Safety Office to ascertain risk.
   Coordination with the appropriate agencies relative to flight
   operations within these areas will be accomplished. Operations outside
   these areas will also require risk assessment, as well as in-depth
   discussions with the Federal Aviation Agency. Aerial photographs of the
   Wallops Flight Facility and Wallops Island are shown.
