   Boulder, Colorado is home to several government organizations that are
   part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
   which is in the Department of Commerce (DoC).

   These organizations include six of the twelve laboratories that make up
   NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Laboratories,
   formerly (ERL), two of the Data Centers of the National Environmental
   Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), one of OAR's eleven
   Joint Institutes, the Denver Forecast Office of the National Weather
   Service (NWS), and an Administrative Support Center.

   In addition to NOAA, Boulder is home to part of the National Institute
   of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Telecommunications
   and Information Administration (NTIA), both within the Department of
   Commerce.

   The David Skaggs Research Center is the new home for the NOAA-Boulder
   organizations and is managed by GSA in Boulder.
