   The Division of Intramural Research Programs (DIRP) at the National
   Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is the internal research division of
   the NIMH. NIMH DIRP scientists conduct research ranging from studies
   into mechanisms of normal brain function, conducted at the behavioral,
   systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations
   into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Major
   disease entities studied throughout the lifespan include mood disorders
   and anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder, and pediatric autoimmune
   neuropsychiatric disorders.  Because of it’s outstanding resources,
   unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation’s capitol, the
   DIRP is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities
   in mental health research and research training.

   Training is conducted in all the Institute’s clinical branches and
   basic neuroscience laboratories located on the 305-acre National
   Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. In addition to
   individualized trainee/mentor-driven postdoctoral training
   opportunities in the clinical and basic sciences, the DIRP offers
   Postbaccalaureate Research Training Awards, a Clinical Electives
   Program, as well as a variety of Summer Research Fellowships and an
   Undergraduate Internship Program.
