                Teachers Research Associates Program at Fermilab

   Objective: To provide outstanding seventh through twelfth grade science
   and mathematics teachers with professional scientific and engineering
   experiences through summer research opportunities, enhance their
   leadership skills, increase their awareness and understanding of
   current science and technology, promote the transfer of this knowledge
   to the classroom and provide an opportunity for renewal.

   Description: Fermilab hosts a summer research program for secondary
   teachers. Teachers are assigned to a scientist or engineer involved in
   a research project and make contact with many professional researchers.
   Projects range from testing polymers to evaluating phototubes to
   developing software. Teachers learn to acquire data and report results
   in a scientifically acceptable manner. Teachers earn a stipend and may
   earn four and one-half semester hours of graduate credit. Teachers may
   return to work in succeeding years through the eight-week TRAC Graduate
   and the 9-12 month Fermilab Teacher Fellowship Programs. Two hundred
   twenty seven teachers have held research positions since 1983 when
   Fermilab initiated a regional program in the Illinois High Tech
   Corridor.
