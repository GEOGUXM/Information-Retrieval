   ANRI Mission Statement

   The Animal and Natural Resources Institute (ANRI) is located at the
   Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in
   Beltsville, Maryland. The research mission of the Animal and Natural
   Resources Institute (ANRI), is to conduct research and to develop
   technology transfer programs that ensure high quality and safe food
   while protecting the natural resource base and the environment.
