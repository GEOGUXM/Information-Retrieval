   NPOESS

                                                          Break out of frames

      The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System
      (NPOESS) merges Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Commerce
      (DOC) meteorological satellite systems into a single national asset.


                               NPOESS Mission
     * Provide a national, operational, polar-orbiting, environmental
       remote-sensing capability
     * Achieve National Performance Review (NPR) savings by converging
       DoD, and DOC/NOAA satellite programs
     * Incorporate new technologies from NASA
     * Encourage international cooperation

      Observing the Earth from space, polar-orbiting satellites collect and
      disseminate data on Earth's weather and atmosphere, oceans, land, and
      space environment. The polar orbiters are able to monitor the entire
      Earth to provide data for long-range weather and climate forecasts.

      The NPOESS program will continue its mission through 2018, building on
      new technologies to create a new system supporting long-term data
      continuity for environmental monitoring and global change assessment.

      The Departments of Commerce and Defense as well as the National
      Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) created the NPOESS
      Integrated Program Office (IPO) to develop, acquire, manage, and
      operate the next generation of polar-orbiting operational environmental
      satellites. As part of this effort, the United States has partnered
      with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological
      Satellites (EUMETSAT) to provide long-term continuity of observations
      from polar orbit that will continue and improve the operational
      meteorological and environmental forecasting and global climate
      monitoring services of the participating organizations.
