   Welcome to the Computational Physics Department (CPD) Home Page. We
   have a new name as of June 1, 2001. The mission of the CPD Department
   is to provide, maintain and support a collection of HEP software
   packages used primarily for HEP offline analysis. CPD's goals,
   projects, and activities are discussed further in the referenced links.
   We include a listing of the CPD product mailing lists.
