                          Dear Fellow Kentuckians,

   I am pleased to announce that, after being displaced for over three
   months, my staff and I have returned to our office in the Hart Senate
   building. We are happy to be back and wanted you to know that we are
   back up and running at full speed and here to help you.

   It has been difficult at times, but resolve here has remained strong
   and I have continued to work hard for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The
   anthrax attack may have temporarily displaced Senators and staff from
   their offices, but business here in Congress continued as usual. That
   is something of which we can all be proud.

   Things are finally getting back to normal around here, but I appreciate
   your continued patience as my office works through the backlog of mail
   created by the anthrax attacks and new security measures that have been
   put in place as a result. We are receiving mail again and I encourage
   you to write. But also feel free to contact my office here in
   Washington by calling 202-224-4343 or to drop me a line through my
   guestbook:  Send a message now.
   Best personal regards,
