         October 27 - November 1, 1998
   Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5
   hurricane. It was one of the most destructive hurricanes in the
   recorded history of the western hemisphere.
   The United States Geological Survey (USGS), along with other Federal
   and International agencies, led an immediate and aggressive response
   effort providing humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and mitigation
   from high-risk areas. The USGS is now supporting major Hurricane Mitch
   Reconstruction activities.
   The objectives of the USGS program are to improve the availability of
   basic data and information; provide information for improved damage
   assessment, hazard mitigation, and management of natural resources;
   develop and distribute base maps, aerial photography, and satellite
   imagery from affected countries into an integrated, computer-based
   Geographic Information System (GIS) format; and develop regional
   strategies for mitigation, preparedness, and response to natural
   hazards.
