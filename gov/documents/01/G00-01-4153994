   Unique to the Middle District is our FedFacts - The Real Deal program.
   This program was created to fill the void left by traditional community
   drug education programs that often do not include federal drug penalty
   information. Our staff believes it is imperative for young adults and
   their parents to be aware of federal drug penalties and prosecution.  A
   growing number of federal drug offenders are between the ages of 18 -
   25; therefore, our programs information is valuable to societys youth.
