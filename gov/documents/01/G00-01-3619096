   The MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator is a joint development
   involving the Airborne Sensor Facility at the Ames Research Center, the
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the EROS Data Center. The primary
   objective of the MASTER activity is to support the ASTER and MODIS
   instrument teams in the areas of algorithm development, calibration and
   validation. MASTER is essentially a clone of the MODIS Airborne
   Simulator (MAS), with changes in the spectral band positions in order
   to better simulate both ASTER and MODIS.
