   Contents

   The Archive Page was created to preserve all of the appeal and bid
   protest decisions issued between October 1, 1992, when the Board
   started publishing its decisions on a Bulletin Board System (BBS), and
   September 30, 1996, when the GSBCA Home Page was initiated.  The
   Archive Page does not contain any travel, relocation, or transportation
   rate cases.  These decisions are only available on the GSBCA Home Page
   (www.gsbca.gsa.gov).  The Archive Page is searchable in the manner
   described below.  A search done on the Archive Page is for that page
   only (i.e., a search of the Archive Page will not return any "hits"
   from the GSBCA Home Page); however, archived appeals and protest
   decisions may also be searched from the GSA Home Page.

   Documents on the following pages are in two formats: HTML (Text) and
   WordPerfect 5.1 (in a self-extracting zip file).

   Text files may be searched, displayed, printed, and downloaded easily.
   When viewing cases in the text format, please use the "back" key on
   your browser to return to the index page.

   The WordPerfect 5.1 file is compressed into a self-extracting zip file
   which may be downloaded.  Once a file has been downloaded, execute it
   and the WordPerfect 5.1 document will emerge.  After the file has been
   downloaded, the downloaded file may be deleted.

   Searches

   Searching is done via the search below.  Searching is limited to a
   decision category.  For example, if you search archived appeals, all of
   the responses returned will reflect archived appeals decisions.  How to
   search (including search tips) is explained on the search pages.
   Search results include a brief summary at the beginning of the
   decision.  Clicking on the case number will display the decision in
   text format.

   The Archive Page also contains an index by GSBCA number for appeals and
   protests so that you can go directly to a GSBCA decision if you know
   its number.

   Enter search text in the box below.  Choose Either Archived Appeals or
   Archived Protests, and click Search
