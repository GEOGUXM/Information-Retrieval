   [space15.gif] Welcome
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) embodies the potential to alleviate
   many of the interoperability problems associated with the sharing of
   documents and data. Realizing the potential requires cooperation not
   only within but also across organizations. Our purpose is to facilitate
   the efficient and effective use of XML through cooperative efforts
   among government agencies, including partnerships with commercial and
   industrial organizations. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
