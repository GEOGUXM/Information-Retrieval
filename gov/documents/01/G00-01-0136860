We invite you to explore some of the studies done on archaeological sites,
historic structures and ancient artifacts in California.

   Cultural resources include all surviving material evidence that sheds
   light on the history of mankind's use of the land, from the earliest
   occupation by Native Americans to recent historical activities.  In an
   individual State Park unit, such cultural resources might include the
   following: an archaeological site representing a Native American
   village occupied 4,000 years ago, an underwater ship wreck along the
   coast, a broken rice bowl discarded by a Chinese laborer, business
   records documenting the laborer's purchases at the local store, the
   building that housed a general store, or the entire landscape that
   encompasses all of the above remains.  The study of these resources has
   traditionally been divided into a series of disciplines that focus on
   particular time periods or types of  evidence. Select a theme at the
   left to review web pages that deal with some of these different
   disciplines.  Be aware that the lines between these areas of study are
   often hazy, and that many sites and projects deal with resources that
   fall into several of these classifications.
