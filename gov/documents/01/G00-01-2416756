   [new01.gif] There is an update to version 3.16. Download the executable
   file into the directory where CFAST/FAST is installed, and run the
   program. It is entitled updto317.exe. This patch applies three fixes to
   the software.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For those who want the most up-to-date version of the package, please
   use version 3.1.6. This is the version we recommend for most users. If
   you need compatibility with Hazard I, version 2.0.1 is appropriate. The
   most recent version of the model is 4.0.1 and includes advanced
   capability such as corridor flow and horizontal heat transfer. Please
   note that version 4 does not include a full featured data editor and
   the model cannot be run from within the data editor.

   Reference documents for FAST/CFAST (these require the Adobe Acrobat
   reader).

   Frequently Asked Questions has notes which explain specific algorithms.
   If you need information or help with features not covered here or in
   the Technical Reference or User's Guide, please send the request to

   We have an overview of the CFAST fire model, and an explanation of the
   naming convention (and version history) for the fire models and related
   products. This latter document describes the differences between FAST,
   FASTLite and CFAST.

   Hazard I, provides an overview of this implementation of fire modeling.
   How to get the software.
