   In the spirit of our forefathers, the men and women leading America
   are rising to a great challenge with courage, strength of character,
   and unity. As we look ahead, the need for principled and capable public
   service leadership has never been clearer. Attracting the best and
   brightest to public service and preparing current and future leaders to
   meet Americas challenges is the work of the Stennis Center. Our future
   depends upon it. We commit our energies and resources to this end as we
   join all Americans in the determination to maintain a strong and free
   nation for future generations.
