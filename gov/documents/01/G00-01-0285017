   Symposium Description

      The emergence of interactive digital television (DTV) brings about a
      host of exciting opportunities for broadcasters, content providers,
      tool developers, and equipment manufacturers. Interactive DTV combines
      aspects of traditional television and the Internet that inspires
      applications in e-commerce, targeted advertising, video-on-demand, and
      enhanced viewing services. An enabling technology for applying
      interactive DTV is being developed by the Advanced Television Systems
      Committee (ATSC) Digital TV Application Software Environment (DASE)
      specialist group. The emerging DASE standard and how it relates to DTV
   is the focus of this Symposium. Such a standard environment fosters the
   interoperability concept of write once, run anywhere applications. The
   DASE Symposium brings together the DTV industry players to promote
   commerce and provide an opportunity to learn about DASE technologies in
   a focused setting.
   Speakers include the DASE architects, broadcasters, equipment
   manufacturers and other top experts in the field. Attendees will gain
   first hand knowledge of the technologies driving this exciting market.
   The agenda provides ample opportunities to meet the leading industry
   players in both formal and informal settings. The Symposium features
   technical sessions focusing on the architecture, API, implementation,
   conformance, content, and use of DASE and related environments. Giving
   you the opportunity to pose your most pressing concerns to the foremost
   DTV technology experts. An evening reception that features exhibitors
   of the technologies presented at the conference allows you to meet the
   developers who are successfully applying and using interactive DTV. The
   aim of the symposium is to introduce the participants to the
   opportunities in interactive DTV that are on the horizon and provide
   them with the knowledge to enter and compete in this market.

Who Should Attend:

   Anyone who is a stakeholder in the emerging area of Interactive Digital
   TV. Especially in the fields of Consumer Electronics Manufacturing,
   Broadcasting, Content Production/Application Programming, Tool
   Development and the Computer Industry. Specific value is seen for
   technical and Management-level decision makers.

Why You Should Attend:

   - Gain first-hand knowledge of the DASE technology
   - Meet leading industry players
   - A chance to pose your most pressing concerns to foremost experts
   - Introduction to opportunities in interactive DTV
   - Meet developers who are successfully applying and using interactive
   DTV

                We look forward to seeing you June 19 and 20!
