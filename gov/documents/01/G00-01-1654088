   The Schedule SalesQuery (SSQ) enables you to easily access the sales
   reported by our Federal Supply Schedule contractors. The report
   generator allows you to quickly select a preformatted report for the
   information you need. To facilitate the process, the ten formats were
   developed based on historically requested data. Some of the reports
   will instruct you to selected either a Schedule number, a Fiscal Year,
   a Contract number, or a Company name. Unsure about the Schedule or
   contract number for your report?? The Schedules E-Library is a valuable
   source of information, so click over if you need extra facts before
   selecting the report format.

   Schedule Sales Query brings you the sales reported by contractors for
   specific report quarters during the current and past five fiscal years.
   The Federal Supply Service maintains official sales data by the fiscal
   year in which it is reported, however, not by the fiscal year of the
   reported quarter. For this reason, different values may be listed in
   some sources.
