   Introduction

    The properties of the strongly interacting particles can be calculated
   from the theory of quarks and gluons (quantum chromodynamics) using the
   approximations of lattice gauge theory. Recent calculations have
   provided determinations of such standard model parameters as quark
   masses and quark mixing (CKM) matrix elements from experiment that
   would have been otherwise impossible. The accuracies of such
   determinations are currently of order 20%, depending on the quantity.
   Future experiments will require over an order of magnitude greater
   accuracy. For example, the amplitudes for the oscillations of B mesons
   at Fermilab and SLAC will soon be known to a per cent or better. The
   corresponding lattice calculations must be done to comparable accuracy
   to make full use of the experiment.

   To help meet these challenges, Fermilab has constructed and operates a
   computational facility for lattice gauge theory on behalf of a large
   group of theorists throughout the US and the world. This effort forms
   one part of a national plan for the future development of lattice gauge
   theory formulated for the Department of Energy by the US lattice gauge
   theory community.
