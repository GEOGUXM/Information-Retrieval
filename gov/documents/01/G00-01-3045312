   Welcome to the SUMER application Web located at the Institut
   d'Astrophysique Spatiale (IAS).

   Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiations (SUMER) is
   designed for the investigations of plasma flow characteristics,
   turbulence and wave motions, plasma densities and temperatures,
   structures and events associated with solar magnetic activity in the
   chromosphere, the transition zone and the corona.

   The Instrumentation has been built under the leadership of K. Wilhelm
   from MPAE at Lindau (Germany). The IAS/SUMER team is taking charge of
   the SUMER in-flight operations and data management at EOF and/or at
   MEDOC

   SUMER is an experiment on-board the ESA/NASA spacecraft SOHO. SOHO was
   launched since 2 December 1995 and will be injected in a halo orbit
   around the L1 Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in March 1995 after a
   1,5000,000 km cruise.
