   OSEI Mission

   The Operational Significant Event Imagery team produces
   high-resolution, detailed imagery of significant environmental events
   which are visible in remotely-sensed data available at the NOAA Science
   Center in Suitland, Maryland.

   OSEI Daily Report

   Our Daily Operational Significant Event Imagery Report (DOSEIR)
   outlines the events we have captured in satellite imagery and provides
   a direct link to each image. The images are described with short
   narratives.

   This report is available Monday through Friday as an email via
   subscription or on this website in a remote window

   OSEI Features

   We occasionally create "Special Coverage" pages that follow
   particularly significant events and "Best of OSEI" pages which showcase
   some of our more striking imagery . Links to these and other features
   of our site are listed below.

     OSEI Special Coverage: Hurricane Mitch (1998)

     OSEI Special Coverage: Eruptions of Guagua Pichincha (1999)

   OSEI Team Members

   The Operational Significant Event Imagery team consists of scientists
   who produce the imagery you can view on this site. Members of NOAA's
   Satellite Analysis Branch monitor significant environmental events and
   notify us of their current or potential occurrence and of their
   severity and scope.
