                         Electronic Document Filing

    The New Cases Report has been modified to show the division code
    assigned to each case. This change was necessitated by the new case
    numbering scheme that went into effect January 1 (see below). On the
    Raw Report, the division code is at the end of each line. For the
    Formatted Report, it is between the Date Filed and Chapter columns.

    The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas
    has changed the way new bankruptcy cases are assigned their permanent
    case numbers. The new scheme was implemented on January 2, 2002. Case
    numbers on cases filed prior to 2002 remain unchanged.
