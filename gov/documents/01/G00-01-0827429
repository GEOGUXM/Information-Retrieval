 MISSION
 Mayor Williams is dedicated to the Clean City Initiative. Appointing me
 as the Clean City Coordinator for the city and keeping me at the
 cabinet level shows his commitment to a clean city. He intends to
 provide the operating agencies with the tools and equipment needed to
 keep this city clean and sustain its cleanliness. See Mission
 Statement.

 CLEAN CITY PHILOSOPHY
 "The world that we have made, as a result of the level of thinking we
 have done thus far, creates problems that we cannot solve at the same
 level as they were created."
 - Albert Einstein
 "Give a man a fish and he will be fed for a day. Teach a man to fish
 and he will be fed for a lifetime."
 - Proverb
 "It's the action, not the fruit of the action that's important. You
 have to do the right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in
 your time, that there'll be any fruit. But that doesn't mean you stop
 doing the right thing. You may never know what results come from your
 action. But if you do nothing, there will be no results."
 - Gandhi
