                                     P2 Conference

      The U.S. Department of Energy, Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos
      National Laboratory, and the Waste-management Education & Research
      Consortium worked together to provide the 1999 Pollution Prevention
      Conference...moving toward a pollution free DOE; an interactive,
      experiential conference that utilized networked computers, roundtable
      discussions, and other interactive events. The 1999 conference, held in
      Albuquerque, New Mexico, was a great success and we'd like to thank all
      who participated. P2 conference information and materials can be

   "I am committed to
   making the Department
   of Energy a leader
   in pollution-free,
   energy-efficient
   operations in the Federal
   Government. To become
   that leader, we must
   continually improve our
   facilities to maximize
   energy efficiency and
   must strive toward "zero"
   waste and emissions..."

   Full quote...
   Bill Richardson,
   Secretary of Energy
