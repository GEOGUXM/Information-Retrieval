   USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center
   The Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) research facility located in Columbia, Missouri.

   Clean water resources and habitat quality are essential for the health
   of all living organisms, a fundamental concept in the mission of CERC.
   The Center provides scientific information and data needed to address
   national and international environmental contaminant issues, and
   effects of habitat alterations on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.
   The Center has a unique capability for conducting multidisciplinary
   research that includes large river floodplains, coastal habitats,
   wetlands, streams, and lakes. Scientists at CERC form partnerships with
   national, state, and local agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and
   universities to enhance scientific information needed for management of
   the nationâ€™s resources.
