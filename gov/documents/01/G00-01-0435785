   The fundamental scientific paradigm guiding research in the Laboratory
   of Personality and Cognition is the analysis of individual differences.
   Few phenomena are more basic than the fact that human beings differ-in
   health, in rates of aging, in cognitive ability, in personality, in
   happiness, and in life satisfaction.

   The Laboratory of Personality and Cognition (1) Conducts basic and
   clinical research on individual differences in cognitive and
   personality processes and traits; (2) investigates the influence of age
   on these variables and their reciprocal influence on health, well-being
   and adaptation; and (3) employs longitudinal, experimental, and
   epidemiological methods in the analysis of psychological and
   psychosocial issues of aging, including health and illness, predictors
   of intellectual competence and decline, models of adult personality,
   and correlates of disease risk factors.
