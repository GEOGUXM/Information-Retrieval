                           Updated December 7, 2001


      ------ Landsat 7 is a U.S. satellite used to acquire remotely sensed
   images of the Earth's land surface and surrounding coastal regions.
   This site features Landsat 7 data characteristics, science and
   education applications, technical documentation, program policy, and
   history.  It is maintained by the Landsat 7 Project Science Office at
   the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.

   Ordering data: Data and browse images are distributed from the EROS
   Data Center of the U.S. Geological Survey. To order and/or view Landsat
