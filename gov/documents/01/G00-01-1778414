   Welcome to the Alaska Aviation Weather Unit (AAWU), located in
   Anchorage Alaska. We are co-located with the Anchorage National Weather
   Service Forecast Office and the Alaska River Forecast Center.

   The AAWU is responsible for issuing Area Forecasts (FA) as well as
   Airmet and Sigmet Bulletins for the entire State of Alaska and
   adjoining waters. The AAWU is also one of nine Volcanic Ash Advisory
   Centers worldwide and issues appropriate advisories when volcanic
   activity is detected in our area of responsibility.

   Our site includes most of our text and graphic products that we issue
   from our office. We also have links to other sites of interest to the
   aviation community in Alaska. Please use the sidebar at left to access
   our site.
