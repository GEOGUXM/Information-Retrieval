                           on Scientific Projects

     CRISP (Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects) is
     a searchable database of federally funded biomedical research
     projects conducted at universities, hospitals, and other research
     institutions. The database, maintained by the Office of Extramural
     Research at the National Institutes of Health, includes projects
     funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse
     and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA), Health Resources and Services
     Administration (HRSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers
     for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), Agency for Health Care
     Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Office of Assistant Secretary of
     Health (OASH). Users, including the public, can use the CRISP
     interface to search for scientific concepts, emerging trends and
     techniques, or identify specific projects and/or investigators.
