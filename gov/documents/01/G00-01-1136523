                                          The Chemical Technology Division (CMT) is one of the largest
   divisions at Argonne National Laboratory, a leading center for research
   and development related to energy and environmental issues.  Since its
   inception in 1948, the Division has pioneered in developing separations
   processes for the nuclear industry.  The current scope of activities
   includes R&D on methods for disposing of radioactive and hazardous
   wastes and on energy conversion processes with improved efficiencies,
   lower costs, and reduced environmental impact.  In addition, the
   Division operates the Analytical Chemistry Laboratory.

   CMT IN THE NEWS:
   The autothermal reforming catalyst developed and patented by CMT has
   won an R&D 100 Award for the year 2001. This catalyst forms the heart
   of a fuel processor that converts hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline,
   to hydrogen gas for fuel cells, which can power electric motors in a
   wide variety of applications, including cars and trucks. (Moreâ€¦)
