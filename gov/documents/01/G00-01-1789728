   Indian Health Service (IHS) pharmacists practice in a true
   pharmaceutical care environment where they fully utilize their
   knowledge and skills. IHS has pioneered many progressive and innovative
   advances over the past thirty years. Pharmacists have access to the
   patient's entire health record including laboratory results,
   immunization status, and past medical history to assess the
   appropriateness of drug therapy. Problems are resolved with providers
   prior to dispensing medications, and all patients are counseled on
   their medication therapy. In some locations, pharmacists are
   credentialed to provide primary care and use their prescriptive
   authority to evaluate and manage the care of certain patients.

   In the hospital setting, services provided include unit dose, IV
   admixtures, pharmacokinetic consultation, physician rounding, drug
   information and patient discharge medication counseling.

   The unique cultural experience of working with various Indian tribes as
   an integral part of the health care team provides a challenging
   experience that is unique to the Indian Health Service.
