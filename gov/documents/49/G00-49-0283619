     __________________________________________________________________

   1.    Purpose. This chapter outlines general policies and procedures
   for the operation and management of the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS)
   program. The VOS program is the National Weather Service's (NWS)
   primary source of marine weather data from coastal, offshore, and high
   seas areas, and from the Great Lakes.

   2.    General. The NWS program for acquisition of oceanic surface
   weather reports is based upon national needs and international
   agreements, and is an integral part of the World Meteorological
   Organization's (WMO) "World Weather Watch." Merchant ships that
   participate in the U.S.-managed portion of the VOS program are
   recruited by port meteorological officers (PMO), who spend the majority
   of their time visiting ships. NWS VOS program vessels are asked to take
   observations at standard synoptic times (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800
   Universal Time Coordinated) while at sea. Additional reports are
   requested at 3 hourly intervals within 300 miles of named tropical
   storms or hurricanes and 200 miles of the U.S. and Canadian coasts. The
   collection of marine reports from the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico,
   western North Atlantic, and eastern North Pacific Oceans is a
   coordinated effort between the NWS, U.S. Coast Guard, and commercial
   shore radio stations. The International Maritime Satellites (INMARSAT)
   are playing a growing role in the data collection. Dissemination of
   marine reports on national and international communication circuits is
   controlled by the communications facility at the National
   Meteorological Center, Camp Springs, Maryland. Great Lakes marine
   observations are dis6eminated by the Weather Service Forecast Offices
   at Cleveland, Ohio, and Ann Arbor, Michigan.

   3.    Program Administration. The NWS Headquarters sets policy and
   provides overall guidance for the VOS program. The various regional
   headquarters establish regional marine data requirements and provide
   administrative support and supervision of PMO activities.

   3.1    National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). The Office of
   Systems Operations (OSO), in coordination with the Office of
   Meteorology and regional headquarters, develops policy recommendations,
   funding plans, and operational instructions for maintenance of an
   effective VOS program. The Surface Observing Section (W/OSO141)
   operates and manages the overall Marine Observations Program. The
   Marine and Applied Services Branch (W/OM12) is responsible for
   maintaining high quality weather forecast and warning services for
   mariners. The International Telecommunications Section (W/OS0151) is
   responsible for the collection and dissemination of ship reports and
   NWS-generated service products. In addition, the Graphics and Display
   Section (W/OS0242) provides computerized monthly ship report statistics
   for effective management of the VOS program.

   3.2    Regional Headquarters. Four regions (Eastern, Southern, Central,
   and Western) have full time PMOs. Two regions (Alaska and Pacific) have
   part time PMOs. When necessary, any regional headquarters may designate
   other personnel to visit ships. Policy and guidance set forth by
   W/OS0141 are coordinated with the regions and passed to PMOs through
   regional marine focal points and station meteorologists in charge, as
   appropriate. The regions provide general administrative support to the
   PMOs.

   3.3    Marine Observations Program (MOP). The MOP in the OSO's
   Observing Systems Branch, W/OS0141, acts as the focal point for all
   PMO-related activities. The MOP will (1) maintain field records on all
   ships in the U.S.-managed VOS program, (2) prepare and distribute PMO
   weekly ship visitation activity reports, (3) supervise PMO accountable
   property responsibilities, (4) maintain VOS program observing
   handbooks, forms, and supplies, (5) manage the VOS program computer
   system, and (6) act to upgrade and improve the VOS program.

   3.4    Port Meteorological Office. PMOs are located in major U.S.
   seaports. They are responsible for (1) recruiting ships, (2) training
   ships ' officers in weather observing procedures and practices, (3)
   checking and calibrating shipboard instrumentation, (4) maintaining the
   quality of ships' observations, and (5) organizing and maintaining
   liaison with maritime interests. The PMOs are under the direction of
   their respective regional support units, which act in cooperation with
   WSH. NWS offices without designated PMOs should offer marine
   meteorological support services to vessels upon request.

   4.    Ship Selection and Recruitment. The vessels enrolled in the VOS
   program should allow for a broad distribution of observations over all
   oceanic regions. Priority is given to recruiting vessels which operate
   where the United States has forecast and warning responsibilities.
   Special emphasis should be placed on recruiting ships traversing
   data-sparse areas, off the main shipping routes. In any recruitment,
   the following points should be considered:

           a.    No ship should be recruited as U.S.-supervised if it is
   already in another nation's program. Ships of Japan, India, and other
   nations with active observing programs should be paid a courtesy visit
   and reminded of the U.S. high seas data requirements. Foreign flag
   vessels may be recruited into the U.S. VOS program if they are not
   participating in the programs of their own countries.

           b.    The ship recruited should be expected to call at a U.S.
   port accessible to a PMO at least every 6 months 50 that ob6erving
   equipment may be inspected and loaned equipment can be retrieved if the
   ship is decommissioned or transferred to another route.

           c.    In general, ships should not be recruited when there is
   little or no opportunity to meet the deck officers and discuss the
   quality and techniques of weather observing with them. Exceptions may
   be made where major U.S. shipping lines are concerned or when a visit
   to an interested vessel is not possible. In such cases, forms,
   observing instructions, and handbooks can be sent through the mail.

   4.1    Certification of Membership in VOS Program. A plaque will be
   issued to each ship that becomes a participant in the NWS VOS program
   (see exhibit B-30-1). It should be presented in person by the
   responsible PMO. If possible, a photograph of the presentation should
   be obtained for inclusion in the Mariners Weather Log.

   4.2    Ship Classification. Ships in the VOS program are classified in
   accordance with WMO International VOS definitions, i.e., SELECTED,
   SUPPLEMENTARY, OR AUXILIARY. A special classification for Great Lakes
   vessels is made to handle this special regional program. In addition,
   special classifications are used for other marine observing facilities
   not defined by the WMO program.

   4.2.1    Selected. A selected class ship is equipped with an NWS or
   shipping company-owned barograph, barometer, and psychrometer, all of
   high quality and accuracy. The ship sails routes where it can b visited
   by a U.S. PMO at least every 6 months. This ship class is expected to
   take and routinely transmit weather messages in the FM13-IX synoptic
   code format while at sea.
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

   4.2.2    Supplementary. A ship is classed as supplementary when it
   lacks a full complement of suitable observing equipment or it cannot be
   reached for routine visits. Supplementary ships also take observations
   in the FM13-IX synoptic code format.

   4.2.3    Auxiliary. A high seas ship, with at least a barometer and a
   thermometer of acceptable accuracy, which does not desire or cannot
   report routinely is considered an auxiliary class vessel. Auxiliary
   ships also use the FM13-IX synoptic code format.

   4.2.4    Great Lakes. This ship observing program consists of
   approximately 70 vessels, which started in 1991 to take and transmit
   sea level pressure readings. Great Lakes ships are also now using the
   same form as high seas vessels to report weather observations--WS Form
   B-81. A few Great Lakes ships without weather instrumentation send
   plain language reports using NOAA Form 72-5b, Marine Coastal Weather
   Log Ship Station. Two PMOs, located in Cleveland, Ohio, and Rosemont,
   Illinois, provide service to Great Lakes vessels.

   4.2.5    Local Moving Ships. Vessels without a radio officer but
   possessing the capability of reporting via single side band  voice
   through the U.S. Coast Guard are considered local moving ships. They
   generally take observations using NOAA Form 72-5b, Marine Coastal
   Weather Log Ship Station, but can also make voice reports in code
   FM13-IX.

   5.    Ship Visitations. This function requires the greatest amount of
   the PMO's time. Therefore, proper management of this activity is
   essential to the VOS. The PMOs must plan routine visits to (1) recruit
   new ships into the VOS program, (2) inspect meteorological equipment
   and provide observing instructions or hints to ships already in the
   VOS, (3) replace or make adjustments to previously installed NWS
   equipment, (4) instruct observers and provide necessary meteorological
   equipment to newly recruited ships, and (5) make courtesy calls on
   foreign supervised VOSs.

   5.1    Timing of Visitations. Ship visits should be planned for times
   when the greatest number of the weather observing personnel can be
   reached to discuss observing procedures and the use of NWS products.

   5.2    Purpose of Visitations. Ship visitations are made primarily to
   (1) expand the existing VOS program, (2) maintain the quality of the
   weather observation program aboard ships, (3) furnish observing and
   reporting instructions and supplies, and (4) inform ships' personnel
   about the availability and use of NWS broadcasts of forecasts and
   warnings.

   5.3    Visitation Routine. The routine during a visit to a ship varies,
   but generally all visitations should begin with a call on the captain
   or the captain's designated representative to explain the purpose of
   the visit (follow-up, new recruitment, or courtesy) and to request
   permission to carry out all the PMO designated functions.

   5.3.1    Instructions on Observation Techniques. The PMO should visit
   with as many shipboard observers as possible. During the first visit on
   a newly recruited ship, instructions from National Weather Service
   Observing Handbook No. 1, Marine Surface Weather Observations, should
   be reviewed with the observers. If observation records are aboard ship,
   the PMO should examine them for coding and logging errors, or
   omissions, and make tactful suggestions for correcting problems.

   5.3.2    Instrument Quality Checks. The PMO should check all the
   weather-observing equipment aboard ship during the visit. NWS VOS
   program ships have barometers corrected to read sea level pressure. To
   correct to sea level, the portable inspection barometer should be
   brought to the bridge and the bridge height determined. The height
   correction is found by multiplying the bridge height in feet by the
   correction factor, 0.037 milibars per foot (Exhibit B-30-2). The ship's
   barometer is then set to sea level pressure by adding the height
   correction to the inspection barometer reading. If the ship's barometer
   cannot be adjusted, a height correction (plus or minus) must be applied
   by the observer to achieve a sea level pressure reading. The correction
   should be entered on WS Form B-13, Barometer Correction Label, and
   posted on or near the barometer face. Several barometer comparisons
   should be made to figure the proper height correction. Some large
   vessels, such as bulk carriers, ride either fully loaded or empty
   without ballast. Two different corrections should be provided for these
   ships since large changes in draft can cause considerable pressure
   difference. To maintain accuracy, the ship inspection barometer should
   be checked each day by the PMO before and after ship visitations.

   Method of calculating the "HEIGHT CORRECTION" for any given height of
   barometer above ship's waterline:

   Height of ship's barometer above ship's waterline ---

   feet x 0.037 mb./ft                        =                  mb.
   feet x 0.0011 in.(Hg)/ft                 =                  in. (Hg)

               Exhibit B-30-2:    Barometer Height Correction

   Barographs should be checked for normal operation and adjusted sea
   level pressure. Thermometers should be cleaned and columns inspected
   for separations. If necessary, the psychrometer muslin should be
   replaced. All defective NWS equipment should be replaced.

   If the ship is equipped with an anemometer, the PMO should provide the
   ship with a wind plotting board and explain its use. PMO should
   evaluate the wind system exposure and discuss the qualities of the
   instrument with the deck officers. Officers; should be encouraged to
   have their anemometers checked by a qualified technician at least
   semiannually and calibrated if necessary.

   5.3.3    Explanation of Use of NWS Forecast Services. Discussion of
   radio facsimile broadcast schedules and products, as well as radio
   broadcasts of forecasts, synopses, warnings, and analyses, should be
   brought to the attention of the ship's officers. If necessary,
   shipboard personnel should be provided instructions on the
   interpretation and use of these NWS forecast products.

   5.3.4    Radio Officer Contacts. The PMO should contact the radio
   officer of each ship visited. Any difficulties the radio officer has
   had when forwarding or receiving weather information should be noted
   and forwarded to the MOP in OSO's Observing Systems Branch (W/OS014),
   for necessary action. The PMO should stress the NWS need for timely
   delivery of weather reports.

   5.3.5    Visitation Services to Foreign Ships. Ships recruited by
   foreign meteorological services or foreign ships not participating in
   any observing program should be visited by PMOs when time permits and
   visits can be arranged. The activities of the PMO on visits to such
   ships should be the same as they are when vessels in the U.S. VOS
   program are visited.

   5.3.6    Visitation Services to U.S. Government and Private Research
   Ships. Every effort should be made to encourage the cooperation of
   ships that sail under the following Government-sponsored programs:

           a.    U.S. Coast Guard

           b.    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

           c.    Ships engaged in Government-funded research

   Visitation services should be offered to all ships in the various
   categories listed above. Services to NOAA ships should be coordinated
   through National Ocean Service Marine Centers, National Marine Centers,
   and National Marine Fisheries Service Research Centers and
   Laboratories.

   6.    NWS Instruments Installed Aboard Ships. The NWS provides as a
   loan: (1) a barometer, barograph, and sling psychrometer to ships of
   the selected class; (2) a barometer and psychrometer to supplementary
   class ships; and (3) in special cases, a barometer and thermometer to
   coastal auxiliary class ships. The NWS has provided a limited number of
   wind systems to ships on the Great Lakes. The NWS also provides sea
   water thermometers to vessels reporting sea surface temperature. In
   many cases, shipboard instrumentation is a mix between shipping company
   and NWS-loaned equipment.

   7.    Observational Aids and Marine Publications Provided to Voluntary
   Observing Ships. Forms, aids, and publications provided VOS program
   vessels, depending on their observing program, include:

           a.    National Weather Service Observing Handbook No. 1, Marine
   Surface Weather Observations

   8.   Observation Procedures. Transmission. and Disposition of NWS Forms
   by Ships. All voluntary ships are requested to take weather
   observations on a routine basis while at sea. These observations are
   encoded according to WMO and U.S. requirements and transmitted to
   selected shore radio stations for relay to the NWS. Completed weather
   observation forms are sent to the servicing PMO, who performs a quality
   review of the coded data. The PMO then sends them to the National
   Climatic Data Center where they are archived on microfilm and used in a
   variety of investigations and studies.

   8.1    Observation Procedures Aboard Voluntary Observing Ships. All
   voluntary ships are requested to take and record four observations at
   intervals of 6 hours daily while at sea. Observations every 3 hours are
   requested from vessels operating within 200 miles of-the U.S.,
   Canadian, Hawaiian coasts or within 300 miles of named tropical storms
   or hurricanes. Special observations are made when specifically
   requested by a Weather Service office or the National Hurricane Center
   (reference WSOM chapter B-90) and when the ship encounters severe
   weather conditions, especially those not forecast. These conditions can
   include ice, strong winds, heavy seas, tropical storms, etc., in
   accordance with "International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea"
   instructions.

   8.2    Radio Reports from Voluntary Observing Ships. All high seas
   vessels taking synoptic observations using WS Form B-81 are requested
   to transcribe them onto WS Form B-80, Weather Report for Immediate
   Transmission, for submission to the radio officer. The radio officer
   transmits the observations according to instructions in the NWS
   publication "Radio Stations Accepting Ships' Weather and Oceanographic
   Reports." Observations recorded on NOAA Form 72-5b should also be
   transmitted according to instructions outlined in this publication.
   PMOs are encouraged to hold frequent discussions with radio officers so
   that communications problems can be discovered and corrective action
   taken with the parties involved.

   8.3    Disposition of Weather Records by Ships. Shipboard observers
   should be instructed to forward completed observation forms (NOAA Forms
   B-81 and 72-5b) and barograph sheets (WS Form 455-12) to their
   servicing PMO.

   A supply of self-addressed envelopes should be furnished to ships for
   mailing the forms. Requests for additional forms, supplies, and
   services should be noted by the supervising PMO and handled as
   expeditiously as possible.

   8.4    Disposition of Weather Transmission Forms (WS Form B-80) by
   Ships. Ships should handle completed radio message forms according to
   ship policy. Although the NWS has no specific requirement for these
   forms, when made available, PMOs should check them for conformity to
   code format and transmission guidelines.

   9.    PMO Liaison Activities. Next in priority to ship visitations, the
   PMOs are responsible for maintaining close liaison with shipping
   company officials, the U.S. Coast Guard, shore radio stations, and
   other marine-oriented organizations. Through these contacts the PMOs
   can gain support for the VOS program and determine the local marine
   communities' requirements for weather services. Important unfulfilled
   requirements discovered by these contacts should be brought to the
   attention of regional personnel and the Marine Observation Program
   Leader (MOPL) for necessary action.

   9.1    Marine Weather Training by PMOs. Insofar as possible, the PMOs
   are encouraged to provide training in weather observing techniques for
   shipboard weather observers. The main purpose of the training is to
   provide the ship's officers with practical assistance in observing
   techniques and uses of the meteorological services available to
   shipping. Basic meteorology necessary for weather map analysis and
   interpretation can be included in the training, if requested.
   Suggestions for training topics are available from WSH (W/OSO141).

   9.2    Merchant Marine Schools. Since the majority of cadets at
   merchant marine academies will eventually serve aboard ships
   participating in the VOS, the NWS should provide them with
   meteorological assistance. When requested by the school administration,
   NWS forms, publications, guidance, and instruction will be provided if
   available and as resources permit.

   10.    Familiarization Trips. PMOs are required to maintain skills and
   expertise in meteorological observations and to be well informed
   concerning all marine meteorological services available to shipping.
   This requirement cannot be met by ship visitation and liaison alone. To
   fully understand the mariners and their problems with regard to the
   VOS, all PMOs should sail aboard a cooperating merchant vessel at least
   once every 2 years. Arrangements for such voyages should be approved by
   the regions, the MOPL, and with the cooperating shipping companies.

   10.1    Duties While on Familiarization Trips. During a familiarization
   trip, the PMO should assist deck officers in taking, encoding, and
   transmitting synoptic observations; discuss the weather broadcast
   schedules with the radio operator; and suggest that pertinent marine
   weather bulletins be copied. Using appropriate bulletins, the PMO
   should demonstrate plotting, drawing, and analysis of surface charts
   and assist ships' personnel with any questions they may have. In
   addition, the broadcast analysis and forecasts should be checked for
   accuracy and consistency. A complete transcript of any problems or
   discrepancies with these products should be prepared. Dates and times
   of all observations transmitted and shore radio stations that
   acknowledge receipt of the messages should be noted. This information,
   as well as other pertinent facts, should be included in a trip report
   completed at the end of each voyage and sent to the MOPL (W/OS0141),
   and the appropriate regional units.

   11.    Awards for Voluntary Observing Ships. In order to provide
   suitable recognition of long or especially effective service rendered
   by participants in the VOS program, special awards may be granted.
   Awards are provided to ships, shipping companies, and to individuals in
   the maritime community. Arrangements for presentation of awards will be
   made through the MOPL (W/OS0141) and the PMO's appropriate regional
   supervisor. Where feasible, presentation should be made before a local,
   civic, or management group. The presentation ceremony should be
   adequately publicized. Newspaper clippings, pictures, and other
   pertinent items should be sent to W/OS0141 for distribution to NOAA
   Public Affairs units and the Mariners Weather Log editor.

   1.    Introduction. This appendix outlines procedures to be followed by
   Port Meteorological Officers (PMO) for documenting information about
   ships in the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) program. The information is
   used to:
   Keep vessel distribution lists and mailing addresses up to date.
       Maintain records of shipboard observing equipment and radio
       facilities.
       Provide data on VOS to other Government agencies and the World
       Meteorological Organization.
       Monitor PMO ship visitation activities and prepare PMO performance
       reports.

   Uniform procedures to document PMO ship visitation activities are
   necessary to assure an efficiently managed VOS. PMOs are required to
   fill out two forms as follows:
   Ship Visitation, WS Form, B-22A, for each ship visited to record what
       the PMO has done during the visit.
       Ship Record Card, WS Form B-31, whenever a ship is recruited or to
       document changes to a vessel's mailing address, observing
       equipment, or sailing data.

   Information from WS Form B-22A and WS Form B-31 are entered by the PMOs
   into the VOS program computer system daily. Details for preparing these
   forms appear below. See the booklet "VOS Program Computer Information
   and Data Management System" for information on using the VOS computer
   system.

   2.   Ship Visitation Card. WS Form B-22A. This form is used for
   documenting PMO ship visits. All PMOs will prepare a WS Form B-22A for
   every ship visited. In addition, other PMO activities, such as visits
   to coastal radio stations, marine reporting stations, boat shows, etc.,
   should be documented on this form. Information from the WS Form B-22A
   is entered into the time-share emptor system by the PMO according to
   the procedures outlined in the booklet "Instructions for the Computer
   Information and Data Management System."

   Instructions for making entries on WS Form B-22A (gee exhibit B-30-Al)
   are as follows:

                                   SIDE 1

       DATE - Date of the ship visit

       PORT OFFICE - Name of the PMO performing the ship visit, i.e.,
   Miami, Cleveland, etc.

       CALL - Radio call sign of ship

       FLAG - Vessel's nation of registry (from exhibit B-30-A4)

       PROGRAM - Circle the letter representing ship program:

               P - Ship in National Weather Service (NWS) program
               R - Newly recruited ship
               F - Foreign supervised
               U - Ship not interested or not operating in area of
   interest
               C - Candidate for VOS program membership

       SHIP NAME - Name of ship visited

       BAROMETER NUMBER - Only record numbers for NWS instruments

       COR - Barometer correction (mbs), posted on the instrument, to
   obtain a sea level pressure reading

       RESET - Barometer adjustment (mbs, normally with screwdriver), to
   obtain a sea level pressure reading

       BAROGRAPH NUMBER - Only record numbers for NWS instruments

       OTHER INSTRUMENTS - Identify other NWS-accountable instruments
   onboard the ship

   Space is allowed for "comparison of barometers" computations, for
   indicating which observing forms were supplied to the ship, and for
   noting the location of the ships barometer.

                                   SIDE 2

       VESSEL EVALUATION -    Base your evaluations on the quality and
   completeness of the
                                                     observations and on
   how closely the vessel follows the synoptic
                                                     weather reporting
   schedule.

       OFFICERS' NAMES -        To assist in remembering shipboard
   contacts for future use.

   3.   Weekly Marine Report. W/OSO14 prepares a weekly consolidated
   function report showing ship visits made by all PMOs. The report
   indicates which ships are new program recruits. All computer entries
   for ship visits are maintained indefinitely. Copies of the Weekly
   Marine Report will be provided to all PMOs, regional administrative
   units, WSH, and, on request, to other interested parties.

   4.   Ship Record Card. WS Form B-31. Documentation of the VOS program
   is accomplished with the Ship Record Card, WS Form B-31 (see exhibit
   B-30-A2). PMOs enter information from the Ship Record Card into the
   appropriate computer file. WS Form B-31 is used to (1) document newly
   recruited ships, (2) record subsequent changes in a ships program, (3)
   change ship owner or agent address information, and (4) add
   foreign-supervised ships to Government publication distribution lists.
   Code entries for data fields on WS Form B-31 are shown in exhibit
   B-30-A3. Examples of completed WS Form B-31 are shown in exhibit
   B-30-A2.

   After entering the data from WS Form B-31 into the computer, W/OSO14
   will check the transactions and initiate any action necessary to
   correct errors.

   PMOs will be provided copies of information contained in the VOS
   computer files at regular intervals. The PMO should check vessel
   mailing addresses, and equipment inventories against computer records
   during each ship visitation. Corrections to computer files are made by
   the PMO using methods described in the booklet "Instructions for the
   Computer Information and Data Management System."

   There are certain actions that must be completed when preparing WS Form
   B-31 and when performing computer entries. They are:
   A ship's call sign is required for all entries.
       When an entry in any field is not appropriate or would be "no" or
       "none," the data field should be left blank.
       Effective date should be entered on all WS B-31 forms.

   5.   VOS Computer Products. W/OS014 prepares and distributes computer
   printouts and mailing labels generated from information in the VOS
   time-share computer system.

   These computer printouts include, but are not limited to:
   Ships - Alphabetical by ship name.
       Ships - Alphabetical by ship call.
       Alphabetical list of ships agents.
       Numerical list of ships agents.
       Ships - Alphabetical by ship name with agent name and address.
       List of ships by supervising PMO.
       Ship observation statistics based on observations relayed through
       continental U.S. radio stations.
       Mailing labels for Mariners Weather Log, and other mass
       distributions to ships.
