   Volunteer as a Clean City Rater
   To volunteer as a Clean City Rater, send an email to Vincent Spaulding,
   Clean City Coordinator, at vincent.spaulding@dc.gov. Include your name,
   address, phone number(s), email address, and state when you would be
   available. You must be a District resident to participate.
   Ratings are done quarterly. The process consists of rating the level of
   cleanliness of the major corridors/interstate highways, high visibility
   communities, residential streets & alleys and industrial areas within
   the Wards on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being the best rating. Each of
   the four-person rating teams consists of a representative from the
   office of the Councilmember whose Ward is being assessed, two community
   representatives, and a participant from the Street and Alley Cleaning
   Division of DPW.
   The outcome of the ratings are plotted on GIS maps. The clean city
   ratings are provided to the City Administrator, DPW, City Council and
   the Neighborhood Services Director for their information and use. The
   clean city ratings and GIS maps also are posted on the clean city
   website.
   Read more about the rating methodology.
