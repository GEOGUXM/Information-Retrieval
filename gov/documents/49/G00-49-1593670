 AiroCide Ti02 Hardware KES Science & Technology, Inc., a company which
 uses the ethylene removal technology that was originally developed for
 commercial plant growth flight hardware, has developed a potentially
 life-saving device that has been proven to kill anthrax spores.

 AiroCide TiO2 is a revolutionary new device that kills 93.3% of
 airborne pathogens that pass through it. It was developed from
 already-existing technology that is used to remove ethylene gas and
 airborne pathogens from the air. This patented technology was first
 developed for use in Astroculture Â™, a plant growth chamber for
 commerical experiments on the Shuttle. This technology was jointly
 developed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin
 Center for Space Automation and Robotics (WCSAR), a NASA Commercial
 Space Center. As a result of a partnership between KES Science &
 Technology, Inc. and the University a Wisconsin several years ago, the
 Bio-KES unit -- the precursor to AiroCide TiO2 -- was developed. KES
 Science & Technology, Inc. purchased the commercial rights from the
 University of Wisconsin, and began selling this product as Bio-KES in
 1998. Bio-KES is used by the produce industry to aid in preserving
 perishables.

 After the September 11 attacks, a KES employee asked the question, "If
 Bio-KES already removes some airborne pathogens from the air with its
 Titanium Dioxide-formula catalyst material and UV bulbs, could it be
 modified to remove pathogens from the air at a higher rate? And if so,
 could it help in the fight against airborne anthrax spores?"

 Internal view of AiroCide Ti02 unit The answer was yes. A Bio-KES unit
 was modified to include 52 germicidal UV bulbs, instead of its usual 6
 germicidals and 48 UV black lights (along with a few other changes.)
 After testing a new unit, called AiroCide TiO2, in a laboratory, Dr.
 Dean Tompkins, one of the original developers of the TiO2 technology,
 determined that AiroCide TiO2would kill 93.3% of Bacillus thurengiensis
 that went through the unit on the first pass. (Bacillus thurengiensis
 is a close cousin to Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax), which has most of
 the same properties as anthrax but is not pathogenic.)

 After extensive measures were taken to cleanse Senator Daschle's office
 and normal workday activities resumed, more Anthrax spores were found
 to have re-contaminated the air. In a situation like this in the
 future, the AiroCide TiO2 unit may help because it filters the air
 24-hours a day killing all harmful air-borne bacteria that might be
 reintroduced into the air supply.

 One AiroCide TiO2unit can clean 15,000 cubic feet of air in 24 hours,
 ridding that area of 93.3% of the pathogens in the air. It is currently
 the best available method of stopping cross-contamination. The most
 effective applications for AiroCide TiO2 units are in mail rooms,
 conference rooms, kitchens and general meeting areas. Since AiroCide
 TiO2 kills many common bacteria and viruses like Influenza A, E. coli,
 Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitis, Staphylcoccus aureus and
 more, it is also a good way to cut down on "Sick Building Syndrome," an
 affliction from which many office buildings suffer.
