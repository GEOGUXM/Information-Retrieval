     The Distributed-Parallel Storage System (DPSS) is a scalable,
     high-performance, distributed-parallel data storage system orginally
     developed as part of the DARPA -funded MAGIC Testbed, with
     additional support from the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Energy Research
     Division, Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences
     Office.

     The DPSS is a data block server, which provides high-performance
     data handling and architecture for building high-performance storage
     systems from low-cost commodity hardware components. This technology
     has been quite successful in providing an economical,
     high-performance, widely distributed, and highly scalable
     architecture for caching large amounts of data that can potentially
     be used by many different users.

     Current performance results are 980 Mbps across a LAN and 570 Mbps
     across a WAN.

 DPSS Integration:

                  We are currently working on integrating the DPSS into serveral
                      computational grid-like tools.
                      These include the following:

                    * Globus
                    * SRB (Storage Resource Broker)
       _______________________________________________________________

DPSS Applications

     * A Medical Imaging application using the DPSS and ImgLib
     * Terravision: The terrain navigation program that was the initial
       target application for the DPSS.
     * DIV : A large image viewing application from the EROS Data Center.
     * A High Energy Physics data processing application.
     * Most of these applications are examples of the Wide Area Large Data
       Object architecture (WALDO) that we have been developing.
