   Remote sensing is the science and art of obtaining information about an
   object, area, or phenomenon via analysis of data acquired by a device
   that is not in contact with the target of investigation. ARS is
   conducting research on remote sensing technologies of benefit to
   agriculture, forestry, environmental quality and global climate change
   concerns. The research includes topics of interest to a wide range of
   managers, from individual producers, agribusinesses, and regional
   planners to strategic decision makers at the national and international
   levels. Some examples are presented here.
