Engines/Emissions

   Argonne's mission in this area is to develop advanced technologies that
   will improve the fuel economy and other performance parameters of
   reciprocating engines while reducing harmful exhaust emissions. All our
   projects involve applied research and are aimed at commercialization by
   vehicle and engine manufacturers within 5 to 10 years. Because most of
   the "easy solutions" in internal combustion engines have already been
   exploited, we emphasize "out-of-the-box" thinking in developing
   innovative solutions. Our engineers work closely with both industrial
   companies and leading universities.

   Argonne's experimental investigations of engines span a wide range of
   applications, including automobiles, trucks, and locomotives. New
   world-class research facilities have been built for both light- and
   heavy-duty engine research. Our accomplishments have been recognized
   with an R&D 100 award (1999) for simultaneous reduction of nitrogen
   oxides (NOx) and particulate emissions from diesel engines, three
   Argonne Pacesetter awards, and five patents for novel emissions control
   technologies.

Research Areas

     [bullet.gif] Diesel Locomotive Engine Research: Electromotive
     Division (EMD) of General Motors Corporation (GM) has invested an
     estimated $6.5 million to set up a world-class locomotive engine
     facility at Argonne for all of its advanced performance and
     emissions research. This is one of the largest private-sector-funded
     projects at Argonne, perhaps at any U.S. Department of Energy
     laboratory, in the field of transportation research. A second
     research engine, EMD's current production locomotive diesel known as
     the "710 Engine,"is being installed.

     [bullet.gif] "Chemical Filter" Cleans Up Diesels: Argonne staff
     demonstrated, for the first time, simultaneous reduction of NOx and
     particulate emissions in a locomotive diesel engine by the use of
     oxygen-enriched combustion air. This breakthrough technology was
     recognized by R&D 100 (1999) and Argonne Pacesetter awards.
     * Variable Oxygen- or Nitrogen-Enriched Air System for Engines
     * Reducing Diesel Soot by Using Late-Cycle Oxygen Enrichment
     * Reducing NOx in Engine Exhaust by Using Monatomic Nitrogen

     [bullet.gif] Fuel Spray Research Using the Advanced Photon Source:
     We have opened up a new area in fuel spray research: use of x-rays
     from the APS to obtain quantitative data with unprecedented time and
     space resolution in diesel and gasoline sprays. With cooperation and
     support from the world's leading fuel system manufacturers, such as
     Robert Bosch, Delphi, and Outboard Marine, we have obtained the
     first-ever quantitative fuel spray data in optically dense regimes
     that cannot be studied with lasers. Spray data close to the injector
     nozzle can now also be obtained.
     * "X-Ray Vision": Taking a Hard Look at Fuel Sprays and Combustion

     [bullet.gif] Heavy-Duty Truck Engine Research: Under a CRADA with
     Caterpillar, we are conducting research on the concept of late-cycle
     injection of air or oxygen-enriched air. Computational fluid
     dynamics studies have been completed, and experimental work is
     starting with the engine supplied by Caterpillar.

     [bullet.gif] Compression-Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) Engine
     Research: We are focusing on fuel injection systems and controls and
     in-cylinder engine research. A new motoring dynamometer facility and
     a complete particulate emissions laboratory have been built. These
     capabilities are critical for measuring transient, real-time data
     from engines. In close cooperation with Bosch and Delphi, the
     world's two leading manufacturers of fuel-injection systems, we plan
     to evaluate advanced fuel system concepts in this test cell.

     [bullet.gif] Laser-Induced Incandescence Technique for Measuring
     Exhaust Particulates: This technique has the potential to measure
     real time transient particulate emissions. The facility, for
     laboratory use, has been completed with DOE funding. A portable
     model is being designed and built with LDRD funds. This technique
     has attracted the attention of Sierra and TSI Inc., two leading
     particulate instruments manufacturers, as well as Caterpillar.

     [bullet.gif] Revealing the True Nature of Diesel Particulates:
     Argonne researchers created a special thermophoretic sampling device
     to gain a better understanding of the nature of diesel particulates.

     [bullet.gif] Using Advanced Materials to Improve Engine Performance:
     The Mercury Marine Division of Brunswick and Argonne are working
     together under a CRADA to discover ways to solve the materials
     problems related to more efficient engines. One possibility is the
     use of advanced ceramic materials to fabricate pistons and rings.
