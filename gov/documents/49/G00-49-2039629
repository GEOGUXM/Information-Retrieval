   HOW CAN I HELP? > Military Academy Applications

   Each year I have the privilege of nominating a select group of high
   school seniors for admission into one of the United States Service
   Academies representing the US Army, the US Airforce, the US Navy, the
   US Marines, the US Merchant Marines, and the US Coast Guard. The
   nomination process begins the spring of your Junior year in High School
   by submitting a request for nomination to my office.

   You should take the opportunity to review the schedule and requirements
   for nomination located on this web page. If you have any questions,
   please feel free to contact my Academy Coordinator at 1-800 205-6446,
   or simply 1-800-205-OHIO.

   Please also take a minute to visit the web sites of our United States
   Service Academies.
