   Surface Winds Product Description
   The ocean surface wind products appear similar, but each product has
   unique characteristics dependent on sensor characteristics and wind
   derivation methods.
   Colors are used to indicate wind speed.

   The products (ERS-2, QuikSCAT) that yield a velocity (wind speed and
   direction) use color as well as wind-barb notation. SSM/I products show
   only wind speed.
