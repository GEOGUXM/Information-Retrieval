   OUR MISSION-OUR BUSINESS
   _________________________

   The Princeton Group (PG), in partnership with our sponsors, customers,
   and support organizations, represents the Department of Energy (DOE) at
   the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and contributes to the
   achievements of Departmental scientific, technical, and institutional
   goals and objectives at the Laboratory.

   We accomplish this by administering the performance-based contract with
   Princeton University, facilitating transactions, serving as the
   custodian of publicly owned assets at PPPL, and helping to ensure the
   protection of workers, the public and the environment.

   Through our presence on site, the Princeton Group plays a stewardship
   role on behalf of the Department and the American taxpayer.  PG
   effectively partners with PPPL to develop and execute plans and
   programs which are results oriented, cost effective, and responsive to
   the specific needs of the Department, the Laboratory, other members of
   the fusion research community, our customers and partners.
   ___________

   others which will further enable PPPL to reach its full potential as a
