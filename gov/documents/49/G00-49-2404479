   UTAH GRAND JURY SCHEDULE
   2000-2003

   A panel of judges selected from throughout the state will hold hearings
   in each judicial district every three years to determine if a grand
   jury needs to be summoned based upon criminal activity. The attorney
   general, a county attorney, or special prosecutor appointed under
   U.C.A. 77-10a-1 can also present evidence to the panel of judges based
   upon criminal activity to summon a grand jury. The panel of judges will
   hear in secret all persons claiming information justifying the calling
   of a grand jury. All persons appearing shall be placed under oath and
   shall be examined by the panel of judges.
   The purpose of the hearing is for the judges to receive testimony to
   determine if reasonable cause exists for calling a grand jury. Persons
   appearing to testify claiming information justifying the calling of a
   grand jury should be prepared to give evidence in support of such
   claims. In this regard, persons considering appearing to testify should
   bear in mind that is is not the purpose of the hearing to hear and
   consider controversies between individual parties.
