   Members of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Magnetometer and Electron
   Reflectometer (MAG/ER) Science Team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight
   Center (GSFC) spend about 8 weeks each quarter at Samuel Ogle
   Elementary School in Prince Georges County, Maryland as guest
   instuctors with Ms. Sadeghin's Mars class. Each quarter, Ms. Sadeghin
   and her students have been able to visit GSFC for a day, meet with the
   staff, and take a tour of the center.
