   Oct. 24, 1998, Deep Space 1 is the first mission under NASA's New
   Millennium Program, which features flight testing of new technology,
   rather than science, as its main focus. These new technologies will
   make spacecraft of the future smaller, cheaper, more reliable and more
   independent of human control. By summer, engineers expect to have fin-
   ished testing all 12 advanced technologies aboard the spacecraft.
   Testing of two technologies that make Deep Space 1 less reliant on
