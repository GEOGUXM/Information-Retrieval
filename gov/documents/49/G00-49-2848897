   Background top

   The Design for X mission is the first mission to the outermost planet
   in our solar system. It will include flybys of Pluto and it's moon
   Charon, with two small, lightweight spacecraft. The launch of the
   spacecraft is planned for early next decade with encounter around 2010.

   Description top

   Automated Planning/Scheduling for Science Planning
   One application of the ASPEN planning and scheduling system is in
   support of the Pluto Express (PX) project for science planning. In this
   effort, we are developing high level models of proposed PX spacecraft
   to assist in automated generation of science data acquisition plans
   (e.g., high level activity sequences) from high level science goals to
   assist in developing science plans for mission profiling.

   Automated Planning/Scheduling for Design Analysis
   In a spin-off application of planning and scheduling technology, this
   same capability to generate science (and engineering) plans is being
   used to evaluate candidate spacecraft designs from the standpoint of
   emergent design aspects such as science return and operability. This
   spin-off arises from the observation that often it is difficult to
   determine how well a given spacecraft design will perform without
   fleshing out approximate operations sequences for critical phases of
   the mission (e.g., encounter). In order to address this difficulty, we
   are developing a design analysis tool which accepts as input: a
   candidate spacecraft design (and operations constraints, models, etc.);
   a set of engineering and science objectives; and a set of scoring
   functions to assess how well a sequence achieves the objectives. This
   tool then uses planning and scheduling technology to generate a
   candidate sequence; then uses the scoring function to score this
   sequence in terms of the aspects of science, operability, etc. The end
   result is that the design team gets quantitative feedback on how well
   the design achieves science objectives and meets operability
   constraints (such as meeting power margins, etc.). This type of tool is
   targeted at enabling design teams to rapidly and impartially evaluate
   large numbers of spacecraft designs with little effort, thus allowing
   improved analysis of design tradeoffs to enhance science and operations
   concerns for future missions.
