Take the Time to be Safe. . .

   Winter looks like it's finally arriving in Northern California, at
   least. That means that roads are slick, visibility is reduced, and
   people are in more of a hurry to go places and do things than they
   would in the languid days of summer (our other season out here). The
   news has been full lately of very serious traffic accidents on area
   freeways. Unfortunately, the same thing happens on railroads too. The
   same conditions, coupled with the preconception that "trains never use
   THESE tracks" have lead to many serious injuries -- even death to both
   pedestrian and vehicular trespassers. This Press Release from the
   Federal Railroad Administration should give us pause at any time.

Seniors and Youth Groups from Los Angeles, visit Allensworth

   Allensworth, established a century ago as a community by and for former
   black slaves and their descendents, was successful until World War II.
   Now, part of it has been preserved as a State Park. On the west side of
   the San Joaquin Valley, it hasn't always been easy to find. Now Amtrak
   California's San Joaquin trains will stop for groups. A special tour
   and group fare is now available

Grand Canyon Tours . . . Update

   You may not be aware that Nava-Hopi Tours has gone out of business.
   Even if you have, this information from the Arizona Republic
   (newspaper) will help you with travel plans to Grand Canyon.
"Bus tour veteran steps up to fill gap left by Nava-Hopi Tours"
Arizona Republic, 03-Nov-01.

A shuttle company's sudden shutdown became an opportunity for
one of its employees... Bruce Shepard, a 15-year veteran of the
transportation industry and the charter manager for now-closed Nava-Hopi Bus Tou
rs...
[has] opened Northern Arizona Shuttle and Tours Inc... David Maurer,
president of the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce, said Shepard is only
one of many who are offering to fill the gap left by Nava-Hopi. The chamber
and the Flagstaff Convention and Visitors Bureau also are working to
find a company that could contract with Amtrak to provide a tour package to
the Grand Canyon with a stop in Flagstaff, a service Nava-Hopi provided.
Part of the concern is to keep the Flagstaff Amtrak stop alive since there
is a competing one in Williams."

We get Letters about Los Angeles International Airport...

   Amtrak guests often write this website asking about getting between Los

   car. It isn't hard to do, but until now it hasn't been easy to find out
   how to do it. Now, go to Amtrak California's LAX station site.

   This website has been prepared by the California Department of
   Transportation's Division of Rail to provide information about the
   cooperative rail passenger program operated by Amtrak and funded by the
   Federal Government and the State of California, through the Department
   of Transportation, (Caltrans).

   About the only thing you will NOT find here about Amtrak service in
   California is information about train schedules, fares and
   accommodation charges for travel between specific city pairs. It is
   beyond the scope of this website to provide this information, which
   changes frequently by time of year, class of service, and availability
   of seats. Go to an Amtrak ticket agent, travel agent, call
   1-800-USA-RAIL (1-800-872-7245) or visit Amtrak's web site:
