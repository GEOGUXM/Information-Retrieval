   Picture of CAMI Library The CAMI Library is a special library primarily
   committed to serving the unique information needs of the research staff
   at the Institute. Although the primary focus of the collection is on
   aviation medicine, materials on human factors, engineering, management
   , and general reference are available.
   The library participates in two automated interlibrary loan networks,
   the Online Computer Library Center and Docline (National Library of
   Medicine), allowing access to many of the participating libraries in
   the two networks. The library, located at the Mike Monroney
   Aeronautical Center, is open to the public.
