   Field Campaigns & Ground Validation


                 Lightning Campaigns | Detection Instruments

   Over the past two decades, the GHCC Lightning Team has been involved in
   numerous field campaigns around the globe. By measuring the the
   electrical properties of thunderstorms, members of the GHCC Lightning
   Team have helped advance the field of Atmospheric Electricity while
   providing insight into key elements of the global hydrological cycle.

   During the early and mid 1980s, many of the field measurements recorded
   by the GHCC Lightning Team were used to verify that optical signals
   produced during a lightning discharge are powerful enough to be viewed
   from space. These measurements led to the design and deployment of the
   Optical Transient Detector and the Lightning Imaging Sensor. From the
   late 1980s, many instruments have been used to provided airborne and
   ground based measurements of lightning activity to support field
   campaigns which were designed to investigate storm convection and
   precipitation in various climatological regimes. In the future, our
   involvement in field programs will include the validation of the data
   obtained by the space based lightning detection instruments, such as
   OTD and LIS.
