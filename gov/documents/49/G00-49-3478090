   MARYLAND 20910    Letter 4-83

   Date of Issue:     February 7, 1983            Effective Date February
   7, 1983

   In Reply Refer To: W/OM13x1                File With: D-24

   Subject:     Wind and Temperature Aloft Forecast Amendment
   Responsibility

   Reference(s): WSOM Chapter D-24, Transmittal Issuance 81-18, dated
   November 4, 1981.

   This OML deletes sections 2.3 and 8.1 of the reference chapter. In lieu
   of these sections the following responsibilities are assigned:

   Wind and Temperature Aloft amendments will be issued, in accordance
   with the instructions and criteria detailed in the reference chapter,
   for the nine former Area Forecast areas shown in the attachment. Each
   area has an associated WSFO which will continue to be responsible for
   issuing amendments to the Winds Aloft and Temperature forecasts within
   its associated area.

   Each issuing office will have the AFOS keys for their amendment
   responsibility locations stored with the "national bits" set. This will
   enable the issuing offices to transmit the amendments under their own
   node identifiers and for all other offices storing the NMC products to
   also store the WSFO issued amendments.

   Issuing offices will assume the retention responsibilities described in
   WSOM Chapters D-24 and D-90.

   It is expected that this amendment responsibility will continue until
   the NMC begins making LFM model outputs available four times a day.
   Once this occurs the requirement for amending these forecasts-will
   cease.
