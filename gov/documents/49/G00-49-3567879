       Plasma and Radio Wave Imaging Survey of the Earth's Magnetosphere
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Earth's magnetosphere supports a rich variety of plasma waves and
   wave-particle processes. Over three decades of insitu observations have
   provided us with a generalized picture (see Shawhan, 1978 for a review)
   of the location within the magnetosphere of plasma waves. This
   generalized picture of the types and distribution of plasma waves has
   guided our thinking of the physical processes of plasma and energy
   transport in the magnetosphere.

   The purpose of these Web pages is, for the first time, to provide a
   global view or "image" of the Earth's magnetosphere in plasma waves.
   Work is underway to develop statistical samplings of wave spectral
   power flux as a function of frequency and position, based on a variety
   of orbiting spacecraft. As you will see, the availability of these
   images will change the way you think about wave-particle processes
   throughout much of the magnetosphere.

   Plasma wave data archived at the National Space Science Data Center
   (courtesy of Dr. D. A. Gurnett, University of Iowa) have been use to
   form images of the distribution of wave spectral power in the
   magnetosphere. Only measurements of wave intensity from the
   noon-midnight meridian plane (within +/- 1 Re of the y=0 plane), in
   magnetic coordinates, have been included in the present survey. For
   DE-1 the measurements in the equatorial plane (within +/- 1 Re of the
   z=0 plane) are also include.

  Dynamics Explorer - Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI) Images

   Three years of Dynamics Explorer (DE) plasma wave data from the PWI
   experiment have been combined into a wave image map of the Earths
   magnetosphere. The bin sample distribution illustrates the size of the
   data base used in the analysis. The data are displayed in four panels:
   two electric field (E) and two magnetic search coil (M) measurements in
   two frequencies.

   The data are plotted with an additional notations of important cutoff
   or resonance frequencies. These are:
     * White - selected dipole field lines
     * Red - electron cyclotron at center frequency of plotted band
     * Blue/Green -geometric mean of electron and proton cyclotron
       frequency (LHR).
     * Blue - proton cyclotron frequency

     * 1.78 Hz - E & M
     * 3.12 Hz - E & M

  Hawkeye VLF Experiment Images

   Four years of the Hawkeye plasma wave data from the VLF experiment have
   been combined into a wave image map of the Earths magnetosphere. The
   bin sample distribution illustrates the size of the data base used in
   the analysis. The data are displayed in two panels with either the
   electric field (E) and magnetic search coil (M) measurements at one
   frequency or only the electric field (E) measurements at two
   frequencies.

   The data are plotted with an additional notations of important cutoff
   or resonance frequencies. These are:
     * White - selected dipole field lines
     * Red - electron cyclotron at center frequency of plotted band
     * Blue/Green -geometric mean of electron and proton cyclotron
       frequency (LHR).
     * Blue - proton cyclotron frequency

     * 1.8 Hz - E & M
     * 5.6 Hz - E & M
     * 17.8 Hz - E & M
     * 56.2 Hz - E & M
     * 178 Hz _ E & M
     * 562 Hz - E & M
     * 1.78 kHz - E & M
     * 5.62 kHz - E & M
     * 13.3 kHz and 17.8 kHz - E only
     * 23.7 kHz and 31.1 kHz - E only
     * 42.2 kHz and 56.2 kHz - E only
     * 100 kHz and 178 kHz - E only

   the characteristics of the Hawkeye VLF experiment and of plasma wave
   observations.
