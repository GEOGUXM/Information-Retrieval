   Title 17 Regulations
          Title 17 regulations are promulgated by the California
          Department of Developmental Services under the division of the
          Welfare and Institutions Code cited as the Lanterman
          Developmental Disabilities Services Act. These regulations
          govern how services are delivered within the California
          developmental services system.

   Proposed Regulations
          The California Department of Developmental Services has the
          responsibility to draft and implement regulations that carry out
          the Department's statutory responsibilities. These regulations
          are promulgated under Title 17 of the California Code of
          Regulations. In developing these regulations, the Department
          must follow the California Administrative Procedures Act
          rulemaking requirements regarding public review and comment.

   California Code of Regulations
          The California Office of Administrative Law maintains a Website
          containing the text of the complete California Code of
          Regulations (CCR) with the exception of Title 24 (California
          Building Standards.) The CCR consists of 27 titles and contains
          the regulations of approximately 200 regulatory agencies.

   Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act & Related Statutes
          The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act of 1969
          defines the rights of persons with developmental disabilities
          and establishes how these services will be delivered.
