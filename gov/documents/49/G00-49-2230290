     Industry Services      The Department of Financial Institutions

     The Department of Financial Institutions has two critical missions.
     The first is to assure that existing licensees are operated in a
     safe and sound manner, in compliance with all state and federal
     statutes; and the second is the granting of licenses to new
     financial services firms to assure an adequate level and diversity
     of services to the public.

     The Department of Financial Institutions fulfills the first role by
     maintaining a comprehensive program of on-site examination of our
     licensees to both verify financial condition and monitor methods of
     operation. All licensees are further subject to off-site review
     through the filing and analysis of comprehensive financial and
     operational reports. In addition, the Department also receives and
     investigates complaints and inquiries from the public.

     The Department currently grants licenses to conduct financial
     services business in California under nine different sets of
     statutes; bank and trust, savings and loan, credit union, industrial
     loan, foreign banks, business and industrial loan, transmitters of
     money abroad, payment instruments, and travelers checks. While the
     specific requirements for each type of licensee differ, the
     licensing process should always begin with a meeting between the
     potential applicant and the Deputy Commissioner at one of our four
     regional offices. At this meeting we will discuss the applicantÂ’s
     proposed services, location and financial and human resources. This
     meeting is key to identifying what type of license would be most
     appropriate; and the key decision points which will need to be
     emphasized in any formal application.

     The Department also engages in a number of outreach programs to both
     the financial services industry and the public. Our efforts include
     not only printed media such as newsletters and reports, but also
     providing speakers on a variety of issues of interest to both the
     industry and the public.
