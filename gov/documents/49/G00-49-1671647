   What is NRCS?
   The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil
   Conservation Service, is an agency of the United States Department of
   Agriculture. Since 1935, NRCS has worked cooperatively with landowners,
   conservation districts, federal, state, and local agencies, and
   citizens from urban and rural communities to develop and protect the
   nation's soil, water and related resources. NRCS District

   Interior established the Soil Erosion Service to supervise specific
   erosion control demonstration projects. Public concern over the
   nation's land resources become widespread in May 1934 when a dust cloud
   swept across the nation from the Great Plains to beyond the Atlantic
   Coast, becoming the first major dust storm in history to retain its
   identity as it covered a large part of the nation. This prompted
   Congress to enact the Soil Conservation Act of 1935, which shifted soil
   conservation responsibilities from the Department of the Interior to
   the Department of Agriculture and established the Soil Conservation
   Service in all 50 states.
   In 1938, Louisiana passed the Soil Conservation Districts Law and
   established the Feliciana District, the first soil conservation
   district charted in Louisiana. By 1939, there were 12 soil and water
   conservation districts in Louisiana and an association of soil and
   water conservation districts was formed. In 1972, the name of the
   association was changed to its current title, the Louisiana Association
   of Conservation Districts. As part of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture reorganization in 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture
   established the Natural Resources Conservation Service and replaced the
   Soil Conservation Service. Historical photo of Minden, Louisiana

   The new name reflects the agency's role of providing technical
   assistance, through locally organized conservation districts, to help
   individual land users, groups, organizations, and units of government
   conserve all natural resources on private lands.
