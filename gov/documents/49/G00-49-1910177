   Meeting announcement :

     * November 5-7, 1996
       SUMER/CDS meeting at Orsay, FRANCE. The final agenda is available.

   SUMER status September 1996 :

     * SUMER Detector A to Detector B switching over.
       As planned Detector A has been moved to Detector B for future
       observations since the 23rd of September. You have to be careful
       because the wavelength range is a little bit different from
       Detector A ( domain below to 1480 Angstroms ). The detector A is
       still available and will be operated again after a 'switch-off'
       period of several months.

   SUMER Status February 1996 the 19th

   At the date of February 13, before the first maneuver that is incurving
   the SOHO trajectory before the final injection on the Halo orbit around
   the L1 Lagrangian point, the SUMER instrumentation has successfully
   been tested.
     * The mechanisms and on-board electronics are working as expected.
     * The telescope and spectrometer focus had a preliminary adjustement.
     * The spectral and angular resolutions of the telescope and
       spectrometer are limited by the pixel sampling. Up-to-now the
       smallest solar feature detected in the H I Lyman continuum has a
       FWHM of 2 pxels (2 arcsec) with a contrast of 5 above the solar
       neighborood. During the tests, a lot of explosive events with
       velocities from 50 to 100 km/s have been detected.
     * The scattering level of the telescope is still in evaluation:
       observations above the solar limb in a coronal hole has shown that
       we can detect the O VI lines up-to-5 arcmin above the solar limb.
     * We are still in the learning curve in using the XDL (360 x 1024
       pixels) photon counting detector that requires accurate flat
       fielding (at several wavelengths), correction of distortion and
       careful management of bright lines.

   At the end of the commisioning phase, at the Halo orbit insertion, we
   will be ready to begin a set of our first priority scientific
   objectives before starting the full set of coordinated observations
   proposed.

     * September 1996 The Database search interface is available
