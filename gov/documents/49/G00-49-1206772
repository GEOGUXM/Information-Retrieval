   The Icing Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center has an extensive
   collection of still images and video documenting various research and
   tests which have been conducted over the years. Additionally, newer
   media pieces, such as computer-based training courseware, are being
   developed by the branch. A small cross section of all available media
   is available in this section. Please note that some video and
   multimedia components may require specific browser plug-ins or players
   to be viewed.
