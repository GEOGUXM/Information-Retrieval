   Correspondence Programs
   Because of the recent situation with the U.S. Postal Service, ALL of
   the Correspondence Program's incoming letters and package mail have
   been delayed. This includes lessons, mail registrations and midterm and
   final examinations from students, proctors and faculty.
   The Correspondence Program is working closely with the USDA's mailroom
   to expedite the mail as soon as new safety measures are put in place.
   In the meantime, we encourage students to fax their lessons to the
   Correspondence Program office at fax number (202) 690-1516.
   If you have mailed a new registration to our office using a credit
   card, please
   re-register here or contact the Correspondence Program with any
   additional questions at (202) 314-3670 or correspond@grad.usda.gov.
   We appreciate your cooperation and patience during this brief delay.
