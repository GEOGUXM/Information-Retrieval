   Working with OIT

   OIT provides a wide variety of opportunities for partnership. From the
   traditional Industries of the Future strategy that allows companies in
   energy-intensive industries to collaborate on R&D, to the
   implementation assistance offered by BestPractices, to the financial
   assistance provided by NICE3 and I&I, OIT is fueling industrial energy
   efficiency improvements for the nation. Complementary to these core
   strategies, OIT offers numerous other resources and tools that can help
   you improve your industrial efficiencies.

   Solicitations
   Throughout the year, OIT's Industries of the Future, BestPractices,
   State Industries of the Future, financial assistance programs, and the
   enabling technologies offer cost shared grants for research and
   development of new technologies or plant assessments. Stay tuned to the
   solicitations pages to track the requests for proposals that may be of
   interest to you.

   Laboratory Coordinating Council
   DOE's national laboratory system is a priceless resource for the
   development of cleaner, more energy-efficient industrial technologies.
   The 17 laboratories and facilities in the system represent a wealth of
   technical knowledge and expertise plus highly specialized equipment
   necessary to advance R&D. To support OIT and the Industries of the
   Future, the Laboratory Coordinating Council gives U.S. industry access
   to a "virtual" lab that can be tailored to meet the specific
   requirements of almost any R&D project.

   Financing Toolbook
   Additional cost-share opportunities extending from OIT throughout DOE,
   State government, and the private sector are spelled out in the
   Financing Toolbook. The Toolbook Web site provides step-by-step
   guidance through such topics as commercial loans, energy services
   contracts, and equity financing, among many others.

   Communications Standards
   If you provide communications products for the Office of Industrial
   Technologies, check out the Communications Standards site for
   up-to-date information on print, graphic, and Web specifications.

   More to Come
   Most importantly, return to this site often to keep up with the growing
   number of opportunities to work with OIT. We'll be adding to the site
   frequently as new areas for partnership and collaboration emerge.
