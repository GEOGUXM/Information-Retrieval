Summary of Water-Quality Data Collected in Iowa Tribal Lands, July 2000

U. S. Geological Survey, in Cooperation with the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma
     __________________________________________________________________

   The U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Iowa Tribe,
   conducted periodic water-quality sampling of surface and ground-water
   sites in Lincoln and Payne Counties,Oklahoma, in July 2000. Water in
   the Cimarron River contained substantial concentrations of chloride.
   Water in the Deep Fork River contained a substantial number of
   pesticides, at low concentrations. Ground-water samples from the area
   were mostly of good quality. A few wells had high concentrations of
   nitrate or of uranium. The uranium is naturally-occurring and the
   sources of nitrate are unknown.
