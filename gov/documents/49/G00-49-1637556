   You have accessed a U.S. Government Resource.

   This site is intended to be used by the public for information
   exchange.

   Any attempt to modify this resource or associated information other
   than for instructed use is strictly prohibited and may be punishable
   under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

   The Government may monitor and audit the usage of this resource.

   All persons are hereby notified that use of this resource constitutes

   Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site...

   To read or download information:

   We may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For
   example, we may count the number of visitors to the different sections
   of our site to help us make them more useful to visitors. Similar
   information is gathered for anonymous ftp, remote account login, or for
   other comparable types of connections.

   To send us an E-mail:
   By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
   personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as in an
   official Freedom of Information Act request. We may store the name and
   address of the requester in order to respond to the request or to
   otherwise resolve the subject matter of your E-mail.

   To register:

   Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill
   out a registration form. For example, vendors looking for marketing
   opportunities by visiting our Electronic Grants or NASA Acquisition
   Internet Service sites may be asked to "register" to obtain copies of
   Requests for Proposals or other NASA opportunities. Other information
   which may be collected at these sites through questionnaires, feedback
   forms, or other means, enable us to determine a visitor's interests,
   with the goal of providing better service to our customers.

   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
