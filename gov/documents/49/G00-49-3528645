                               Program Summary

   The Health Facilities Inspection Program, (HFIP), is part of the Office
   of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) Code Enforcement program. This division
   forms the largest contract program in the Office of the State Fire
   Marshal. The Office of the State Fire Marshal contracts with the
   California Department of Health Services to provide fire and life
   safety inspection services of health-care facilities that participate
   in the Medicare program. These facilities are certified by the Health
   Care Financing Administration, (HCFA), to receive Federal funding. The
   program is statewide, and directly addresses the fire and life safety
   issues of acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory
   surgery centers, clinics, and intermediate care facilities. In this
   program, the Department of Health Services conducts the nursing part of
   the survey, while SFM staff conduct the fire and life safety element.
   The two parts are then joined and become a single survey that is
   reported to HCFA.

   Participation by the facilities in the Medicare program is strictly
   voluntary and there are several Conditions of Participation which each
   facility must meet. A major condition is that each facility must comply
   with both Federal and State fire and life safety standards.

   These facilities are inspected in accordance with the provisions
   adopted by the Federal Health Care Financing Administration,
   Specifically, the National Fire Protection Association Standard 101,
   known as the Life Safety Code. The applicable edition of this standard
   is the edition that was in place at the time that the facility came
   into the program. The earliest applicable edition is the 1967, while
   the latest edition adopted by HCFA is the 1985 Edition. Also applicable
   are the other NFPA standards that are directly adopted by NFPA #101.
   These are standards such as; NFPA #99 (1993 edition), NFPA #13, etc.
