   Series iv Executive Summary The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided
   $150 million over 5 years to Indian Health Service (IHS) for the
   establishment of a Grants for Special Diabetes Program for Indians
   focused on "the prevention and treatment of diabetes." The IHS was
   instructed to conduct an evaluation of the grant program and provide an
   interim (year 2000) and final (year 2002) report to the Congress. The
   challenge is great. Significant and positive changes in diabetes
   activities have occurred in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN)
   communities as a result of the diabetes grant funds. Here is a list of
   accomplishments: Tribal Consultation Grant program development involved
   the full participation of tribes and tribal leaders, urban Indian
   organizations, and IHS staff. The IHS Director established the Tribal
   Leaders Diabetes Committee to create a partnership between tribes and
   IHS for ongoing input and guidance on diabetes issues. Grant Awards
   Grants were awarded to 318 programs under 286 administrative
   organizations within the 12 IHS Areas. There were 27 grants awarded to
   IHS programs, 33 grants awarded to urban programs, and 258 distributed
   to tribal programs. Diabetes Prevention ! Sixty-seven percent of the
   grant programs are focused on primary and secondary diabetes
   prevention. Thirty-two percent are focused on tertiary diabetes
   prevention. ! More diabetes prevention efforts now focus on elders
   (75%); young adults (68%); adolescents (55%); school age children
   (42%); and preschool age children (33%). ! Three-fourths of programs
   now focus more on clients with newly diagnosed diabetes; 68% of grant
   programs focus more on family members of people with diabetes; and 37%
   focus more on pregnant women as a result of the grant funds. ! More
   emphasis is now placed on addressing preventive measures in adults who
   are overweight (71.5%), people with high blood pressure (70%), children
   who are overweight (56%), and on tobacco users (42.6%). v Enhancement
   of Diabetes Care and Education As a result of these grant funds,
   programs have both enhanced existing diabetes activities and developed
   new ones. These activities are known to improve diabetes care to
   patients. ! A significant number of programs use traditional approaches
   in their diabetes programs, including story-telling (34%), talking
   circles (35%), and use of traditional herbs or medicines (28%).
   Traditional approaches help support and influence positive diabetes
   self-management behaviors within communities. ! AI/AN communities
   established new diabetes teams (29%) and improved existing diabetes
   teams (42%). ! AI/AN communities created new diabetes registries (42%)
   and improved existing diabetes registries (48%). ! AI/AN communities
   established new diabetes clinics (21%) and improved existing diabetes
   clinics (43%). Community Involvement The diabetes grant funds have
   afforded tribes the opportunity to address diabetes prevention where it
   needs to be addressed--at the tribal community level. Significant
   advances in the development of diabetes programs have been made. New
   diabetes care networks have formed within and between tribal
   communities. They are learning from each other which diabetes
   prevention strategies work in AI/AN communities. This grant opportunity
   has allowed tribal communities to move further along their paths to
   wellness and diabetes prevention. But these funds were "seed money,"
   just enough to get programs started. Five years is not nearly enough
   time to accomplish the goal of diabetes prevention. The advances
   achieved in AI/AN communities as a result of these funds will be lost
   without the means to continue and expand the established programs. AI/
   AN communities will need continued funding beyond the five years
   allowed through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to continue to
   implement and expand upon the valuable lessons learned through this
   process. Diabetes prevention on all levels should bring the health of
   this population to the same level as that of all Americans in the next
   millennium. With these grants, American Indian and Alaska Native
   communities are finding their own paths to diabetes control and better
   health. vi Background Balanced Budget Act of 1997 - P. L. 105-33 The
   Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed by the President on August 5, 1997,
   made available $150 million of new funding to the Indian Health Service
   (IHS) through Grants for Special Diabetes Program for Indians. The
   purpose of this legislation was to provide "services for the prevention
   and treatment of diabetes." These services were to be provided at
   Indian health facilities operated by the IHS, Indian tribe or tribal
   organizations, and urban Indian organizations. The funds were to be
   distributed as grants over a 5-year period, at a rate of $30 million a
   year. The legislation also stipulated that the Secretary of Health and
   Human Services would evaluate the diabetes grant programs established
   by the Act and submit an interim report of the evaluation to Congress
   by January 1, 2000, and a final report by January 1, 2002. The
   congressional legislation came in the wake of increasing public concern
   about the human and economic costs of diabetes in the United States and
   its growing prevalence in vulnerable populations, particularly in
   American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). This concern, shared by
   most members of Congress, resulted in bipartisan support for several
   funding measures in the summer of 1997 addressing the diabetes problem.
   Additional funding to expand diabetes-related activities in AI/AN
   communities came from two separate appropriations acts. The 1998
   Appropriations Act for the Department of the Interior included $3
   million for the IHS National Diabetes Program. Because the
   appropriation language required "grants," the IHS funding was added to
   the Grants for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians. The 1998
   Appropriation Act for the Department of Health and Human Services
   included $2 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   (CDC) to establish a national diabetes prevention research center. In
   accordance with Congressional intent in enacting the legislation, the
   Diabetes Prevention Center was to be established in Gallup, New Mexico.
   The Indian Health Service is pleased to submit this interim report to
   the Congress documenting activities through December 31, 1999, of the
   Grants for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians, the program made
   possible by this legislation. Special Diabetes Programs for Indians-
   Page 1 IHS National Diabetes Program History and Mission Statement
   Recognizing the severe impact of diabetes on AI/AN communities in the
   U.S., the National Commission on Diabetes in its 1976 landmark report
   to Congress called for a "comprehensive clinical management program for
   diabetes mellitus within the Indian Health Service." The present IHS
   National Diabetes Program has its origins in this recommendation. The
   mission of the IHS National Diabetes Program, based in Albuquerque, New
   Mexico, is to develop, document, and sustain a public health effort to
   prevent and control diabetes in American Indian and Alaska Native
   peoples. The agency promotes collaborative strategies for the
   prevention of diabetes and its complications in the 12 IHS Service
   Areas through a network of 19 Model Diabetes Programs and 13 Area
   Diabetes Consultants (Appendix F). The agency also disseminates current
   information about all aspects of diabetes surveillance, treatment,
   education, and prevention. Diabetes Prevention Activities Diabetes
   prevention activities include primary, secondary, and tertiary
   prevention. Primary prevention involves preventing the onset of
   diabetes in persons at risk for the disease. Secondary prevention
   focuses on screening people for diabetes and on screening and treatment
   programs for people with diabetes in order to control blood sugar
   levels and other health problems that could contribute to the onset of
   diabetes complications. Tertiary prevention involves screening and
   treatment programs to reduce disability from the long-term
   complications of diabetes affecting the blood vessels, nerves, heart,
   and kidneys. We are starting to accept this disease and think of it as
   our fate. We're not talking about how we can stop the disease. What
   we're saying is, "When am I going to get it?" We just opened a dialysis
   center, and I'm sad that we had to build it. Joyce Dugan, former Chief,
   Eastern Band of Cherokee Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 2
   Primary Prevention Epidemiological studies in a wide range of
   publications have consistently shown a strong association of exercise
   and weight control with reduced risk for diabetes. Moreover, several
   primary prevention trials show reduced incidence rates of diabetes in
   high-risk individuals exposed to nutrition and exercise interventions
   compared with controls. Given the magnitude of the population at high
   risk for diabetes in AI/AN communities and the growing evidence
   supporting diabetes primary prevention, AI/AN community leaders have
   strongly advocated programmatic support for diabetes primary prevention
   programs. Accordingly, the IHS diabetes programs have supported many
   activities that directly and indirectly target diabetes primary
   prevention. These include: ! Community fitness and nutrition programs !
   Primary school health education curricula ! Initiating, distributing,
   and evaluating selected preventive strategies in the IHS Model Diabetes
   Programs In addition, the IHS diabetes programs ensure that IHS
   populations are included in major prevention studies conducted within
   the United States. For example, the IHS is a cosponsor with the
   National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
   (NIDDK) of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a national
   multicenter research study. The DPP research objective is to determine
   whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented in those at high risk for the
   disease. Volunteers from four AI/AN communities (Pima Tribe at Gila
   River and Salt River, AZ; Navajo Tribe at Shiprock; NM; Zuni Pueblo,
   NM) who are at high risk for diabetes are participating in the DPP.
   Some tribal leaders will say "We're going to beat this disease. We have
   to do something." The diabetes money is a start. It's only going to
   scratch the surface. Unfortunately, with the IHS's limited resources
   they've only been able to focus on treatment--and very minimal
   treatment it seems. Nothing as innovative as we'd like to see, but the
   diabetes money has us thinking more about the community-based
   prevention side . . . The diabetes money is a step in the right
   direction. Joyce Dugan, former Chief, Eastern Band of Cherokee Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians - Page 3 Secondary Prevention IHS
   secondary prevention programs operate at several levels. The IHS
   promotes screening programs for early diagnosis of diabetes and
   develops strategies to improve blood sugar control, hypertension, blood
   lipids, and other health problems to reduce diabetes-related
   complications. These strategies include: ! Adaptation and dissemination
   of medical and educational standards for use in Indian health care
   facilities ! Development of the IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit to
   assess diabetes care and education ! Development of professional
   education and culturally relevant patient education materials !
   Collaboration with the International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota, to disseminate practice guidelines based on Staged Diabetes
   ManagementTM (SDM), a systematic approach for scientifically-based
   clinical decision-making in diabetes care. The SDMTM guidelines are
   adapted locally by clinic and tribal community members for use in local
   IHS and tribal health care facilities. Tertiary Prevention Tertiary
   prevention activities center on refining, promoting, and measuring the
   implementation and outcomes of specific services to prevent disability
   from diabetes-related complications. Some of these services include: !
   Foot and eye screening ! Blood lipids and blood pressure measurements
   and treatment ! Screening for proteinuria and serum creatinine to
   assess kidney function Just don't assume that we know. We don't. You
   need to show us. You have to show me. You can tell me. You can give me
   brochures to read. I'll read those later and suddenly say "well what is
   this doing in here or where did I get this?" The diabetes is a constant
   struggle because my husband never did believe that he was sick. He says
   "There is nothing wrong with me," but the toll that diabetes has taken
   on him . . . he's blind, he has an amputation below the knee and lost a
   toe on the other leg. Juanita Atone, Kiowa, husband has diabetes,

   Evaluation The IHS has been a leader in developing a diabetes care
   surveillance system, the annual Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit
   carried out voluntarily in Indian health facilities, to track
   performance on more than 87 indicators to study trends over time
   (Appendix D). The Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit monitors use of
   standards and outcomes of diabetes care, including glycemic and blood
   pressure control, screening for complications, and preventive health
   services such as dilated eye exams. The system is based on IHS
   Standards of Diabetes Care, which have been in place since 1985 and are
   updated every 2 years. In the 1998 IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes
   Audit, 11,581 charts were reviewed representing care to 70,751 patients
   at 190 IHS and tribal health facilities in the 12 IHS Areas. This
   diabetes care surveillance system has been instrumental in the
   improvement of diabetes care practices in many Indian health settings.
   For example, in a special program in Alaska and in northern Minnesota
   from 1989-93, lower extremity amputation rates were reduced by 50
   percent in people with diabetes who received complete foot screening
   and protective footwear1. IHS has developed a protocol so there's a
   standard way of categorizing the disease and as a result, treatment
   becomes more uniform and more able to meet the needs of the individual
   . . . a common approach to treating the disease. Ray Granboise, Turtle
   Mountain Band of Chippewa, Service Unit Director for Quentin Burdick
   Memorial Health Care Facility Model Diabetes Programs Development of
   the regional Model Diabetes Programs is a major achievement of the IHS
   National Diabetes Program. In 1979, following the recommendation of the
   National Commission on Diabetes, five model programs were incorporated
   into existing IHS sites at hospitals and clinics serving AI/AN
   communities. Subsequent legislation by Congress has enabled the IHS to
   increase the current number of Model Programs to nineteen. They are
   located in diverse settings in the 12 IHS Areas, from the Navajo
   Reservation to Alaskan villages; from an urban setting at Albuquerque
   Indian Hospital to a tribal consortium in northern Maine. The sites
   have been selected to represent a spectrum of facilities and settings
   (Appendix F). Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 5 The model
   programs are designed not only to expedite care and provide education
   to people with diabetes, but also to translate and develop new
   approaches to diabetes control that serve as models for other Indian
   communities facing similar problems. Their contributions to diabetes
   care in AI/AN communities are impressive: ! Model Diabetes Programs
   provide state-of-the-art, comprehensive clinical diabetes care using a
   multi-disciplinary approach to individuals, families, and communities
   served by the programs. ! Model Diabetes Programs offer diabetes
   education and nutritional counseling services to individuals and
   families on an inpatient and outpatient basis in clinics, homes, and
   within the community. These services include assessment and information
   sharing and specific interventions for pregnant women and persons with
   other health problems related to diabetes. ! Model Diabetes Programs
   provide professional education through conferences, workshops, and
   in-service settings and through articles in IHS and other American
   Indian tribal and urban publications. I know that education is the key
   and we need more money for education. This wasn't done (education) in
   my younger time. I really didn't know what diabetes was, how it affects
   you in the later years. I guess if I had a little more education on it,
   I probably wouldn't be sitting here without my limbs. Lawrence Bedeau,

   Partnerships Agencies and Organizations The IHS National Diabetes
   Program offers diabetes consultation services to staff of medical
   facilities within the 12 IHS Areas that the Model Diabetes Programs do
   not reach. The national program also coordinates with other Federal and
   private agencies involved in diabetes-related programs such as the
   Diabetes Prevention Program and the National Diabetes Education
   Program, both funded by the National Institutes of Health (Appendix E).
   In addition, the IHS also participates with the: ! Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention, Division of Diabetes Translation, in diabetes
   control and surveillance activities in AI/AN communities and on their
   Translational Advisory Committee ! The Diabetes Interagency
   Coordinating Committee, comprising diabetes representatives from all

   Tribal Colleges and Universities Input from Tribal Communities In all
   of its current activities, but especially since implementation of the
   Grants for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians, the IHS National
   Diabetes Program has taken advantage of opportunities to hear what
   tribal leaders have to say. The Program supported formation of the
   Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee to have a means of seeking advice and
   guidance on issues of concern to tribes and tribal organizations. In
   addition, input from tribal communities is solicited to ensure that
   tribal and cultural concerns are addressed. Educational materials,
   treatment programs, nutritional counseling, and physical activities are
   all tailored to accommodate cultural, physical, and geographical
   considerations in diverse AI/AN communities. In June 1997, the IHS
   cosponsored the Diabetes Future Search Conference to gain input on ways
   that AI/AN communities could capitalize on opportunities afforded by
   recent advances in diabetes management and control. Key participants in
   this conference included tribal leaders, people with diabetes, health
   care professionals, and others interested in diabetes in AI/AN
   communities. This conference established the need for continued
   discussions with tribal leaders and community members in identifying
   additional approaches and strategies needed for diabetes prevention and
   management in AI/AN communities.2 What we're doing here today as tribal
   leaders, we may never see the results of what we do, but . . . we are
   here for the future good of the tribes that we represent . . . How can
   we best do something for future generations? That's what we're here to
   talk about . . . There are some people that are already gone, we've
   lost them. But it's those that we can stop (from getting this disease)
   that we can help, we can talk about prevention. Those are the ones we
   need to be thinking about . . . that group of young people. Alvin Windy
   Boy Sr, Chippewa Cree, Councilman, Chair, Tribal Leaders Diabetes
   Committee Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 8 Scope and
   Impact: Diabetes Epidemiology Prevalence of Diabetes Diabetes has had a
   major impact on American Indians and Alaska Natives. In fact, in the
   last half of this century, the disease has reached epidemic proportions
   in AI/AN communities. Virtually unknown 50 years ago, type 2 diabetes
   (formerly known as type II or adult-onset, noninsulin- dependent
   diabetes) is now a severe health problem in every AI/AN community. In
   1996, nine percent of AI/ANs aged 20 years or older had diagnosed
   diabetes. On average, AI/ANs are 2.8 times as likely to have diagnosed
   diabetes as non-Hispanic Whites of similar age.3 In all 12 IHS Areas,
   diabetes is reported as one of the top 10 major health problems.4 In
   some tribes, notably the Pima Indians of Arizona, half the adults have
   diabetes,5 and the official rate of diabetes among Navajo Indians aged
   45 or over is 40 percent.6 The actual prevalence of the disease may be
   one-third to one-half higher in many communities because of undiagnosed
   cases, as estimated by the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes has
   had a major impact on American Indians and Alaska Natives. ! Nine
   percent of all American Indians and Alaska Natives twenty years or
   older have diagnosed diabetes. ! ! In 1996 American Indians and Alaska
   Natives twenty years or older were 2.8 times more likely to have
   diabetes as non-Hispanic Whites of similar age. ! In all IHS regions
   diabetes is reported to be one of the top ten major health problems.
   The disease is also increasing in prevalence among all American Indian
   and Alaska Native populations. IHS studies show that between 1991-97,
   the prevalence of diabetes increased in all major regions served by the
   agency. The increases in prevalence ranged from 17 percent among tribes
   in the Northern Plains to 80 percent in Alaska.7 Two tribes in the
   Nashville Area, the Choctaw and Cherokee, had a 30 percent increase in
   diabetes prevalence in those 6 years.7 Earlier, in 1989, a survey among
   the Mississippi Choctaw showed that more than one-third of the 638
   adults from ages 45 to 64 years had diabetes, and there were almost as
   many cases in the younger age group from ages 15 to 44 years.8 Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 9 Overall, about 65,000 American
   Indians and Alaska Natives aged 20 years or older had diagnosed
   diabetes in 1996, according to IHS statistics.3 Almost half of all
   diabetes patients are between the ages of 45-64 years, and 25 percent
   are 65 years or older.3 American Indian and Alaska Native women 65
   years or older have especially high rates: one in four has diagnosed
   diabetes.3 By comparison, in the U.S. non-Hispanic White population,
   11.2 percent of women 65 years or older have diabetes (Table 1).3 Table

   Diabetes is incurable. But they can control it by eating the right
   kinds of foods, exercising, and these kind of things. These are
   individual kinds of things that a person has to do for themselves. I
   hear there is a program up in the Dakotas . . . where they are using
   medicine people who are knowledgeable in the use of herbs . . . and
   they are working with non-Indian doctors to turn around some of the
   problems with diabetes. Jim Hena, Pueblo of Tesuque, former Tribal
   Governor Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 10 Trends in
   Diabetes Prevalence Two alarming trends have recently become evident
   among American Indians and Alaska Natives. One is the rise of diabetes
   in Alaska Native people, as noted above; the other is the development
   of type 2 diabetes in younger American Indians. In the general
   population, type 2 diabetes usually develops after age 40. Finding
   adolescents with type 2 diabetes in American Indian and Alaska Native
   communities is not uncommon. A recent IHS study shows a steady increase
   in the rate of diagnosed diabetes in American Indian and Alaska Native
   adolescents and young adults between the years 1991- 97. From 1991 to
   1997: ! Among AI/AN adolescents age 15 to 19 years, diabetes prevalence
   increased by 32 percent; ! Among AI/AN young adults between 20 and 24
   years, diabetes prevalence increased by 36 percent; ! Among AI/AN young
   adults age 25 to 34 years, diabetes prevalence increased by 28 percent.
   At all age levels, the increase in diabetes prevalence was higher in
   young men, although the actual prevalence rate among women was still
   higher than among men. It should be noted that the study did not
   distinguish between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. (Type 1
   diabetes usually develops in childhood and is considered rare in
   American Indian and Alaska Native populations.) 7 And it's sad to say
   that we live in a push button age and the kids can't even empty our
   trash cans. They don't get exercise and they don't eat right . . . We
   can start at home, start teaching our young ones that are on the
   reservations all these things . . . all these values. Now all the young
   people know is a can opener. They don't know the basics of good
   potatoes and all the good vegetables. Betty Thin Elk, Rosebud (Sioux),
   has had diabetes for 24 years Special Diabetes Programs for Indians-
   Page 11 Etiology of Diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives
   Much of our information about the nature and impact of diabetes in
   AI/AN communities ! indeed type 2 diabetes in general ! comes from
   ongoing cooperative studies with the Pima tribe. Since 1965, the NIDDK
   has maintained a facility at the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona
   to carry out studies with volunteers from the Pima community. These
   studies and data from other tribes show that the major factors
   contributing to type 2 diabetes in American Indians are obesity,
   especially central obesity (upper-body/above the waist obesity),
   genetics, and high levels of insulin in the blood, which results in
   insulin resistance, a forerunner of type 2 diabetes. Contributing to
   obesity, particularly in the last half century, is adoption of a
   "westernized" high-fat diet by many AI/ANs. Dietary counseling is
   generally limited or not available on reservations. Often, access to
   quality foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, is scarce or
   available only at a great distance, and people on reservations must
   rely on commodity foods furnished by the Government, which are often
   high in fat and calories. The level of physical activity also has
   declined, with less reliance on hunting and farming as occupations and
   the adoption of more sedentary occupations. The grandfathers and my
   grandmothers taught us things. They ate according to what they should
   eat, the Indian way, the traditional way. They taught us how to gather
   these foods and eat them. And they were strong . . . My grandfather, No
   Two Horn, was 107 when he died. And he had a cane but he used it just
   now and then. And he would take it and put it above his head and run in
   the mornings. Zona Loans Arrow, Standing Rock Sioux, 72 years old,
   diagnosed with diabetes at age 34 The tendency to become obese appears
   to have genetic components, particularly in diabetes-prone families.
   Among some AI/ANs, obesity develops at an early age. Researchers have
   found that diabetes rates are highest in full-blooded American Indians,
   and a genetic marker linked with insulin resistance has been identified
   in the Pimas.9 Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 12 Diabetes
   Mortality According to statistics, diabetes mortality is more than 2
   times higher in the American Indian and Alaska Native population than
   in the general U.S. population.4 However, the actual death rate
   attributable to diabetes among American Indians and Alaska Natives is
   believed to be 4.3 times higher than in the general population.10 Most
   experts agree that because of under-reporting on death certificates,
   true diabetes mortality is underestimated in national statistics. Also,
   Indian heritage is not always apparent on death certificates. Diabetes
   death rates in American Indians increased 550 percent in women and 249
   percent in men over a 30-year period in New Mexico.10 Diabetes
   Complications AI/ANs have higher rates of diabetes at all age levels,
   and they also have high rates of long-term diabetes complications,
   particularly kidney failure, blindness, and amputations. Because they
   tend to develop the disease earlier in life, compared to the general
   U.S. population, they also tend to develop these complications sooner.
   I don't feel like there's anything wrong with my health right now but
   there has been. I have only one leg. I have a toe missing on the other
   side. I am blind. It's from diabetes, they told me. Vern Antone, Kiowa
   According to studies, rates of diabetes-related kidney failure in
   AI/ANs are six times higher than for the general U.S. population.9 High
   rates of kidney failure are reported in many tribes, including the
   Navajo, Cherokee, Sioux, Pima, Zuni, Chippewa, Oklahoma tribes, and
   Alaska Natives.9 From 1975-84, diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease)
   was the leading cause of nontraumatic death among the Pimas.9 Because
   few tribes have community-based dialysis centers, many AI/ANs living on
   reservations in remote areas do not have ready access to treatment
   centers. AI/ANs are also less likely than Caucasians to get a kidney
   transplant. Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 13 Diabetic
   retinopathy, which can lead to blindness, is also common in many
   tribes. Various studies among the tribes in Oklahoma and the Pima tribe
   in Arizona have shown rates ranging from 14 percent to 49.3 percent.9
   In addition, AI/ANs have high rates of lower extremity amputations and
   foot ulcers and loss of sensory perception in the feet, which can lead
   to amputation. In addition, AI/ANs also develop high rates of
   diabetes-related periodontal disease and infections. One study in the
   Sioux tribe showed that those with diabetes were 4.4 times more likely
   to develop tuberculosis than those without diabetes. 9 Demographics of
   American Indian and Alaska Native Communities In 1998 the IHS had
   approximately 70,000 people with diagnosed diabetes listed in its
   computerized record system. Table 2 shows some characteristics of this
   population in 1998. Table 2 Demographic characteristics of people with
   diagnosed diabetes, IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit, 1998 Gender %

   43 According to the most recent census figures, as of September 1,
   1999, 2.4 million American Indians and Alaska Natives live in the
   United States.11 There are more than 550 federally recognized tribes,
   with differing languages and cultural backgrounds. The lives of AI/ANs
   have I didn't have any inkling of what a diabetic was . . . so that
   went on like that `til my eyesight was failing. And so they corrected
   that by laser treatments and I started getting bigger doses of insulin
   . . . But as the years went by and I didn't take care of myself . . . I
   had congestive heart failure and that was caused by diabetes . . . That
   was in August. By October 3, I was on dialysis. Betty Thin Elk, Rosebud
   (Sioux), has had diabetes for 24 years Special Diabetes Programs for
   Indians- Page 14 changed radically in this century. Today, according to
   IHS and CDC statistics, about 38 percent live on reservations, about 22
   percent live near reservations, and approximately 40 percent live
   elsewhere in the United States. More than half, about 1.46 million,
   live in reservation States served by IHS facilities.4 Economically,
   AI/ANs are among the country's most disadvantaged populations. More
   than 30 percent (31.6 percent) live below the poverty level, compared
   to 13 percent of the general population, and they are more than twice
   as likely to be unemployed (2.5 times for men and 2.2 times for
   women).4 Their median income is two-thirds that of the rest of the
   country, and the high school dropout rate is reported to be 35 percent,
   compared to a dropout rate of 25 percent in the general U.S.
   population.4 They are a young population, with a median age of 27.7
   years, compared to 35.5 years in the general population, and 33 percent
   are below the age of 15.11 Their life expectancy is below the national
   average.4 I wish there was a way we could have an interpreter . . . or
   it could be written in Indian . . . there are so many things we don't
   understand. We don't all read the books that's given to us. We don't
   understand what its all about . . . If somebody explained to us how to
   take care of each other, it could help. Candelaria Valencia, Elder,
   Pueblo of San Felipe Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 15
   History of the Grants Process Tribal Consultation The legislation
   authorizing new grants for diabetes prevention and treatment activities
   in AI/AN communities sparked an intensive, indepth tribal consultation
   process to explore the best method for allocating the new resources and
   to develop recommendations. To expedite the distribution of these new
   funds to local Indian health programs, the IHS convened a series of
   meetings in the fall of 1997. I am chairman of the National Indian
   Health Board, we advocate for all 550 tribes. I am diabetic . . . I
   challenge each of you to get involved. We have a serious issue in our
   community and nationally. We can beat this real serious disease by
   working together. If we want to be sovereign, we need to take care of
   ourselves . . . We have to improve our shared efforts among our
   communities . . . with IHS, NIHB, NICOA and other Indian organizations.
   Buford Rolin, Poarch Band of Creek Indians, Councilman, Chairman,
   National Indian Health Board Diabetes Workgroup The consultation
   process began in September at the NIHB National Consumer Conference in
   Spokane, Washington, with elected representatives from tribes, urban
   Indian health organizations, and IHS officials. One purpose of the
   meeting was to announce the new grants program and to solicit the views
   of elected tribal and urban Indian health program leaders. Regional
   caucuses in all 12 IHS Areas followed this meeting to develop
   recommendations for the Special Diabetes Programs for Indians. Early in
   November of the same year, Michael H. Trujillo, M.D., M.P.H., M.S,
   Assistant Surgeon General and Director of IHS, named a workgroup to
   review recommendations from the Area caucuses, identify national
   allocation issues, and recommend policy options for the final decision-
   making process. The Indian Health Diabetes Workgroup consisted of 13
   members, including two representatives from each of the following: !
   National Indian Health Board ! Tribal Self-Governance Advisory
   Committee Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 16 ! Urban Indian
   health programs ! IHS American Indian Physicians Others in the
   workgroup included a member of the Association of American Indian
   Physicians, a diabetes expert, and three other elected tribal leaders.
   The Workgroup met on November 19, 1997, to review background
   information from the tribes compiled by NIHB and to begin planning. It
   met again on December 15-16, 1997, to formulate final recommendations.
   Time was allowed between the two meetings for tribal councils in each
   IHS Area to submit their recommendations for the grants program and for
   allocation of funds at the Area level. The Workgroup's final
   recommendations for the Grants for Special Diabetes Program for Indians
   were presented to the Director of IHS on December 16. The Director
   issued his final decision on January 8, 1998, the details of which were
   announced at the combined Annual Meeting of the National Councils of
   Area Directors and Clinical Directors in Phoenix, Arizona. The
   consultation process involved the full participation of tribes, urban
   Indian organizations, and IHS staff regarding the development of the
   program and the most equitable distribution of funds. The
   recommendations developed by the Workgroup reflected the majority
   opinion based on input from tribal organizations throughout the Nation.
   In his final decision, the Director approved all of the Workgroup's
   recommendations, making only one change in the formula for determining
   allocation of funds. Education is the biggest part of dealing with
   diabetes. Getting the people to understand and it's their own native
   people that's going to have to educate us. If somebody comes from off
   the reservation I guess they don't take them seriously. They just don't
   take the disease seriously and I went through the same thing. I didn't
   take it seriously until it really started affecting me. It affects all
   parts of the body . . . And I thought it would go away sometime just
   like a common cold but I guess I was wrong and it didn't go away.

   Implementation Guidelines for the Grant Program: Director's Final
   Decisions The recommendations developed by the Workgroup and approved
   by the Director, IHS, for implementing the program were as follows:
   Distribution Formula ! The grant funds were allocated to IHS Areas
   according to an agreed-upon formula. Each Area would then determine
   grant program design and distribution of funds within its region. ! The
   grants were to be awarded on a noncompetitive basis. ! The sum of $1.5
   million was set aside each year for urban Indian health programs. ! For
   the first year of funding, the formula for determining each Area's
   allocation was based on user population (30 percent); disease burden as
   measured by excess diabetes prevalence and mortality (52.5 percent);
   and tribal size adjustment, to compensate for smaller-sized tribes
   (12.5 percent). In addition, the Director set aside $116,000 (5
   percent) per Area to improve data and reporting systems. (Appendix B) !
   A cap of 1 percent was placed on administrative costs. ! For Year 1,
   all grant funds were to be awarded by June 1, 1998. IHS and Tribal
   Roles ! The participation of the IHS Model Programs in the Grants for
   Special Diabetes Programs for Indians would be determined at the Area
   level. ! Tribal governments would decide how the monies were to be
   divided among programs within the IHS Area. Individual grant sites
   decided the focus and chose particular primary, secondary, and tertiary
   prevention strategies for diabetes, depending on needs and priorities
   in their community. ! Authority and responsibility for program
   evaluation was assigned to local and Area leadership as well as IHS
   Headquarters, consistent with IHS principles, using existing IHS
   guidelines for data collection. ! The IHS was to work with CDC in
   initiating a tribal consultation process on issues relating to diabetes
   in AI/AN communities and the Diabetes Prevention Research Center.
   Diabetes Prevention Research Center ! For each of the 5 years, $1
   million was to be set aside for a Diabetes Prevention Research Center
   to be located in Gallup, NM. The Center would eventually serve all
   tribes and support primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention
   research. Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 18 ! The
   Workgroup recommended that a Tribal Advisory Committee be established
   to provide advice and consultation to the Center. The IHS Director and
   the Workgroup supported collaboration with the CDC to obtain input and
   guidance from representatives of IHS, tribal, and urban Indian
   organizations nationwide in the Center's design, operation, and future
   expansion. In summary, the total amount of funds available in the first
   year of the Grants for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians was $33
   million. Of this sum, $1 million was set aside for the National
   Diabetes Prevention Research Center and $1.5 million for urban Indian
   health programs. In addition, $300,000 was allowed for administrative
   costs, leaving $30.2 million for the distributions as grants (Appendix
   C). These funds were allocated to the 12 IHS Areas according to the
   formula recommended by the Diabetes Workgroup to the Director, IHS.

   Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee
   (TLDC) was established in 1998 by the Director of the IHS in response
   to the successful partnership between IHS and tribal leaders in
   deciding the process for distribution of the Balanced Budget Act of
   1997 Special Diabetes Program for Indians. In creating this permanent
   committee, the Director sought to foster an ongoing dialogue between
   the agency and tribal leadership on matters related to diabetes in
   AI/AN communities. The TLDC is comprised of one elected tribal official
   from each IHS Area and 2 members-at-large. The Chief Medical Officer,
   Dr. Kermit Smith of the IHS and one elected tribal leader, Councilman
   Alvin Windy Boy Sr, serve as Co-Chairs of the committee. The TLDC meets
   quarterly with intermittent conference calls as needed between
   meetings. The agenda is established jointly by the IHS National
   Diabetes Program, the Grants Management Office and the tribal leaders,
   based on current issues and concerns. The impact of this relationship
   on the grants process is evident in the unique character of the grant
   program and its clear attention to tribal concerns. Tribal leaders'
   involvement in the grants process has allowed the IHS National Diabetes
   Program greater access to, and increased awareness and knowledge of,
   tribal concerns across the nation. This valuable collaboration between
   the IHS and tribal leaders has been an unexpected, but very important,
   outcome of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, and has
   contributed significantly to the success achieved in Indian communities
   thus far. I see here it says Native Americans are minority populations
   . . . We try to stress the fact that we are tribal governments and
   tribal nations. We always stress our government-to-government
   relations, we have to do that. Patricia Martin, Yakama Nation,

   at which the Workgroup's recommendations and the Director's decisions
   were presented to tribal Indian health representatives, the
   consultation process moved to the Area level. Each Area held tribal
   caucuses to identify programs eligible to apply for grant funds. Each
   Area was required to submit a report to the Director of IHS identifying
   eligible programs and the amount of funding for each. The Director also
   asked the Areas to document the tribal consultation process used to
   ensure that it had been fair and Special Diabetes Programs for Indians-
   Page 20 representative. To promote coordination of a range of diabetes
   services within an Area, Urban Indian health programs were encouraged
   to participate in the caucuses. Urban programs, however, were not
   eligible for Area funds since they were funded separately. Elected
   tribal leaders should have a say in what happens to our health care
   because it affects our people . . . We can't forget those we work for .
   . . The agency did a good thing to ask tribal leaders to advise on
   these diabetes funds . . . I'd like to recognize IHS for involving
   tribal leadership in diabetes grants program in a way that has been far
   too absent over the course of time. Alvin Windy Boy Sr, Chairman,
   Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee Chippewa Cree Tribe, Councilman Grant
   Application The IHS Grants Management Branch mailed grant application
   kits to all IHS and identified tribal health programs in the Area
   caucuses. Potential grant sites submitted applications in March and
   April. Each Area Chief Medical Officer and/or Area Diabetes Consultant
   reviewed the grant applications, rating them as acceptable, not
   acceptable, or as needing revisions. All sites were offered technical
   assistance in the development and revision of their applications.
   Awards were completed by June 1. All together, the IHS awarded grants
   for 318 programs in the 12 IHS Areas serving American Indians and
   Alaska Natives. When we did research for the grant we found there were
   four areas that weren't properly addressed: optometry, foot care,
   education with youth and (hiring) staff to assist with the Diabetes
   Program. With our new program we can treat our people properly, modify
   their shoes so their shoes fit correctly and we avoid amputations.
   Anita Blue, Director of Economic Development and Tribal Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 21 Program Challenges There were
   many challenges and obstacles making implementation of this grants
   program difficult. The IHS had gone through many changes in the several
   years before the Special Diabetes Program for Indians that influenced
   the way decisions were made regarding the grant program. Other
   challenges presented themselves as IHS carried out these decisions. !
   Agency downsizing had a significant impact on the number of employees
   at Headquarters. At one time, the IHS National Diabetes Program had as
   many as 13 employees. When Congress announced the Balanced Budget Act
   (BBA) funds for diabetes, the program had five employees and no
   director. ! An increase in self-governance activities had occurred over
   several years before the BBA. Many tribes were using the compact and
   contract possibilities made available through P.L. 638 legislation to
   take over and run their own health care systems. The grant program had
   to take into account these mechanisms for funding, although the grants
   program came through the BBA, and thus was subject to different
   regulations than self-determination contracting/compacting authorized
   by P.L. 93-638. ! The IHS Grants Management Branch had never managed a
   grant program of this magnitude. The software system used to monitor
   IHS grants was obsolete and needed replacement. ! The BBA also provided
   an opportunity to address Medicare reimbursement for diabetes education
   training services. This added a significant amount of work to an
   already reduced staff at the IHS National Diabetes Program. ! The
   grants process requires that agency personnel serve as project officers
   to monitor the grants. The IHS National Diabetes Program did not have
   adequate personnel to serve this These myths and old wives' tales that
   they had about diabetes, they're finding out are not true . . . They
   can do something about their disease. It takes a team of us to really
   work. Diane LaFontaine, Diabetes Coordinator, Quentin Burdick Memorial
   Health Care Facility, 1,060 patients on diabetes registry Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 22 function. Instead, the Director
   decided to assign this duty to the Chief Medical Officers and Diabetes
   Consultants in each Area. Many did not have Project Officer training so
   this training had to be arranged quickly in several sites. ! More than
   half of AI/ANs live in urban Areas, away from their reservation,
   without access to IHS or tribal health care systems. Thus, many AI/ANs
   with diabetes have inadequate resources to address diabetes care and
   education. ! Final decisions on the grant process were based on the
   recommendations of tribal leaders, Urban Indian organizations and IHS
   staff. Allowing time for these recommendations to be formulated created
   delays in making the many decisions required by the grant process. !
   Grant award dates varied among eligible tribes. Many tribes wanted to
   extend Year 1 awards to match their fiscal years. This would allow for
   increased quality in fiscal monitoring. Adjusting for this option
   increased the workload for the IHS Grants Management Division and
   created further challenges in grant reporting requirements. I'm the
   cook of the house and so all my family went on the diet with me and
   that's very encouraging for them to do that . . . you need your family
   to back you. You know that you are not standing alone . . . you know
   someone cares. My grandmother used to say that a long time ago we ate
   off the wild . . . We have a lot to teach our grandchildren, especially
   those of us who can talk and read and write in our own language . . .
   My grandmother used to say that we had to work for our eats . . . We
   carried water, we chopped wood . . . It wasn't a hardship for us
   because that's the way we lived. We were healthy because we were doing
   all this. Betty Thin Elk, Rosebud (Sioux), has had diabetes for 24

   Baseline Information Overview The legislation authorizing the Grants
   for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians appropriated a total of $150
   million over a 5-year period. Additional funds from the Interior
   Appropriations Act in FY 1998 brought the total amount of funds
   available in the first year of the program to $33 million. The total
   amount of money available for distribution to grant sites during the
   first year of the grant program was $30.2 million, because of the funds
   set aside for Urban Indian programs, the National Diabetes Prevention
   Center, and administrative costs. The legislation authorizing the
   Grants for Special Diabetes Programs for Indians specified that the
   monies were to be used to support diabetes treatment and prevention
   programs. Acceptable activities included primary, secondary, and
   tertiary diabetes prevention and treatment programs and related data
   collection. Grants under the program were for 5 years, with annual
   renewals, and covered both direct and indirect costs (Appendix C).
   Request for Application (RFA) The IHS RFA for the Grants for Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians, dated February 4, 1998, was developed by
   the IHS National Diabetes Program and the IHS Grants Management
   Branch.12 The RFA included complete instructions and background
   materials needed to apply for non- competitive grants authorized by the
   Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and by the FY 1998 additional
   appropriations made available through the Interior Appropriations Act.
   The RFA stated that the funds were "to provide diabetes prevention and
   treatment services for AI/ANs." Types of programs eligible for grant
   funds included: ! IHS programs, both inpatient and outpatient
   facilities; ! Tribal health programs operating under a contract, grant,
   cooperative agreement, or compact with the IHS under the Indian Self-
   Determination Act; and ! Urban Indian health organizations, including
   those functioning under a grant or contract with the IHS under Title V
   of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Scope of Grant Programs.
   Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 24 Narrative The narrative
   section of the RFA gave applicants directions related to the following:
   ! Proposed project description ! Documentation of work plan and
   timeline ! Target audience descriptions ! Identification of
   partnerships or collaborations ! Descriptions of evaluation measures
   and data sources ! Identification of key personnel, including
   consultants and contractors ! Program budget estimates. I went to the
   training sessions . . . I didn't understand, at first--it takes you a
   little while--just exactly what foods make your sugar go up and what
   foods you can eat to keep it down. And I do feel much better if I take
   care of myself. If I'm not takin' care of myself, I don't feel good.
   And I don't feel like playing with my grandchildren or interacting with
   other people. I couldn't believe how much better I felt after I got it
   under control and how much better my eyesight was. Dean McManus,
   Chickasaw, diagnosed with diabetes in July 1995 Appendices Several
   appendices were included in the RFA, to facilitate the application
   process and provide ideas for programs: ! Diabetes prevention and
   treatment programs ! Resources for data collection in primary,
   secondary, and tertiary prevention ! Descriptions of the 19 Model
   Diabetes Programs with contact sources ! Detailed bibliography listing

   Page 25 Reporting Requirements General Requirements The grant RFA
   outlined specific annual reporting requirements for each program. All
   grant recipients were required to submit a yearly progress report.
   Included in the progress report is general information on program
   accomplishments, as well as challenges and problems in achieving
   program goals and objectives. All grant recipients were required to
   submit an annual progress report detailing: ! Program accomplishments !
   Problems and challenges ! Required data elements ! Financial status
   Data Elements Each grant site was required to submit identified data
   elements that would measure and evaluate the overall Grants for Special
   Diabetes Programs for Indians. All sites must provide data annually on
   the prevalence of diabetes. Additional data elements would also be
   required: ! Number of diabetes related amputations ! Cases of end-stage
   renal disease ! Laser treatments for retinopathy ! Obesity prevalence
   of youth age 2-3 years, 4-6 years, and 13-15 years. The IHS National
   Diabetes Program gave grant sites the option to choose the additional
   data elements they would report in Years 2 and 3. The number of
   additional data elements increases annually, from one in Year 2 to two
   in Year 3. By Year 4, grant sites must provide measures for all data
   elements. In addition, grant recipients must provide data specific to
   the type of project they are conducting. For example, if the purpose of
   a primary prevention project is to prevent the later development of
   diabetes in women with gestational diabetes, grant sites should provide
   information on the number of mothers counseled, number of counseling
   sessions, and on the incidence of diabetes in the target population.
   Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 26 Reporting Requirement
   Options In Year 1, many grant recipients requested that their
   individual renewal dates be made consistent with the Federal or tribal
   fiscal year cycle. This required a change in their continuation
   application dates. The change in application dates would allow better
   fiscal management and tracking at the individual sites. Yet, many
   programs also reported that these changes in the grant cycles, as well
   as the delays in Year 1 grant awards, created significant data
   collection and reporting problems. Sites also reported significant
   limitations in their infrastructures and capacity to conduct quality
   diabetes surveillance on the complications measures required in the
   RFA. In response to these concerns, the IHS Grants Management Branch
   agreed to offer six different cycles for extensions and renewals of
   grant applications. To address the data and surveillance problems
   raised, the IHS National Diabetes Program added an optional grant
   reporting requirement. As an alternative to reporting diabetes data
   elements (amputations, end-stage renal disease, retinopathy, obesity),
   programs were given the option to provide the 87 data elements from the
   IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. Those sites without a
   clinic-based program can provide data from the diabetes audit done at
   their local IHS or tribal clinic. This reporting option will allow all
   grant recipients an opportunity to provide valid data elements related
   to the diabetes care and outcomes within their communities. . . . with
   our Diabetes Center of Excellence, we have tried to get out of the
   bricks and mortar of the hospital. We need to be out in the community
   to involve the people and get them doing things that are part of the
   wellness program. Ray Grandbois, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa,
   Service Unit Director for Quentin Burdick Memorial Health Care Facility
   Special Diabetes Programs for Indians- Page 27 Year 1 Grant Application
   Review Review Process Although the grants were noncompetitive, and not
   ranked or rated, the Grants Management Branch of IHS reviewed all
   applications for eligibility and compliance with the grant
   announcement. The applications were also reviewed by the Chief Medical
   Officers and Area Diabetes Consultants in each IHS Area Office. Grant
   application reviews addressed the soundness of proposed services, their
   compliance with the legislation and grant regulations, and
   recommendations on proposed costs. If the reviewers decided that the
   proposal needed revisions, the Area Diabetes Consultant was available
   to provide technical assistance. Year 1 proposals were analyzed in
   terms of the following: ! Program emphasis ! Target population groups !
   Screening, treatment, and prevention services ! Education ! Nutrition !
   Physical fitness activities ! Health systems development components In
   response to the RFA, the IHS awarded grants in Year 1 by June 1, 1998.
   Grants were awarded to 318 programs under 286 administrative
   organizations within the 12 IHS Areas. There were 27 grants awarded to
   IHS programs, 33 grants awarded to urban programs, and 258 distributed
   to tribal programs (Appendix A). The range of services and activities
   outlined in the grant applications reflects the widespread recognition
   of the critical need to address the epidemic of diabetes in AI/AN
   communities. If I had a magic wand, I would . . . expand the center and
   add a physical therapy room. That is the only thing that is hindering
   our programs -- to have a formal type of exercise program. Emily

   Analysis The IHS National Diabetes Program carried out an analysis of
   the Year 1 grant proposals to determine the scope of activities
   proposed by the applicants and to establish baseline parameters for
   later comparison. The following shows the results of the Year 1
   analysis. Program Emphasis The four Areas of program emphasis addressed
   by grantees in the initial Special Diabetes Programs for Indians were:
   planning, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention (Figure 2). ! 67%

   33 Analysis of Current Grant Program Activities Introduction
   Recognizing that the use of diabetes surveillance statistics alone
   would not reflect the magnitude of changes happening in Indian
   communities as a result of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians
   grant funds, the Indian Health Service decided early on to use a
   variety of evaluation strategies. The results presented in this section
   represent the first set of data collected about the grant activities
   since the initial grant proposals. The purpose of this evaluation
   strategy was to assess successes and barriers and to ask specifically
   what changes had occurred in American Indian and Alaska Native
   communities after two years into this grant program. Method In Fall
   1999, the IHS National Diabetes Program commissioned Macro
   International Inc., a consulting firm with diabetes expertise used
   frequently by the CDC and NIH, to collect information from the grantees
   as part of the grantees' annual reporting process. Packets describing
   the intent for collecting the information and the types of information
   desired were sent to all 318 grant delivery sites in early September
   1999. By the end of October, 1999, 277 service delivery sites (83
   percent) responded with information about the following: ! Special
   emphases of their grant program and intended impact ! Age groups and
   special high risk target groups served ! Methods used and groups
   targeted for: screening, diabetes education, physical activity, and
   nutrition ! Service areas improved or enhanced because of the grant
   funds ! Program infrastructure improved or enhanced because of the
   grant funds ! Staffing needs Special Diabetes Programs for Indians-
   Page 34 Findings Analysis of these data was completed in November 1999.
   Highlights of the analysis are presented below: Program Emphasis on
   Target Age Groups Grant programs emphasize all ages but particularly
   adults and the elderly (Figure 12). ! Eighty percent or more of all
   programs have a major focus on elders (>55 yrs) and Emphasis on Target
