      This page is devoted to the hurricanes and tropical storms of 1999.
          NCDC archives the climatic data, satellite images, and radar data
          related to these storms. A good deal of the surface data collected
          by National Weather Service offices and other airports, as well as
          cooperative stations, is available via the NCDC Get/View Data page.
          NCDC also has images and movies of these events-- Images/Movies of
          Hurricanes and Special Events, along with special reports and
          summaries that put these and other global climate events in
          historical perspective-- Worldwide Weather Events--1999. Finally,
          NCDC reports on the global climate and places monthly temperatures,
          precipitation and extremes in historical perspective-- The Climate
          of 1999.
