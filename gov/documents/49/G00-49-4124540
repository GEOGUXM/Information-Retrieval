   EPAct Fleet Information and Regulations The U.S. Department of Energy's
   Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) is trying to help make
   alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase decisions easier for fleet
   managers and companies across the nation. Many fleets are subject to
   AFV acquisition requirements under Energy Policy Act (EPAct)
   regulations. In order to help companies meet these regulations, OTT has
   developed these online tools:

   Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide
   The Fleet Buyer's Guide was developed to help fleet managers make
   informed decisions about buying AFVs. This comprehensive tool helps
   fleets understand which regulations and incentives apply to them (based
   on their location and company description), shows fleet managers what
   AFVs are available, identifies where refueling stations are located,
   and measures the cost differences of using AFVs versus conventional
   vehicles. Fleet Buyer's Guide flyer (PDF 70 KB) Â— for general
   information. Download Acrobat Reader.

   EPAct Fleet Information and Regulations
   Many fleets are subject to AFV acquisition requirements under EPAct
   regulations. These requirements differ for different types of fleets.
   This site provides information for federal, state/alternative fuel
   provider, and private/local government fleets. State/Alternative Fuel
   Provider fleet managers can report AFV acquisitions to DOE as required
   using the new on-line application for Compliance Reporting.

   AirCRED Online Tool
   This tool helps you calculate ozone emission reduction credits for your
   Clean Cities AFVs. AirCRED is based on the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's MOBILE model combined with emission test
   certification data for new original-equipment-manufacturer AFVs and
   their gasoline- or diesel-fueled counterparts.

   Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle USER Program
   This site supports the expansion of alternative fuel infrastructure by
   concentrating large quantities of federal AFVs and substantially
   increasing the use of alternative fuels in six selected cities.
