                           FNMOC OTIS SST ANALYSIS
                   (Click on picture for current analysis)

   SEAS is a program developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) to provide accurate meteorological and
   oceanographic data in real time from ships at sea through the use of
   satellite data transmission techniques. The system transmits data
   through either the GOES or INMARSAT C satellites to NOAA for use in
   weather, climatological and ocean models such as in the Fleet Numerical
   Oceanography and Meteorology Center (FNMOC) OTIS SST analysis above.
   Our goal on the World Wide Web is to provide information on the past
   and current activities of the NOAA SEAS XBT program.
