    Chesapeake Bay early image

    [chesapeake.jpg]

    Day 2000/066 16:30 UTC.

    MODIS bands 1,4,3 (displayed as red, green, blue) were used to make
    this quasi-true color image of the Chesapeake Bay observed on March
    6th, 2000. The Land Surfance Reflectance product was used to produce
    this image, corrected for atmospheric effects. The MODIS 250m
    resolution multispectral observations clearly discriminate different
    types of vegetation and urban areas in this image.
