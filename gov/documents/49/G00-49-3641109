       DOE-Sponsored Process Enhances Use of Landfill Gas, Improves Air
       Quality
       Energy Secretary Abraham Commends Small Business for Innovative Concept
       Being Showcased Today in New Jersey

     Acrion's demonstration CO2 wash skid treats 140,000 standard cubic feet
       of raw landfill gas per day to produce 1 ton of commercial liquid CO2
                              and 70 million Btu of fuel cell grade methane.

       Columbus, New Jersey - Acrion Technologies Inc., a small business
       sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, is showcasing a method this
       week that could offer a major advancement in reducing pollution at
       municipal landfills where Americans deposit more than 100 million tons
       of garbage every year.

       The garbage creates a major source of air emissions, expelling carbon
       dioxide (CO2) and methane as it decomposes. At an open house today at
       the New Jersey EcoComplex, Acrion is demonstrating how its innovation
       will make it easier to capture the CO2 before it escapes into the
       atmosphere and to use the captured gases for commercial ventures,
       making such "landfill gas-to-energy" projects more environmentally and
       economically attractive.

       "Acrion took a good idea and, in partnership with the federal
       government, made it work," said Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham in
       congratulating the company. "It will be creative ideas like this one
       that will be key to improving the quality of our environment and
       combating the threat of climate change. The Department of Energy is
       pleased to have had a role in fostering the development of this
       technology and helping it evolve to the threshold of commercial
       reality."

       Acrion, based in Cleveland, Ohio, received a small business innovation
       research grant from the Energy Department in 1998. With the federal
       backing, the company developed a process called "CO2 Wash" which it
       initially tested at a New York site.

       Now, with follow-on funding from the department's National Energy
       Technology Laboratory, the company has scaled up the process at the New
       Jersey EcoComplex. Acrion's first step to commercialize the innovation
       will be seen at an open house today where visitors touring the
       EcoComplex will have an opportunity to see and ask questions about the
       Acrion CO2 Wash system.

       Since it began operating this summer, the system has been processing
       gases captured from decomposing waste at the Burlington County
       landfill. After moisture is removed, the gases are compressed and fed
       into the bottom of the unit's three-story high column. As the gases
       drift upward, refrigeration at the top of the column condenses the CO2
       into liquid form. A portion of the liquid CO2 washes down the column,
       cleansing volatile organic contaminants from the gas.

       Clean, high-grade fuel gas exits the top and can be used directly in
       turbines, boilers or fuel cells to generate electricity. Methane
       produced from Acrion's CO2 Wash is 2 to 3 times cleaner than required
       by fuel cells which can convert the hydrogen-rich gas into electricity
       without using combustion. The landfill gas could also be further
       processed into methanol or upgraded to pipeline specifications,
       depending on local market needs.

       The small stream of contaminant-laden CO2 that is used to wash out
       impurities in the landfill gas is vaporized and burned in a flare to
       destroy the volatile organic compounds.

       The CO2 not used for the wash is drawn off as a 99.99 percent pure
       liquid CO2 stream that can be used in a variety of commercial
       applications, from making dry ice to carbonating soft drinks. One
       option Acrion is examining is to pipe the CO2 to Burlington County's
       R&D Greenhouse and Resource Recovery Complex, where "Jersey Fresh"
       tomatoes and other plants would benefit from the CO2-enriched
       environment. Acrion is also providing samples of the pure liquid CO2 to
       distributors and consumers for analysis and testing in commercial
       applications.

       Acrion's innovation is expected to add to the growing interest in using
       landfill gas as a renewable energy resource. Current federal law
       requires many landfills to collect the gas and dispose of it in one of
       two ways: either flare the gas, or install a "landfill gas-to-energy"
       system.

       According to the Environmental Protection Agency, every 1 million tons
       of waste deposited in landfills produces enough landfill gas to
       generate 7 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year, enough for
       700 homes. Using this gas for energy purposes, rather than expelling it
       into the atmosphere, is equivalent to removing more than 6,000 cars
       from the road, or planting 8,300 acres of trees.
