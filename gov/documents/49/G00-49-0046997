   Mission Statement
   The mission of the Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture
   Research Center is to conduct aquaculture research to address the
   highest priority needs of the U.S. aquaculture industry. The Center's
   research programs focus primarily in three areas: 1) Production Systems
   Research including development of feeds and improved culture strategies
   for warmwater fish species, other than catfish, such as hybrid striped
   bass, baitfish, ornamental fish and carp; 2) Disease Therapeutics
   Evaluation and Registration Research for catfish, trout, tilapia,
   baitfish, and hybrid striped bass; and 3) Bird Depredation Research
   including development of practical dispersal and barrier technologies
   for control of fish-eating birds on fish farms.

   History
   The Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Center was
   authorized by The Fish Rice Rotation Act of 1958, under the name U.S
   Fish Farming Experiment Laboratory, U.S. Department of the Interior. In
   1958, 86 acres of land were purchased near Stuttgart, Arkansas. In
   1961, an office building, laboratory, garage and fish-holding facility
   were constructed. The FFEL was officially dedicated October 21, 1962.
   Additional construction resulted in 86 ponds(ranging in size from
   0.1-3.0 acres), a wet laboratory building, a garage and two buildings
   for chemical and oil storage. In 1992, a state-of-the-art 18,000 ft²
   laboratory was added to increase the research capability of the
   facility. In 1996, Congress transferred the Center to the Agricultural
   Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of the Farm
   Bill.

   Description

   The Center's Research Facilities include an 18,000 ft² bench research
   laboratory. The building includes space for computerized information
   retrieval and
   conference areas. Other laboratory facilities include a 3,700 ft² wet
   laboratory equipped for multi-use aquaria and tank studies with the
   capability of being
   supplied with several temperatures of well water and pond water. A
   2,700 ft² auxiliary building is equipped with a feeds manufacturing
   pilot plant, a fish disease
   wet laboratory with associated aquaria, and a fish disease laboratory.
   A newly completed 8,000 ft² tank farm is equipped with 120 4-foot
   diameter fiberglass fish
   holding tanks. Other buildings located on the 136-acre site include a
   1,700 ft² mechanical shop, a 3,700 ft² personnel support building, a
   600 ft² plumbing and
   metal fabrication building, a water filtration and purification plant,
   and various other storage buildings. Research pond facilities include
   36 0.1-acre, 36 0.25-acre
   and 9 1.0-acre earthen ponds in addition to 2 1.5-acre earthen raceways
   and a 27-acre water reservoir. Water for the research ponds and wet
   laboratories is
   obtained from 3 deep wells with a total capacity exceeding 2,500
   gallons per minute.
