   About Information Sciences
   Internet Technologies
   Information Management
   Through their information management skills, DIS staff members help
   customers compile, integrate, and easily access the information they
   need to function effectively and efficiently as they carry out their
   organization's missions.

   Information Sciences:
     * Supports information dissemination, analysis, and decision making
       with custom information management systems and infrastructures
     * Integrates advanced information-handling technologies to structure
       and organize massive data repositories
     * Pioneers prototype systems and tools for the representation of
       quantitative, qualitative, and spatial information

   [pyramid.gif] Research focuses on information-handling technologies to:
     * Structure and organize massive data repositories
     * Provide easy access through custom interfaces and tools

   Computer scientists work with applied systems, commercial tools, and
   emerging technologies being developed by the university research
   community and information systems developers.

   Projects are customer-focused and use an integrated systems approach:
     * Begin with the end-users -- consider their needs, challenges, and
       constraints
     * Encompass the total system -- users, interface, hardware, software,
       and networking -- and the interrelationships among these elements
     * Use an interactive, rapid-prototyping process that involves
       customers in the production of the final system
