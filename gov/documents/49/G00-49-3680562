          NASA's Earth Observatory

   Earth Observatory Navigation Bar



                                   MISSION

   The purpose of NASA's Earth Observatory is to provide a
   freely-accessible publication on the Internet where the public can
   obtain new satellite imagery and scientific information about our home
   planet. The focus is on Earth's climate and environmental change. In
   particular, we hope our site is useful to public media and educators.
   Any and all materials published on the Earth Observatory are freely
   available for re-publication or re-use, except where copyright is
   indicated. We ask that NASA's Earth Observatory be given credit for its
   original materials.

   We encourage Earth scientists and science writers from all NASA
   centers, as well as all agencies and universities affiliated with
   NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, to submit articles and/or images for
   publication on the Earth Observatory. Prospective contributing authors
   and graphic artists should refer to our Online Style Guide before
   submitting.
