   Cosmology: The Study of the Universe
      Cosmology is the scientific study of the large scale properties of the
      Universe as a whole. It endeavors to use the scientific method to
      understand the origin, evolution and ultimate fate of the entire
      Universe. Like any field of science, cosmology involves the formation
      of theories or hypotheses about the universe which make specific
      predictions for phenomena that can be tested with observations.
      Depending on the outcome of the observations, the theories will need to
      be abandoned, revised or extended to accommodate the data. The
      prevailing theory about the origin and evolution of our Universe is the
      so-called Big Bang theory discussed at length in the pages linked
      below. This primer in cosmological concepts is organized as follows.
      The main concepts of the Big Bang theory are introduced in the first
      section with scant regard to actual observations. The second section
      discusses the classic tests of the Big Bang theory that make it so
      compelling as an apparently valid description of our universe. The
      third section discusses observations that highlight limitations of the
      Big Bang theory and point to a more detailed model of cosmology than
      the Big Bang theory alone provides. As discussed in the first section,
      the Big Bang theory predicts a range of possibilities for the structure
      and evolution of the universe. The final section discusses what
      constraints we can place on the nature of our universe based on current
      data, and indicates how MAP will further our understanding of
      cosmology.

   Foundations of the Big Bang theory

      Theoretical pillars
             General Relativity and the Cosmological Principle give rise to
             the Big Bang theory.

      Concepts of the Big Bang theory
             The Big Bang theory makes definite predictions for the structure
             and evolution of the universe that depend on the nature and
             amount of matter in the universe.

      Observational tests of the Big Bang theory

      Expansion of the universe
             Edwin Hubble's 1929 observation that galaxies were generally
             receding from us provided the first clue that the Big Bang
             theory might be right.

      Abundance of the light elements H, He, Li
             The Big Bang theory predicts that these light elements should
             have been fused from protons and neutrons in the first few
             minutes after the Big Bang.

      The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
             The early universe should have been very hot. The cosmic
             microwave background radiation is the remnant heat leftover from
             the Big Bang.

   Limitations and extensions of the Big Bang theory

      Structure in the universe
             The Big Bang theory makes no attempt to explain how structures
             like stars and galaxies came to exist in the universe.

      Fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
             The temperature of the CMB is observed to vary slightly across
             the sky. What produced these fluctuations and how do they relate
             to stars and galaxies?

      The fine tuning of the universe
             The universe we live in appears to be very unlikely in the
             context of the standard Big Bang theory. Is there some mechanism
             that forces it to be that way?

      The inflationary universe
             A very short, but especially rapid burst of growth in the very
             early universe (inflation) provides an elegant, yet untested,
             explanation of the above puzzles.

   Our universe

      Matter in the universe
             The amount and type of matter in the universe is fundamental in
             determining the properties of our universe. How much matter is
             there? Is it mostly ordinary matter (composed of protons,
             neutrons, electrons and/or photons) or a more exotic form not
             yet observed in the laboratory?

      Measuring expansion
             How fast is the universe currently expanding? How do we measure
             this?

      The age of the universe
             We can estimate the age of the universe from its current
             expansion rate. We can place a lower limit to the age of the
             universe by estimating the age of the oldest known stars. Are
             these numbers compatible?

      The shape of the universe
             Is our universe open and infinite, closed and finite, or just
             hovering on the flat boundary between the two?

      The accelerating universe
             Rather than slowing down, the expansion of our universe appears
             to be speeding up! One possible source of this acceleration is a
             form of energy called the cosmological constant, or a variant
             of it called quintessence.

      The fate of the universe
             Will the universe continue to expand forever, or eventually
             collapse?
