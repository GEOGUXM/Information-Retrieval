                                About WFF/GFO

Summary

   The Navy's Geosat Follow-On (GFO) Mission, launched on Feruary 10,
   1998, is the latest in a series of altimetric satellites which include
   Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, and TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P). Data derived from
   these missions has and will lead to vast improvements in our knowledge
   of ocean circulation, ice sheet topography, and climate change. In
   order to capture the maximum amount of information from the altimetric
   data, accurate altimeter calibrations are required for the civilian
   data set which NOAA will produce. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center
   (GSFC) has provided these products for the Geosat and T/P missions and
   will do the same for GFO.

   GFO has the same 17-day repeat period orbit as the Geosat "Exact Repeat
   Mission" (800 km altitude). Unlike Geosat, GFO is tracked by two
   extremely accurate tracking systems: satellite laser ranging (SLR) and
   the Global Positioning System (GPS). Accordingly, the spacecraft
   carries a laser retro-reflector array and Turbo-Rogue GPS receivers.
   These tracking data, especially in combination, can support GFO orbit
   accuracies approaching those achieved on T/P despite the lower altitude
   and increased atmospheric drag modeling errors.

   Given precise knowledge of the spacecraft's position, it is imperative
   that the altimeter's performance be calibrated and monitored if the
   data are to be used for precision oceanographic applications and ice
   sheet mapping. Unlike T/P, the GFO altimeter is single frequency.
   Therefore, an ionospheric correction must be modeled or computed.
   Additionally, pre-launch analysis of temperature and voltage
   dependencies and return waveform effects as well as post-launch
   determination of corrections for seastate and attitude based on the
   calibrated waveform are required. Post-launch instrument-related drifts
   must also be determined. The Navy applications for the GFO data do not
   require an absolute range calibration and they will not perform one.
   However, the Navy has agreed to provide the required GFO altimeter
   calibration data to other agencies interested in absolute range
   applications.

Activity

  Background

   The Observational Science Branch (Code 972) of GSFC Wallops Flight
   Facility (WFF) has provided altimeter calibration for all U.S.
   altimeter missions including Skylab, GEOS-3, Seasat, Geosat, and T/P.
   WFF has provided the pre-launch algorithms necessary to correct the
   TOPEX altimeter instrument data. These corrections have proven to be
   better than 1 centimeter after three years of scientific applications.
   Post-launch range and sigma-0 measurement drift values are known to
   within a few millimeters and 0.03 dB levels, respectively. The
   oceanographic community would not have been able to produce the
   acclaimed considerable body of results from T/P without the altimeter
   calibration.

   Mr. Robert Cheney's group at NOAA will produce the GFO geophysical data
   records (GDR) for distribution to the scientific community via CD-ROM.
   As is currently done for Geosat, the NASA Ocean Altimeter Pathfinder
   group will provide algorithm support for the GDR generation as well as
   producing higher level data sets. Similarly, the NASA Ice Sheet
   Altimetry Pathfinder group will evaluate the GFO over-ice altimeter
   waveforms and provide measurements of ice sheet topography to the polar
   science community.

  Altimeter Calibration Overview

   WFF processed all the TOPEX altimeter pre-launch test data and verified
   the altimeter calibrations and corrections. This led to the development
   of an exact tracker model used to compute range corrections. The
   Automatic Gain Control (AGC) calibration provided spacecraft
   temperature-corrected sigma-0 to better than 0.05 dB. Consequently, the
   electromagnetic bias estimate, which is based on the windspeed derived
   from sigma-0, reflected subcentimeter temperature effects. This
   pre-launch effort allowed the TOPEX/POSEIDON Ground System to produce
   useful TOPEX data from the first turn-on. The algorithms have proven to
   be quite robust and no changes have been required. In the post-launch
   phase, WFF's complete understanding of the altimeter and its data
   allowed for quick modeling of the TOPEX waveform leakages and update to
   the corrections. WFF continually performs calibration monitoring for
   the TOPEX altimeter and has created databases useful for trend
   analyses. These detailed performance studies have resulted in
   corrections which have proven to be better than 1 centimeter after
   three years of scientific applications. A similar activity will be
   performed for the GFO radar altimeter. WFF will:
     * Perform analysis on GFO pre-launch test data to characterize the
       altimeter's performance and to obtain pre-launch calibration data
       needed for absolute range applications.
     * Perform analysis on GFO inflight data to characterize the
       altimeter's performance and to provide post-launch instrument
       calibrations needed for absolute range applications.
     * Perform trend analysis for the calibration of range to correct for
       instrument drifts over the life of GFO.

   WFF has been working with the Navy GFO program to define the pre-launch
   data and testing needed to provide for the calibration of the altimeter
   instrument. David Hancock of WFF has been invited to be a member of the
   Navy pre- and post-launch GFO altimeter calibration team.

  Pre-launch Altimeter Calibration

   Pre-launch, WFF worked with the Applied Physics Lab of Johns Hopkins
   University (JHU/APL) to analyze GFO test data to determine any
   dependence of science parameters on the altimeter characteristics. The
   pre-launch test data was used by the Navy to determine GFO altimeter
   initial calibrations and data corrections. This phase included helping
   to define pre-launch test requirements, receiving test data, and
   performing test data analysis. The GFO altimeter is much like the TOPEX
   Ku altimeter. WFF has converted pre-launch TOPEX processing software to
   ingest GFO data to perform similar analyses and to create similar
   databases. The waveform modeling will be modified to the GFO parameters
   and tracker to provide the needed tracker bias range corrections. WFF
   performed analysis on a limited set of pre-launch GFO data (for TOPEX,
   extensive analysis was performed on all test data) to determine
   instrument effects on the science data (range, SWH, AGC). The results
   have been provided to the GFO project and other users.

   As part of the Navy team, WFF visited Ball Aerospace System Division
   (BASD) to witness testing and collect data. While working with the Navy
   and BASD, WFF assisted in collecting a number of one-time data products
   needed by other non-Navy users such as the POD team; measurement of
   center of mass and of spacecraft dimensions are among these one-time
   data products. Data was made available as requested to other users to
   support their modeling and software development. A set of pre-launch
   instrument calibrations was made available. WFF converted some of their
   TOPEX inflight processing to ingest GFO data and create databases.

  Post-launch Altimeter Calibration

   In the initial post-launch phase, WFF will examine the GFO data to
   insure that engineering corrections were applied correctly and to
   validate the pre-launch instrument calibrations. WFF will perform
   analysis of inflight data to develop waveform-based seastate and
   attitude corrections to be provided to the GFO project and the user
   community. WFF will continue to work as a member of the Navy
   calibration team and will request that a few special tests that were
   found useful in the calibration of the TOPEX altimeter be performed.
   The first few months of inflight GFO altimeter data will be used for a
   more intensive study period to finalize the tracker corrections and
   provide an assessment of instrument performance. A set of post-launch
   instrument calibrations will be made available.

   Throughout the remainder of the mission, WFF will continue to perform
   monitoring of the GFO altimeter to determine the corrections for any
   instrument-related range and sigma-0 measurement drifts. Altimeter
   performance databases similar to those used for the TOPEX altimeter
   will be maintained. WFF plans to continue to be an active member of the
   Navy calibration team. Updates to correct the altimeter calibration for
   changes/drifts during the mission will be provided as required to the
   Navy, NOAA GFO GDR production, NASA Altimeter Pathfinder programs, and
   other interested users.
