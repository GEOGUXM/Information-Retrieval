   About Your Duplicate Income Tax Statement

   The Duplicate Income Tax Statement is a copy of the tax statement
   issued by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). This statement details
   payments made to you for the requested tax year. You will receive a
   general information letter with explanations of items in the
   statement.  Your statement will be mailed to the address we have on
   record. Click here to see samples of the tax statements.
