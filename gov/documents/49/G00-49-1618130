   NIST and NFPA's first report on the sublethal effects of fire smoke
   contains:
     * estimates of the magnitude and impact of sublethal exposures to
       fire smoke on the U.S. population,
     * the best available lethal and incapacitating toxic potency values
       for fire smoke,
     * determination of the potential for various sizes of fires to
       produce smoke yields that could result in sublethal health effects,
     * state-of-the-art information on the production of the condensed
       components of smoke from fires and their changes during transport
       from the fire.

   NIST's Solar Photovoltaic System
   A portion of the energy used at the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD is
   being provided by renewable energy. The solar system will reduce the
   quantity of electricity purchased to power the NIST campus and reduce
   the monthly peak demand charges.


   Summary of Federal Construction, Building, and Housing Related Research
   & Development in FY 1999
   (PDF file).  The RAND Corporation has completed its search of the
   Research and Development in the United States (RaDiUS) database for all
   FY 1999 federally funded R&D activities related to construction and
   building.  The search was funding by the NSTC Subcommittee on
   Construction and Building and PATH.  This report presents the results
   of this search. The MS Excel file of the database results is also
   available.

   Prospectus on BFRL History
   . This prospectus provides a preliminary description of the project for
   your comments.


   Factsheets,
   providing fire safety information especially for people living in
   manufactured housing.


   NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator and Smokeview
   - The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator predicts smoke and/or air flow
   movement caused by fire, wind, ventilation systems etc. Smokeview
   visualizes the predictions generated by NIST FDS.


   FASTData
   A collection of over 450 tests ranging from cone calorimeter tests of
   single materials and assemblies to real-scale tests of single- and
   multiple-compartment configurations. Plots of data include focus on
   heat release rate, but additional plots including temperatures, species
   concentration, mass loss, and flows are included for some tests.
