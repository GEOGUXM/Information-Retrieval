   Technical Information

   The objective of this Web site is to provide the public with
   up-to-date, reliable, and official information on the management of the
   Nation's Marine Sanctuaries, and the scientific, educational, and
   resource protection activities that are being carried on for their
   protection and preservation. Additionally, we provide, and will expand
   in the months ahead, offerings on the sanctuaries themselves (their
   natural environments, management programs, and suggestions to
   visitors), special events, such as scientific missions and educational
   forums, and a photo gallery with high quality imagery from each of
   twelve sanctuaries.

   We much appreciate your comments. Please email them to:
   NMScomments@noaa.gov.

   Descriptions of Content Sections

   The National Program provides information on the history of marine
   sanctuaries in the United States and the legislation which established
   the program. Future offerings will include the process for designating
   a site, descriptions of candidate sites, and principal documents
   governing national marine sanctuary activities.

   Our Marine Sanctuaries provides a closeup view of each sanctuary. The
   description provides information on the physical and biological
   environments, sanctuary management, science and education programs, and
   information and tips for visitors.

   These descriptions also include links to local sanctuaries Web sites
   which contain a wealth of additional information. These sanctuary
   closeups will be expanded in the future to include interviews with
   sanctuary managers, essays on the cultural and historic importance of
   the sanctuaries, and more detailed information on habitats and
   biological communities. Additionally, a 3-D map of each sanctuary is
   now under development and should be available by the fall of 1999.

   Sanctuary News is a regularly updated on-line newsletter that
   summarizes sanctuary happenings and notable events. The newsletter
   presents feature articles, a calendar of events, and a bulletin board.

   The Sustainable Seas Expeditions pages provide a series of scientific,
   educational, and technical offerings related to NOAA's activities in
   the Sustainable Seas Expeditions. Specific offerings include
   descriptions of major science projects and the scientists undertaking
   them, a variety of educational materials from descriptions of
   educational projects to summaries of student summits, and maps and data
   developed during individual missions. Additional information on the
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions can be found at the official of the
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions Web site at sustainableseas.noaa.gov.

   The Photo Gallery presents the visual story of each sanctuary with 50
   to 80 fully annotated photographs. Photographs are presented in five
   theme areas: The Living Sanctuary, Habitats, Sustainable Seas
   Expeditions, People and the Sanctuary, and the Kids Gallery featuring
   art works by children. Future offerings will include selected video
   pieces.

   Special Offerings hosts special World Wide Web events, such as daily
   logs from a scientific expedition and educational forums. It will also
   present notable science and research activities.

   Technical Information

   Browsers - This site is designed to be completely compatible with
   Netscape Navigator (v3.0 and above, recommended) or Microsoft Internet
   Explorer (v3.0 and above, recommended); however, other browsers can
   also be used.

   Access Time - Many pages on this site contain several photographs. The
   purpose of these photographs is to enhance the visual appeal of the
   page and provide supplemental information. Images have been provided
   with captions that allow those readers who do not load images
   immediately, to select specific images for viewing.

   Fonts and Type Sizes - Arial is the default font for this site; 12
   point is the default size. All browsers allow users to select specific
   fonts and type sizes for display. Some users select large type sizes
   for ease of reading, or specific fonts for personal tastes. The text
   and layout should not be adversely affected by a user's selection of
   alternative fonts and type sizes.

   Printing Pages - This site has been designed to ensure simple printing.
   We recommend printing in portrait format.

   Downloadable Documents - A number of large, complex documents are
   available on this site as downloadable files in Portable Document
   Format (pdf). These files can be viewed on microcomputers equipped with
   recent versions of the (free) Adobe Acrobat Reader. Some documents may
   also have either thumbnail views or bookmarks within the Acrobat
   document; these additional navigation features may remain hidden
   without first activating an optional menu selection.

   Adobe has a large collection of support resources if you have problems
   installing or using the Acrobat Reader software.

   Navigation - Navigation through the site is straightforward. There are
   five levels of hierarchy, most of which are always visible to the user.
   The first and second levels are with the tabs at the top of the page.
   Tabs are color coded for easy reference. The third level is in the
   right column, as buttons. The fourth level is either at the top of the
   page, or occasionally, on the right, as a pulldown menu. The fifth
   level are text links at the top of the page.

   This site is complex and also references other sites. Back and forward
   buttons have been added to each page to ease complex navigation through
   difficult links. These buttons are primarily visual clues and function
   precisely as the standard forward and backward buttons in the browser.
