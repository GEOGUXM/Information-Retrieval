   Watershed Infrastructure

        Local project sponsors (with NRCS assistance) have constructed
   over 10,000 small flood control dams in America. Many of the dams are
   nearing the end of their design life. Rehabilitation of these dams is
   quickly becoming a major issue for the many people who are affected by
   these watershed projects. The following information provides background
   and case studies of rehabilitation needs of watershed dams across the
   nation.

   Upstream Flood Control Dams: A Growing National Concern
       More than 50 years ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was
   first authorized by Congress to help local communities with upstream
   flood control and watershed protection.
       Today, there is growing national interest and concern that many of
   the early upstream flood control dams that resulted (from the Flood
   Control Act of 1944 and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention
   Act of 1954) are at or near the end of their 50-year design life and
   pose a public safety issue.
       Most of these small, upstream flood control dams resemble large
   farm ponds. They are part of a full complement of land and water
   conservation practices on private lands aimed at the basic conservation
   principle of holding the raindrop high in the watershed as close to
   where it strikes the land as possible.
       The Small Watershed Program has a 50-year tradition of protecting
   lives and property and conserving natural resources. Administered by
   the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the watershed
   program assists local communities with technical and financial
   assistance to take a comprehensive approach to address local natural
   resource concerns.

   Public Safety Concerns
       Local communities, with assistance from NRCS, have constructed more
   than 10,000 upstream flood control dams since 1948. Many of the older
   small dams have significant rehabilitation needs. Some pose a threat to
   public safety to those downstream from the dams or who use the
   reservoirs as a source of drinking water. Other dams have the potential
   for creating adverse environmental impacts in the same downstream
   floodplain that they have been protecting.

   Benefits of Watershed Protection Projects
       Watershed projects, which are organized and operated by local
   sponsors, provide flood control, municipal and irrigation water supply,
   recreation, erosion control, and wildlife habitat enhancement on more
   than 130 million acres in the nation.
       The nation's Small Watershed Program yields annual benefits of more
   than $800 million annually. Projects reduce flooding to prime farmland,
   highways, communities, and residences, and conserve natural resources.
   They are an integral part of communities in every state in the nation.
   They provide a $14 billion national infrastructure investment and
   beneficially impact thousands of people's lives every day.

   Time Takes Its Toll
       Many project areas now are in a far different setting than when
   they were originally constructed. Population has grown, development has
   occurred upstream and downstream from the small dams, land use changes
   have taken place, sediment pools have filled, structural components
   have deteriorated, and many do not meet state dam safety regulations
   that have been enacted and revised with more stringent requirements
   since the dams were built.
       Many of these dams lie in upstream agricultural areas and are
   unknown to most residents who are protected by them. Many are quietly
   deteriorating as time takes its toll on their components. Unless
   something is done to rehabilitate or, in some cases, to remove them,
   they pose a public safety issue.
       A recent survey of known rehabilitation needs in 22 states revealed
   that more than 2,200 dams need rehabilitation at an estimated cost of
   more than $540 million.
       The cost of rehabilitation will only increase with time, as
   deterioration increases and construction costs go up.

   Rehabilitation Opportunities
       In addition to addressing human health and safety issues,
   rehabilitation provides opportunities for communities to provide new
   benefits, such as adding municipal and irrigation water supplies,
   firefighting water sources, recreation, and wetland and wildlife
   enhancements.
       All rehabilitated dams will meet all state and federal
   environmental and safety standards.
       In limited cases, where flood control can be achieved by other
   measures, dams may even be removed and the site restored to natural
   conditions to the extent possible.

   Technological Advances
       Today, technology advances, design and construction experience, and
   updating of design criteria have improved the safety of dams. Design
   methods are much more sophisticated than when early dams were designed
   and built.
       Emerging technologies can also be applied to help make older dams
   safer. Robotic cameras can inspect pipes, sediment volume in reservoirs
   can be determined by seismic investigation, pollutants in the sediment
   can be determined by chemical testing, and improved flood warning
   systems can be installed.

                        Upstream Flood Control Dams:
                         A Growing National Concern

   Q. How many small dams have been installed by communities with the
   assistance of the Natural Resources Conservation Service watershed
   protection programs?
   A. More than 10,000 small dams have been installed in 46 states since
   1948 (the four states where watershed dams are not located: Washington,
   Delaware, Rhode Island, and Alaska).

   Q. How old are the small watershed dams?
   A. The average age of the 10,000 watershed dams in the nation is 30
   years old. Over 250 dams are more than 45 years old (almost 50 are
   greater than 50 years old). Within the next 10 years, more than 1,300
   dams will reach 50 years old.

   Q. What happens when a dam reaches the end of its life span?
   A. Time takes it toll on dams. Reservoirs fill with sediment, metal and
   concrete deteriorate, land use conditions upstream from the dam change
   and increase the volume of water being delivered to the site, and many
   do not meet current dam safety requirements.

   Q: Who planned, designed, and constructed the dams?
   A: Local communities, with technical and financial assistance from the
   Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation
   Service).

   Q: Who owns the dams?
   A: Local communities, who are the sponsors of the watershed project.

   Q: Who is responsible for the annual operations and maintenance of the
   small dams?
   A: Local communities, who are the sponsors of the watershed project.

   Q: When a small dam reaches the end of its life span, what options do
   local communities have?
   A: Dams can be rebuilt or rehabilitated so they can function for a long
   time in the future (100 years or more). General options include raising
   the dam to provide additional storage or dredging the sediment and
   replacing metal components. In some cases where flood control is no
   longer needed downstream, the dam can be removed and the site restored
   to natural conditions to the extent possible.

   Q: If NRCS assists the local community with any of these options, what
   environmental considerations are there?
   A: If USDA assists with rehabilitation of the dams, federal
   environmental laws must be met, including consideration of
   environmental and cultural impacts of any proposed work.

   Q: What benefits do these small dams provide?
   A:
     * Flood control -- by temporarily detaining runoff that has flowed to
       the dam and safely releasing it downstream through a pipe through
       the dam.
     * Improved water quality -- by settling out contaminants and sediment
       in the reservoir, thus protecting downstream streams and rivers.
     * Water supply -- by storing the water during rainy seasons for use
       by communities or agricultural irrigation later in the year when it
       is needed for crop production.
     * Drinking water -- by storing water in the reservoir for use by
       municipal and industrial entities.
     * Fish and wildlife habitat -- by improving wetland and vegetative
       habitat that creates better shelter and food sources.
     * Habitat to threatened and endangered species -- by creation of
       special features to enhance and protect threatened and endangered
       species.
     * Wetland habitat -- by creating vegetative riparian areas along the
       upper reaches of the reservoir.
     * Restoration of riparian habitat -- by providing protection of
       downstream channel areas that allow vegetative growth and
       improvement of the riparian areas.
     * Recreation for local residents -- by providing a source of quality
       fishing, hunting, picnicking, etc.
     * Fire protection in rural communities -- by providing a supply of
       water to be used for fire fighting.

   Q: What level of flood protection do most small dams provide?
   A: Most dams provide protection of downstream areas from storms that
   occur less than once every 25 years.

   Q: What happens when a greater storm event occurs?
   A: Each dam is designed with an auxiliary spillway constructed around
   one end of the dam that safely conveys excess flow around the dam, thus
   protecting it from overtopping and failure.

   Q: How long were the dams designed to function?
   A: The majority of the 10,000 dams were designed with a 50-year design
   life.

   Q: What is the typical size of these small dams?
   A: Generally, small watershed dams are between 25 and 60 feet in
   height. These dams create lakes that range in size from a few acres to
   several hundred acres in size.

   Q: What materials are the small dams built with?
   A: Most dams are built with compacted earth with metal or concrete
   pipes that draw down water that is temporarily detained behind the dams
   after storms.

   Q: Where are the small dams located on the landscape?
   A: Typically, small watershed dams are located on drainageways that are
   generally dry or have very little flow except following rainstorms.
   Very few dams are placed on larger drainageways that actually flow
   year-round.

   Q: Have any of the small dams built under the Small Watershed Program
   ever failed?
   A: To date, no dams have failed that have resulted in loss of life or
   property. However, some have had significant problems that have been
   corrected before a catastrophic failure or tragedy has occurred. These
   occurrences will undoubtedly increase as the dams get older.

   Q: How much water do these small dams typically hold?
   A: The lakes created by these dams typically hold between 100 and 5,000
   acre-feet of water.

   Q: How much floodwater do these small dams typically detain?
   A: These dams contain as much as several thousand acre-feet of
   floodwater before it is slowly released downstream after a rainstorm.

   Q: How long is floodwater typically detained behind these small dams?
   A: Floodwater is typically detained from 5 to 20 days behind the dams
   after a rainstorm.

   Q: Are local communities, farmers, and ranchers required to install
   soil and water conservation practices in the watershed above each of
   the small dams?
   A: Conservation practices are required to be installed within the
   drainage areas above the dams to protect them from excessive soil
   erosion and sedimentation. Many of these conservation practices are
   also aging and must be rebuilt. A minimum of 50 percent of the needed
   conservation practices and management techniques must be implemented
   prior to a dam being constructed or rebuilt.
