                          YOUTH OPPORTUNITY GRANTS

   The Youth Opportunity Grants authorized in the 1998 Workforce
   Investment Act (WIA) offer a chance to make a significant impact on
   concentrated poverty and unemployment in this country. As a complement
   to Job Corps, School-to-Work, and formula-funded youth programs, Youth
   Opportunity Grants provide the Department of Labor with a means to
   saturate targeted high-poverty urban and rural communities with
   sufficient resources to cause a significant drop in youth unemployment
   and idleness in these communities.
