   For movie stills using JPEG images
          JPEG's are much smaller than GIF's and so this page will load
          faster if you are using a slow link. However, not all web
          browsers support the JPEG format for inline images. These images
          will also appear a bit fuzzier than the GIFs due to compresion
          artifacts.

   For movie stills using GIF images
          The GIFs are about 3 times larger than the JPEGs, but at least
          every browser will be able to display the GIFs.
