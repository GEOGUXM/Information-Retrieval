     Description

     The November 5, 1996 Presidential General election will be the third
     time that the California Secretary of States office is posting live
     election results on the Internet.

     The initial project was conducted with the help of Digital Equipment
     Corporation during the 1994 general election and was limited to the
     results of statewide races and initiatives.

     Earlier this year, we again teamed up with Digital to produce our
     primary election server which included legislative races, improved
     graphics and additional voting information.

     This site for the general election has been prepared entirely by the
     staff at the Secretary of States office and is our first election
     site without the assistance of a public-private partnership.

     We hope you will enjoy the site and let us know what you think of
     it.

     Please address comments and questions to Vote96@ss.ca.gov.

   Browsers

     This web site has been developed using both Netscape Navigator 3.0
     and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. Experience with our Secretary
     of State Home Page indicates that well over 90% of the visitors to
     our site are using one of these two Web browsers.

     Certain features of this site - HTML tables with graphical content
     or colored backgrounds, for example - do not display properly with
     some other Web browsers. Since the majority of our visitors use one
     of these two products, we have designed the site with them in mind.

     On the other hand, we recognize that there are some special
     situations that require other technology. This is explained below in
     Text-Only Navigation.

     For your convenience, we have provided links here to the Netscape
     and Microsoft sites where you can obtain the latest versions of
     their software. If you wish to upgrade now, simply click on one of
     the buttons below.

   Text-Only Navigation

     Feedback from our March Primary Election Web Site indicated the need
     to be able to navigate the site using textual links only. Some
     visitors are using browsers that only display text. These are often
     made available by schools, libraries and other public entities. Some
     people are using slow dial-up connections and must turn off the
     display of graphics in their browsers.

     More significant though, are our visually impaired visitors who
     listen to our site by passing the output of a text-only browser such
     as Lynx into a special voice synthesizer. Unfortunately, we
     discovered too late that visitors such as these were not able to
     move from page to page on our Primary Election site due to its
     dependence on clickable image maps.

     For this election, we have kept the essential "look and feel" of the
     site while enhancing it with textual links that mimic the operation
     of the graphical ones. We hope this enables even more people to have
     access to the important information here.

     If you are one of our visitors who must use text links only, we
     would like to hear any suggestions you might have for improving the
     navigability of this site in that manner. Please send them to
     Vote96@ss.ca.gov and we will see if we can incorporate them.
