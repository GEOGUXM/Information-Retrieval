                  Portable Document Format (PDF) Help Page

                                 About PDFs

   Portable Document Format is one of the more common file types that make
   up publications on geopubs. In general, PDFs are provided for onscreen
   viewing, but we also use PDF as a reliable way to print page-size
   documents. We also provide PDFs of large map sheets. Although PDFs can
   be plotted, we have found that PostScript (.ps) file or Encapsulated
   PostScript (.eps) files are slightly more reliable when plotting large
   map sheets. In particular, PDFs aren't as true to scale.

   The term "printing" as used here refers to printing page-size (8.5- x
   11-inch) or somewhat larger documents. The term "plotting" refers to
   using a large-format (36-inches wide and beyond) plotter. In some cases
   (particularly for our I-map series), we provide two different
   PostScript versions of a map when it is too large to be plotted on a
   36-inch-wide plotter.

   To view a PDF file, you must have Acrobat Reader, which is available
   free from Adobe Software. A link to the download page for the current
   version of Acrobat Reader (5.0) is provided on every publication on
   geopubs that includes PDF documents.

                     Version Number Makes a Difference!

   Some PDFs (namely, page-size documents) can be viewed with Acrobat
   Reader version 3.0, version 4.0, or version 5.0. However, any document
   that is larger than 45 inches by 45 inches CANNOT be viewed with
   Acrobat Reader version 3.0. In many cases, Acrobat Reader version 3.0
   will open a file containing a large map, but it will display a blank
   screen with no error message. This is a frequently encountered problem
   for users. To download the latest version of Acrobat Reader for free,
   visit the Adobe website.

                       Accessibility of PDF Documents

   If you use a screen reader to navigate on the world wide web, not all
   PDF documents at this site (geopubs.wr.usgs.gov) are currently
   accessible. However, it is our goal to make all our documents
   accessible to everyone.

   The first step to using PDF documents is getting a copy of Acrobat
   Reader, which is available for free. Adobe maintains a text-only
   download page on their website for Acrobat Reader.

   Adobe maintains another website that includes many tools, resources,
   and information to help people with visual disabilities work with PDF
   documents.

   There will be a difference in the tools you need to use PDF with a
   screen reader depending on which version of Acrobat Reader you have. If
   you do not have any copies of Acrobat Reader, the best choice is to
   install Acrobat Reader version 5.0. If you already have a copy of
   Acrobat Reader version 4.0, you will need to download the Adobe Acrobat
   Access for Windows version 4.05 to read PDF documents, which is also
   available on their text-only website.

   If you have trouble accessing any of the PDF documents available at
   this website, please call our toll-free number 1-888-275-8747
   (1-888-ASK-USGS) or contact the site maintainer listed at the bottom of
   each publication on geopubs.

   Please refer to our general help page if you have questions not
   involving PDF.
