   The Advanced Hydropower Turbine Systems Program

   Current hydropower technology, while essentially emission-free, can
   have undesirable environmental effects, such as fish injury and
   mortality from passage through turbines, as well as detrimental changes
   in the quality (dissolved gases) of downstream water. Advanced
   hydropower turbine technology could minimize the adverse effects yet
   preserve the ability to generate electricity from an important
   renewable resource.

   The goal of DOE's Advanced Hydropower Turbine System (AHTS) Program is
   to develop technology that will allow the nation to maximize the use of
   its hydropower resources while minimizing adverse environmental
   effects. Conceptual designs of environmentally friendly hydropower
   turbines have been completed under the DOE-industry program. Potential
   injury mechanisms caused by turbine passage have been identified.
   Research is being performed to understand the effects of these injury
   mechanisms on fish and to develop methods for reducing their severity.

   Potential Benefits of Advanced Turbine Technology
     * Reduced fish mortality: Advanced turbine technology could reduce
       fish mortality resulting from turbine passage to less than 2%, in
       comparison with turbine-passage mortalities of 5 to 10% for the
       best existing turbines and 30% or greater from other turbines.
     * Improved compliance with water quality standards: Advanced turbine
       technology would maintain a downstream dissolved oxygen level of at
       least 6 mg/L, ensuring compliance with water quality standards.
     * Reductions in CO2 emissions: The use of environmentally friendly
       turbine technology would help reverse the decline in hydroelectric
       generation and reduce the amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases
       emitted by consumption of fossil fuels.
