                   How Does the Relicensing Process Work?

   Operating licenses for hydropower projects across America, some issued
   more than half a century ago, are expiring and hydro operators have
   begun applying for new licenses. Originally granted by the Federal
   Power Commission, these licenses are now the responsibility of the
   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In New York, the state
   Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is responsible for
   issuing a Water Quality Certification as part of any new hydroelectric
   license.

   Our St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project is the largest
   hydroelectric facility to begin relicensing thus far.
   The current license expires in 2003; we expect to submit a new license
   application to FERC by 2001.

   Our goal is to obtain a new license on schedule so that we can continue
   to provide low-cost power for our governmental, industrial and
   residential customers.
   Equally important is the consideration of non-power issues including
   the area's environmental resources.

   To keep such a massive effort running smoothly, while ensuring the full
   participation of all interested parties, we've set up a process that
   emphasizes cooperation on many levels. In a landmark development, FERC
   and DEC have agreed to a joint federal-state review of the project's
   environmental impact statement, saving time and money.

   To make sure this environmental analysis is comprehensive and timely,
   we've established a Cooperative Consultation Process (CCP) that
   encourages participation by anyone interested in or affected by the St.
   Lawrence-FDR project's relicensing. Members of this cooperative team
   meet regularly to consider issues relating to the project relicensing
   and determine what type of study and/or action is required. The group
   is open to anyone committed to actively working with the cooperative
   team. CCP team members represent a wide range of interests and opinions
   in the local community and on the state and national levels.

   The cooperative team has produced Scoping Document 1 (SD1), which
   identifies issues and alternatives relating to the St. Lawrence-FDR
   project. SD1 will be used to develop a comprehensive agreement, which
   will form the basis for a new license application.

   Not everyone has the time to actively participate in this relicensing.
   To keep the general public informed, we have a number of communication
   vehicles to share the latest news, including this web site and our
   newsletter, River News. We also want to hear from any of you who'd like
   to share your interests or concerns with us. If you would like more
   information about our power project and the important relicensing
   effort, please fill out the following form and e-mail it back to us.
