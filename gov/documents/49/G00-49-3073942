                       APPEALS - SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS

   No. 00-0679/AR. U.S. v. Jermain J. BEST. CCA 9701222. On consideration
   of the petition for grant of review of the decision of the United
   States Army Court of Criminal Appeals, it is ordered that said petition
   is hereby granted on the following issue:

     WHETHER APPELLANT'S SANITY BOARD IS INADEQUATE AND
     INVALID BECAUSE TWO OF THE THREE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD
     HAD CONFLICTS OF INTEREST;

   That the decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals
   is set aside;

   That the record is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Army
   for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further factfinding
   consistent with the principles of United States v. Ginn, 47 MJ 236
   (1997) and consideration of the granted issue, which was not raised
   below; the court will address the following questions:

     (1) Was there an actual conflict of interest sufficient
     to undermine the reliability of the sanity boards
     findings?

     (2) Was appellant aware of the potential conflict of interest at the
     time of the sanity board?

     (3) If so, did appellant have an opportunity to raise the
     issue?

     (4) Did appellant waive the conflict of interest?

   That, if the court concludes that there was a conflict of interest that
   was not waived and further concludes that the findings of the sanity
   board are not reliable because of a conflict of interest, the court
   will order another sanity board; and

   That, after resolving the above issues, the court will determine
   whether appellant has the mental capacity to understand and to conduct
   or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings. If so, the
   court will determine whether the evidence regarding appellants mental
   responsibility at the time of the offenses warrants setting aside the
   findings and sentence. See RCM 1203(c)(5), Manual for Courts-Martial,
   United States (2000 ed.). See generally United States v. Martin, 56 MJ
   97 (2001).

   Thereafter, Article 67, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC ยง 867,
   shall apply.
