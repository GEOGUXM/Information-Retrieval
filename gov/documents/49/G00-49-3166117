   The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at LLNL is a
   branch of the University of California IGPP, a Multi-Campus Research
   Unit. The acting director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   (LLNL) branch of IGPP is Kem Cook. Other branches are at UC Los
   Angeles, UC San Diego, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, and Los Alamos
   National Laboratory. The Livermore IGPP runs research centers in
   Astrophysics and the Geosciences.

   The LLNL Astrophysics Research Center, headed by Kem Cook, serves the
   aims of the IGPP-LLNL in the area of astrophysics. This includes
   managing the astrophysics part of the University Collaborative Research
   Program (UCRP) and facilitating contacts between UC scientists and
   their LLNL counterparts. The Astrophysics Research Center also serves
   as the focus of astrophysics activities at LLNL by organizing the
   weekly astrophysics colloquium, by hosting visitors and collaborators,
   by editing an annual Observatory Report that covers all astrophysics
   activities at LLNL (and is published in the Bulletin of the American
   Astronomical Society), and by providing various other service
   functions. The staff and post doctoral researchers of the Astrophysics
   Research Center carry out a significant program of astrophysics
   research within the Center.

   The purpose of the IGPP-LLNL Center for Geosciences, headed by Rick
   Ryerson, is to promote collaborative research in the earth sciences
   between LLNL and University of California researchers. Many
   subdisciplines within the geosciences are employed by LLNL's
   mission-oriented programs, and the IGPP draws upon these capabilities
   and expertise to act as a focal point for research in the more
   fundamental aspects of these areas. In doing so, we hope to consolidate
   the many talents and capabilities at LLNL and provide an easily
   identifiable avenue for LLNL-UC collaborations.

   The Center for Geosciences is the physical and scientific focus for
   interactions with visitors from academic (UC and other universities),
   industrial, and government geoscience research institutions. The
   Center's research emphasis has been on the physics and chemistry of the
   solid Earth, including seismology, geochemistry, experimental
   petrology, mineral physics, and hydrology. More recently, we have
   initiated an effort in interdisciplinary studies of active tectonics.

Mission

   Systemwide IGPP:
     * To promote basic research involved in understanding the structure,
       origin, and evolution of the solar system and its planets.

   LLNL-Branch IGPP:
     * To enhance University-Laboratory relations by fostering
       collaborations between UC campus faculty, staff, students, and LLNL
       staff.
     * To provide LLNL programs with input of new ideas, people, and
       contact with the large university community.
     * To foster top-quality research at LLNL in the more "basic" or
       "fundamental" aspects of fields that are important to LLNL
       programs.
     * To provide a stimulating venue for LLNL scientists to broaden their
       research horizons.
