   *   NODC's most complete global oxygen (e.g., dissolved oxygen,
   Apparent Oxygen Utilization and oxygen saturation) datasets on
   CD-ROM are contained in:
     * World Ocean Database 1998 Version 2 (raw data) - WOD98 grey arrow
       image pointing right to online version Online Version of WOD98
       Version 2 CD-ROMs.
     * World Ocean Atlas 1998 (analyzed fields) - WOA98 grey arrow image

       WOA98F CD-ROMs.

   Descriptions of the data, methods, and selected figures are also
   contained in a separate printed atlas series. Go to a list of NODC's
   CD-ROM products or publications; or go directly to the Ocean Climate
   Laboratory's Product Page for additional information on World Ocean
   Atlas products.

   *   A global oxygen (e.g., dissolved oxygen, Apparent Oxygen
   Utilization and oxygen saturation) database is also available online in
   the NODC Oceanographic Profile DataBase: search for oceanographic
   profiles by parameter, geographic location, and time; produce station
   location charts, parameter vs. parameter plots, and create datasets
   that can be downloaded via FTP.

   *   Customized datasets of oxygen can also be obtained by contacting
   NODC User Services.
