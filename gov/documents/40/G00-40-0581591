Welcome:

   The Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) within the Directorate
   for Education and Human Resources, serves as a focal point for NSF's
   agency-wide commitment to enhancing the quality and excellence of
   science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education and
   research through broadening participation by underrepresented groups
   and institutions. The Division's programs aim to increase the
   participation and advancement of underrepresented minorities and
   minority-serving institutions, woman and girls, and persons with
   disabilities at every level of the science and engineering enterprise.
   In so doing, these programs contribute to attainment of the PEOPLE
   outcome goal of the NSF Strategic Plan FY 2000-2005:A diverse,
   internationally competitive and globally-engaged workforce of
   scientists, engineers, and well-prepared citizens. Programs within HRD
   have a strong focus on partnerships and collaborations in order to
   maximize the preparation of a well-trained scientific and instructional
   workforce for the new millennium.

   The programs of the HRD are organized to align with our target
   populations:
     * Minorities and Minority Serving Institutions
     * Women and Girls
     * Persons with Disabilities
     * Crosscutting activities

   Five themes are evident across the program targets:
     * Education Research and Demonstration Projects on Access and Equity,
     * Institutional Educational Capacity Enhancement,
     * Large-scale Implementation,
     * Institutional Research Capacity Enhancement, and
     * Recognition and Dissemination

   Programs according to target and theme
