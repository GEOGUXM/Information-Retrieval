   This page contains links to software of interest in predicting
   consequences of contamination.

   Bruce Napier presented an overview of the subject on the Health Physics
   "Ask the Expert" web page. The text of his paper: Computer Modeling
   Codes for Chemical and Radiological Releases is available here in Adobe
   Acrobat format. Bruce discusses several codes:
     * HOTSPOT
     * RASCAL
     * ARAC
     * GENII
     * MACCS2
     * EPIcode - not available on web, reference: Homann (Homann
       Associates, Inc.), 1988, EPIcode- (Emergency Prediction Information
       Manual), Homann Associates, Inc., Fremont, California.
     * CAMEO at EPA
     * CAMEO at NOAA
     * CHARM dead link 7/25/2001
     * ISC-3
     * HPAC

   Additional air quality and ground water software is cataloged by the
   Open Directory Project. These links have not been evaluated by QECC
   staff, and are presented here on a "user beware" basis.
