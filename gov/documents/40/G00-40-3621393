SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

13 CFR Part 121

RIN 3245-AE56


Small Business Size Standards; Inflation Adjustment to Size
Standards

AGENCY: Small Business Administration.

ACTION: Interim final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) is adjusting its
monetary-based size standards, (e.g., receipts, net income, net worth,
and assets) for the effect of inflation. This action is intended to
maintain the value of size standards in inflation-adjusted terms. From
1994 to the third quarter of 2001 the general level of prices in the
United States increased approximately 15.8% as measured by the chain-
type price index for gross domestic product. This change will restore
eligibility to firms that may have lost small business status solely
due to the effect of inflation.
    SBA is adding a provision in its regulations that will require, at
least once every five years, an assessment of the inflationary impact
on monetary-based size standards. This periodic review will generally
ensure that monetary-based standards are current with inflationary
factors, as appropriate, and that firms will not lose small business
status due solely to the effect of inflation.

DATES: Effective Date: This regulation becomes effective on February
22, 2002.
    Applicability Dates: For the purposes of Federal procurements, this
rule applies to solicitations, except for noncompetitive Section 8(a)
contracts, issued on or after February 22, 2002. For the purpose of
noncompetitive Section 8(a) contracting actions, the new size standards
are applicable to offers of requirements that are accepted by SBA on or
after February 22, 2002. For purposes of eligibility for economic
injury disaster loan assistance to small business concerns located in
disaster areas declared as a result of the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center, New York, New York and the Pentagon, the
applicability date is September 11, 2001.
    Comment Period: Comments must be received on or before February 22,
2002. Upon request, SBA will make all public comments available to any
person or entity.

ADDRESSES: Send comments to Gary M. Jackson, Assistant Administrator
for Size Standards, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third St.,
SW., Mail Code 6530, Washington, DC 20416; or, via e-mail to
SIZESTANDARDS@sba.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Inflationary Review

    SBA is adding a provision to its size standards regulations
requiring that at least once every five years it will assess the impact
of inflation on its monetary-based size standards. These are size
standards based on receipts, net income, or other monetary measures.
Although the provision does not mandate that SBA adjust size standards
for inflation, it does provide assurances to the public that SBA is
monitoring inflation and is making a decision whether or not to adjust
size standards within a reasonable period of time since its last
inflation adjustment. If SBA decides not to make an inflation
adjustment after a review, it will continue to monitor inflation on an
annual basis until such time an adjustment is made. Afterwards, SBA
will review inflation on a periodic basis, but at least once within
five years.
    As described in Sec. 121.102(a), SBA examines a number of economic
characteristics in developing size standards. Inflation is one of many
considerations in this process. SBA does not believe it is appropriate
to automatically adjust size standards for inflation since other
factors influence the setting of size standards. For example, changes
in industry characteristics or in SBA's policies may render an
inflation adjustment unnecessary or inappropriate. Under this
provision, if a significant amount of inflation occurs in the economy
within a five-year period, SBA will consider an inflation adjustment on
a more frequent basis. SBA invites the public to comment on this policy
and to suggest alternative procedures.

Inflationary Adjustment

    SBA is adjusting the monetary-based size standards for the effect
of inflation in order to restore eligibility to firms that may have
lost small business status due solely to the effect of inflation. While
these adjustments are not done on a fixed schedule, prior adjustments
occurred in 1994 (59 FR 16513, dated April 7, 1994), 1984 (49 FR 5024,
dated February 9, 1984), and 1975 (40 FR 32824, as corrected by 40 FR
36310, dated August 5, 1975). The current adjustment is being made at
this time because inflation has increased by 15.8% since 1994, which is
sufficient to warrant an increase, and because SBA believes that
adjustments should be made more frequently than once every ten years,
as was the case with the last inflationary adjustment.
    Small business size standards are based on the six-digit industry
codes of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). In
addition, SBA has several programs that have their own size standards
(e.g., Surety Bond Guaranteed Assistance, Sale of Government Property,
etc.). The size standards that SBA is changing are those that are
receipts based and those based upon other monetary measures.

[[Page 3042]]

Employee-based, production-based, and those established by legislation
are unaffected by inflation, and thus, not part of this rulemaking.
Those standards that have been changed since the last inflation
adjustment in 1994 will be increased accordingly. However, some
receipt-based standards that were recently increased will not be
adjusted as the inflation effect has already been factored into the new
size standard. Full details of this adjustment are contained in the
table, at the end of the preamble, which lists the affected industries
according to NAICS.

How Does SBA Adjust Size Standards for Inflation?

    The methodology for adjusting the size standards for inflation was
as follows:
    1. Selection of an appropriate inflation indicator. We used the
chain-type price index for gross domestic product (GDP) as published by
the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
which is a broad measure of inflation for the economy as a whole, and
is available on a quarterly basis. In the past, SBA used the implicit
price deflator for GDP. Since that time the BEA has produced an
improved price index, the chain-type price index for GDP, that more
accurately reflects inflation. This type of index relies on annual
price weights rather than on the fixed price weight that the implicit
price deflator relied upon. For more information, see J. Steven
Landefeld and Robert P. Parker's article ``BEA's Chain Indexes, Time
Series, and Measures of Long-Term Economic Growth'' in the May 1997
issue of Survey of Current Business. This article may also be found at
http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/an/0597od/maintext.htm, or it may be
obtained by calling the Government Printing Office at (202) 512-1800.
    2. Selection of a base period. We selected the fourth quarter of
1993 as the base period since this was the ending period of the last
inflation adjustment in 1994. The chain-type price index for GDP stood
at 94.79 at that time.
    3. Selection of an end period. We selected the third quarter of
2001 as the ending period for this inflation adjustment since it is the
latest available quarterly data published by BEA. The chain-type price
index for GDP Deflator stood at 109.8 at that time.
    4. Calculation of inflation. Based on these price indices,
inflation increased 15.8% between the base and ending periods [((109.8/
94.79) -1.00)  x  100=15.8%].
    5. Application of the inflation adjustment to the monetary-based
size standards. We multiplied the current size standard by 1.158 and
rounded to the closest $0.5M.
    6. Which size standards and size eligibility criteria are not being
changed?
    Certain size standards and size eligibility criteria are not being
changed in this rule. SBA's reasons are set forth in the chart below.

                                          at this time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Special Situations Exist Regarding the New Inflationary
Adjustment?

    The size standard for banks is expressed in terms of assets and is
being set at $150 million. This adjustment represents more than a 15.8%
increase. The current size standard of $100 million in assets was
established in 1984 and was not adjusted in the 1994 inflation
adjustment. The 1994 adjustment increased only the receipt based size
standards. Monetary standards, other than receipts based, and program
size standards were not adjusted at that time. This rule adjusts all
monetary standards.
    The Health Care Group's size standards were increased in December
2000; the Freight Forwarders size standards were increased in September
2000; and the Help Supply Services size standards were increased in
July 2000. These changes, however, were not due to inflation but were
based on the structure of these industries using data from 1992. Unlike
other industries described in the table above, these industries were
adjusted for inflation in 1994. A further increase is being adopted for
inflation at this time in order to make these size standards current.
    The Construction and Refuse Collection size standards were
increased in June 2000 to account for inflation through the end of
1999. Since that time, an additional 4.3% inflation has occurred [the
chain-type price index for GDP was 105.28 at the fourth quarter of 1999
((109.8/105.28)-1.00)  x  100=1.043, or 4.3%]. To adjust all size
standards to the same common period with respect to inflation, the
Construction and Refuse Collection size standards are being adjusted by
4.3%. The Dredging size standard of $17 million, however, is not being
adjusted since that size standard was based on an analysis of specific
industry cost data and other industry considerations.
    The size standard for sales of government property, currently at $2
million, is increasing to $6.0 million. This especially large increase
is being made due to an earlier oversight, in that this size standard
was not raised from $2 million for inflation in 1984 or 1994. Therefore
it is being increased to $6.0 million to bring it up to the present-day
equivalent of $2 million and the most common size standard for the non-
manufacturing industries.

What Other SBA Programs or Activities, Not Defined by the NAICS
System, Will Have Their Size Standards Adjusted for Inflation?

    The size standards associated with the NAICS Codes are primarily
used in connection with SBA's financial assistance programs and federal
procurement programs. SBA and other federal agencies oversee small
business programs that are not covered by the NAICS Codes or use NAICS
size standards as an alternative to the program size standard.
Therefore, SBA will also make inflation adjustments to those programs
that have any monetary-

[[Page 3043]]

based size standards, except for the SBIC program as discussed above.

Justification for Publication as an Interim Final Rule

    In general, SBA publishes a rule for public comment before issuing
a final rule, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and
SBA regulations. 5 U.S.C. 553 and 13 CFR 101.108. The Administrative
Procedure Act provides an exception to this standard rulemaking
process, however, where an agency finds good cause to adopt a rule
without prior public participation. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). The good
cause requirement is satisfied when prior public participation is
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Under
such circumstances, an agency may publish an interim final rule without
soliciting public comment.
    In enacting the good cause exception to standard rulemaking
procedures, Congress recognized that emergency situations may arise
where an agency must issue a rule without public participation. On
September 16, 2001, the President declared a national emergency as a
result of the events of September 11, 2001. The events of that day have
impacted U.S. businesses both in the declared disaster areas and across
the nation. Most of the affected businesses qualify as small under
existing SBA size standards and are eligible for SBA and other Federal
assistance. However, some of the affected businesses had previously
lost their small size status solely as a result of the inflation that
has occurred since SBA last revised the size standards in 1994. A
proposed inflationary adjustment to the size regulations to restore
eligibility to those businesses was already under development at SBA
when the tragic events of September 11, 2001, occurred. SBA now
believes that any delay in the adoption of those inflationary
adjustments could cause serious harm to those businesses.
    Accordingly, SBA finds that good cause exists to publish this rule
as an interim final rule in light of the urgent need to make disaster
loans and other SBA assistance available to businesses that should be
considered small, but that do not qualify under SBA's existing size
standards. Advance solicitation of comments for this rulemaking would
be impracticable and contrary to the public interest, as it would delay
the delivery of critical assistance to these businesses by a minimum of
three to six months. Any such delay would be extremely prejudicial to
the affected businesses. It is likely that some would be forced to
cease operations before a rule could be promulgated under standard
notice and comment rulemaking procedures.
    Furthermore, SBA has a statutory obligation to act in the public
interest in determining eligibility for Federal assistance under the
Small Business Act. 15 USC 633(d). Pursuant to that authority, SBA has
determined that it is in the public interest to give immediate effect
to SBA's current determination of small size status and that it would
be impracticable to delay such implementation. SBA also notes the
failure to adopt this rule immediately would work to the detriment of
many small businesses.
    Although this rule is being published as an interim final rule,
comments are hereby solicited from interested members of the public.
These comments must be received on or before February 22, 2002. SBA may
then consider these comments in making any necessary revisions to these
regulations.
    Pursuant to Public Law 107-117 (Department of Defense and Emergency
Supplemental Appropriations for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist
Attacks on the United States Act), SBA has the authority to apply the
size standards in this rule for purposes of eligibility for economic
injury disaster loans to small businesses located in the disaster areas
declared as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
Accordingly, for that purpose only, SBA is applying these size
standards as if they were in effect on September 11, 2001.

Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12988, and 13132, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), and the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35)

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed this rule as a
``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) under Executive
Order 12866.
    For purposes of Executive Order 12988, SBA has determined that this
rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the
standards set forth in section 3 of that Order.
    This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the
States, on the relationship between the national government and the
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibility among the
various levels of government. Therefore, under Executive Order 13132,
SBA determines that this rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
    This rule does not impose any new information collection
requirements from SBA which require the approval by OMB under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520.
    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), this rule may have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Immediately below, SBA sets forth an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis (IRFA) of this rule addressing

[[Page 3044]]

the reasons and objectives of the rule; SBA's description and estimate
of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply; the
projected reporting, record keeping, and other compliance requirements
of the rule; the relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, overlap or
conflict with the rule; and alternatives considered by SBA.

(1) What Is Reason for This Action?

    As discussed in the supplemental information, the purpose of this
rule is to restore the small business eligibility of businesses who
have grown above the size standard due to inflation rather than to an
expansion of business activity. A review of the latest available
inflation indices show inflation that has increased a sufficient amount
to warrant an increase to the current receipt-based size standards.

(2) What Are the Objectives and Legal Basis for the Rule?

    The revision to the receipt-based size standards for inflation more
appropriately defines the size of businesses in these industries that
SBA believes should be eligible for Federal small business assistance
programs. Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a))
gives SBA the authority to establish and change size standards.

(3) What Is SBA's Description and Estimate of the Number of Small
Entities to Which the Rule Will Apply?

    SBA estimates that there will be approximately 8,600 newly
designated small business, distributed as follows by NAICS Sectors and
Subsectors:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------
Source: 1997 Economic Census, U.S. Census Bureau, Special Tabulation for SBA. Sa
les estimates restated to 2000
  dollars.

    The percentage increase in the number of small businesses that will
result from this rule, compared to the existing base of small
businesses, is estimated to be about two-tenths of one percent. The
special tabulation of the 1997 Economic Census for SBA reports
5,082,970 total firms in the U.S. economy as defined by this census. We
estimate that 98.4% of all businesses in the U.S. are currently defined
as small under the existing size standards. Under the rule, this will
increase to 98.6%. The percentage increase of annual sales in the U.S.
economy attributed to these new small businesses is likely to be
approximately seven-tenths of one percent. This will be applied to a
base of 28.6%. Thus under this proposal the percent of sales attributed
to firms defined as small businesses in the U.S. is likely to increase
to 29.3%.
    Description of Potential Benefits of the Rule: The most significant
benefit to businesses obtaining small business status as a result of
this rule is their eligibility for Federal small business assistance
programs. These include SBA's financial assistance programs and Federal
procurement preference programs for small businesses, 8(a) firms, small
disadvantaged businesses, and small businesses located in Historically
Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone).
    SBA estimates that approximately $46.2 million of additional
Federal contracts will be awarded to firms becoming newly designated
small businesses. As stated above, the percentage increase of annual
sales attributed to these new small businesses is likely to be
approximately seven-tenths of one percent. SBA applied this factor to
the Fiscal Year 1999 total small business prime contractor initial
awards which totaled $6.6 billion [$6.6B x .007 (.7 of 1%) = $46.2M].
    We view the additional amount of contract activity as the potential
amount of transfer from non-small to newly designated small firms. This
does not represent the creation of new contracting activity by the
Federal government, merely a possible reallocation or transfer to
different sized firms.
    Under the SBA's 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program and Certified
Development Company (504) Program, SBA estimates that approximately $17
million in new Federal loan guarantees could be made to these newly
defined small businesses. This represents 0.19% of the $9 billion in
loans that were guaranteed by the SBA under these two financial
programs to firms in industries with monetary-based size standards.
    Considering that the average size of firms gaining small business
status will be $6 million, demand for assistance will likely be less
than the overall participation rate for SBA loans among firms of all
sizes. In any given year less than 1% of all small businesses receive
SBA financing. Since larger firms are less likely to seek SBA financial
assistance, we believe that no more than one-half of 1% of the 8,610
newly designated small businesses would seek SBA assistance. SBA
estimates that approximately 45 out of the 8,610 firms would seek SBA
financing. SBA financial assistance recipients of this size on average
obtain assistance worth $375,000, so the impact in terms of new loans
generated is estimated to be $17 million per year.

(4) Will This Rule Impose Any Additional Reporting or Record Keeping
Requirements on Small Businesses?

    This rule does not impose any new information collection
requirements from SBA which require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. A new size standard does
not impose any additional reporting, record keeping or compliance
requirements on small entities. Increasing size standards expands
access to SBA programs that assist small businesses, but does not
impose a regulatory burden as they

[[Page 3045]]

neither regulate nor control business behavior.

(5) What Are the Relevant Federal Rules Which May Duplicate, Overlap or
Conflict With This Rule?

    This rule overlaps other Federal rules that use SBA's size
standards to define a small business. Under Sec. 632(a)(2)(C) of the
Small Business Act, unless specifically authorized by statute, Federal
agencies must use SBA's size standards to define a small business. In
1995, SBA published in the Federal Register a list of statutory and
regulatory size standards that identified the application of SBA's size
standards as well as other size standards used by Federal agencies (60
FR 57988-57991, dated November 24, 1995). SBA is not aware of any
Federal rule that would duplicate or conflict with establishing size
standards.
    SBA cannot estimate the impact of a size standard change on each
and every Federal program that uses its size standards. In cases where
an SBA's size standard is not appropriate, the Small Business Act and
SBA's regulations allow Federal agencies to develop different size
standards with the approval of the SBA Administrator (13 CFR 121.902).
For purposes of a regulatory flexibility analysis, agencies must
consult with SBA's Office of Advocacy when developing different size
standards for their programs.

(6) What Alternatives Did SBA Consider?

    SBA considered two alternatives to this rule. First, to wait until
inflation has increased a greater amount before proposing an adjustment
to receipt-based size standards. Previous inflation adjustments ranged
between 48 percent to 100 percent. SBA believes that more frequent
adjustments are necessary since smaller amounts of inflation can change
the small business eligibility of a large number of businesses.
    Second, SBA considered a policy of automatically adjusting size
standards for inflation on a fixed schedule. SBA believes inflation
must be closely monitored to assess the impact of inflation on size
standards. Automatic adjustments may lead to inappropriate changes to
size standards and prevent the Agency from taking into consideration
other factors that bear on the review of size standards, such as
changes in industry structure or Administration policies. Furthermore,
an automatic adjustment could require SBA to make insignificant changes
(i.e., 1 percent) or to wait a longer period of time than necessary to
adjust size standards if inflation rapidly increases.

PART 121--SMALL BUSINESS SIZE REGULATIONS

    1. The authority citation for part 121 continues to read as
follows:

    Authority: 15 U.S.C. 632(a), 634(b)(6), 637(a), 644(c), and
662(5); and sec. 304, Pub. L. 103-403,108 Stat. 4175, 4188.

    2. Amend Sec. 121.102 as follows:
    a. Redesignate the current paragraph (c) as (d).
    b. Add new paragraph (c) to read as follows:


Sec. 121.102  How does SBA establish size standards?

* * * * *
    (c) As part of its review of size standards, SBA's Office of Size
Standards will examine the impact of inflation on monetary-based size
standards (e.g., receipts, net income, assets) at least once every five
years and submit a report to the Administrator or designee. If SBA
finds that inflation has significantly eroded the value of the
monetary-based size standards, it will issue a proposed rule to
increase size standards.
* * * * *

    3. In Sec. 121.201, revise the referenced NAICS Codes and size
standards in the table ``Size Standards by NAICS Industry'' under
Sectors 11, 21 through 23, 44-45, 48-49, 51 through 56, 61, 62, 71, 72,
and 81 to read as follows:


Sec. 121.201  What size standards has SBA identified by North American
Industry Classification System codes?
