   Land Use Planning Introduction

   The way we plan the physical layout, or land use, of our communities is
   fundamental to sustainability. Two main features of our land use
   practices over the past several decades have converged to generate
   haphazard, inefficient, and unsustainable urban sprawl:
     * zoning ordinances that isolate employment locations, shopping and
       services, and housing locations from each other;

     * low-density growth planning aimed at creating automobile access to
       increasing expanses of land.

   The complex problems shared by cities throughout the US are evidence of
   the impacts of urban sprawlincreasing traffic congestion and commute
   times, air pollution, inefficient energy consumption and greater
   reliance on foreign oil, loss of open space and habitat, inequitable
   distribution of economic resources, and the loss of a sense of
   community. See "Indicators of Sprawl."

   Community sustainability requires a transition from poorly managed
   sprawl to land use planning practices that create and maintain
   efficient infrastructure, ensure close-knit neighborhoods and sense of
   community, and preserve natural systems.

   This section provides an introduction to key planning principles as
   well as resources for strategies, tools, and civic participation to
   help your community with sustainable land use planning.
