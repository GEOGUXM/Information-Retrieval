                                                       rev 10 January 2000

       !!PLEASE NOTE THE ftp FILE NAMES HAVE CHANGED FROM riceacrg_1x1 to
  t00z.siceg_1x1 and t12z.siceg_1x1 THE GRIB INDEX FILES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE!!

    The NCEP superstructure ice accretion forecast system was developed by
    applying statistical algorithms developed by Overland and Pease at the
    Pacific Marine Environmental Research Laboratory in the mid- 1980s. The
    algorithm relates icing to wind speed, freezing point of sea water, air
    temperature, and sea surface temperature. The method is designed for
    trawlers in the 20 to 75 meter length range, underway at normal speeds in
    open seas and not heading downwind. There are three categories: light - 0.1
    to 0.8 inches of ice accretion/ 3 hours (aqua on chart); moderate - 0.8 to
    2.4 inches/3 hours (dark blue on chart), and heavy - greater than 2.4
    inches/3 hours (red on chart). It is available on a 1 deg x 1 deg grid for
    the North Atlantic (N ATL) and Pacific (N PAC) basins. Binary data files in
    GRIB are available on a 1 x 1 degree grid grid thoughout the year. The
    figures are in gif format and are on the order of 10k each. The season for
    vessel icing is 1 November - 31 May. Graphic output and binary files (GRIB
    and GIF) are not available outside the season.

   To ftp binary data, ftp to polar.wwb.noaa.gov, and cd to
   pub/vessel.icing. Do a binary get t00z.siceg_1x1 or t12z.siceg_1x1
   (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE OLD FILE NAMES!! USERS WILL HAVE
   TO CHANGE THEIR SCRIPTS!!) to download the GRIB ice accretion data for
   the northern hemisphere. This file contains seven (7) records: one for
   each projection from 00 to 72 hours at 12-h intervals on a 1 deg x 1
   deg grid. Please send questions and comments to Lawrence D. Burroughs
   at Lawrence.burroughs@noaa.gov
