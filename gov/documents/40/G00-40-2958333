                                General uses:

     * To remotely examine surface temperatures of objects.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Measuring temperature of hot pressings.
     * Temperature measurement of material inside furnaces,and material
       being heated by microwaves.
     * Observing temperature gradients across molded plastic parts
       immediately after opening the mold.
     * Measuring temperatures of circuit board components during
       operation.
     * Line scan mode enables measurement of a single line at 125
       microsecond intervals.

                                Test Samples:

   Test samples include any object to which an optical path transparent in
              the IR region of the spectrum can be established.

                                Limitations:

    This process measures surface temperatures only. Measurements can not
    be taken hrough glass, because it is opaque in the infarared region;
       however, arangements can be made to look through fused quartz.
     Temperature measurement can be made from 5 to 1500 degrees Celsius.

                         Estimated Evaluation Time:

      Measurements are taken real time, and processing takes only a few
     minutes. The system is portable and can be set up in a few minutes.

                                 Principle:

        Infrared emission is measured, and the system correlates that
    measurement to surface temperature. A black and white or false color
        image is displayed on a video monitor along with temperature
       information, brightness or color corresponding to variations in
                  emission (and hence surface temperature).

                                 Equipment:

            We have an Inframetrics model 600 IR imaging system.
    A PC-based image processing system is available for analysis of live
        video or video tapes created by the system. This software is
                   specifically for analysis of IR images.
