   In an effort to improve the quality of appellate advocacy, the Ninth
       Circuit has produced a 28-minute practice guide video. Separate
       versions oriented toward criminal and civil appeals are available.
       The guide, collaboratively developed by members of the Ninth
       Circuit bench, seasoned practitioners and court staff, traces a
       hypothetical case from filing to disposition.
       The guide is a valuable aid for both experienced and novice
       advocates. Purchase requests accompanied by a $15 check may be
       directed to:

                    San Francisco, California 94119-3939.
       Copies are also available for viewing at all circuit library
       locations.

   2. Perfecting Your Appeal - A simple guide
     __________________________________________________________________

            UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
                           PERFECTING YOUR APPEAL
                      A simple guide to aid you in the
                proper and timely preparation of your appeal.
                           (updated January 1999)

                           INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS

   * Obtain and Review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Ninth
   Circuit Rules
   Copies of the Federal and Circuit Rules are available upon written
   request to the Clerk's Office.
   * Post-Judgment Motions
   Certain timely post-judgment motions render a notice of appeal
   ineffective. An amended notice must be filed if review of the
   post-judgment motion's disposition is desired. See, FRAP 4(a)(4).
   * File Timely Notice of Appeal in District Court
   The filing deadlines are set forth at Federal Rule of Appellate
   Procedure 4. The deadlines are mandatory and jurisdictional. Browder v.
   Director, Department of Corrections, 434 U.S. 275 (1978).
   * Civil Appeals Docketing Statement/Settlement Program
   All litigants, (except Pro Se litigants) are generally required by
   Ninth Circuit Rules 3-3 and 15-2 to file a civil appeals docketing
   statement at the same time the notice of appeal is filed. The docketing
   statement is used to assess whether a possible settlement of the case
   could be aided by the court's settlement described at Ninth Circuit
   Rule 33. Litigants may also request a settlement conference by
   contacting the settlement unit.
   * Order the Reporter's Transcripts
   The process to designate and order transcripts is described at Ninth
   Circuit Rule 10-3. The deadlines for initiating the process are
   triggered by the filing of the notice of appeal. A transcript
   designation form may be obtained from the district court.

                                  BRIEFING

   * Filing Dates
   Consult your scheduling order and Ninth Circuit Rule 31-2.2 with regard
   to due dates and extensions of time. Note that unlike some state
   courts, there is no rule permitting automatic approval of stipulations
   or unopposed motions for extensions of time.
   Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a), briefs are deemed
   timely filed if served by mail on the due date. All other filings must
   be in the courthouse on the due date.
   If the opening brief in a civil case is not filed and no motion for an
   extension of time has been submitted, the clerk will dismiss the appeal
   for lack of prosecution without prior warning under Ninth Circuit Rule
   42-1.
   * Required Contents
   Contents of a brief are set forth at FRAP 28 and Ninth Circuit Rule 28.
   * Format/Length
   Format and length requirements are found at Ninth Circuit Rule 28-3.1
   and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32. Attempts to manipulate the
   format so as to circumvent the length limitations may subject counsel
   to sanctions. Kano v. National Consumer, 22 F. 3d 899 (9th Cir. 1994).
   * Stylistic Considerations
   Use short sentences and comprehensible language. Avoid legalese. Refer
   to the parties by name or by terms such as A the taxpayer @ or A the
   employer. @ Fed. R. App. P. 28(d).
   * Record Citations
   All references to the record must be supported by an appropriate
   citation to the excerpts of record pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule
   28-2.8.

                             EXCERPTS OF RECORD

   * Purpose
   The excerpts of record are intended to provide each member of the panel
   with those portions of the record necessary to reach a decision on the
   appeal. 9th Cir. R. 10-2. The full record is not regularly transmitted
   in civil cases. 9th Cir. R. 11-4.1.
   * Required Contents
   The contents of the excerpts of record are governed by Ninth Circuit
   Rules 17-1 and 30-1. There are different requirements for civil and
   criminal appeals and for petitions for review.
   * Format/Length
   Include a table of contents. Each volume should be limited to 300 pages
   each and have tan covers. The district court docket sheet should be the
   final document.

                                ORAL ARGUMENT

   * Generally
   Practices regarding calendaring and oral argument are discussed in the
   introduction to the Ninth Circuit Rules and the Circuit Advisory Note
   to Rules 34-1 to 34-4.
   * Notice
   If oral argument will be heard, counsel are informed approximately five
   weeks before the date of the hearing. If the court contemplates
   deciding the appeal without oral argument, the parties will be informed
   of that proposed course of action and permitted to offer an explanation
   as to why oral argument would be desirable. Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
   * Additional Authorities
   When additional authorities are discovered after the filing of the
   brief, the party may advise the court by letter. The letter shall
   refrain from including any additional argument. Fed. R. App. P. 28(j).
