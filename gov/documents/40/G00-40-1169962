                      Prostate Patient Confidentiality

   Introduction
   Diagnosis of the Patient
   Removal of Patient Identifiers
   Backup Link

   Introduction
   The prostate samples that are studied by the NCI Prostate Group for
   molecular profiling research are unlinked from the patients by a
   privacy firewall to ensure absolute patient confidentiality. After
   clinical diagnosis, the samples are anonymized before they can be used
   for research purposes. However, if by chance new histopathological
   information is discovered during research, a backup link is maintained.
   The entire process is described in detail below.

                                                               Back to top

   Diagnosis of the Patient
     * Prostatectomy specimens or needle biopsies retrieved from the NCI
       Urologic Oncology Branch, the NCI Medicine Branch, or the National
       Naval Medical Center are initially received in the NCI Laboratory
       of Pathology for gross and histopathological examination.
     * Following sample processing, the histologic slides from each case
       are reviewed microscopically and a diagnostic pathology report is
       generated for the patient and clinician.
     * The slides used for diagnosis, two additional sets of H/E-stained
       slides, and three unstained recuts are placed into the patient's
       permanent file in the Laboratory of Pathology. An additional set of
       H/E recut slides is sent to the institution where the prostate
       sample originated.

                                                               Back to top

   Removal of Patient Identifiers
   All patient identifiers are then removed from the tissue blocks which
   are transferred to the NCI Pathogenetics Unit. The case is given a
   research identification number and new H/E slides and serial recuts are
   prepared for research studies.

                                                               Back to top

   Backup Link
   However, a link between the clinical and the research identification
   numbers is maintained in a private database by the clinical staff in
   the Laboratory of Pathology. This is considered to be for the patient's
   benefit in the event that serial recut sectioning of a case during a
   research study reveals a clinically important feature (e.g., capsular
   invasion by the tumor that was not detected in the initial pathology
   workup). The clinical staff is notified and the relevant histologic
   slides returned to the Laboratory of Pathology. The entire case is then
   re-reviewed by the clinical staff and an addendum to the pathology
   report is generated for the patient and clinician.

     This database is not available to the research staff and no links
     between patient identity and molecular studies are made.
