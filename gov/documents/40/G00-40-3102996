   April 2, 1999 Deployed high-gain antenna will soon send streams of new
   Mars images MGS images to be received on Earth next week By MARY HARDIN
   A steady stream of new data from Mars, including high-resolution
   images, will begin arriving next week at Earth receiving stations
   following the March 29 deployment of the Mars Global Surveyor's
   high-power communi- cations antenna. "Having a deployed, or steerable,
   high- gain antenna is like switching from a garden hose to a fire hose
   in terms of data return from the spacecraft," said Joseph Beerer,
   flight operations manager for Mars Global Surveyor at JPL. "We now have
   a steady stream of data. "Up until now, we have been using the
   high-gain antenna in its stowed position, so during the first three
   weeks of our mapping mission, we had to stop collecting science data
