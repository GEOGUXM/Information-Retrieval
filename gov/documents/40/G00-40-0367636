   Astronomical Instrument Markup Language

   Background

      The Astronomical Instrument Markup Language (AIML) is a domain-specific
      implementation of the more generalized Instrument Markup Language
      (IML). Both AIML and IML are vocabularies based on the W3C standard,
      the Extensible Markup Language (XML). NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
      and Century Computing, a division of AppNet, Inc., are developing AIML
      to command and control astronomical instruments. Our software
      architecture combines the platform-independent processing capabilities
      of Java with the power of XML. A key aspect of the object-oriented
      architecture, implemented in Java, involves software that is driven by
      the AIML instrument description. The initial effort is targeted at the
      Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, an airborne
      observatory aboard a Boeing 747. Eventually our techniques will enable
      trusted astronomers from around the world to easily access infrared
      instruments (e.g., telescopes, cameras, and spectrometers) located in a
      variety of remote, inhospitable environments.

      AIML is an instrument description that encompasses instrument
      characteristics, control commands, data stream descriptions (including
      image and housekeeping data), message formats, communication
      mechanisms, and pipeline algorithm descriptions. AIML also supports
      role-specific documentation and GUI component generation. Dialects such
      as PAML (Pipeline Algorithm ML) and IGS (Instrument GUI Stylesheet
      [XSL]) will be added in the near future. More details appear below.

   Benefits

        * Clearly defined interface between hardware and software engineers.
        * Easy to make last-minute changes in AIML description that are
          incorporated throughout the system.
        * Clean separation of implementation (representation) from
          description.
        * Human readable and machine understandable instrument descriptiom.
        * Leverages latest Java and XML technology; many more capabilities
          expected in 1999 (from Sun, IBM, W3C).

   Examples

        * IML Document Type Definition (DTD), iml.dtd (formerly called
          aiml.dtd)
        * Example XML file of the HAWC instrument which uses iml.dtd.

   Presentations

        * PowerPoint 97 poster presentation from the 193rd Meeting of the AAS
          (January 1999): Using XML for Instrument Description, Communication
          and Control of the SOFIA / HAWC Instrument
        * Word 97 description of IML and AIML and how they are being used on
          SOFIA

      An effort will be made to coordinate with D. Guillaume for image
      markup: Astronomical Markup Language (AML).

      Note: If you have difficulty viewing the DTD or XML files in your
      browser, download the files and open them with any text editor.
