   Moving? Don't Forget to Update your Listing in the GAL The Global
   Address List or GAL is an email directory that many NCI staff rely on
   to correspond with, talk to, and find fellow NIHers. It is used by
   MSOutlook, but not Eudora or other mail programs. Your GAL information
   contains not only email information, but also address, phone, FAX, and
   organizational affiliation information. NCI Computer Services
   recommends that you update this information when moving from one office
   to another. Even if you haven't moved, it's still a good idea to check
   your GAL information once or twice a year and update it as needed. The
   following steps take about five minutes and allow you to update your
   GAL entry right at your desktop. Activate the hyperlink titled ``Email
   and NIH domain Account Management'' in the upper left and corner of the
   webpage. Activate the hyperlink titled ``Modify how your information
   appears in the Global Address List (GAL).'' A ``New Site Certificate''
   window may appear; you can push the ``next'' and ``finish'' buttons
   through these screens. This provides security for the information you
   send and receive. Enter your exchange email account following the
   example provided on the web page. Enter the User Name and password
   information associated with your email account (eg nci/smithj). If you
   have only one email account, click the button ``Edit User Info.'' If
   you have two accounts select the account you wish to modify then click
   the ``Edit User Info'' button. Make the appropriate modifications to
   your information and click ``Modify User Info'' when you are done. The
   changes you have made will be automatically updated in the GAL.
