      Statement by Speaker Dennis Hastert Regarding Continued Calls by
                         Democrats for Tax Increases

                              January 16, 2002

   Washington, DC-U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) today made the
   following statement:

   With renewed calls each week to raise taxes in a slow economy by
   national Democrats, such as Tom Daschle, Ted Kennedy and Hillary
   Clinton, it appears some folks in Congress need to brush up on the
   fundamentals of economics.

   As a former high school economics teacher, Ive found the basic concepts
   to be fairly simple: Tax increases in tough economic times only make
   matters worse and do nothing for working folks and unemployed families
   struggling to make ends meet. On the other hand, letting consumers keep
   more of their hard-earned money to spend and invest helps lift the
   economy. Where would the economy be today if we hadnt sent out those
   tax rebate checks last summer?

   I particularly find it unfair and irresponsible for top Democrats to
   play politics with peoples futures by proposing to punish the lifes
   work of family farmers and Mom-and-Pop businesses by keeping the Death
   Tax in place. We can only imagine how that unwise shell game could
   further damage our already shaky markets and overall sluggish economy.

   As a former high school econ teacher, I can say that basic economics
   tell us that any calls for tax hikes during tough economic times need
   to take a hike.
