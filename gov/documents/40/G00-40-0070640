Ethyl Lactate Solvents: Low-Cost and Environmentally Friendly

   Purification-Separation System Millions of pounds of toxic industrial
   solvents could be replaced by environmentally friendly solvents made
   with ethyl lactate, thanks to a new cost-cutting manufacturing process
   developed by researchers from Argonne's Energy Systems Division. This
   innovative technology was the winner in the Environment category of the
   1998 Discover Magazine Awards, and won a 1998 Presidential Challenge
   Green Chemistry Award.

   Unlike other solvents, which can damage the ozone layer or pollute
   groundwater, ethyl lactate is so benign that the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration approved its use in food products long ago. Although
   ethyl lactate has been around for years, the cost of producing it has
   been too high to allow it to compete economically with lower-priced
   chemical solvents. Ethyl lactate normally sells for $1.60 to $2.00 per
   pound, compared with about 90 cents to $1.70 per pound for conventional
   chemical solvents. Argonne's new production technology has shattered
   the old price barrier. Its developers believe their new process can cut
   the market price to well below $1.00 per pound.

   The key technology that will significantly reduce the market price is a
   new patented purification-separation system. It uses a membrane to
   selectively remove excess water and bring the reaction to nearly 100%
   completion with higher purity and lower processing costs.

   The technology was developed with funding from DOE, Energy Efficiency
   and Renewable Energy, Office of Industrial Technologies.
