   The U.S. Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program
   (FEMP), along with the U.S. General Services Administration and the
   U.S. Department of Defense, will host the Energy 2001 workshop and
   exposition at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center in Kansas City, Missouri,
   June 3-6, 2001.

   This will be the fourth annual national energy management workshop and
   trade show for federal, state, local and private sector energy
   managers, energy service companies, utilities, procurement officials,
   engineers and others involved in energy management around the country.

   The workshop has been moved to June for 2001 and we expect the biggest
   crowd yet for this program. Several new tracks and sessions have been
   added, along with more presentation topics and new activities. Special
   social events are planned to maximize group interaction, including a
   Sunday night opening reception and a Tuesday evening Union Station gala
   at Science City.
