Archive Mailing Lists

   There are two mailing lists associated with the archive, one for
   discussion of the archive contents, and the other for announcements of
   updates and changes.
   To get on the discussion mailing list, send mail to
   majordomo@listserv.lbl.gov with subscribe ITA-discuss in the body of
   the message. You can access the archive of the mailing list (as a
   single large file) by sending get ita-discuss archive in the body
   instead, so you can see what topics have previously been discussed.
   Submissions to the list itself are sent to ITA-discuss@lbl.gov.
   There is a second, announcement mailing list, used by the moderator for
   announcing updates and changes to the Archive. The ITA-discuss mailing
   list mentioned above automatically gets copies of these announcements.
   If you wish to receive announcements but not the discussion mailings,
   send mail to the moderator (currently Vern Paxson, vern@ee.lbl.gov) to
   be added to the announcement mailing list.
