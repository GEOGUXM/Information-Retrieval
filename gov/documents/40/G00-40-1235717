   Volcanic unrest since 1980 in the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes in the
   southern part of the Long Valley caldera has increased concern among
   scientists over the possibility of a volcanic eruption in the future.
   Although pinpointing the precise time and location of the next eruption
   in the Long valley area is not feasible, scientists can identify areas
   that are likely to be affected from different types of future volcanic
   activity. Knowing the potentially dangerous areas before an eruption
   starts is critical for planning emergency procedures that can help
   ensure public safety if the unrest leads to volcanic activity.

  Past is key to future

   Future eruptions in the region are most likely to consist of one or
   more of the types of volcanic activity that have occurred in the past
   few thousand years along the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, which
   cuts through the western part of the caldera. This activity included
   (1) explosive eruptions that produced fast-moving pyroclastic flows
   that spread several kilometers from the vents and widespread ashfall;
   and (2) nonexplosive eruptions of thick lava flows and lava domes. Some
   of these eruptions were probably accompanied by mudflows, caused by
   rapid snowmelt during explosive activity.

   Scientist examines volcanic deposits formed by explosive eruptions
   about 600 years ago
   Scientists use volcanic rock deposits and layers formed by past
   eruptions as a guide to identify areas in the region that are likely to
   be affected by similar types and sizes of eruptions in the future.

   Knowledge of the distribution of these deposits and familiarity with
   similar historical eruptions from around the world permit scientists to
   identify potentially hazardous areas on a map for different vent
   locations and different types of eruptions. Since the Long Valley
   region consists of many possible vent locations that can produce
   different types of eruptions, the actual hazardous areas may not be
   known until hours before or just after an eruption begins.

   Even so, maps showing volcano-hazard zones and examination of several
   possible eruption scenarios can help to identify (1) possible vent
   locations; (2) potential hazardous areas; and (3) different types of
   eruptions that can occur.

  How likely is volcanic activity in the Long Valley area?

   Based on the frequency of eruptions along the Mono-Inyo Crates volcanic
   chain in the past 5,000 years, the probability of an eruption occurring
   in any given year is somewhat less than one percent per year or roughly
   one chance in a few hundred in any given year. This is comparable to
   the annual chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake (like the Great 1906 San
   Francisco Earthquake) along the San Andreas Fault in coastal California
   or of an eruption from one of the more active Cascade Range volcanoes
   in the Pacific Northwest, such as Mount Rainier in Washington or Mount
   Shasta in California.

   Increased volcanic unrest (including earthquake swarms, ground
   deformation, and CO[2] gas emissions) in the Long Valley area since
   1980 increases the chance of an eruption occurring in the near future,
   but scientists still lack adequate data to reliably calculate by how
   much. Volcanic unrest in some other large volcanic systems has
   persisted for decades or even centuries without leading to an eruption.
   But since volcanic unrest can escalate to an eruption quickly--in a few
   weeks, days, or less--USGS scientists are monitoring the activity
   closely.


  Potential volcano-hazard zones: critical for emergency planning

   The hazard zones listed below are for a small- to moderate-sized
   eruption that erupts less than 1 km^3 of magma:
     * Introduction
     * Volcanic ash and pumice fallout (including ballistics)
     * Pyroclastic flows and surges
     * Viscous lava flows and dome collapses
     * Volcanic eruption clouds

  Long Valley area

   Geologists have pieced together the dramatic sequence of eruptions and
   ground cracking that occurred along the Inyo volcanic chain about 600
   years ago. This eruptive sequence provides probably the best "scenario"
   for future volcanic activity in the Long Valley area.
