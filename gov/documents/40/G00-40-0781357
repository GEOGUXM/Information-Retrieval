                             Settlement Judge Program (ADR)

               The voluntary unfair labor practice settlement program was
         established in the Office of Administrative Law Judges in mid-1995.
         This voluntary settlement program, described in section 2423.25(d) of
         the Authority's Regulations, may be initiated by any of the parties to
         a pending ULP case in which a complaint has been issued by the General
         Counsel and a hearing date before a Judge has been set. If all parties
         to the proceeding agree, a conference at a mutually agreeable date and
         time is set by the Settlement Judge -- usually prior to the pre-hearing
         conference -- and the parties discuss possible resolutions of the
         dispute without resort to litigation. The process is confidential in
         that nothing discussed at the conference is disclosed to the Judge
         designated to preside at the hearing if settlement efforts are
         unsuccessful. The program has achieved wide success, with more than 800
         ULP complaints referred through the settlement process. Successful
         settlements were reached in well over 80 percent of those cases.

              Inquiries concerning the Settlement Judge Program should be
         directed to the Office of Administrative Law Judges (202) 482-6630.
