   1992 June - First flight of MSAM1
   1993
   1994 June - confirmation flight for MSAM1-92
   1995 June - Additional sky coverage for MSAM1
   1996 June - "The Endless Summer" Despite over three months residence in
        Palestine, Texas, the launch for MSAM2 was attempted, but the weather
        was not cooperative
   1997 June - First flight of the MSAM2
   1998

        July - TopHat Test Flight 1 - first flight of a high-fidelity mockup of
        the top payload.

        October - Second flight of a high-fidelity mockup of the top payload,
        combined
        with the actual bottom payload that will be flown in Antarctica.
   1999 Flight preparations for an Antarctic flight culminated in a system
        end-to-end test in Palestine, TX in August. Unfortunately,
        thermal-vacuum testing showed that the main bearing in the spinning
        mechanism ("lazy-Susan") was not reliable at cold temperatures. As a
        result, Antarctic flight was postponed in order to fix this problem.
