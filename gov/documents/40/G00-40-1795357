Privacy & Security

   NTIS is committed to protecting your privacy and will collect no
   personal information about you unless you choose to provide that
   information. Such information is kept within NTIS although some
   information may be provided to our agency sources. For products
   developed under a joint venture, some information may be shared with
   our joint venture partner.

   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our site.

   1. If you read or download information, we automatically collect and
   store the following:
     * status of the request (was it successful or was there an error?);
     * the date and time you access our site;
     * the Internet address of the Web site or domain name of the computer
       from which you accessed our site;
     * the type and version of your Web browser (Netscape, Explorer,
       etc.); and
     * the operating system (Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.) of the machine
       running the Web browser.

   2. If you send us an e-mail, we will only use it to respond to your
   message or to provide you ongoing information if you request it.

   3. If you purchase a product on-line, we collect personal information
   required to support the purchasing of products, including names,
   addresses, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail addresses.

   Links   top of page pointer
   Our Web site has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases,
   we link to private organizations with their permission. Once you link
   to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

   Security   top of page pointer
   Shopping online at NTIS is safe and secure. Our secure server software
   (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available
   today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your
   personal information, including credit card or deposit account number,
   name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels
   over the Internet.

   Cookies   top of page pointer

   fee-based subscription services. No other site can request this
   information nor can NTIS track your usage of other sites. If you turn
   your browser's cookie option off, you can still use most of the
   features on our site.
