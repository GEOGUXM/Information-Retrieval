   Privacy Policy

   Pursuant to Government Code section 11019.9, the State Water Resources
   Control Board has adopted this privacy policy, in adherence with the
   Information Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code section 1798 et seq.),
   that includes the following principles:

     (a) Personally identifiable information may only be obtained through
     lawful means.

     (b) The purposes for which personally identifiable data are
     collected shall be specified at or prior to the time of collection,
     and any subsequent use of the data shall be limited to and
     consistent with the fulfillment of those purposes previously
     specified.

     (c) Personal data may not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise
     used for a purpose other than those specified, except with the
     consent of the subject of the data, or as required by law or
     regulation.

     (d) Personal data collected shall be relevant to the purpose for
     which it is needed.

     (e) The general means by which personal data is protected against
     loss, unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure shall be
     posted, unless the disclosure of those general means would
     compromise legitimate agency objectives or law enforcement purposes.

   This policy complies with the Information Practices Act (Civil Code
   Section 1798 et seq.); the Public Records Act (Government Code Section
   6250 et seq.); Government Code Section 11015.5, and all other laws
