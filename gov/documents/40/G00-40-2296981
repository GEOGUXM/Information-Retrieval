  Summary

   The Glacier Studies Project includes four active tasks: a Satellite
   Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World Task, a Coastal-Change and
   Glaciological Maps of Antarctica Task, a Borehole Paleothermometric
   Measurements in Ice-Sheets and Permafrost Task, and a Monitoring
   Atmospheric and Shallow-Permafrost Temperatures in the Arctic for
   Contemporary Climate Change Task. All four tasks are inter-divisional,
   inter-agency, and international in scope and institutional involvement.
   Glaciers and permafrost are two of the four components of the
   cryosphere (the other two are sea, lake, and river ice; and snow
   cover). The cryosphere is particularly sensitive to changes in regional
   and global climate. Seasonal changes in sea ice and snow cover and
   decadal changes in glacier area can be monitored regionally and
   globally with image data from Earth-orbiting satellites. NASA and USGS
   scientists are also carrying out experimental geodetic airborne,
   satellite laser altimetry, radar interferometric, and other
   remote-sensing surveys of glaciers.

  Accomplishments

   The U.S. Geological Survey has played the lead national and
   international role in using satellite image data to provide baseline
   data and other information about glaciers from a global perspective.
   The 11-volume Satellite Image Atlas of the World Task (USGS
   Professional Paper 1386 A-K) involves more than 60 scientists who
   represent 45 institutions and 25 nations. Six volumes have been
   published to date: B, Antarctica; C, Greenland; E, Glaciers of Europe;
   G, Glaciers of the Middle East and Africa; H, Glaciers of Iran Jaya,
   Indonesia, and New Zealand; and I, Glaciers of South America. Within
   the Coastal-Change and Glaciological Maps of Antarctica Task; 700
   Landsat MSS and TM images have been analyzed to provide, for the first
   time:
    1. Accurate baseline maps of the coast of Antarctica
    2. Accurate maps showing coastal changes during the past 15 to 20
       years that may depict trends
    3. A comprehensive view of glacier-ice velocities in the coastal
       regions

   One map of the series has been published, US Geological Survey Map
   I-2600-F, Coastal-Change and Glaciological Map of the Bakutis Coast,
   Antarctica, 1972-1990. Ice-velocity measurements have been completed
   for three maps.

  Data sets available online

   All Landsat images used in the Glacier Studies Project are archived at
   the USGS EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, SD. The data base can be
   searched on the Internet.
