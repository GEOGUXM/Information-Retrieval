The First Joint Space Internet Workshop

                      NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

                             Greenbelt, Maryland

                           November 13 - 15, 2000

Official Announcement



Scope

   The Science, Engineering, and Standards communities are pleased to
   announce the first of a series of Space Internet Workshops.  This
   series will address all issues related to Internet or Internet-like
   communication protocols in space environments.  The vision is to bring
   together and integrate the Internet, the Consultative Committee for
   Space Data Systems, and any other applicable protocol suites, to enable
   transparent end-to-end Internet (or future Internet) communications to
   space missions resources.  Communications within and between the
   various space environments are included.  The purpose of this first
   workshop is to foster broadly based, comprehensive discussion of
   cost-effective technical solutions for the design and engineering of
   mission communications.  The goal is to develop an understanding of the
   technical "territory" and to plan for working the issues in future
   workshops.

   The first workshop seeks to bring forth results and information that
   will help to:


     1.  Describe the science drivers and requirements with respect to
     communications and information exchange

     2.  Define and characterize the different communication domains for
     space applications

     3.  Identify and explore the currently available and proposed
     technical approaches

     4.  Map the technical approaches onto the operational domains

     5.  Identify areas where solutions do exist and areas where further
     study, analysis, or development is needed

   All types of missions


     * robotic and manned missions
     * scientific, military, and commercial spacecraft
     * constellations, formation-flying missions, and single nodes
     * nano- and micro-, and macro-satellites
     * relay satellites
     * buoys, balloons, and aircraft
     * planetary rovers

   and "space" environments, for example:


     * Local or Wired
     * In Situ
     * Severely Resource Constrained
     * Nearby
     * Circum-planetary
     * Deep Space

   are of interest.  Issues and solutions related to space and ground
   systems and operations as well as mission design and implementation
   will be under consideration.

   Workshop participants are invited to present position papers, identify
   issues, and discuss ways to expand the solution space.  Participants
   are encouraged to consider end-to-end engineering issues and overall
   cost-benefit trades.  All workshop activities will take place in an
   open forum and participants are advised that there is no explicit
   protection for proprietary information.

Call for Abstracts

   Selection of all contributed oral presentations is based on the
   submitted abstracts.  An individual may be an author on more than one
   submission.  A selection committee will determine which oral
   presentation to accept, by considering quality and significance of the
   content as well as its appropriateness to the subject and scope of the
   workshop.

   Submitters of non selected oral presentations will be invited to
   contribute their paper as a poster or technical demonstration.  Oral,
   poster, or demonstration presentations may discuss or describe
   applications of commercial products/services, but must be substantially
   more than advertisement in nature.

   International participants are welcome, as are participants from
   governmental, private, academic, and commercial/industrial
   organizations.

   All submissions and presentations must adhere to relevant government
   regulations regarding disclosure and distribution.  Submission will
   constitute approval to publish in any way or in any venue (including
   the Internet) deemed appropriate by the organizing committee.  Such
   publication will not imply endorsement by NASA, the US government, or
   any other entity.

   Submitted abstracts should be between one and two pages (8.5" x 11") in
   length and must relate directly to the subject and scope of the
   workshop.  Abstracts should be submitted as plain text, with a list of
   the authors and their affiliations (including address), telephone
   numbers, and email addresses.  Submit abstracts electronically via
   email addressed to the organizing committee at

     spaceinternetworkshop@listserv.gsfc.nasa.gov

   Send all questions, including those regarding formatting or
   appropriateness of material to be included in a submission, to the
   organizing committee at the same email address.

   We prefer to receive abstracts as plain text only.  Abstracts should
   also be accompanied by certain essential information.  From the
   workshop home page (http://siw.gsfc.nasa.gov), please consult the page
   concerning guidelines on abstract/paper/presentation submission.
