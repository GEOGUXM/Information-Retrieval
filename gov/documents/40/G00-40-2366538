   The Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA), and the State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality held
   a public workshop for the 60 percent design stage for a disposal
   complex to consolidate on-site contaminated soil, debris, and liquids
   from environmental cleanup activities. The facility will be located at
   the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and
   is known as the INEEL CERCLA^1 Disposal Facility (ICDF). The agencies
   held an information workshop on November 12, 2001 from 5 to 8 p.m. at
   the Shilo Inn in Idaho Falls.

   The format was similar to the first workshop held on July 16, 2001,
   where the agencies discussed issues concerning the preliminary (30
   percent) design. The informal format allows agency and contractor staff
   to discuss in detail information on the project status, answer
   questions, and exchange ideas on how to best proceed with completion of
   the design. The topics covered include:
    1. Types of waste acceptable for management in the ICDF Complex, which
       includes the Landfill, Evaporation Pond, and the Staging, Storage,
       Sizing, and Treatment Facility (SSSTF)
    2. Draft Waste Acceptance Criteria for the ICDF Complex
    3. Generalized process flow and interaction between the SSSTF, the
       ICDF Landfill, and the Evaporation Pond

   The ICDF landfill, which is primarily for soils, and evaporation ponds,
   which are for liquids only, will be engineered facilities for hazardous
   and radioactive contaminants. To protect the Snake River Plain aquifer
   located over 450 feet below, a system of multiple liners and liquid
   collection and diversion points is incorporated into the design. This
   will prevent contaminants from migrating below the bottom of the
   landfill or evaporation ponds and threatening the aquifer. The criteria
   for accepting or rejecting wastes are an important part of this
   protection. The Workshop will provide the public with an opportunity to
   understand what we are planning and discuss their concerns with agency
   and contractor staff involved in the project.
