   ACTUARIAL NOTE

   Number 139 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
   Originally published June 1998 (updated September 2001) Office of the
   Chief Actuary

               Name Distributions in the Social Security Area

                      by Michael W. Shackleford, A.S.A.

   Beginning in 1998, for births in 1996 and 1997, the Office of the Chief
   Actuary has published lists of given names in popularity order by
   gender and year of birth. The original version of these lists were
   published as Actuarial Note 139. Since the inception of this project
   updates have been added for births in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 as
   well as years prior to 1996.

   The source of the data have been samplings from Social Security Number
   card applications. The size of the sample has ranged from 1% to 100%
   depending on the data available at the time the list was compiled. The
   selection criteria is based on the last four digits of the Social
   Security Number, which are random and not correlated with a particular
   geographical region. In cases where multiple cards were issued to the
   same person, a reason for this might be a lost card or a name change,
   the name on the last application was used. Unless otherwise stated
   birth on U.S. soil is not required for inclusion in the sample. An
   exception to this rule are the top 1000 lists for each decade.

   of this project.
