     Stay Out - Stay Alive
     Mine Hazard Awareness Campaign
     _______________________________________________________________________

     More than 70 organizations nationwide are partners in the "Stay
     Out--Stay Alive" public safety campaign.

     "Stay OutStay Alive" is a national public awareness campaign aimed at
     warning children and adults about the dangers of exploring and playing
     on active and abandoned mine sites.
     Every year, dozens of people are injured or killed in recreational
     accidents on mine property. MSHA pioneered "Stay OutStay Alive" three
     years ago to educate the public about the existing hazards. The
     campaign is a partnership of more than 70 federal and state agencies,
     private organizations, businesses and individuals.
     Each April, around Earth Day, "Stay OutStay Alive" partners visited
     schools, communities and youth organizations throughout the country to
     educate children about the importance of steering clear of active and
     abandoned mines.
