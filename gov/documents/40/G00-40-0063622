   The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a comprehensive set of
   digital spatial data that contains information about surface water
   features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, springs and wells.
   Within the NHD, surface water features are combined to form "reaches,"
   which provide the framework for linking water-related data to the NHD
   surface water drainage network. These linkages enable the analysis and
   display of these water-related data in upstream and downstream order.
   The NHD is based upon the content of USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG)
   hydrography data integrated with reach-related information from the EPA
   Reach File Version 3 (RF3). The NHD supersedes DLG and RF3 by
   incorporating them, not by replacing them. Users of DLG or RF3 will
   find the National Hydrography Dataset both familiar and greatly
   expanded and refined.
   While initially based on 1:100,000-scale data, the NHD is designed to
   incorporate and encourage the development of higher resolution data
   required by many users.

   NHD Releveling Underway (12/12/01)
   Append_NHD version 2.11 released (11/20/01)
   NHD Arcview Toolkit version 4.0.0 released (7/3/01)
   The NHD High Resolution Database is now online. As CUs are loaded into
   the database, they will become visible on the map display and available
   for download. (6/01/01)
   Due to a load error, NHD data in the database could have been
   corrupted. We are recommending that any datasets downloaded from March
   26 to April 11, 2001 should be downloaded again. (4/19/01)
