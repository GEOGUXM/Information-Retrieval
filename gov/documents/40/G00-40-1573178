                 Mapping Information Resources for Minnesota

   National Mapping Information - Cartographic data and information
   available through the USGS and its National Mapping Program can be
   accessed through the USGS National Mapping Information World Wide Web
   server. This page provides a starting point to obtain information about
   map products, map dealers, ordering information, data standards, and
   data available online.

  RELATED SITES

   Other USGS facilities in this region with information about
       mapping-related products and geographic information system (GIS)
       resources include:
     * EROS Data Center (EDC): The Earth Resources Observation Systems
       (EROS) Data Center, located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota is a data
       management, systems development, and research field center of the
       U.S. Geological Survey's National Mapping Division. This site
       includes a variety of products and information relating to digital
       cartographic data, aerial photography and remotely sensed imagery.
     * Mid-Continent Mapping Center (MCMC): Mid-Continent Mapping Center
       in Rolla, Missouri is one of several mapping centers in the
       National Mapping Division of the U.S. Geological Survey. This site
       provides access to a variety of information, with specific detail
       available for one of the newest USGS digital map products, the
       Digital Raster Graphic (DRG), a scanned image of a USGS standard
       series topographic map.
     * Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center: The National
       Biological Service (NBS) of the Department of the Interior joined
       the USGS in October 1996 as the Biological Resources Division. The
       Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, located in Onalaska,
       Wisconsin, shares a wide range of biological, physical, spatial,
       and technical data and information relating to the Upper
       Mississippi River System. Established in 1986 as a center for
       ecological monitoring and analysis, the UMESC manages the largest
       river-related inventory, monitoring, research, spatial analysis,
       and information sharing program in the United States.

   The following public sites in Minnesota are state affiliates of the
       USGS Earth Science Information Center (ESIC) network and contain
       information about maps, cartography and GIS:
     * Minnesota Planning's Land Management Information Center (LMIC) was
       established in 1977 by the legislature to promote the use of
       geographic information and analysis in government. The link to Base
       Maps for the 1990s at this site provides information about the
       availability of USGS map products in Minnesota.
     * The University of Minnesota's John R. Borchert Map Library also
       contains a variety of information about maps and cartographic
       information. The Borchert Map Library is a map depository for USGS
       topographic maps and receives copies of published maps and digital
       data as they are completed and released to the public.

  CURRENT TRENDS IN CARTOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

     * The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) encompasses
       policies, standards, and procedures for organizations to
       cooperatively produce and share geospatial data. The Federal
       Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) has assumed leadership in the
       evolution of the NSDI in cooperation with state and local
       governments, academia, and the private sector. The USGS provides
       primary technical and operational support to the FGDC for various
       surveying, mapping and spatial data activities involving standards
       and production.
     * The USGS node of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse is a
       component of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure and provides
       a pathway to find information (i.e., "metadata") about geospatial
       data available from the USGS.

  HOW DO I GET USGS MAPS AND CARTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS?

   There are several ways to obtain USGS map products. There are a number
   of businesses that sell USGS products as commercial map dealers. The
   Minnesota Geological Survey also sells USGS printed maps for Minnesota.
   You can contact the MGS Maps and Publications Sales office at
   612-627-4782.

   The USGS maintains several regional Earth Science Information Centers
   that can provide assistance regarding USGS products and ordering
   procedures. There are also additional internet sites that contain
   information for ordering USGS products. There is also additional
   information on USGS Geospatial Data, Information and Related Products
   for specific inquiries and USGS General Interest Mapping Publications
   for people looking for more generic information.
