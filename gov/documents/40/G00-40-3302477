     Linking to Social Security Online

        Social Security Online welcomes links to our Web site. We prefer that
        you establish links to the Home Page; however, you may create links to
        specific pages within our Web site. Our Home Page address is
        http://www.ssa.gov/

        All external links to Social Security Online should clearly be
        identified as a link to a government site. Social Security cannot
        endorse, or appear to endorse, any commercial products or services. SSA
        does not charge for its services; e.g, there is no charge for an
        application for a new or replacement Social Security Number card or to
        change a name on a card, or for obtaining your Social Security
        Statement of earnings. All of SSA's publications are free.

        You may use the following statement to characterize our site:

        The Social Security Administration's Web site provides information
        about Retirement, Survivors and Disability Insurance Benefits, and
        Supplemental Security Income. The site also provides wage reporting
        information for employers.

        For additional information, send e-mail to webmaster@ssa.gov or use our
        Feedback Form.
