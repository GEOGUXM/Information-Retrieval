   General and Science questions

   Q6: Can I use your images and if so what should the credit line read?

   We are very happy to have our images used for educational purposes. We
   have an image gallery specifically for this purpose. Also, if you are
   looking for images that you think we should have but can't find, please
   contact us at topex@jpl.nasa.gov.

   JPL's image release policy is located at
   http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/imageuse.html . The credit line should
   read 'Courtesy of NASA/JPL/Caltech'. We would also really appreciate
   copies of publications where you use our imagery.

   Q7: Where can I find bathymetric charts?

   The National Ocean Service's (NOS) MapFinder Web Service provides
   direct Internet access to NOS imagery and data holdings for coastal
   photography, nautical charts, historical maps, coastal survey maps,
   environmental sensitivity index maps, hydrographic survey outlines,
   water level stations, estuarine bathymetry, and geodetic control
   points. These are on-line as directly usable products, or as previews
   of higher quality products that can be ordered from NOS. Target users
   of this service are resource managers (municipal planners, protected
   area managers, etc.), but these products will also benefit a wider
   public audience.

   Q8: What is the difference between an El Niño and a La Niña?

   An El Niño has warmer than normal surface waters in the eastern Pacific
   and cooler than normal surface waters in the western Pacific. This is
   generally associated with weaker than normal winds blowing from east to
   west (the Trade winds).

   A La Niña occurs when the waters in the eastern Pacific are much colder
   than normal, while the waters in the west are much warmer than normal.
   During a La Niña, the Trade winds are stronger than normal. For more
   information see our El Niño/ La Niña pages .

   Q9: How can I find out the altitude of my town?
   .

   There are several approaches. You can look in an atlas, quite often the
   altitude is listed. If you have an airport, the authorities there will
   have a very precise measurement. Otherwise look on a topographic map.

   Q10: Is there any equation to correlate sea surface temperature to sea
   surface topography?

   No, there is no direct relationship to convert sea surface temperature
   to sea surface topography, or vice versa. The sea surface temperature
   reflects the temperature in the top centimeter or so of water, whereas
   the sea surface height reflects the heat stored in the ocean. In
   general a 1°C temperature change over 50m gives a 1cm change, however
   changes in sea surface height are a result of many factors in addition
   to heating and cooling.

                                                               Top of Page

   Q11: How is the bathymetry of the ocean floor accounted for in the sea
   surface topography?

   The bathymetry effects are removed by removing the geoid. The
   bathymetry (mass concentrations/holes) cause different gravity signals
   at the ocean surface, which cause a permanent deformation in the sea
   surface that is part of the geoid signal.

                                                               Top of Page
     __________________________________________________________________

   Q12: What is a geoid?

   The geoid is the shape the ocean surface would have if it were covered
   with water at relative rest to a rotating earth. The geoid will be
   pulled away from a perfect sphere due to mass concentrations. Note also
   that the rotation rate of the Earth affects the geoid. The geoid is the
   sum of gravity effects and rotational effects.

                                                               Top of Page

   Q13: What is the reference ellipsoid, and what does this mean
   physically?

   The reference ellipsoid is basically a convenience so that we don't
   have to work with larger numbers, and so that we can get more precision
   in our calculations. The reference ellipsoid is the best fitting
   ellipsoid to the geoid. An ellipsoid is basically a sphere with a bulge
   at the equator. To first order, this accounts for over 90% of the
   geoid. Also, sea surface height measurements from the center of the
   Earth are on the order of 6000 km. By removing a reference surface, the
   heights relative to the ellipsoid are on the order of 100 meters. Thus,
   one can gain several digits of accuracy in numerical calculations.

   In fact, any reference surface can be used. A sphere would work, but
   sea surface height differences from this surface could be as large as
   20 km, thus one would loose the precision that is possible by using an
   ellipsoid.

   Q14. What is the sensitivity and accuracy of the instrument regarding
   windspeed?

   Wind speed is determined from the radar backscatter cross section
   (sigma0) measurement and an empirical relationship of backscatter to
   wind ("model function"). Sigma0 is reported with a precision of 0.25 dB
   which translates to about 0.5 m/s for typical wind speeds. Comparisons
   to buoys show a variance of about 1.5 m/s. Sigma0 calibration is
   maintained to about 0.1 dB.

   Q15. What is the repeat time for the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite

   TOPEX/Poseidon is in a "10 day" (9.9155 d) exact repeat at an
   inclination of 66 degrees. The ground tracks are about 315 km apart at
   the equator and the orbit period is 112 minutes.

                                                               Top of Page

   Q16. What is the swath width of the windspeed imagery?

   The exact footprint size of the altimeter depends on the significant
   wave height, but it is 3-5 km in diameter for typical wave heights.
   Measurements are taken approximately 1/sec along track giving a spacing
   of about 6 km.

   Q17. Where I could find information (images) of the ocean floor?

   Q18: What is the horizontal resolution of the TOPEX/Poseidon
   altimeters?

   The measurement geometry and operation principles of the TOPEX
   Altimeter are very well described in D. B. Chelton, et als, "Pulse
   compression and sea level tracking in satellite altimetry", J.
   Atmospheric and Oceanic Tech., Vol 6, #3, June 1989.

   The altimeter footprint for ocean applications (or other very flat
   surfaces, relief less than 100 m) is determined by the compressed pulse
   length (3.125 nsec), the satellite altitude, and the significant wave
   height. At the TOPEX altitude of 1335 km, the footprint diameter varies
   from 2.0 km at 0 m SWH (not very realistic) to 5.5 km at 3 m SWH
   (typical of open ocean) to 11.7 km at 15 m SWH (about the highest
   observed during the TOPEX mission).

   Measurement values are reported at approximately 1 per second, although
   high rate data at 10/sec are also given. In 1 sec the satellite nadir
   point moves about 6 km along the Earth's surface.

   For land or ice applications, the beam width of the antenna may be
   important as returns may come from anywhere within it. It has a
   diameter of 25 km.

   Q19. When we have meteor showers, can anything be done to protect the
   TOPEX/Poseidon satellite?

   TOPEX/Poseidon rotates it solar array during large meteor showers to
   minimize the cross section panel exposure to the incoming meteoroids.
