The Problem

     * Rather than being able to fly the most efficient route to a
       destination, aircraft operators in today's air traffic control
       system are usually constrained to follow established airways that
       are often comprised of inefficient route segments.
     * Current air traffic control user interface inefficiencies inhibit
       controllers from issuing user preferred routes, even under light
       traffic conditions.

The Solution is the Direct-To Tool

   Screenshot of the Direct-To Planview Graphical User Interface D
     * Direct-To identifies aircraft that can save at least one minute by
       flying direct to a down-stream fix on their route of flight.
     * A Direct-To list on the controller's display shows eligible
       aircraft, time savings, direct-to fixes, and conflict status.
     * The point-and-click Trial Planner allows controllers to easily
       display, modify, or accept Direct-To flight plan amendments.
     * Acceptance of the Direct-To advisory automatically sends a
       ``6-7-10'' flight plan amendment to the Host computer.

Direct-To Features

     * Time and fuel saving direct routes are displayed as advisories to
       controllers in real time.
     * Direct-To advisories are probed for conflicts with expanded
       separation criteria.
     * The point-and-click interface keeps the controller's eyes on the
       traffic display and eliminates keyboard entries for route
       amendments.

Direct-To Success

     * Potential savings in flying time for Ft. Worth Center airspace is
       approximately 1,800 minutes per day or about 2.5 minutes per
       aircraft.
     * Over 35 controllers from 9 different Air Route Control Centers
       participated in the development, simulation, and field testing of
       the CTAS Trial Planner which forms the basis for the Direct-To
       interface.
     * Controllers pointed out a preferred use of the Trial Planner:
       Searching for and evaluating conflict free direct routes.
