     __________________________________________________________________

   The U.S. UV-B Interagency Monitoring Strategy calls for the development
   and implementation, by the joint effort between NIST and NOAA, of a
   Central UV Calibration Facility (CUCF). Its sole purpose is to provide
   long term, NIST traceable instrument calibrations and characterizations
   for the U.S. UV-B monitoring Networks which are operated by the
   supporting agencies (USDA, EPA, NSF, etc.). The success of the U.S.
   Interagency UV monitoring network will require a strong commitment to
   calibration. The use of a common calibration facility and standards
   will provide quality assurance of data for the participating networks.
   In order to detect trends in UV-B radiation, the measurement base must
   be stable over the decades of the monitoring effort. The U.S. agencies
   will, in all probability, be deploying instruments of different designs
   and in different locations to achieve the individual goals of the
   agencies. The calibration facility will provide as services:

          bullet Irradiance calibrations and slit scattering/stray light
          measurements for spectral instruments.
          bullet Absolute irradiance calibration.
          bullet Angular response measurements.
          bullet Linearity measurements for broad band and multi -filter
          instruments.

   In addition, field audits will be conducted with a field calibrator for
   the spectral instruments. These measurements will be conducted on an
   annual or semi-annual basis as needed, determined by the stability of
   each instrument. The central calibration facility also hosts the annual
   spectoradiometer intercomparisons held at the Table Mountain Test
   Facility located north of Boulder, Colorado.
