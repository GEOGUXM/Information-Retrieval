     * What is the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) listserv?
       The ODS listserv is a convenient way to receive news from the ODS
       through e-mail. If you join the listserv, you will receive periodic
       e-mail messages containing information about the ODS website and
       other news from the ODS. Although there is no set timeframe for
       these e-mail messages, you can expect to receive them approximately
       once per month.

     * What will be contained in the listserv e-mails I receive?
       The e-mails will notify you of significant updates to the ODS
       website as well as other news about the ODS. This will include
       information such as the availability of new fact sheets on dietary
       supplements, updates to the IBIDS database of dietary supplements
       research, information about upcoming workshops and conferences,
       announcements of requests for grant applications, as well as
       summaries, proceedings or bibliographies from previously held
       workshops and conferences.

     * Will listserv subscribers be able to send e-mails to the listserv
       or identify others in the listserv by name or e-mail address?
       No. For privacy reasons, names and e-mail addresses of listserv
       subscribers will not be available to other listserv subscribers,
       nor will listserv subscribers be able to send messages to the
       listserv. Only the ODS will be authorized to send e-mail messages
       through the listserv. Although listserv subscribers will be able to
       reply to e-mails received from the ODS, it is unlikely that the ODS
       will be able to respond to individual e-mails.

     * How do I subscribe to the listserv?
       Send an e-mail to LISTSERV@LIST.NIH.GOV
       Leave the subject line blank and write the following text in the
       message body:
       subscribe NIH-ODS-L your name
       where your name is your first name followed by your last name. For
       example, John Smith would subscribe as follows:
       subscribe NIH-ODS-L John Smith
       Shortly after you send the e-mail, you will receive a confirmation
       by e-mail welcoming you to the ODS listserv. To confirm your
       subscription, you will have to respond to the e-mail.

     * If at a later time, I'd like to be removed from the ODS listserv,
       how do I unsubscribe?
       Send an e-mail to LISTSERV@LIST.NIH.GOV
       Leave the subject line blank and write the following text in the
       message body:
       unsubscribe NIH-ODS-L
