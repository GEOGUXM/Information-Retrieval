Introduction

   Regulations implementing legislation effective on January 1, 2000,
   require that architects renewing registration of a license on or after
   July 1, 2001 must satisfy continuing education requirements. For those
   renewing before January 1, 2003, the number of contact hours needed
   will vary, but will not exceed 36 hours. On and after January 1, 2003,
   36 contact hours of continuing education in each three-year
   registration period will be required.

   The statutes that apply to these requirements are available on this
   site. In addition, you may request the regulations by contacting the
   State Board for Architecture by phone at (518) 474-3817 ext. 110, fax
   at (518) 486-2981, e-mail at archbd@mail.nysed.gov or by writing New
   York State Education Department, Office of the Professions, State Board
   for Architecture, State Education Building - 2nd Floor, 89 Washington
   Avenue, Albany, New York, 12234.

   This document is designed to respond to frequently asked questions. It
   is not a substitute for reading the provisions of law, rule or
   regulation, including Part 69 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of
   Education and Part 29 of the Rules of the Board of Regents.

General Information

    1. Is there a difference between "licensure" and "registration"?
       Yes. In New York State, upon satisfaction of the eligibility
       requirements, a "license" is awarded. Licensure is for life unless
       suspended, revoked or annulled for reasons of misconduct.
       To practice the profession of architecture in New York, a licensee
       must be currently "registered". Registration is for a three-year
       period.
     __________________________________________________________________

Continuing Education Requirements

    2. Am I required to take continuing education?
       Yes. Effective January 1, 2000, every architect using his or her
       New York license must take continuing education. No one is exempt.
    3. What if there are circumstances which make it impossible for me to
       comply?
       The Department may grant an adjustment to the requirement for
       reasons, which in the Department's judgment, make it impossible for
       the licensee to comply. An adjustment may be granted for reasons of
       health certified by an appropriate health care professional, for
       extended active duty with the armed forces of the United States, or
       for other good cause acceptable to the Department which may prevent
       compliance. For more information regarding an adjustment to this
       requirement, contact the State Board for Architecture.
    4. I just passed all divisions of the Architect Registration
       Examination (ARE) and received my license. Since I am in my first
       registration period, do I need to take continuing education courses
       immediately?
       No. Licensees are not required to take continuing education during
       their first three-year registration period. After that, architects
       must take 36 hours of continuing education in each subsequent
       registration period.
    5. I am currently practicing in another state and just received a New
       York license by endorsement. Do I need to take continuing education
       courses immediately?
       You are exempt from taking continuing education only during the
       first three years following your initial licensure, regardless of
       the jurisdiction in which you were licensed. If you were licensed
       more than three years before obtaining your New York licensure,
       then the continuing education requirements must be completed when
       you renew your New York registration.
     __________________________________________________________________

Amount of Continuing Education Required

    6. I renew my registration on or before December 31, 2000. How many
       continuing education credits must I take?
       None. Completion of the continuing education requirement does not
       apply to any registration renewals prior to January 1, 2001. The
       continuing education requirement must be met for any
       re-registration as of January 1, 2001.
    7. I renew my registration in 2001 or 2002. How many continuing
       education credits must I take?
       You will need a prorated number of hours of continuing education
       determined by the month and year in which you renew your
       registration. The proration is at the rate of one (1) contact hour
       per month for the period from January 1, 2000, to the renewal date.
       During this period, licensees will need at least 12 but not more
       than 36 contact hours, as shown below. For subsequent renewals
       (after January 1, 2003), architects will need at least 36 contact
       hours of continuing education.
    8. What is an hour of continuing education?
       An hour is one contact hour of at least 50 minutes duration. Most
       continuing education providers give credit in hours (e.g., one AIA
       Learning Unit [LU] is equivalent to one contact hour of continuing
       education), however, some courses may be given in continuing
       education units.
       One continuing education unit (CEU) equals 10 contact hours.
       Therefore, 0.1 CEU equals one contact hour, 0.2 CEUs equals two
       contact hours, and so on.
       Individuals completing one semester hour of college-level course
       work taken over the course of a college semester equals 15 contact
       hours. One-quarter hour of college-level course work taken over the
       course of a college semester equals 10 contact hours.
    9. May I take more than the specified number of hours of continuing
       education?
       Yes. The regulations set the minimum requirements for practice in
       New York State. You may take as many more hours of continuing
       education as you wish.
   10. I am licensed in New York State but am not registered (my
       registration is inactive) and I am practicing my profession in
       another jurisdiction. Do I need to complete continuing education
       before I can reactivate my New York State registration?
       Yes. To reactivate your New York State registration, depending on
       how long your registration was inactive, you will have to document
       the number of continuing education credits from January 1, 2000 to
       the date your registration expired, plus the number of credits
       during which your registration was inactive. You are required to
       take 1 continuing education hour for each month your registration
       is inactive, up to a maximum of 36 hours. Since you are actively
       practicing your profession, you will be able to count continuing
       education credits earned up to 36 months prior to the month in
       which you reactivate your registration.
   11. I am licensed in New York State but am not registered (my
       registration is inactive) because I have not been practicing my
       profession in any jurisdiction. Do I need to complete continuing
       education before I can reactivate my registration?
       Yes. To reactivate your New York State registration, depending on
       how long your registration was inactive, you will have to document
       the number of continuing education credits from January 1, 2000 to
       the date your registration expired, plus the number of credits
       during which your registration was inactive. You are required to
       take 1 continuing education hour for each month your registration
       is inactive, up to a maximum of 36 hours. Since you are not
       actively practicing your profession, you will only be able to count
       continuing education credits earned up to 12 months prior to the
       month in which you reactivate your registration.
   12. Must I take a specific number of continuing education courses each
       year during my registration period?
       No. As long as you complete the required number of hours, you may
       take all courses in one year, if you wish.
     __________________________________________________________________

Subjects and Providers of Continuing Education

   13. What courses are acceptable for continuing education?
       To be acceptable the courses must be administered by an approved
       New York State sponsor (provider), in an approved subject area, and
       in an approved course format. See question #14 for a listing of
       approved sponsors and question #15 for a listing of approved
       subject areas. Of the total contact hours required, two-thirds must
       be formal courses (interaction with an instructor, e.g. a seminar,
       workshop, lecture, etc.). Of the total contact hours required, no
       more than one-third may be in formal self-study courses. (Formal
       self-study: a course in an approved subject area, which has a
       testing instrument, which is completed by the licensee and returned
       to the sponsor for scoring. A passing grade is required before a
       sponsor may award continuing education credit.) Any course in which
       a sponsor requires the use of a self-reporting form will not be
       accepted for continuing education credit.
   14. Who are approved sponsors (providers)?
       Architects have three types of approved sponsors (providers):
         a. Sponsors recognized by the American Institute of Architects
            (AIA) Continuing Education Program or by an organization
            determined by the State Board for Architecture to have
            equivalent standards.
            The American Institute of Architects Continuing Education
            System list of recognized sponsors is available from the
            Continuing Education Program, 1735 New York Avenue NW,
            Washington, DC 20006-5292 or at the AIA's Web site at
            www.aia.org.
            NYS Continuing Education credits may now be earned based on
            the articles published in Architectural Record as of the
            November 2001 issue. To obtain NYS CE credit for articles in
            the November and December 2001 issues, Option B on the
            Architectural Record Continuing Education report form must be
            used. The licensee must read the article, answer the questions
            on the report form, and send the completed form to the address
            printed on the form. Architectural Record will score the test
            and, if a passing score is obtained, a certificate of
            completion will be sent to the licensee. The certificate of
            completion should be retained in the licensee’s records for a
            period of six-years. The articles are considered formal
            self-study courses and no more than one-third of the total
            contact hours required may be accepted for NYS CE credit.
            As of the January 2002 issue of Architectural Record, to
            obtain NYS CE credit for these articles, the licensee must
            read the article, answer the questions on the report form, and
            send the completed form to the address printed on the form.
            Architectural Record will score the test and, if a passing
            score is obtained:
               o If a licensee is a member of AIA, Architectural Record
                 will forward the results to AIA/CES records office at the
                 University of Oklahoma for inclusion on AIA continuing
                 education transcripts. OR
               o If a licensee is not a member of AIA, a certificate of
                 completion will be sent to the licensee. The certificate
                 should be retained in the licensee’s records for a period
                 of six-years.
            Note: If a licensee obtains AIA/CES credit by using a
            self-reporting form (sending a completed report form to the
            University of Oklahoma Continuing Education), the articles
            will not be accepted for NYS CE credit. Any course in which a
            sponsor requires the use of a self-reporting form will not be
            accepted for NYS CE credit.
         b. Colleges, universities, and other degree-granting institutions
            offering degree (e.g. A.A.S., B.S., M.S.), certificate or
            diploma programs carrying degree credit that are registered by
            the State Education Department (SED) or that are accredited by
            an equivalent accrediting agency. Only college level courses
            in those registered or accredited programs will be accepted in
            this category (b) for continuing education credit. Sponsors of
            non-college level courses (credit awarded in CEU's, LU's,
            etc.) must be approved under category (a) or (c).
            The State Education Department's "Institutional Directory"
            lists all degree granting institutions in the State and can be
            found on SED's Web site at www.highered.nysed.gov/ocue.
         c. Sponsors (providers) approved directly by the Education
            Department.
               o NYS Department of State, Division of Code Enforcement and
                 Administration, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12231, (518)
                 474-4073, www.dos.state.ny.us
            For information on other sponsors (providers) approved
            directly by the Department, contact the State Board for
            Architecture by telephone at (518) 474-3817 ext. 110, fax at
            (518) 486-2981 or e-mail at archbd@mail.nysed.gov.
   15. Is there any limitation on the subject matter of the coursework?
       Yes. The course must contribute to the professional practice in
       your profession. Of the 36 hours required, at least two-thirds (24
       hours) must be in the areas of health, safety and welfare (HSW).
       However, no more than one-third (12 hours) will be accepted in
       other topics, which contribute to the professional practice of
       architecture as such practice is defined in section 7301 of the
       Education Law. The key is the subject matter's relationship to
       professional practice. Therefore subjects that are not so related
       (e.g., office management) are not acceptable.
       Acceptable Subjects:
       Health, Safety and Welfare Areas:
          + accessibility
          + acoustics
          + building design
          + code of ethics
          + codes, acts, laws, and regulations governing the practice of
            architecture
          + construction administration
          + construction contract law
          + construction documents and services
          + construction functions, materials, methods, and systems
          + energy efficiency
          + environmental issues - including asbestos, lead based paint,
            toxic emissions
          + environmental analysis and issues of building materials and
            systems
          + building fire loads - flame spread, smoke contribution,
            explosives
          + fire safety systems - detection and alarm standards
          + insurance to protect the owners of property and injured
            parties
          + life safety codes
          + materials and systems - roofing/waterproofing, wall systems,
            and other systems
          + materials and methods, use and function
          + mechanical plumbing, electrical - system concepts, materials
            and methods
          + natural hazards - impact of earthquake, hurricane, or flood
            related to building design
          + building preservation, renovation, restoration, and adaptive
            re-use
          + design of security of buildings
          + site and soils analysis
          + site design
          + specification writing
          + structural issues
          + surveying methods and techniques
          + sustainable designs
          + other matters of law and ethics which contribute to the
            health, safety and welfare of the public
       Other Topics:
          + Other topics, which contribute to the professional practice of
            architecture as such practice is defined in section 7301 of
            the Education Law, (e.g. Intermediate or higher level Auto Cad
            Courses. Basic Auto Cad Courses will not be accepted for NYS
            continuing education credit.)
   16. Can I study on my own rather than take a formal or self-study
       course?
       No. Independent study or informal group "study clubs" of architects
       that are not approved sponsors can not be accepted. Only formal
       courses or self-study courses offered by approved sponsors may be
       counted toward the continuing education requirement. Formal courses
       offered by approved sponsors assure course content, effective
       evaluation, and record keeping by the provider.
   17. Am I required to take self-study courses?
       No. All the courses may be formal courses in which you interact
       with an instructor, if you wish. However, of the total number of CE
       hours required, no more than one-third (12 hours) may be self study
       courses.
   18. Are formal courses limited to a traditional "classroom setting" in
       which I'm in the same room with the instructor?
       No. A formal course is:
          + A telecourse or teleconference in which you and the instructor
            can communicate directly with each other.
          + Where you and other practitioners discuss a taped presentation
            with a facilitator's assistance.
          + A computer course in which you interact directly with the
            instructor.
       However, a televised lecture with no means of direct interaction is
       not considered to be a formal course, even if it is a live
       telecast.
   19. May I count toward my requirement a continuing education course
       that I teach?
       Yes. The hours in a continuing education course you teach through
       an approved sponsor in an acceptable subject area may be counted
       only once during a registration period.
     __________________________________________________________________

Record Keeping and Reporting

   20. What records will I have to keep?
       You will need to keep the following five items of information on
       each course for six years from the date you completed it:
         1. title of the course or program and any identification number
            assigned to it by the sponsor
         2. number of hours completed
         3. the sponsor's name and any identifying number
         4. verification by the sponsor of your attendance
         5. the date and location of the program or course
       All five elements are likely to be provided on a certificate of
       completion from the sponsor. If so, KEEP IT!
   21. What information must I provide the Education Department when I
       renew my registration?
       Send your completed registration form, on which you will attest
       that you completed the required continuing education hours,
       together with the registration fee, which is currently $210.00, and
       the continuing education fee, which is currently $45.00, for a
       total of $255.00.
   22. Do I have to file copies of my continuing education records with
       the Department?
       No. You must certify that you have completed the coursework on the
       registration form and submit it to the Department. However, you are
       required to make your continuing education records available for
       inspection by the Education Department upon our request. We audit
       random samples of mandatory continuing education records to assure
       compliance with the continuing education requirement.
   23. What documentation must I provide if my continuing education
       records are audited?
       You will have to provide the Department with your original records
       of completion for each continuing education course.
   24. What if the audit reveals discrepancies?
       You may be subject to disciplinary proceedings for professional
       misconduct. Willfully making or filing a false report is
       unprofessional conduct, according to Section 29.1 of the Rules of
       the Board of Regents. Penalties may include censure and reprimand,
       fine, and/or suspension or revocation of your license.
   25. What if I fail to complete the required number of hours?
       If you request, the Department, at its discretion, may issue you a
       conditional registration. The conditional registration is valid for
       not more than one year only and is not renewable. To be granted
       such a conditional registration you would have to (1) agree to
       remedy the deficiency during the period of conditional
       registration, (2) complete the regular continuing education
       requirement at a rate of 1 contact hour per month, and (3) pay the
       fee for the conditional registration, which is currently $255.00.
       At the end of the conditional registration period, you must submit
       to the Department, your continuing education records certifying
       that you have completed the required coursework and pay the regular
       registration fee, which is currently $255.00, for the remaining two
       years of the registration period.
   26. What if I don't meet the continuing education requirement and
       simply don't renew my registration?
       If you do not renew your registration, you can not use your New
       York license in this State. If you practice your profession after
       the Department has denied renewal of your registration for failure
       to report completion of the required contact hours of continuing
       education, you are subject to disciplinary proceedings for
       professional misconduct.
