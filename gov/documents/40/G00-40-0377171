   Read the following information before using any image from the NSF
   Image Library:
     * Unless otherwise indicated, images contained in the library are
       available for use in print and electronic material by NSF employees
       and possibly members of the media, university staff, teachers, and
       the general public.
     * Images in the library may be: in the public domain; available for
       limited use; available for use only with specific permission
       granted by the owner, as stated under "Restrictions" on the Image
       Information screen.
     * Users of the library are required by law to honor all copyright
       restrictions indicated herein.
     * Prior to using an image in the library, check under "Restrictions"
       on the Image Information screen for that image to see if there are
       any restrictions stated. If there is a restriction to use the
       image, you must show NSF verification that you have contacted the
       owner (individual and/or organization) and been granted permission
       to use the image before NSF will authorize your use of the image or
       send you a high resolution image file. Proof of authorization can
       be in the form of a letter on organization letterhead or an e-mail
       from the owner. The letter or e-mail should clearly state that you
       have been given permission to use the image. Copies of letters can
       be faxed to NSF, "Attention Administrator, NSF Image Library," at
       703-292-9087. E-mail documentation can either be faxed or forwarded
       via e-mail to OLPA-Images@nsf.gov. When sending documentation, be
       sure and state which image in the library you are referring to.
       These restrictions must be adhered to. Many of the images in the
       library do not belong to NSF and permission must be granted by the
       owner prior to use.
     * You must submit an electronic request form to NSF that explains
       your intended use of the image prior to using any image in the
       library. This form can be found on the Image Information screen
       under "Request this Image."
     * Once the user has been given confirmation that an image is
       available to use, they may proceed with using the image provided
       they credit the individual and/or organization named in the "Credit
       Line," found on the Image Information screen for the image.
     * Granting the right to use an image from the NSF Image Library does
       not explicitly or implicitly convey NSF's endorsement of the site
       or document in which it is used or the entity using it.

   Please send inquries to OLPA-Images@nsf.gov.
