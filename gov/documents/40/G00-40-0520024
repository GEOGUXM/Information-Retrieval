                Ocean Color Data, Information, and Resources

                  Welcome to the Ocean Color Data Web Site

    The remote sensing of ocean color from space provides information on
    the abundance of phytoplankton and the concentration of dissolved and
    particulate material in surface ocean waters. This information can be
      used to investigate biological productivity in the oceans, marine
    optical properties, the interaction of winds and currents with ocean
    biology, and how human activities influence the oceanic environment.
      The Goddard DAAC provides access to data from ocean color sensors
          currently in operation, as well as historical data sets.
