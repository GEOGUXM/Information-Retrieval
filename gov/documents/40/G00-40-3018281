                                                 Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center

                                   The mission of the laboratory is:

     * To determine the interrelationships of dietary intake of energy,
       fiber, fat and fatty acids, and selected fat soluble micronutrients
       to metabolic and physiological parameters in humans so that
       recommendations for intakes of these nutrients are consistent with
       life-long maintenance of health and optimum quality of life for the
       diverse population of adult Americans.  Lack of knowledge of how
       lipids, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, other nutrients and alcohol
       interact in human metabolism limits our ability to predict how
       different intake patterns will affect an individual's health and
       well being.  This is especially important in developing
       recommendations for prevention of the most prevalent diseases, such
       as cancer, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity.
       Understanding the relationship between energy metabolism and diet
       and body composition is critical to defining optimal dietary
       intakes of fat, carbohydrate, protein, fiber and other nutrients to
       prevent disease.
