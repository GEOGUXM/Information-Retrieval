      Security Notice

      This Web site is part of a federal computer system used to accomplish
      federal functions. The Department of Energy (DOE) monitors this Web
      site for security purposes to ensure it remains available to all users
      and to protect information in the system. By accessing this Web site,
      you are expressly consenting to these monitoring activities.

      Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features, to use
      the system for other than intended purposes, to deny service to
      authorized users, to access, obtain, alter, damage, or destroy
      information, or otherwise interfere with the system or its operation
      are prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law
      enforcement authorities and result in criminal prosecution under the
      Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 990474) and the National
      Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-294),
      (18 U.S.C. 1030), or other applicable criminal laws.

      Privacy Notice

      We collect no personal information about you when you visit a DOE Web
      site, unless otherwise stated, unless you choose to provide this
      information to us. However, we collect and store certain information
      automatically. What we collect and store automatically is: the Internet
      Protocol (IP) address of the domain from which you access the Internet
      (i.e. 123.456.789.012), whether yours individually or provided as a
      proxy by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the date and time you
      access our site, the pages you peruse (recorded by the text and
      graphics files that compose that page), and the Internet address of the
      Web site from which you linked directly to our site.

      We use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to
      visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least
      interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the
      site's technical design specifications and identifying system
      performance or problem areas. This information is NOT shared with
      anyone beyond the support staff to this home page, except when required
      by law enforcement investigation, and is used only as a source of
      anonymous statistical information.

      You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail
      message containing your comments or questions. We use this information
      to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. There are
      times when your message is forwarded, as e-mail, to other Department of
      Energy employees who may be better able to help you. Except for
      authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail
      with any other outside organizations.
