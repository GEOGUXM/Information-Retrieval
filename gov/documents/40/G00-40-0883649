         Alkanes

         Alkanes, especially methane, are abundant, relatively unreactive
         chemicals. They represent a valuable but as yet untapped source of
         chemical feedstocks. Research goals are to include
           * Identify factors that influence the controlled activation of C-H
             bonds on metals, metal oxides, and transition metal complexes
           * Discover novel pathways for selective conversion of methane to
             other products
           * Develop new classes of catalysts for homologation of alkanes and
             converting them into useful products

           * Hydride Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions of Transition
             Metal Hydrides Kinetic and Mechanistic Studies

           * C-H and B-C Bond Activation and C-C Coupling Reactions with
             Cationic Platinum Complexes

         Oxidation

         Alkylation

         Alkylation is used in refineries to upgrade light olefins and isobutane
         into more valuable gasoline components. Alkylate has high octane and
         low vapor pressure, which allow lower-cost butane to be used in
         gasoline. Light olefins are produced from catalytic crackers, cokers,
         and visbreakers. Unfortunately, current akylation catalysts are based
         on HF and H2SO4,highly toxic and corrosive compounds. Research
         concentrates on finding a safer catalyst system. Goals are
           * Developing solid-acid alkylation catalysits with sustained activity
             at low temperature
           * Identifying factors that control acid site density and strength in
             solid-acid catalysts

         Current projects include
           * Alkylation of Aromatics at Supercritical Fluid Conditions

         Polymerization

         Research goals are to
           * Identify ways to control polymer architecture and composition
           * Develop hetergeneous single-site catalysts
           * Develop catalysts for incorporating various functional groups
             during olefin polymerization
           * Develop heterogeneous catalysts for synthesizing chiral polymers
