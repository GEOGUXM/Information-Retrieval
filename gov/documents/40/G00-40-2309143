                                Service Guide

   NCUM, along with our contract supplier(s), can provide a turnkey
   operation for your organization by administering your entire natural
   gas procurement program with substantial cost savings to you. The
   purpose of this guide is to provide details about each of the service
   components throughout the operation.

                           Customer contacts NCUM
                           Cost effective contract
                            While on the contract
                            Required by Facility

   When a customer first contacts NCUM:

       1.   The customer will be asked to provide their last twelve months
   gas invoices. The NCUM staff will             analyze this data to
   determine:

     A.  The facilities gas usage pattern.

     B.  The applicable rate schedule the facility is currently on.

     C.  What the facility is currently paying for natural gas.

     D.  The information to provide a cost comparison of our contract
     supply cost to the
           local tariff supply cost. (This is to determine cost
     effectiveness of coming onto the
           program or to compare GSA to an alternative approach.)

       2.  The Local Gas Company is contacted to find out if the facility
   can transport natural gas under
            their current rate structures.

       3.  The customer is made aware of what is available under our
   natural gas contract such as:

     A.  The ability to determine if they want a fixed gas price or an
     index based gas price.

     B.  The ability to decide how your natural gas is purchased.

     C.  The ability to cancel your natural gas contract with a thirty
     day written notice.

     D.  If there are multiple rates or no transportation rates
     available, we will negotiate the
          most favorable rate for the facility.

       4.  The customer is made aware of billing and administration
   options and alternatives.

   Once it is determined that it is cost effective and the customer
   decides to use our contract:

    1. NCUM will obtain a letter of intent from the prospective customer
       to their Local Distribution Company informing them of their intent
       to start on the program.
    2. The Facilities Contracting Officer will issue a Task Order to the
       Contractor and supply a copy to the NCUM Contracting Officer.
    3. The Contractor and NCUM will ensure that all necessary
       documentation is in place to allow the facility to transport
       natural gas.
    4. Arrangements will be made for daily gas meter readings from the
       facility if applicable.
    5. The facility will be given a start date.

                            Return to Top of Page

   While the facility is on the contract, NCUM will:
    1. Monitor the facility's daily gas usage.
    2. Ensure that the facility is not being charged for unwarranted
       penalties.
    3. Notify the facility of situations that may arise which may allow
       them to benefit from the fluctuations in the gas market.
    4. Review all natural gas invoices for accuracy

                            Return to Top of Page

   While the facility is on the contract it will be required to:
    1. Provide daily gas meter readings if applicable.
    2. Provide copies of all natural gas invoices each month.
    3. Provide a 24-hour point of contact.
    4. Inform NCUM at least 48 hours in advance of any fuel switching.
