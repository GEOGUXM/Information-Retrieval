   Web Fire Maps
   Interactive GIS fire data for US

   View an interactive map incorporating active fire detection point data
   from MODIS with physical features and the University of Maryland's land
   cover product. You can display for fire detections in a given date
   range, and query a particular detection for more information (time,
   brightness temp, lat/lon).

   Cumulative Fire Extent: California North/South & Great Basin West
   Geographic Area (7/4/2001 - 8/20/2001) These cumulative fire extent
   maps show actively burning area and previously burned area from the
   MODIS Rapid Response system.

   Monthly Active Fire Distributions
   MODIS Land Rapid Response Fire Detections - May 2001

   These maps show the global distribution of fire detections produced by
   the MODIS Rapid Response System. These active fire detections are
   produced using the same algorithm as the standard MODIS MOD14 Fire and
   Thermal Anomalies Product. Each detection represents the center of a 1
   km pixel flagged by the algorithm as containing a fire within that
   pixel. The MODIS Rapid Response System is a collaboration between
   Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to prototype
   rapid access to MODIS products.
