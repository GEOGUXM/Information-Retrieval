   Council on Environmental Quality

   The Council on Environmental Quality coordinates federal environmental
   efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices
   in the development of environmental policies and initiatives. The
   Council's Chair, who is appointed by the President with the advice and
   consent of the Senate, serves as the principal environmental policy
   adviser to the President. In addition, CEQ reports annually to the
   President on the state of the environment; oversees federal agency
   implementation of the environmental impact assessment process; and acts
   as a referee when agencies disagree over the adequacy of such
   assessments.

   Congress established CEQ within the Executive Office of the President
   as part of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).
   Additional responsibilities were provided by the Environmental Quality
   Improvement Act of 1970.

   In enacting NEPA, Congress recognized that nearly all federal
   activities affect the environment in some way and mandated that before
   federal agencies make decisions, they must consider the effects of
   their actions on the quality of the human environment. NEPA assigns CEQ
   the task of ensuring that federal agencies meet their obligations under
   the Act. The challenge of harmonizing our economic, environmental and
   social aspirations has put NEPA at the forefront of our nation's
   efforts to protect the environment.
