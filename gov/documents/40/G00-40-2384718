     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Purpose. This chapter provides instructions and assigns
   responsibility for the conduct of a program of drills for warning
   situations and other emergency conditions. The intent of these drills
   is to assure that all personnel with warning responsibilities are
   prepared to react quickly when required. This chapter is intended to
   supplement, but in no way supersede, instructions in other chapters of
   the Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM).

   2. Delegation of Responsibilities. This section covers organizational
   responsibilities.

   2.1 Regional Headquarters. Regional headquarters in conjunction with
   the meteorologist in charge (MIC), official in charge (OIC), or
   hydrologist in charge (HIC) should determine what hazards are a threat
   and what type of drills should be conducted. Regional headquarters
   should also provide guidance material for drills, require annual
   updating of the Station Duty Manual, and ensure that each MIC, OIC, or
   HIC periodically carries out assigned drills.

   During field office visits, regional headquarters personnel should
   review the Station Duty Manual and evaluate the state of readiness of
   the office.

   2.2 Weather Service Field Offices with Warning Responsibility. MIC's,
   OIC's, and HIC's are responsible for conducting periodic drills and
   maintaining a level of preparedness at their respective office
   commensurate with the risks in their area of responsibility. This
   should include natural and man-made hazards, as well as plotting
   fallout winds.

   In general, drills for specific weather emergencies should be conducted
   just prior to appropriate seasons. All office personnel with warning
   responsibility should be required to participate on an individual or
   office basis. Any deficiencies should be corrected immediately.
   Individual offices should maintain a record of drills performed,
   including date of drill, type, and personnel participating.

   2.2.1 Station Duty Manual. All offices with warning responsibility will
   include their complete warning program and procedures for handling
   emergency messages in a Station Duty Manual. Offices will review these
   plans at least once annually and incorporate necessary changes as they
   occur. (For details on manual, see WSOM Chapter A-13, Station Duty
   Manual.)

   2.2.2 Knowledge of Instructions in Station Duty Manual. All operational
   office personnel should be required to read Part I, Volume I, of the
   Station Duty Manual annually. In addition before the start of a
   particular type of severe weather season, personnel should review
   appropriate sections of the Station Duty Manual and WSOM chapters.

   2.2.3 Reports to Regional Headquarters. Regional headquarters will
   establish the format and reporting procedures for drill reports and due
   dates. At least one report a year will be required for each office. The
   report should include the number, types, and dates of drills conducted.

   3. Emergency Warning Drills. This section discusses the purpose and
   scope of emergency warning drills.

   3.1 Purpose. An emergency warning drill should accomplish the
   following.

           a. Evaluate the employees' knowledge of procedures described in
   pertinent WSOM chapters and the Station Duty Manual.

           b. Uncover deficiencies in the office's warning dissemination
   plan.

   3.2 Scope of Drill. The scope of a drill can vary widely as to detail
   and the types of persons and organizations involved. Drills concerning
   tornadoes, hurricanes, winter storms, flash floods, nuclear accidents,
   tsunamis, and toxic chemical spills are situations which can readily be
   expanded to include other organizations.

   3.2.1 Intraoffice Drill. This type of drill is the easiest to conduct,
   since it does not involve persons outside the office and can be done
   with minimum disruption of office operations. It can be administered to
   office personnel on an individual or office basis. Its primary purpose
   should be to condition personnel to react quickly and effectively to
   severe weather reports or emergency conditions.

   The participants can be presented with one or more descriptions of
   situations requiring issuance of warnings or the taking of other
   emergency actions. Each of these simulated emergencies should be
   accompanied by a set of questions which must be answered, including the
   requirement to write the text of a warning, statement, or other
   issuance as appropriate.

   3.2.2 Community Drill. This type of drill is similar to the intraoffice
   drill, except that it is broadened to include persons, organizations,
   and communities outside of the National Weather Service (NWS).
   Interested news media and public service agencies could be invited to
   participate. As an example, arrangements could be made for an
   interested party in the office's area of responsibility to call in a
   report of a hypothetical "tornado." Progress reports on this "tornado"
   could be furnished by a law enforcement patrol car. Office procedures
   would be the same as in the intraoffice drill, except actual
   dissemination of some of the material prepared could be made to the
   affected areas. The words "TORNADO manual" should be used frequently.
   The effectiveness and timeliness of the information distributed could
   be evaluated by officials in the affected areas who are responsible for
   relaying warnings to the public. In this type of drill, everyone
   concerned should know that the material distributed is for a simulation
   drill.

   4. Availability of Communication Channels. A warning message is
   obviously of no benefit unless it is distributed to the user.
   Therefore, drills should include the use of normal and alternate
   communication channels. This section of the drill will include
   familiarity with the warning dissemination list and its priorities.
   Office personnel must be familiar with the means of alerting storm
   spotters and rainfall and river observers to the threat of severe
   weather and of obtaining storm reports from these observers.

   5. Content of Drill. To ensure effective handling of emergency
   conditions, drills should be formulated to cover a review of
   appropriate WSOM chapters, Station Duty Manual, communication channels,
   and those reports or conditions that in themselves may be indicators of
   actual or potential disaster. Among such items are:

     a. Radar indications of severe weather and flash flooding.

   b. Reports of heavy rainfall, high river stage, or unexpected flooding.

   c. An individual report or a sequence of reports which indicate that
   severe weather is or might be occurring.

   5.1 Tornado, Hurricane, and Winter Storm. A suggested outline of key
   points to develop and stress in a warning drill, in which a tornado,
   hurricane, or winter storm is simulated, is given in Exhibit A-17-1. If
   desired, the drill may be shortened to action items 6 through 9 that
   would be taken if a tornado or other severe weather were reported.

   5.2 Floods and Flash Floods. The format of a flood drill or a flash
   flood watch/warning drill may vary with the size and responsibility of
   the individual field office. In addition to the items suggested in
   section 5, the drill should include the following.

           a. Procedures for evaluating flash flood potential, using
   upstream stage reports (when available) and flash flood guidance. A map
   delineating areas of known or potential flash flooding should be
   included.

           b. Knowledge of key hydrologic forecasts and antecedent and
   predictor data provided by the appropriate River Forecast Center or
   field office with hydrologic service area responsibility. For known
   flood and flash flood sites, a brief tabulation of antecedent and
   synoptic conditions, rainfall amounts, and other pertinent data, such
   as degree of flooding, should be available for quick reference.

   5.3 Aircraft Mishap. An aircraft mishap is an inclusive term used to
   denote the occurrence of an accident or incident or an in-flight
   emergency which could adversely affect the safety of the aircraft.
   Drills should be formulated to cover mishaps that require immediate or
   specific action as given in WSOM Chapter D-90.

   5.3.1 Pre-mishap Planning. Arrangements should be made with Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) offices and civil authorities for prompt
   notification whenever an aircraft mishap occurs.

               OUTLINE OF INTRAOFFICE EMERGENCY WARNING DRILL

   1. Review:
   Severe weather procedures in appropriate WSOM chapters and Station Duty
   Manual.
   2. Emphasize:
   Need for adequate staffing and coordination and consultation between
   offices.
   3. Document:
   Each action in the office Severe Weather Log.
   4. Know:
   Relationship between radar indications and severe weather.
   5. Monitor:
   All guidance material and sources of severe weather information. Be
   alert to an individual report or a sequence of reports which indicate
   severe weather is occurring.
   6. Prepare:
   A warning when any reliable report indicates severe weather is, or is
   likely to be, occurring. Use timely and understandable statements.
   7. Distribute:
   Releases according to priorities via all communication channels.
   8. Follow:
   Progress of storm by radar and surface reports from cooperative
   observers and law enforcement agencies. Ask for appropriate reports.
   9. Summarize:
   Severe weather actions and storm damage.

       Exhibit A-17-1: Outline of Intraoffice Emergency Warning Drill

   5.3.2 Drill Action. Upon notification of an aircraft mishap, the drill
   should cover the steps which must be taken concerning observations,
   operational status of primary observing equipment, safeguarding weather
   records, and preparation of statements and reports.

   5.4 Communication Failure. When communications fail, the primary
   responsibility is to use alternative means to distribute observations
   and severe weather information. Personnel are required to be familiar
   with back-up procedures (Chapter I-03).

   5.5 Man-made Hazards. If appropriate, drills should include actions
   that must be taken by office personnel for toxic chemical and oil
   spills, nuclear accidents, emergency evacuation of the office, and
   other hazards that could occur.

   6. Post-drill Evaluation. The post-drill evaluation is invaluable and
   should always be conducted. It can take place on an individual basis or
   at an office seminar. Discussion after the drill should center on (1)
   ensuring that all personnel know what to do in the type of emergency
   simulated and (2) improving office operations during emergencies.
