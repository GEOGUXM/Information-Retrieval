                     NOTICE TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

    The CPUC encourages all Californians to participate in its meetings,
       hearings, workshops, and proceedings. We try to hold our public
    meetings only in places that are wheelchair accessible and which can
    accommodate specialized equipment and other services useful to people
     with disabilities. Please see the notice of the meeting you wish to
                         attend for more specifics.

       If you plan to attend and need specialized accommodations for a
   particular meeting that are not listed in the notice, request them from
   the Public Advisor's Office at least three business days in advance of
     the meeting. Contact the Public Advisor's Office by any one of the
                                 following:
