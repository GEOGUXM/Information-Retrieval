   New Members Sworn in at Fall Council Meeting Meeting Examines
   Alternative Designs for Historic Pennsylvania Avenue

   Three new members were sworn in at the fall meeting of the Advisory
   Council on Historic Preservation November 15-16, 2001, in Washington,
   DC. Members also toured Pennsylvania Avenue to see firsthand the
   effects of the historic street's closure near the White House, and
   heard recommendations by the National Capital Planning Commission on
   alternative street designs that would be responsive to security needs,
   while reinforcing the historic setting of the Federal city.

   New members sworn in

   Sworn in were John L. Nau, III, of Houston, TX, as Council chairman;
   Bernadette Castro of Albany, NY, as vice chairman; and Bob Young of
   Augusta, GA, as mayor on the Council. Director of Presidential
   Personnel Clay Johnson conducted the ceremony, which was held at the
   Dolly Madison House in Washington, DC.

   The new members, which also include the Council's governor member, Jane
   Dee Hull, of Phoenix, AZ, were named to the Council by President Bush
   in August.

   Council members toured Pennsylvania Avenue to see firsthand the effects
   of the closure of the historic street, which has been closed to regular
   traffic since 1995 due to security concerns for the nearby White House.
   National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) Historic Preservation
   Specialist Nancy Witherell and staff discussed some of the esthetic
   problems with the current appearance of the avenue, which has become a
   jumble of fences and barriers since its closure in response to security
   concerns.

   Members later heard a presentation by NCPC, which described various
   proposals to balance historic preservation and security needs, as well
   as recommendations on the design of security measures throughout the
   Federal city. The Council proposed a task force to examine the issue
   further.

       historic properties
     * Adopting a proposed policy statement on balancing cultural and
       natural values on Federal lands for discussion with Federal land
       managing agencies
     * Reviewing improvement in the scoring process for military

       the impacts of defense mobilization and actions taken to improve
       security at defense installations

       significant tribal resources

       actions taken by the Smithsonian Institution, which has been found
       not to be a Federal agency

   new leadership and the Council members shared views on future
   directions for the Council.
