                                 Description

    MPQC is the Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry program. It computes
   properties of atoms and molecules from first principles using the time
        independent Schrödinger equation. It runs on a wide range of
       architectures ranging from individual workstations to symmetric
    multiprocessors to massively parallel computers. Its design is object
                oriented, using the C++ programming language.

                For more information see the MPQC Home Page.
