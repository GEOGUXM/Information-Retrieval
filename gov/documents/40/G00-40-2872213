   State and Federal programs.
   Proposed Acid Mine Drainage Projects
   (420K jpg)

   Proposed projects are being developed thanks to funding from the OSM
   Clean Streams Initiative, Cooperative Agreement Program, and Indiana
   AML Fund.  These projects are winding their way through the process,
   with construction scheduled to begin in the spring of 2001.
   Non-Acid Mine Drainage Projects
   (165K pdf)

   Non AMD projects are only possible because of the presence of the
   PSFWSC. While the primary purpose of the PSFWSC is AMD, collateral
   holistic projects add an additional dimension to improving the
   watershed.
   Acid Mine Drainage Projects outside the Watershed
   (61K pdf) While these projects are outside the immediate limits of the
   watershed, the Patoka South Fork Watershed Steering Committee (PSFWSC)
   has undertaken these projects to deal with some very serious acid mine
   drainage problems.
