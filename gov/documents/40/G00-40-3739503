Kava Linked to Liver Toxicity
                                  __________________________________________________________________


 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating whether
the use of dietary supplements containing kava (also known as kava kava
or Piper methysticum) pose a health risk. Recent reports from European
 health authorities have linked kava use to at least 25 cases of liver
 toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The FDA
has issued a letter to health professionals requesting that they report
     any adverse events associated with the use of kava products.

Kava, a member of the pepper family, is an herbal supplement. Products
 containing kava are sold in the United States for a variety of uses,
  including insomnia and short-term reduction of stress and anxiety.
 These products are marketed to men, women, children, and the elderly.

  Advice to Consumers
  Safety is a concern for users of kava. People, especially those with
  a history of liver problems, should talk with their health care
  practitioner about avoiding kava until safety questions are
  answered.

NCCAM is supporting two research studies of kava. These studies are on
             hold, pending further guidance from the FDA.
