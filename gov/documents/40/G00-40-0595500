   [thCammie.jpg] Bivouacs
   Squadron 47 bivouacs are usually overnight (2 or 3 days) field training
   exercises where cadets learn navigation and survival techniques in a
   variety of environments (mountains, desert, beach). Activities include
   map and compass reading, shelter building, food and water procurement,
   fire building and emergency signaling.  There are also nighttime
   capture the flag "War Games".
   [thMcClureJacobs.jpg] Orientation Flights
   O-Flights provide the cadets with the chance to go flying in a variety
   of small aircraft flown by experienced Squadron 47 pilots.  Once the
   aircraft is airborne, the cadets can actually take the controls and fly
   the plane for a while.
   [thF117Cockpit.jpg] Tours
   CAP cadets are often allowed to tour military installations, ships and
   aircraft, and can usually go places and see things that are not
   available to the public -  like the cockpit of the F-117 Stealth
   Fighter and the Combat Control Center of a nuclear powered aircraft
   carrier.
   [thSalutes.jpg] Cadet Activities
   There are many activities that cadets can attend to learn the
   leadership skills and the military customs and courtesies that are
   needed to advance and promote in the Civil Air Patrol.  Most of these
   training activities are held locally over a weekend, but there are also
   week long National Activities that cadets can attend.
   [thGroupPlane.jpg] Senior Member Activities
   Squadron 47 has a very active group of Senior Members who attend and
   participate in many of the cadet activities, as well as participating
   in their own activities including bivouacs and O-Flights.
