     The earth observing instrument on Landsat 7, the Enhanced Thematic
   Mapper Plus (ETM+), replicates the capabilities of the highly
   successful Thematic Mapper instruments on Landsats 4 and 5*. The ETM+
   also includes new features that make it a more versatile and efficient
   instrument for global change studies, land cover monitoring and
   assessment, and large area mapping than its design forebears. The
   primary new features on Landsat 7 are:

     a panchromatic band with 15m spatial resolution

     on board, full aperture, 5% absolute radiometric calibration

     a thermal IR channel with 60m spatial resolution

                             MISSION OBJECTIVE:

   [bull.gif]

   To maintain data continuity by providing data that are consistent in
   terms of data acquisition, geometry, spatial resolution, calibration,
   coverage characteristics, and spectral characteristics with previous
   Landsat data.
   [bull.gif]

   To generate and periodically refresh a global archive of substantially
   cloud-free sun-lit land-mass imagery.
   [bull.gif]

   To continue to make Landsat-type data available to U.S. and
   international users at the cost of fulfilling users requests, and
   expand the use of such data for global change and commercial purposes.
