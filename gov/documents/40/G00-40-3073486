   FIRE D. Meade Presented to PPPL Reseach Council July 20, 2001 FIRE
   Lighting the Way to Fusion Fusion Science Objectives for a Major Next
   Step Magnetic Fusion Science Experiment Explore and understand the
   strong non-linear coupling that is fundamental to fusion-dominated
   plasma behavior (self-organization) * Energy and particle transport
   (extend confinement predictability) * Macroscopic stability ( -limit,
   wall stabilization, NTMs) * Wave-particle interactions (fast alpha
   particle driven effects) * Plasma boundary (density limit, power and
   particle flow) * Test/Develop techniques to control and optimize
   fusion-dominated plasmas. * Sustain fusion-dominated plasmas -
   high-power-density exhaust of plasma particles and energy, alpha ash
   exhaust, study effects of profile evolution due to alpha heating on
   macro stability, transport barriers and energetic particle modes. *
   Explore and understand various advanced operating modes and
   configurations in fusion-dominated plasmas to provide generic knowledge
   for fusion and non-fusion plasma science, and to provide a foundation
   for attractive fusion applications. Stepping Stones for Resolving the
   Critical Fusion Plasma Science Issues for an Attractive MFE Reactor

   Next Step Potential for Future Growth 1. Could the TFTR site ever be
   used for tritium again? We need to determine this very soon. 2. Defense
   Program sites may be special opportunities. Summary * Most issues are
   being resolved, others are soluble and will take time and resources. *
   The design point is in about the right place wrt to feasibility and BP
   mission. The AT mission and capability is very promising but need
   additional work. * The cost needs to be thoroughly reviewed and
   scrubbed. The tokamak is $375M, with a total cost $1.2B. Need to begin
   assessing possible sites. * Need a physics R&D List/Plan. - Many
   generic or ITER specific items are being worked. - Need work on FIRE
   specific items; e.g., - double null effects on confinement, stability,
   power handling, - all metal PFCs, W divertor targets, Be first wall
   optimized confinement at n~ 0.7 nGW  AT mode development qmin 2.2, q95
   ~ 3.7 * Need to begin work on Engineering R&D items. * Community
   interest is increasing, need stronger community involvement and
   organization of this effort will need resources to carry this forward.
