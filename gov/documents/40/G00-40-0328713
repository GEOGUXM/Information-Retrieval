   How to use the Organigram
     * You are at the MODIS Atmosphere Discipline Group Web Site Web site
       (represented by the box highlighted in yellow)
     * Although some hierarchy is indicated, the main focus of the
       organigram is topical: programatic sites are in the upper-right,
       data sources are in the upper left with data production sites
       below, the main MODIS site is represented by the MODIS globe in the
       middle with the two satellite sites above, and science sites and
       their related validation, quality assurance (QA), science computing
       facilities (SCF's) and product/Principal Investigator (PI) sites
       are around the perimeter in the lower half of the image.
     * For similar content, select a blue area (connected by a black line)
       near your present location - Bright blue areas tend to have more
       comprehensive information or more of an overview of MODIS and
       darker blue areas tend to have more general information or
       information about a particular aspect of MODIS.
     * Click on a blue area to go to another site or select the yellow
       area to return to MODIS Atmosphere Discipline Group Web Site Web
       site - your present site.
     * To return to this map, look for the MODIS Web Organigram minature
       at core sites (except for programmatic sites).
