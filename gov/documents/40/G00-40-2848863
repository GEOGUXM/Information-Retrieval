                             Light Weight Optics

     The Next Generation Space Telescope will be constructed using
   advanced optical technology that produces extremely light weight
   mirrors. Such mirrors are required for this and future telescopes.
   Mirrors must become larger to collect light from fainter, more distant
   objects. Since the cost of launching satellites is a strong function of
   their weight lighter mirrors mean smaller launch costs. Currently,
   there are several mirror studies being conducted by NASA and industry
   partners.
   The mirror materials being investigated include: (click on the image to
