   [QCpic.jpg] Quality assurance and quality control practices encompass
   all aspects of the Surface Environmental Surveillance Project.
   Comprehensive quality assurance programs, which include various quality
   control practices and methods to verify data, are maintained to ensure
   data quality. The programs are implemented through quality assurance
   plans designed to meet requirements of the American National Standards
   Institute / American Society of Mechanical Engineers and DOE Orders.
   Quality assurance plans are maintained for all activities, and auditors
   verify conformance.

   Quality control methods include, but are not limited to, replicate
   sampling and analysis, analysis of field blanks and blind reference
   standards, participation in interlaboratory crosscheck studies, and
   splitting samples with other laboratories. Sample collection and
   laboratory analyses are conducted using documented and approved
   procedures. When sample results are received, they are screened for
   anomalous values by comparing them to recent results and historical
   data.

   More detailed information on the quality assurance and quality control
   practices of the Surface Environmental Surveillance Project is
   available in the Hanford Site 2000 Environmental Report, Section 9.0.
