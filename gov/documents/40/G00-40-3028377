       What is anthrax?
       Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming
       bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs in wild and
       domestic lower vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes,
       and other herbivores), but it can also occur in humans when they are
       exposed to infected animals or tissue from infected animals.

       Why has anthrax become a current issue?

       Because anthrax is considered to be a potential agent for use in
       biological warfare, the Department of Defense (DoD) has begun mandatory
       vaccination of all active duty military personnel who might be involved
       in conflict.

       How common is anthrax and who can get it?
       Anthrax is most common in agricultural regions where it occurs in
       animals. These include South and Central America, Southern and Eastern
       Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. When anthrax
       affects humans, it is usually due to an occupational exposure to
       infected animals or their products. Workers who are exposed to dead
       animals and animal products from other countries where anthrax is more
       common may become infected with B. anthracis (industrial anthrax).
       Anthrax in wild livestock has occurred in the United States.

       How is anthrax transmitted?
       Anthrax infection can occur in three forms: cutaneous (skin),
       inhalation, and gastrointestinal. B. anthracis spores can live in the
       soil for many years, and humans can become infected with anthrax by
       handling products from infected animals or by inhaling anthrax spores
       from contaminated animal products. Anthrax can also be spread by eating
       undercooked meat from infected animals. It is rare to find infected
       animals in the United States.

                                                graphic to jump to top of page

       What are the symptoms of anthrax?
       Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease was contracted,
       but symptoms usually occur within 7 days.

       Cutaneous: Most (about 95%) anthrax infections occur when the bacterium
       enters a cut or abrasion on the skin, such as when handling
       contaminated wool, hides, leather or hair products (especially goat
       hair) of infected animals. Skin infection begins as a raised itchy bump
       that resembles an insect bite but within 1-2 days develops into a
       vesicle and then a painless ulcer, usually 1-3 cm in diameter, with a
       characteristic black necrotic (dying) area in the center. Lymph glands
       in the adjacent area may swell. About 20% of untreated cases of
       cutaneous anthrax will result in death. Deaths are rare with
       appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

       Inhalation: Initial symptoms may resemble a common cold. After several
       days, the symptoms may progress to severe breathing problems and shock.
       Inhalation anthrax is usually fatal.

       Intestinal: The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the
       consumption of contaminated meat and is characterized by an acute
       inflammation of the intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of
       appetite, vomiting, fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of
       blood, and severe diarrhea. Intestinal anthrax results in death in 25%
       to 60% of cases.

       Where is anthrax usually found?
       Anthrax can be found globally. It is more common in developing
       countries or countries without veterinary public health programs.
       Certain regions of the world (South and Central America, Southern and
       Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East)
       report more anthrax in animals than others.
       Can anthrax be spread from person-to-person?
       Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely to
       occur. Communicability is not a concern in managing or visiting with
       patients with inhalational anthrax.

       Is there a way to prevent infection?

       In countries where anthrax is common and vaccination levels of animal
       herds are low, humans should avoid contact with livestock and animal
       products and avoid eating meat that has not been properly slaughtered
       and cooked. Also, an anthrax vaccine has been licensed for use in
       humans. The vaccine is reported to be 93% effective in protecting
       against anthrax.

       What is the anthrax vaccine?

       The anthrax vaccine is manufactured and distributed by BioPort,
       Corporation, Lansing, Michigan. The vaccine is a cell-free filtrate
       vaccine, which means it contains no dead or live bacteria in the
       preparation. The final product contains no more than 2.4 mg of aluminum
       hydroxide as adjuvant. Anthrax vaccines intended for animals should not
       be used in humans.

       Who should get vaccinated against anthrax?

       The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommend anthrax
       vaccination for the following groups:
         * Persons who work directly with the organism in the laboratory
         * Persons who work with imported animal hides or furs in areas where
           standards are insufficient to prevent exposure to anthrax spores.
         * Persons who handle potentially infected animal products in
           high-incidence areas. (Incidence is low in the United States, but
           veterinarians who travel to work in other countries where incidence
           is higher should consider being vaccinated.)
         * Military personnel deployed to areas with high risk for exposure to
           the organism (as when it is used as a biological warfare weapon).

         The anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program in the U.S. Army Surgeon
         General's Office can be reached at 1-877-GETVACC (1-877-438-8222).

         Pregnant women should be vaccinated only if absolutely necessary.

                                                graphic to jump to top of page

       What is the protocol for anthrax vaccination?

       The immunization consists of three subcutaneous injections given 2
       weeks apart followed by three additional subcutaneous injections given
       at 6, 12, and 18 months. Annual booster injections of the vaccine are
       recommended thereafter.

       Are there adverse reactions to the anthrax vaccine?

       Mild local reactions occur in 30% of recipients and consist of slight
       tenderness and redness at the injection site. Severe local reactions
       are infrequent and consist of extensive swelling of the forearm in
       addition to the local reaction. Systemic reactions occur in fewer than
       0.2% of recipients.

       How is anthrax diagnosed?
       Anthrax is diagnosed by isolating B. anthracis from the blood, skin
       lesions, or respiratory secretions or by measuring specific antibodies
       in the blood of persons with suspected cases.
       Is there a treatment for anthrax?
       Doctors can prescribe effective antibiotics. To be effective, treatment
       should be initiated early. If left untreated, the disease can be fatal.

       Where can I get more information about the recent Department of Defense
       decision to require men and women in
       the Armed Services to be vaccinated against anthrax?
       The Department of Defense recommends that servicemen and women contact
       their chain of command on questions about the vaccine and its
       distribution. The anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program in the U.S. Army
       Surgeon General's Office can be reached at 1-877-GETVACC
       (1-877-438-8222). http://www.anthrax.osd.mil
