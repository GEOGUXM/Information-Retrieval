   Ex-Im Bank`s Letter of Interest (LI) is a pre-export tool that helps
   you obtain financing. The LI is an indication of Ex-Im Bank`s
   willingness to consider financing for a given export transaction and
   locks in the exposure fee for six months.

   The online application offers the opportunity to fill out an
   easy-to-follow application process and make payment by credit card. All
   applications and credit card payments are handled on Ex-Im Bank`s
   secure web server. You can edit and save an application under a persons
   password and login ID.

   Start with Registration
   (no fee or commitment, just basic information such as: name, address,
   phone, etc.).

   After you have registered, you can come and go as needed by using the
   Login
   feature.

   If you are already registered, simply Login using your login name and
   personal ID (which you create during registration). This lets you cross
   over to our secure server. From here you can apply for an LI, save and
   edit your work to complete at a later date, or submit a completely
   filled out application with your credit card payment.

   To make changes to an account, click on Update Existing Account.

   If you forget your password, e-mail the WebAdminstrator.

   Click on the LI Application Page
   to get detailed information on the Letter of Interest Process and the
   application forms in HTML, WPD and PDF formats.

   Online application is fast, easy, convenient and secure.
