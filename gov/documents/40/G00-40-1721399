  Introduction

   WebServer-SG is a prototype package to provide a turn-key solution to
   the relatively painful experience of installing and deploying a secure
   Apache web server and the Tomcat servlet container. WebServer-SG v1.1
   is bundled with the following packages:
     * mm-1.1.3
     * openssl-0.9.6b
     * apache_1.3.20
     * mod_dav-1.0.2-1.3.6
     * mod_ssl-2.8.4-1.3.20

   In addition both ant v1.3 and Tomcat version 3.2.3 is included and uses
   the mod_jk connector to talk to Apache.

  Download

   The build script is simple Bourne shell and has been tested under Linux
   and Solaris.

  Installation

   Create a user under which you wish to run the web server. Generally
   this is a user with minimal privileges e.g user or group nobody.

   Now run the install script as root:

%>./install.sh

   After compiling and installing the necessary programs, you will be
   asked a couple questions about server configuration before the script
   processes the configuration files and prints out post installation
   instructions on obtaining a certificate and other issues.
