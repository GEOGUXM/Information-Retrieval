   This presentation is about the planning tools of the next century. New
   Urbanism and Smart Growth concepts have been widely embraced for
   redevelopment and new growth areas. Yet the problems faced by the
   proponents of these approaches are many. They include community
   opposition to density and the mixing of uses, outdated regulatory
   practices, and difficulties related to financing. As the tools you see
   in this presentation move from the testing phase to everyday use, these
   barriers to building better communities will diminish.
