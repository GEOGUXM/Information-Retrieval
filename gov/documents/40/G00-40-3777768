   How do I register for an auction and how much does it cost?

      Licensed drivers must register at the auction facility on the day of
      inspection or auction in order to obtain a bidders number. There is no
      cost to attend or register, but participants must be a minimum of 18
      year of age.


   Can I purchase a vehicle for someone else?

      Yes. To purchase a vehicle for another you must furnish the Social
      Security Number or the Tax Identification Number of the individual or
      company for whom the vehicle is to be licensed. Also, the bidder must
      have a letter granting power of attorney from the buyer to purchase
      Federal Surplus Property on their behalf.


   Can I test drive a vehicle before bidding?

      During inspection you can start a vehicle to check engine performance,
      A/C, heater, and other accessories to see if they are functional. But,
      the transmission must remain in the park position.


   How are auction vehicles maintained?

      GSA Fleet vehicles are maintained in compliance with manufacturer's
      requirements by service professionals. Since GSA does not maintain
      other Federal Agency vehicles we cannot verify the level of maintenance
      on their vehicles.


   Does the Government warranty their vehicles?
      No, GSA warrants that the vehicle will conform to its description in
      the auction catalog. Condition is not guaranteed. Some vehicles may
      still be covered under the manufacturer's warranties that could be
      transferable to the purchaser. Contact the vehicle manufacturer for any
      warranty eligibility


   How does GSA determine who is awarded the vehicle?

      Each vehicle is sold to the highest qualified bidder. However, the
      Government has the right to reject any bid.



   Can I refuse a vehicle after my bid was accepted?

      No, once a bid is accepted as the successful bid, the bidder is under
      contract to pay for and remove the vehicle(s) from the facility within
      the time period specified in the Invitation for Bid. Should the
      purchaser fail to pay for or remove the vehicle(s) within the
      prescribed period of time, the government at its election and upon
      notice of default shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as
      liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20% of the total
      purchase price of the items(s) as to which the default has occurred or
      (b) $200.00 or the purchase price of such items(s), whichever is
      higher.


   Are there any hidden charges?

      Your successful bid amount is what you pay. There are no buyerÂ’s fees
      added. However, some states require that applicable taxes be paid at
      the time of sale.  It is the bidder's responsibility to ascertain and
      comply with the Federal, State, local, and multi-jurisdictional laws.


   Does GSA sell seized vehicles?

      No. Seized vehicles are usually sold by the U.S. Marshals Service.
      Their web site is located at:
      http://www.usdoj.gov/marshals.


   Where can I purchase a military vehicle?

      Military surplus can be found on the Defense Reutilization and
      Marketing Service web page
