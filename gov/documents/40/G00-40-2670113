  Tips on How to Perform Searches

                                Types of Queries
         The Marshall Islands Collection Search page allows you to find
        documents via a field query, full-text query, or some combination
     thereof. A fielded query searches the collection's metadata for matches
     whereas a full-text query searches the documents' content. To find the
     documents you're interested in, you can fill in as few as one field on
     the search page or as many as four. Keep in mind that, in general, the
     more search criteria you specify, the more relevant your search results
                                    will be.

                                 Using Operators
      You can use operators and modifiers to apply logic to your query and
       pinpoint the exact information you are interested in. The operator
     defines the relationship among the search criteria you've specified and
     thus affects the results that are returned. You can change your search
                        results by changing the operators

       The Concept Operators,"AND," "NOT," "OR," and "ACCRUE," are used to
               connect fielded as well as full-text search terms.


  AND    Using AND (the default) as the operator returns documents that
         contain all search terms specified.
  NOT    Returns documents that do not contain the term that follows the NOT
         operator.
  OR     Returns documents that match at least one of the criteria specified.
  ACCRUE Essentially the same as using OR, except that the returned
         results will be ranked according to relevancy.  That is, documents with
         a higher score contain more of the search criteria than do documents
         with a lower score.

  Fielded Query versus Full-Text Query
    To connect fielded terms, select one of the four operators (AND, OR,
   NOT, or ACCRUE) from the drop down list.    (Remember that the operator
     applies to the term entered in the field that follows the selected
       operator.)  To connect terms entered in the full-text (document
      content) field, type in the operator between each word or phrase
   entered. Because these operators are interpreted as query language, you
             need not surround the operator with angle brackets.

                  Operators Specific to Full Text Searching
       You may find documents by searching the content of each of the
    documents in the collection (known as a "full-text" search). You can
    expand a full-text search by using Evidence Operators or specify the
       relative location of search terms by using Proximity Operators.

                             Evidence Operators
   Evidence operators must be enclosed in angle brackets and placed before
                              the search term.

   &ltStem> By default a full-text search returns documents that contain
   one or more variations of the search term specified
   &ltWord> Returns documents that contain the exact search term
   specified. Enclosing the search term in double quotation marks is
   equivalent to using the &ltWord> operator. Use double quotes when you
   want to search for a phrase containing a word normally used as an
   operator; for example, bread "and" butter will return only those
   documents containing the phrase "bread and butter."
   &ltThesaurus> Returns documents that contain the search term specified
   as well as documents that contain one or more synonyms of the that term
   &ltWildcard> Returns documents that contain matches to a search string
   containing one or more variables such as * (any character) or ? (a
   single character)
   &ltSoundex> Returns documents that contain one or more words that sound
   like, or whose letter pattern is similar to, the word specified

   Proximity Operators
   Proximity operators are used to specify the relative location of words
   in a document. To perform such a search, you need to use angle brackets
   around your operator and place it between two search terms.

   &ltNear> Returns a list of documents where the word following the
   &ltNear> operator is in close proximity to the word preceding the
   operator. The results items are ranked according to the relative number
   of words between search terms; the closer the search terms, the higher
   the score. To find documents where the specified search terms occur
   within a specific number of words of eachother, use &ltNear/n>, where n
   is an integer representing the maximum number of words appearing
   between the two search terms.
   &ltSentence> Returns a list of all documents where the words specified
   are contained in the same sentence
   &ltParagraph> Returns a list of all documents where the words specified
   are contained in the same paragraph

   Interpreting Results
   After you've filled in the fields as desired, click the Search button.
   A new screen will appear, listing your results.    The number of
   documents matching your criteria is shown at the top of the page,
   followed by the actual list of matching documents. Each document listed
   provides the document name, author, title, and number of pages, and is
   assigned a score, which is based on the number of matches the document
   contains and the density of those matches.
     82 of 1281 documents matched query (82 shown)

   Opening/Saving a File
   To view a document, you must have either Adobe Acrobat Exchange or
   Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your desktop. To open a file listed
   in the results, click on its link (underlined and in blue). The web
   browser will launch an Acrobat reader (if installed on your local
   computer), which allows you to look at, navigate through, and print the
   document. If you wish to edit or annotate the document, you must save
   it to your hard drive or another destination.    Because the file is in
   pdf format, you must have Acrobat Exchange installed on your computer
   in order to annotate the document or do hit-to-hit searching
   (sequentially find highlighted occurrences of terms entered in the
   full-text field. Note: In the near future, you will be able to do
   hit-to-hit searching from within your browser.
