About the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics
   _____________________________________________________________________

   In 1986, the National Institute on Aging, in cooperation with the
   National Center for Health Statistics and the Census Bureau,
   established the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics
   to foster collaboration among Federal agencies that produce or use
   statistical data on the older population. Over a period of several
   years, the Forum played a key role in improving aging-related data by
   encouraging cooperation and data sharing among different agencies,
   furthering professional collaboration across different fields, and
   compiling aging-related statistical data in a centralized location. The
   meetings of the Forum helped promote a number of important
   developments, including the establishment of the Health and Retirement
   Study and the Study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old;
   the comparison of disability measures across national surveys;1 the
   acceptance of more standardized age categories; and the collection and
   presentation of statistics on more narrowly defined age and race
   categories.

   In response to changes in the Federal statistical system, the Forum was
   reorganized in 1998. As part of this reorganization, the Administration
   on Aging, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Health Care Financing
   Administration, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and
   Evaluation (Department of Health and Human Services), Office of
   Management and Budget, and Social Security Administration were invited
   to become organizing members of the Forum.

   The inaugural meeting of the “new” Forum was held in March 1999. At
   this meeting, the organizing members agreed that the Forum should focus
   its efforts on developing an indicators chartbook, exploring
   opportunities to integrate data for research applications, and
   initiating projects to improve measurement methods and data quality.

Mission of the Forum

   The Forum’s mission is to encourage cooperation and collaboration among
   Federal agencies to improve the quality and utility of data on the
   aging population. To accomplish this mission, the Forum provides
   agencies with a venue to discuss data issues and concerns that cut
   across agency boundaries, facilitates the development of new databases,
   improves mechanisms currently used to disseminate information on
   aging-related data, invites researchers to report on cutting-edge
   analyses of data, and encourages international collaboration.

   The specific goals of the Forum are to improve both the quality and use
   of data on the aging population by:
     * widening access to information on the aging population through
       periodic publications and other means;
     * promoting communication among data producers, researchers, and
       public policymakers;
     * coordinating the development and use of statistical databases among
       Federal agencies;
     * identifying information gaps and data inconsistencies;
     * investigating questions of data quality;
     * encouraging cross-national research and data collection on the
       aging population; and
     * addressing concerns regarding collection, access, and dissemination
       of data.

Financial Support of the Forum

   The work of the Forum is currently funded by the Office of Demography
   of Aging, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health.
   Valuable staff support is provided by all members of the Forum.
