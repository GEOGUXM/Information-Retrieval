   SUBJECT:     Transmittal Memorandum for Operations Manual Issuance 91-7

   1. Material Transmitted: WSOM Chapter D-22, In-flight Aviation Weather
   Advisories.

   2. Summary:

   The entire chapter is being reissued. The following are major changes:

       a.     AIRMETs will be scheduled products issued every 6 hours with
   amendments issued as necessary. They will have fixed alphanumeric
   designators of Zulu for icing and freezing level, Tango for turbulence,
   strong surface winds, and low level wind shear, and Sierra for
   Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and mountain obscuration.

       b.     IFR meteorological conditions shall now be described solely
   in the AIRMET bulletins and will no longer be redundantly described in
   the Area Forecast (FA).

       c.     The alphanumeric designators for nonconvective SIGMETs have
   been changed and will now include only N through Y excluding the AIRMET
   designators, S and T.

       d.     Nonconvective SIGMETs shall be issued for volcanic eruptions
   and when, in the forecasters' judgment, a hazard to aircraft operations
   due to volcanic ash is known to exist. The eruption issuance is
   mandatory regardless of the visibility within any ash and/or steam
   cloud and regardless of the areal coverage of the cloud. In addition,
   SIGMETs for volcanic ash should be updated when any information becomes
   available which will increase the effectiveness of the advisory.

       e.     Nonconvective SIGMETs may now expire without cancellation
   when conditions end within 30 minutes of the forecast ending time of
   the phenomenon or of the SIGMETs expiration time and those conditions
   are not expected to continue

       f.     The location of conditions requiring the issuance of SIGMETs
   and AIRMETs shall continue to be coordinated as if no FA region
   boundaries exist and then may be recoordinated within the affected FA
   region boundaries using a minimum number of LOCs. When this method of
   issuance is used, instructions allow the in-flight advisory areas to
   overlap FA region boundaries where necessary to simplify area outlines.

       g.     When a special Convective SIGMET is issued after the
   scheduled Convective SIGMETs have been issued on the hour, the special
   shall be added to the previous hour's bulletin and transmitted.

       h.     Instructions for backup operations during an outage at the
   National Severe Storms Forecast Center have been incorporated. These
   affect both the FA and the In-flight Advisory Programs.

   3.    Effect on Other Instructions:

   This chapter supersedes:

   WSOM Chapter D-22, Issuance 82-19, dated November 2, 1982; Issuance
   83-4, dated March 30, 1983; OML 2-83, dated January 20, 1983; OML 4-86,
   dated April 7, 1986; and ROML A-02-85 dated March 1, 1985.

   This chapter will be effective 0735Z May 30, 1991.

   1.     Purpose. This chapter addresses the National Weather Service
   (NWS) policies and procedures regarding in-flight aviation weather
   advisories for domestic airspace (i.e., contiguous United States,
   Alaska, and Hawaii). The In-flight Aviation Weather Advisory program
   provides information for pilots of en route aircraft concerning weather
   phenomena of sufficient extent and/or intensity as to be potentially
   hazardous to aircraft operations. It is intended to serve the needs of
   both civilian and military aviation as a "common system" aviation
   weather safety program. The instructions of this chapter do not apply
   to the issuance of International In-flight Aviation Weather Advisories
   (see WSOM Chapter D-38). Center Weather Advisories (CWA) are
   short-range regional In-flight Advisories provided by Center Weather
   Service Units (CWSU). These CWAs are issued in accordance with policies
   and procedures detailed in WSOM Chapter D-25.

   2.     Types of Advisories. The Federal Aviation Regulations make
   various distinctions between aviation operating equipment and
   personnel. Some weather phenomena or intensities have an impact on all
   aviation operations. The NWS recognizes that some weather phenomena or
   intensities have greater impact or present a greater hazard to some
   classes or types of aircraft than others. The NWS also recognizes that
   certain types of operators, and operations by pilots without certain
   ratings or certifications, are significantly more impacted by the
   occurrence or forecast occurrence of certain weather phenomena.

   The In-flight Aviation Weather Advisory program has addressed these
   diverse requirements for information by the issuance of two types of
   products, Significant Meteorological (SIGMET) Advisories, and Airman's
   Meteorological (AIRMET) Advisories. However, in the past few years the
   mixing of aircraft vulnerabilities to certain phenomena, changes in
   operating altitudes (small planes higher and larger planes lower),
   interest in conditions affecting passenger comfort as well as safety,
   and expanding pilot and dispatcher requirements for information have
   made this approach less effective.

   The distinctions between the weather advisory needs of operators of
   large versus small aircraft or operating aircraft under visual flight
   rules (VFR) versus instrument flight rules (IFR) are no longer clear.
   What is increasingly clear is that operators of large aircraft need to
   receive information pertinent to their operational concerns and that
   the information intended particularly for operators of small aircraft
   must receive the widest possible dissemination.

   The In-flight Aviation Weather Advisory program has been updated to
   address these problems and to deal more effectively with the
   overlapping requirements of different users. In addition, modifications
   are made to emphasize the distinction between what is meant by
   forecasts of phenomenon intensities and how encounters with such
   conditions may be reported by aircrews.

   AIRMETs are advisories of significant weather conditions but describe
   conditions at lower intensities than those that require SIGMETs. The
   AIRMET portion of the program has been extensively revised to provide
   continuous scheduled issuances and to emphasize that AIRMETs are as
   important to aviation safety as nonconvective SIGMETs. Both are
   intended for dissemination to all pilots in the preflight and the en
   route phases of flight to enhance safety. Both are intended for use by
   pilots and aircraft operators as appropriate to their operating
   environment and individual requirements.

   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) communications system headers
   (location identifiers and product-type designators) are used for the
   examples in this chapter. For the World Meteorological Organization
   (WMO) and the NWS's Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS)
   communications systems headers, see section 10.

   2.1     SIGMET. A SIGMET contains information on specified weather
   phenomena of an intensity and/or extent that concerns pilots and
   operators of all aircraft. When weather conditions meeting or exceeding
   a criterion for SIGMET issuance occur or are expected to occur within 2
   hours, a SIGMET shall be issued regardless of whether the conditions
   are described in the Area Forecast(s) (FA) covering the SIGMET area.

   In the conterminous United States, SIGMETs have been separated into two
   classes, convective and nonconvective.

   2.1.1     Convective SIGMET (WST) in the Conterminous United States.
   WSTs concern only thunderstorms and related phenomena (tornadoes, heavy
   precipitation, hail, and high surface winds) over the conterminous
   United States and imply the associated occurrence of turbulence, icing,
   and convective low level wind shear (LLWS). They are issued hourly and
   are valid for up to 2 hours. Each hourly issuance supersedes and
   cancels the remainder of the previous issuance. Appended to each WST
   bulletin is an Outlook valid for the period from 2 to 6 hours after the
   issuance time of the SIGMET.

   2.1.2     Nonconvective SIGMET (WS1 in the Conterminous United States.
   WSs are valid for up to 4 hours over the conterminous United States and
   concern turbulence, icing, dust, sand, volcanic eruptions, or volcanic
   ash when of sufficient intensity and areal extent.

   2.1.3     SIGMETs in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. SIGMETs in
   Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are issued in international formats, in
   accordance with WSOM Chapter D-38, for both convective and
   nonconvective weather phenomena and are normally valid for up to 4
   hours.

   2.2     AIRMET. AIRMETs (WA) may be of significance to any pilot or
   aircraft operator and are issued for all domestic airspace. Scheduled
   AIRMET issuances and amendments describe phenomena the same as, or
   similar to, those requiring the issuance of nonconvective SIGMETs but
   at lower thresholds. They are of particular concern to operators and
   pilots of aircraft sensitive to the phenomena described and to pilots
   without instrument ratings.

   WAs are issued every 6 hours, with the first valid period beginning at
   0200 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC or Z in aviation products), valid
   for 6 hours, and describe turbulence, icing, sustained surface winds
   greater than 30 knots, ceilings below 1,000 feet and/or surface
   visibilities below 3 statute miles, and mountain obscuration when of
   sufficient values or intensity and/or areal extent. Amendments are
   issued as necessary to describe the conditions not originally forecast
   or the cessation of conditions meeting AIRMET criteria.

   3.     Responsibility for Issuance. Responsibility for issuance of
   In-flight Aviation Weather Advisories for conditions over domestic
   airspace is assigned to several NWS facilities. The National Aviation
   Weather Advisory Unit (NAWAU) in Kansas City, Missouri, has the
   responsibility for issuing WAs, WSTs, and WSs for the conterminous
   United States. The Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO) at
   Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau, Alaska, are responsible for issuing
   International SIGMETs and WAs for designated Flight Information Regions
   (FIR) in and around Alaska. The WSFO in Honolulu, Hawaii, issues WAs
   and International SIGMETs for the Hawaiian domestic airspace (see WSOM
   Chapter D-20) and International SIGMETs for the Hawaiian portion of the
   Oakland Oceanic FIR.

   The specific domestic airspace areas of responsibility for the various
   issuing facilities are the same as those described in WSOM chapter
   D-20.

   The designated forecaster(s) at each facility shall maintain a watch on
   weather developments making use of weather radar, surface observations,
   pilot reports, and satellite image information. Forecasters should also
   use available guidance material received from the National
   Meteorological Center (NMC), products issued by the NMC's National
   Severe Storms Forecast Center, hurricane advisories issued by the
   National and Central Pacific Hurricane Centers, forecasts from WSFOs,
   forecasts and information from the CWSUs, and any other pertinent
   information as appropriate, in formulating their advisories.

   4. Standardizations. The following standards shall apply to all
   In-flight Advisories.

       a.     All heights or altitudes shall be stated with reference to
   "mean sea level" (MSL), except in the case of low ceilings which shall
   be referenced to "above ground level" (AGL) and indicated by "CIGS,"
   e.a., CIGS BLO 10.

       b.     Domestic In-flight Advisories shall describe designated
   weather conditions up to and including 45,000 feet (150 millibars).

       c.     Any abbreviations or contractions used in the advisories
   shall conform with FAA Contractions Handbook 7340.1 except as noted in
   section d below.

       d.     Weather and obstructions to visibility shall be indicated by
   using the weather abbreviations used for surface airways observations
   (see Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1, Surface Observations).
   Exceptions are detailed in section 8.2 of this chapter.

   5.     Convective SIGMETs. WSTs are bulletins (collections of one or
   more products) issued hourly for thunderstorms and related phenomena.
   Since it is assumed that thunderstorms described in a WST are likely to
   be accompanied by severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and
   low-level wind shear, these conditions shall not be specified in the
   advisory. The word "none" shall be sent as the text of each hourly WST
   when the forecaster determines that there is no need for a WST in the
   designated region (see section 5.3.6).

   WSTs shall be issued when either of the following occurs and/or is
   forecast to occur for more than 30 minutes of the valid period
   regardless of the size of the area affected (i.e., including isolated):

       -severe thunderstorm(s)
       - embedded thunderstorm(s).

   WSTs shall also be issued when, during the valid period, either of the
   following criteria occur or are forecast to occur:

       - a line of thunderstorms
       - an area of active thunderstorms affecting at least 3,000 square
   miles.

   WSTs for severe thunderstorms may include specific information on
   tornadoes and/or the occurrence of hail of 3/4-inch or greater diameter
   and/or wind gusts of 50 knots or greater. Tornadoes, 3/4-inch hail or
   wind gusts to 50 knots or greater alone are sufficient criteria for
   issuing a WST for severe thunderstorms.

   Embedded thunderstorms, for the purpose of WSTs, are defined as
   thunderstorms occurring within and obscured by haze, stratiform clouds,
   or precipitation from stratiform clouds. WSTs for embedded
   thunderstorms are intended to alert pilots that avoidance by visual or
   radar detection of the thunderstorm could be difficult or impossible.

   A line of thunderstorms is defined, for WSTs, as being at least 60
   miles long with thunderstorms affecting at least 40 percent of its
   length.

   Active thunderstorms are defined, for WSTs, as thunderstorms having a
   VIP level (i.e., reflectivity intensity) of 4 or greater and/or having
   significant satellite signatures and affecting at least 40 percent of
   the area outlined.

   WST issuances are based upon the above criteria and thresholds plus the
   judgment of the forecaster. For example, the forecaster may decide that
   the issuance of a WST would be prudent in cases where convective
   activity does not meet, but is expected to approach, the thresholds.
   The forecaster must also exercise judgment in determining when the
   thresholds for meeting these issuance criteria have been (or will be)
   exceeded.

   5.1     Convective SIGMET Bulletins. Three WST bulletins, describing
   conditions in the eastern (E), central (C), and western (W) regions of
   the United States, respectively, shall be issued each hour at 55
   minutes past the hour (H+55). Special WSTs shall be issued as required.
   WSTs are stored as replaceable bulletins.

   The boundaries between the three regions are at 87 and 107 degrees
   west. When WST conditions overlie these boundaries, the forecaster
   shall decide how the WSTs shall be designated for distribution to
   appropriate facilities and communications circuits by the use of the
   regional suffixes E, C, or W. The decision on which region to designate
   shall be based on where the bulk of the observed and forecast
   conditions are located with respect to the boundary. For example, if
   most of the WST criteria conditions are located in the Central Region
   but extend into an overlap area in the Eastern Region, the WST shall
   have an MKC header. If the majority of the area affected is forecast to
   move rapidly into the Eastern Region, a WST with the MKCE heading would
   be issued. In rare cases, when the system is massive enough to extend
   past the adjacent overlap areas, the same WST may have to be issued for
   two regions. The overlap areas are:

       a.     For the boundary at 87 degrees, approximately from 83 to 92
   degrees west longitude.

       b.     For the boundary at 107 degrees, approximately from 103 to
   109 degrees west longitude.

   Each WST bulletin shall be made up of one or more individually numbered
   WSTs for conditions within the region and valid for up to 2 hours or
   until superseded by the next hourly issuance.

   5.2.     Convective SIGMET Header. The WST product header consists of
   the 4 lines described below. The communications header on line 1 shall
   appear only once at the beginning of each individual bulletin. Lines 2,
   3, and 4 shall be included in all individual WSTs within the bulletin.

   Line 1 - MKCx WST ddtttt

   x =     E  - East of 87 degrees west longitude
             C  - Central, from 87 degrees west to 107 degrees west
   longitude
             W - West of 107 degrees longitude
              dd = Day of month (e.g., 02 or 31) tttt = Issuance time
   (H+55) in UTC.

   Line 2 - CONVECTIVE SIGMET nnx

     nn = Issuance Number nn - Individual SIGMETs which make up each
     bulletin (i.e., MKCE, MKCC, MKCW) shall be numbered consecutively,
     (e.g., 1-99), each day, beginning at 0000Z. x = C-central,
     E-eastern, or W-western.

   Line 3 - VALID UNTIL hhmmZ

   hhmmZ = Product expiration time in UTC.

   Line 4 - States or Areas Affected - use the two-letter state, Great
   Lakes, and state coastal water identifiers detailed in WSOM Chapter
   D-20, (e.g., KS OK, LM WI LS, or LA CSTL WTRS).

   5.3     Convective SIGMET Contents. The contents (after specifying
   information required on lines 2 through 4) of each individual WST
   message issued for a SIGMET criterion consists of the location (line 5)
   and text (line 6). The location shall be described using one or more
   authorized advisory location identifiers (LOC) shown in exhibit D-22-1.
   LOCs are the three letter FAA codes of either Very High Frequency (VHF)
   Omnidirectional Range (VOR) navigational facilities or airports. The
   text consists of an observation including a 2-hour trend forecast and
   remarks. It is a description of phenomena compiled from radar reports,
   satellite data, Pilot Reports (PIREP), or other reports which satisfy
   the following issuance criteria

   5.3.1     Isolated Severe/Embedded Thunderstorms. For isolated severe
   thunderstorm(s) or embedded thunderstorm(s) of any intensity:

   Line 5 - Location - VCNTY LOC or distance and direction LOC (AREA Dxx)
   LOC = Selected VORs or airport location identifiers Dxx = Area
   diameter. (Not to exceed 30 miles.)
   Example: VCNTY GCK or 10NE OMA AREA D20

   Two or three isolated thunderstorms may be described in one WST if they
   are closely associated and the text applies to all.

   Line 6 - Text - (Intensity trend), ISOLD SVR or ISOLD EMBDD (as
   applicable), TSTM(s), (Dxx), MOVG FROM ddff. TOP(S) hhh/TO hhh (if

   5.3.5     Special Convective SIGMETs. A WST special shall be issued at
   any time when either of the following criteria are met and/or forecast
   to be met for more than 30 minutes of the scheduled WST's valid period:

       a.     tornado, or hail 3/4-inch or greater, or wind gusts to 50
   knots or greater reported to the NAWAU forecaster or indicated when
   previous WST did not mention severe thunderstorms, or

   6.     Convective SIGMET Outlooks. The Convective SIGMET Outlook is a
   forecast of thunderstorm conditions beyond the 2-hour valid period of
   the WST that are expected to meet or exceed WST issuance criteria. This
   forecast is made each hour and is valid for the period 2 to 6 hours
   after the issuance time of the WST bulletin to which it is appended.
   Emphasis is placed on thunderstorms which form lines or active
   clusters, organized severe thunderstorms, or areas of embedded
   thunderstorms.

   The Convective SIGMET Outlook includes a discussion of the
   meteorological factors expected to support the convective development
   which prompted its issuance. Each area detailed shall be a closed
   outline composed of valid LOCs. Areas overlapping two WST regions
   follow the same dissemination rules described in section 5.1. A
   Convective SIGMET Outlook shall always be appended to each scheduled
   WST bulletin, even if it states "NONE." Negative Outlook statements
   should be either TSTMS ARE NOT XPCD or TSTMS ARE NOT XPCD TO REQUIRE
   WST ISSUANCES.

   The Outlook has the following format:

   OUTLOOK VALID ddtttt-ddtttt (AREA 1) (Lf more than one area is needed)
   FROM LOC-LOC-LOC-LOC-LOC (using as many LOCs as needed to adequately
   describe the area). Discussion of criterion(ia) expected to be met and
   meteorological factors supporting convective development.

   AREA N (N = Number of each area as needed) FROM LOC-LOC-LOC-LOC-LOC.
   Discussion.

   7.     Nonconvective SIGMETs in the Conterminous United States.
   Nonconvective SIGMETs for areas within the conterminous United States
   shall be issued by the NAWAU when any of the following weather
   phenomena occur or are forecast to occur and affect an area of at least
   3,000 square miles.

       a.     Severe or extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT)
   not associated with thunderstorms. (See exhibit D-22-2 and D-22-3.)

       b.     Severe icing not associated with thunderstorms. (See exhibit
   D-22-4.)

       c.     Widespread dust storms, sandstorms, or volcanic ash lowering
   surface and/or in-flight visibility to less than 3 miles.

       d.     Volcanic eruption.

   7.1     SIGMET Header. The first issuance of any nonconvective SIGMET
   shall be assigned a UWS (Urgent SIGMET) FAA product type identifier.
   Any subsequent issuance shall be a WS (SIGMET) unless the forecaster
   believes the situation warrants using UWS to trigger more expeditious
   FAA communications handling. Forecaster judgment must be exercised to
   avoid degrading the value of the UWS message option through overuse.

   SIGMETs must be identified accurately to enable proper message
   distribution and replaceability by communications systems. The key to
   replaceability is the assignment of unique communications headers. In
   order to keep the same WS product-type communications designator,
   replaceability necessitates suffixing a letter (representing the
   phonetic alphabet series designator) to the area designator. For
   example, if a SIGMET NOVEMBER 1 is issued, the communications header
   must be iiiN UWS ddtttt where "N" corresponds to the NOVEMBER series.
   Only the alphabetic designators NOVEMBER, OSCAR, PAPA, QUEBEC, ROMEO,
   UNIFORM, VICTOR, WHISKEY, XRAY, and YANKEE shall be used for
   nonconvective SIGMETs. The permitted alphabetic series designators for
   SIGMETs exclude those designators reserved for scheduled AIRMETs
   (SIERRA, TANGO, and ZULU). (See section 8.1.)

   In the contiguous states, iii, the area designator (SFO, SLC, CHI, DFW,
   BOS, MIA) is used to permit selective message distribution within
   various communications systems. It does not denote the office issuing
   the forecast. It does denote the geographical area affected (see WSOM
   Chapter D-20).

   causes rapid bumps or jolts without appreciable changes in aircraft
   altitude or attitude. Report as Moderate Chop.

   Turbulence that causes large, abrupt changes in altitude and/or
   attitude.  It usually causes large variations in indicated airspeed.
   Aircraft may be momentarily out of control.  Report as Severe
   Turbulence.*


   Turbulence in which the aircraft is violently tossed about and is
   practically impossible to control.  It may cause structural damage.
   Report as Extreme Turbulence.*
   Occupants feel definite strains against seat belts or shoulder straps.
     Unsecured objects are dislodged.  Food service and walking are
   difficult.

   Occupants are forced violently against seat belts or should straps.
   Unsecured objects are tossed about.  Food service and walking are
   impossible.
   NOTE
   1. Pilots should report locations(s), time (GMT), intensity, whether in
   or near clouds, altitude, type of aircraft and, when applicable,
   duration of turbulence.
   2. Durations may be based on time between two locations or over a
   single location.   All locations should be readily identifiable.
   EXAMPLES:
   a. Over Omaha, 1232Z, Moderate Turbulence, in cloud, Flight Level 310,
   B707.
   b. From 50 miles south of Albuquerque to 30 miles north of Phoenix,
   1210Z, to 1250Z, occasional Moderate Chop, Flight Level 330, DC8.
   * High level turbulence (normally above 15,000 feet ASL) not associated
   with cumuliform cloudiness, including thunderstorms, should be reported
   as CAT (clear air turbulence) preceded by the appropriate intensity, or
   light or moderate chop.

   FOOTNOTES:

   ^1/ Ude. The derived gust velocity, Ude, is only a rough approximation
   of true vertical gust velocity.  See Federal Aviation Regulations, Part
   23, paragraph 23.341 and part 25, paragraph 25-341.

   2/ Incremental Vertical Acceleration. As measured at the center of
   gravity of an aircraft.  For a given intensity of atmospheric
   turbulence, these accelerations depend on weight, airspeed, and design
   characteristics of the aircraft.  These values are for guidance only
   and do not indicate precise limits.

   3/ Vertical Wind Shear.  These values (vectors) are statistically
   typical for a layer 5,000 feet thick as obtained from rawinsonde data
   encoded for teletypewriter transmissions. Turbulence of these specified
   intensities is not always present.
   ^4/ Convective Clouds. Turbulence associated with convective clouds may
   be present in the immediate environment of, as well as in, the cloud
   systems.  Severe turbulence may be present in some portion of any
   thunderstorm. Extreme turbulence may be present in some portion of any
   mature or rapidly growing thunderstorm.  Superadiabatic lapse rates
   near the surface also may produce moderate turbulence.

   ^5/ Surface Winds.  Depends on terrain roughness and stability as well
   as wind speed.  Interactions are often present between low-level
   convective activity and mechanical turbulence.
   ^6/ Mountain Wave. Moderate or greater turbulence may be found with
   strong winds generally normal to the mountain ridge, wind speed
   increasing with height and relatively stable layers. Turbulence is
   likely at levels near the ridge height, in relatively stable layers and
   at the tropopause. Turbulence layers may be up to about 5,000 feet
   thick and may extend 50 to 100 miles downstream.   The presence of
   troughs and jet streams can enhance wave development. Windshear
   turbulence and mountain wave activity may interact to produce
   variations in turbulence over a wide range of altitudes. Severe or
   occasionally extreme turbulence may be found in or near rotor clouds
   and may extend to the ground. Turbulence may be present in mountain
   waves even though there is insufficient moisture available for the
   formation of lenticular or rotor clouds.

   Intensity Ice Accumulation Pilot Report
   Trace Ice becomes perceptible. Rate of accumulation slightly greater
   than rate of sublimation. It is not hazardous even though
   deicing/anti-icing equipment is not utilized, unless encountered for an
   extended period of time-over one hour. A/C Ident., Location, Time,
   (GMT) Intensity of type*, Altitude/FL, Aircraft Type, IAS
   Example:
   Holding at Westminister VOR, 1232Z Light Rime Icing, Altitude six
   thousand, Jetstar IAS 200kts
   Light The rate of accumulation may create a problem if flight is
   prolonged in this environment (over one hour). Occasional use of
   deicing/anti-icing equipment removes/prevents accumulation. It does not
   present a problem if the deicing/anti-icing equipment is used.
   Moderate The rate of accumulation is such that even short encounters
   become potentially hazardous and use of deicing/anti-icing equipment or
   diversion is necessary.
   Severe The rate of accumulation is such that deicing/anti-icing
   equipment fails to reduce or control the hazard.  Immediate diversion
   is necessary.
   * Rime Ice: Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous
   freezing of small supercooled water droplets.
   Clear Ice: A glossy, clear or translucent ice formed by the relatively
   slow freezing of large supercooled water droplets.

     SIGMET message type dd = Day of month tttt = Issuance and beginning

   Example: SFOP UWS 051710

   Line 2 - Title, alphanumeric deeignator, and SIGMET expiration time.

   SIGMET, Alphanumeric designator, VALID UNTIL ddtttt

   Alphanumeric deeignator = An alphabetic designator (NOVEMBER, etc.) and
   issuance number VALID UNTIL ddtttt = Ending Valid Time

   Example: SIGMET PAPA 1 VALID UNTIL 052110

   The first time a SIGMET is issued for a phenomenon associated with a
   particular weather system, it shall be given the next alphabetic
   designator in the series and shall be numbered as the first for that
   designator, e.g., NOVEMBER 1. It shall be numbered consecutively, using
   the same designator, i.e., NOVEMBER 2, NOVEMBER 3, etc., until the
   phenomenon ends or no longer meets SIGMET criteria.

   In the conterminous United States, this means that a phenomenon that is
   assigned an alphabetic designator in one area shall retain that
   designator as it moves within the area or into one or more other areas.
   For example, the first issuance for a continuing phenomenon which has
   moved into the CHI area from the SLC area might be SIGMET OSCAR 4.
   While this SIGMET OSCAR 4 is indeed the first SIGMET issued for this
   phenomenon in the CHI area, it is actually the fourth issuance for the
   phenomenon since it met SIGMET criterion with the previous three
   issuances having occurred over the SLC area.

   To alert users that a SIGMET, CHI SIGMET OSCAR 4 in this case, is the
   first issuance for an area, a referencing statement shall be included
   after the last remark, e.g., FOR PREVIOUS ISSUANCE SEE SLC SIGMET OSCAR
   3. SIGMETs for separate phenomena shall be designated sequentially,
   i.e., NOVEMBER, OSCAR, PAPA, etc., through YANKEE, and all designators
   through YANKEE, except SIERRA, TANGO, AND ZULU, shall be used before
   starting all over again with NOVEMBER. All six FA areas shall use the
   same alphabetic series.

   While SIGMETs may be issued up to 2 hours before the onset of any
   condition forecast to meet a criterion, note that the time in line 1 is
   the issuance time (rather than the onset time) and the time indicated
   in the VALID UNTIL ddtttt statement is the SIGMET expiration time. The
   difference between the two must not exceed 4 hours. For example, a
   SIGMET issued at 0210Z (0210 and 0610 entered as tttt on lines 1 and 2,
   respectively) and expected to persist beyond 4 hours shall include a
   statement in the remarks of the text indicating that conditions are
   expected to continue and/or spread after the 4-hour SIGMET period ends.
   If conditions persist, the next SIGMET should be issued before the
   expiration time of the previous SIGMET. However, if conditions end, a
   SIGMET cancellation shall be transmitted. SIGMETs for conditions which
   end within one-half hour of the "VALID UNTIL" time, which do not state
   conditions will continue, may be allowed to expire without
   cancellation. When a SIGMET condition is expected to last less than 4
   hours, the expected ending time of the SIGMET condition shall be
   indicated in the "valid until ddtttt" statement. A SIGMET cancellation
   shall be issued if the condition ends more than 1/2-hour prior to that
   expiration time. Caution must be used concerning SIGMETs with valid
   times of less than 4 hours. Some action, either a reissuance or
   cancellation, usually must be taken before the valid period expires.

   Line 3 - States or Areas Affected. Use two-letter state, Great Lake,
   and coastal water identifiers, e.g., MI, WV, LE, or TX LA CSTL WTRS.

   Example: DFWP UWS 051710

     SIGMET PAPA 1 VALID UNTIL 052110
     AR LA MS AND CSTL WTRS

   Line 4 - Location of phenomena. FROM (distance in nautical miles and
   direction in 16-point compass), LOC (see section 5.3 and exhibit
   D-22-1), TO (distance, direction), LOC, etc.

   Example: FROM MEM TO 30N MEI TO BTR TO MLU TO MEM

   Use the minimum number of points necessary to accurately enclose the
   area of a SIGMET phenomenon. The area should be delineated by starting
   in the northernmost corner of the area, proceeding clockwise, and
   ending with the first point.

   7.1.2     Multiple Area Designators. Since all SIGMETs in the
   conterminous United States are issued from the NAWAU in Kansas City,
   the points describing the location of a phenomenon meeting SIGMET
   criteria may extend beyond the boundaries for the area designator under
   which the SIGMET is issued. This is encouraged to avoid truncated
   delineation of weather areas. When a SIGMET criteria phenomenon extends
   or is forecast to extend across FA region boundaries, the phenomenon
   shall be described and its location coordinated across the boundaries
   as if no FA region boundaries exist. Then, the description and location
   shall again be coordinated to use the minimum number of LOCs or
   reference points necessary to enclose the phenomenon within each of the
   affected FA region boundaries. The same coordinated LOC boundaries
   shall be used in each FA region for which the SIGMET is issued. This
   method of describing the phenomenon allows each SIGMET area outline to
   overlap FA boundaries where necessary.

   The two-letter identifier of the state(a) or area(s) within the SIGMET
   shall be included in the "states or areas affected" line when at least
   two LOCs used to describe the SIGMET are within the state or a
   significant portion (e.g., 3,000 square miles or more) of the state or
   area is affected. In addition, any states in an adjacent FA region(s)
   that are within an overlapping area outline should be included at the
   end of the SIGMET's "state(s) or area(s) affected" line if they meet
   one of the criteria above.

   If SIGMETs are issued covering an area in the adjacent FA regions, the
   description of the conditions should be the same in any common or
   overlapping areas described in the products.

   While this chapter establishes the policy guidelines above, the
   forecaster's judgment must prevail. Forecasters shall determine when a
   single SIGMET is appropriate and when multiple SIGMETs are necessary
   due to the areal coverage of the phenomenon at a given instant and/or
   the area through which a phenomenon will be moving over time.

   Example: Coordinated area meeting SIGMET criteria:

   FROM TVC TO ERI TO AND TO MSL TO TVC
   Coordinated SIGMET issuances for the affected FA regions:
   CHI SIGMET area: HI IN KY OH LE WV
   FROM TVC TO ERI TO TRI TO 20W BNA TO TVC
   BOS SIGMET area: OH LE WV VA KY
   FROM ERI TO TRI TO CVG TO 40NE FWA TO ERI
   DFW SIGMET area: TN

   FROM TRI TO 20S CHA TO MSL TO 20W BNA TO TRI
   MIA SIGMET area: NC TN

   FROM TRI TO AND TO 2OS CHA TO TRI

   A referencing remark regarding the previous issuances is required in
   the appropriate message(a) if the SIGMET is not the first issuance for
   the phenomenon.

   It should be noted that for a phenomenon occurring at the juncture of
   the CHI, BOS, MIA, and DFW areas, four SIGMETs may be in effect at one
   time with the only difference being the four area designators and the
   outlines of the areas affected, It is important to note that the
   alphanumeric designator in this event would be the same for all four
   SIGMETs.

   7.2      Nonconvective SIGMET Message Texts. The following standardized
   SIGMET formats shall be used for the appropriate SIGMET criterion.

   7.2.1     Severe and Extreme Turbulence. SIGMETs for turbulence,
   including CAT, shall be issued for an area when severe or extreme
   turbulence is reported or forecast (see exhibits D-22-2 and D-22-3)
   over an area covering at least 3,000 square miles.

   Format: (MDT TO), (OCNL) SVR/EXTRM, TURBC, WITH STG
   UDDFS/UPDFTS/DWNDFTS (optional), INVOF MTNS (optional), BLO hhh/ABV
   hhh/BTWN hhh AND hhh, XPCD (DUE TO cause)/RPRTD BY (PIREP). Remarks.

   The term "optional" and text elements enclosed in parentheses as used
   in the above and subsequent formats, indicate that the associated text
   may be used when appropriate or available, at the discretion of the
   forecaster. The term "OCNL" is defined as a greater than 50 percent
   probability of occurrence but that the occurrence shall total less than
   half of the entire forecast period. "OCNL" should be used when
   appropriate. with forecasts only, even if PIREPs of occasional
   turbulence have been received.

   hhh = Height in hundreds of feet MSL

   Cause = Causal factors

   Include the cause only when XPCD is used within the body of the message
   and if it adds to the understanding of the SIGMET. When RPRTD BY is
   used in the text, include the pertinent PIREP information in the
   appropriate section of the fixed format if it helps lend credence to
   the SIGMET. Otherwise, include one of the following statements: RPRTD
   BY ACFT IN VCNTY or RPRTD BY SVRL ACFT.

   Causal factors include jet streams, mountain wave action, strong
   fronts, upslope or overrunning clouds or rain, strong low-level wind,
   etc.

   Remarks = Comments which expand or clarify the SIGMET, particularly
   information concerning onset and cessation of SIGMET conditions. Such
   information shall be stated using one of the following phrases:

   a. CONDS BGNG BY ttttZ
   b. CONDS CONTG (location) BYD ttttZ
   c. CONDS IPVG TO (conditions) AFT ttttZ
   d. CONDS IPVG TO (conditions) OVR location AFT ttttZ
   e. CONDS IPVG TO (conditions) FM dd AFT ttttZ
   f. CONDS ENDG AFT ttttZ
   g. CONDS SPRDG OVR location BY ttttZ
   h. CONDS MOVG (direction) THRU ttttZ

   Some of the above remarks may be combined, e.g., CONDS BGNG BY 1200Z
   AND CONTG BYD 1400Z. Location refers to states or portions of states or
   recognized geographical areas. dd is an area direction (see section
   7.2.3).

   Examples: MDT TO SVR TURBC BTWN 200 AND 250 RPRTD BY ACFT IN VCNTY.
   CONDS CONTG BYD 1800Z.

   OCNL SVR TURBC WITH STG UDDFS INVOF MTNS BLO 150 XPCD DUE TO MTN WAVES.
   CONDS IPVG AFT 1800Z.

   7.2.2     Clear Air Turbulence (CAT). CAT is defined as turbulence not
   associated with cumuliform clouds, including thunderstorms, occurring
   at or above 15,000 feet. SIGMETs for CAT shall be issued when severe or
   extreme turbulence is reported or forecast over an area covering at
   least 3,000 square miles, i.e., CAT shall be treated exactly the same
   as any other category of turbulence. Forecasts of moderate turbulence
   at any level up to 45,000 feet are included in the turbulence AIRMET
   bulletins.

   7.2.3     Severe Icing. SIGMETs for icing shall be issued for an area
   when severe icing is reported or forecast (see exhibit D-22-4) over an
   area covering at least 3,000 square miles.

   Format: (MDT TO), (OCNL) SVR icing type (CLR, RIME, MXD) (optional),
   ICG, BLO hhh/BTWN hhh AND hhh/BTWN.FRZLVL AND hhh, XPCD (DUE TO
   cause)/RPRTD BY (PIREP). FRZLVL, SFC/hhh/BTWN hhh (dd) AND hhh (dd)/SFC
   (dd)-hhh (dd)/SFC or hhh (dd) SLPG TO hhh (dd). Remarks (see section
   7.2.1).

   dd = 8-point compass direction of a portion of the advisory area.

   Weather and obstructions to visibility shall be indicated using the
   same contractions used for surface airways observations. The height of
   the freezing level shall be included any time the freezing level is
   referenced.

   Examples: SVR CLR ICG BLO 160 RPRTD BY B727. CONDS CONTG BYD 1310Z.

   MDT to OCNL SVR ICG BTWN FRZLVL AND 160 XPCD DUE TO COLD ADVCTN AND STG
   LOW LVL CONVERGENCE. FRZLVL 80 E SLPG TO 120 W. CONDS SPRDG OVR NY NJ
   CSTL SXNS BY 1000Z.

   7.2.4     Widespread Dust Storms. Sandstorms, and Volcanic Ash. SIGMETs
   for dust storms, sandstorms, or volcanic ash shall be issued when they
   cause, or are expected to cause, surface or in-flight visibilities to
   be below 3 miles over an area of at least 3,000 square miles. In the
   case of volcanic ash, a SIGMET may be issued if the conditions affect
   any size area which, in the judgment of the forecaster, is significant
   to aviation operations near that area. The issuance threshold of 3
   miles is not used as a threshold between hazardous and nonhazardous
   conditions. It is the threshold at which reports can be reliably
   expected. It is also the point at which an operational impact is
   assured since IFR operations would be required in controlled airspace.

   Even when these phenomena result in visibilities greater than 3 miles,
   they may still constitute an extreme hazard to aircraft operations.
   SIGMETs should be issued under these conditions when, in the
   forecaster's judgment, a hazard is known to exist.

   Conditions, such as the physical characteristics of the volcanic ash,
   the remote locations of many volcanoes, and/or the ash being obscured
   within clouds, may make determining the occurrence of an eruption or
   the existence of ash aloft difficult, if not impossible. After the
   first (Urgent) SIGMET for volcanic ash is issued, that SIGMET series
   should be updated when any information becomes available which will
   increase the In-flight Advisory's effectiveness.

   Formats:

   VSBY, BLO/AOB 3 IN, DUST/SAND, BLO hhh/ABV hhh/BTWN hhh AND hhh, XPCD
   (DUE TO cause)/RPRTD BY (PIREP). Remarks (see section 6.2.1), or

   VOLCANIC ASH, BLO hhh/ABV hhh/BTWN hhh AND hhh, XPCD (DUE TO source
   eruption)/RPRTD BY (PIREP or other observation). Remarks (see section
   6.2.1).

   Examples: VSBY BLO 3 MI IN DUST BLO 120 RPRTD BY SVRL ACFT. CONDS CONTG
   BYD 2310Z.

   VOLCANIC ASH BTWN 150 AND 250 DUE TO MT. ST HELEN ERUPTION RPRTD BY
   SVRL ACFT. CONDS SPRDG OVR NW AZ BY 2230Z AND CONTG BYD 2310Z.

   7.2.5     Volcanic Eruption. A SIGMET for a volcanic eruption shall be
   issued as soon as possible after receipt of notification that a
   volcanic eruption

   Example: REPORT RECEIVED THAT MT. ST HELEN ERUPTED AT 1230Z. VOLCANIC
   CLOUD XPCD TO MOVE NEWD. TOPS OF CLOUD MAY REACH 350. A SIGMET FOR
   VOLCANIC ASH WILL BE ISSUED AS SOON AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES
   AVAILABLE.

   Volcanic eruptions may continue for only a short period of time while
   some may pulse for long periods of time causing significant disruptions
   to the flow of air traffic. Due to the serious threat volcanic ash
   poses to aircraft in flight, multiple issuances under a SIGMET series
   due to repeated and/or ongoing eruptions should be made to advise the
   aviation community of recurring events regardless of whether or not
   visibility or "known-hazard" criteria are met. A single, short-lived
   eruption will result in a single Urgent SIGMET, valid for 4 hours. The
   alphabetic designator for that SIGMET should not be reused for 24 hours
   to allow any subsequent eruption notifications to be issued under the
   same designator.

   7.2.6     Relationship of Nonconvective SIGMETs to Tropical Storm
   and/or Hurricane Advisories. Conditions meeting SIGMET criteria, which
   result from tropical storms or hurricanes, shall be referenced in the
   "cause" phrase of the SIGMET as follows (see section 7.2.1).

   DUE TO (HURCN ANA, TRPCL STM BOB, etc)...SEE LAmanual ADVY.

   7.2.7     SIGMET Cancellations. SIGMET cancellations shall be
   transmitted, when appropriate, in the following format.

   Format: CNCL SIGMET, alphanumeric designator. Remarks.

   Example: CNCL S}GMET QUEBEC 1. CONDS HAVE BCM MDT.

   7.3     Examples. The following are complete examples of SIGMETs.

   8.     AIRMETs. AIRMETs are also advisories of significant weather
   phenomena but describe conditions at intensities lower than those which
   trigger SIGMETs. Both are intended for dissemination to all pilots in
   the en route phase of flight to enhance safety.

   AIRMET bulletins, each containing one or more AIRMET messages, shall be
   issued on a scheduled basis every 6 hours with 0200 UTC as the first
   valid time. Unlike FAs, scheduled AIRMET bulletin issuances shall occur
   at the same UTC times regardless of their area designators. Unscheduled
   amendments and corrections will be issued as necessary. AIRMET
   bulletins shall contain details of conditions within their designated
   geographical areas when one or more of the following conditions occurs,
   or is expected to occur, and affect an area of at least 3,000 square
   miles:

   a. Moderate icing
   b. Moderate turbulence
   c. Sustained surface wind of 30 knots or more
   d. Ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or visibility less than
   3 miles affecting over 50 percent of an area at any one time
   e. Extensive mountain obscuration

   8.1     AIRMET Header. As with SIGMETs, AIRMETs must be identified
   accurately to enable proper message distribution and replaceability
   within communications systems. The key to AIRMET selective
   replaceability is the assignment of unique communications headers for
   each phenomenon type. In order to use the same WA product-type
   communications designator, a letter (reflecting the alphabetic
   designator of the phenomenon to be described) must follow the area
   designator. For example, when the AIRMET for turbulence is issued, the
   communications header must be iiiT WA ddtttt where "T" (for TANGO) is
   the alphabetic designator for turbulence AIRMET bulletins.

   In the contiguous states, the iii (SFO, SLC, CHI, DFW, BOS, MIA) is
   used for message distribution in the communications systems and does
   not denote the office issuing the forecast, although it does denote the
   geographic area affected (see WSOM Chapter D-20). In Alaska and Hawaii,
   each iii does denote the issuing office.

   8.1.1     Header Format.

   Line 1 - Area, phenomenon and message type designators, and date-time
   group.

   iiix WA dUtttt (AMD/COR #)

   iii = SFO, SLC, CHI, DFW, BOS, MIA, ANC, FAI, JNU, HNL
   x = The alphabetic phenomenon designation of AIRMET bulletins; S for
   significant IFR or mountain obscuration, T for turbulence, strong
   surface winds, or LLWS, and Z for icing and freezing level.
   WA = AIRMET message type designator.
   dd = Day of month.
   tttt = Issuance time (UTC). Scheduled issuance times are 15 minutes
   prior to the beginning of the valid period. Amended and corrected
   bulletins issued after the start of the valid period are valid
   beginning at the time of issuance.
   AMD/COR = Indicator that AIRMET bulletin is an amendment or
   correction to a scheduled issuance.
   # = Amendment or correction number since the last scheduled issuance.

   Example: DFWZ WA 181525 AMD 1

   Line 2 - AIRMET, phonetic alphabet phenomenon designator, FOR criteria,
   VALID UNTIL ddtttt

   Phonetic alphabet phenomenon designators = SIERRA, TANGO, or ZULU
   Criteria = The primary phenomenon indicated by the designator and any
   additional designated phenomena actually contained in the bulletin,
   e.g., mountain obscuration or strong surface winds. VALID UNTIL ddtttt
   = Valid period expiration time. This shall be 6 hours after the
   scheduled ''valid beginning" time or 6 hours and 15 minutes after the
   scheduled issuance time.

   Example: AIRMET TANGO FOR TURBC...STG SFC WINDS AND LLWS VALID UNTIL
   182000 (NOTE: The three dots in this example are equivalent to a
   comma.)

   The contents of AIRMET bulletin lines following line 2 will vary
   depending on conditions. To aid automatic processing of the products,
   each subsequent line or section shall be preceded by a line containing
   only a period (.) as a delimiter.

   As a minimum, each AIRMET bulletin shall contain lines 1 and 2 and the
   statement "NO SGFNT, Standard criteria, XPCD." on line 3. In addition,
   icing and freezing level AIRMETs shall contain a freezing level line.

   Example: NO SGFNT ICG XPCD
   FRZLVL...100-130 THRUT.

   Other options for line 3 are as follows.

   Whenever SIGMETs are in effect, the AIRMET bulletins for the same
   phenomena, which cover the affected area(s) shall contain a reference
   to the appropriate SIGMET series. This reference, when required, shall
   be line 3 of the AIRMET bulletin.

   Line 3 - ...SEE SIGMET Alphabetic designator SERIES FOR (appropriate
   phenomenon)

   Examples: ...SEE SIGMET XRAY SERIES FOR SVR TURBC AREA...
