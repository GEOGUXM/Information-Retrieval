   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has established internal Centers of
   Excellence in order to meet its NASA programmatic commitments, both now
   and in the future. The areas chosen for these Centers reflect NASA's
   desire for JPL to be the Center of Excellence in Deep Space Systems and
   JPL's emerging role in NASA's Origins Program.

   The Interferometry Center of Excellence is chartered to ensure the
   development and maintenance of a leading edge capability in optical and
   near-infrared interferometry imaging and astrometric technology.

   Specific activities include the following:

    1. Be the Laboratory's center of leadership, vision, and strategic and
       long-range planning for the institutional interferometry
       capabilities.
    2. Enable and nurture world class science experiments in Extra-Solar
       System Exploration and in Astrophysics;
    3. Develop, in concert with the line organizations, the required
       infrastructure necessary for the successful implementation of
       interferometry projects, including the acquisitions/development of
       key facilities, design tools and key personnel.
    4. Serve as the focus for the Laboratory's technical interfaces with
       the external scientific and technological interferometry community.
       This includes hosting/sponsoring conferences, providing for
       technical exchanges, coordination of outreach and identifying and
       developing opportunities for alliances.
    5. Develop and maintain, jointly with the ESD and the TAP Program
       Office, a long-range technology plan to support the expected ground
       and space projects.
    6. Develop and maintain, jointly with the ESD and SESPD Program
       Office, a long-range science investigation plan to exploit the new
       capabilities offered by optical interferometry.
    7. Initiate when necessary, and otherwise participate in periodic
       scheduled reviews to ensure that the quality of technical proposals
       and project work in interferometry meets the necessary standards.
    8. Initiate periodic peer reviews of work in interferometry performed
       by the Center to ensure that the quality of the Center meets the
       necessary standards.
