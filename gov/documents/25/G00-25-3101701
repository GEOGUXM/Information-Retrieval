     The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial provides tremendous opportunities
     for our state of South Dakota. South Dakota communities and
     organizations in the state already have begun planning
     Bicentennial-related projects, and many more are sure to join their
     efforts as the celebration becomes more imminent. The Bicentennial
     will serve as a vehicle for education, tourism, and conservation
     initiatives which will benefit the people of South Dakota immensely.
