                          Draft Chapter 4 Summary:
                 Regional Summaries of Restoration Planning
     __________________________________________________________________


                                                                       SAV

   The National Strategy includes six regional summaries that assess the
   status and identify future needs and directions for estuarine habitat
   restoration planning. The regions are: the Northeast Atlantic, the
   Southeast Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Pacific
   Islands, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Lakes.

   The summaries, which are based on an extensive inventory of planning
   efforts related to estuarine habitat restoration and restoration
   planning in the region, support the National Strategy by providing an
   overview of current efforts and needs. Information is included
   regarding: key habitats and species; habitat issues; coordination of
   planning efforts; and common restoration goals, methods, and needs.
   Detailed descriptions of restoration planning documents will also be
   made available in a searchable, online database.
