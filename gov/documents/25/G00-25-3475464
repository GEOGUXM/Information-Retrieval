     __________________________________________________________________

                   BUSINESS HOURS DURING THE 2002 OLYMPICS

   During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the business
   hours of the United States District and Bankruptcy Courts for the
   District of Utah will be adjusted as follows.

   Beginning on Thursday, February 7, 2002, and continuing through Monday,
   February 25, 2002, weekday business hours for the District Clerk's
   Office and Bankruptcy Clerk's Office will be 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
   Access to the Frank E. Moss U.S. Courthouse will be limited to these
   business hours.

   The courthouse will be closed on Monday, February 18, 2002, in honor of
   President's Day, a federal holiday.

   The District Court's 7-day/24-hour filing box will remain in operation
   throughout the 2002 Olympics. The Bankruptcy Court has discontinued use
   of a filing box. Bankruptcy-related papers should be mailed or
   delivered directly to the Bankruptcy Court during the hours noted. They
   should not be placed in the District Court filing box.
   We appreciate your cooperation and anticipate a smooth return to the
   regular business hours following the 2002 Olympic Games.

   For information, call the District Court Clerk's Office at (801)
   524-6100 or the Bankruptcy Court Clerk's Office at (801) 524-6687.
