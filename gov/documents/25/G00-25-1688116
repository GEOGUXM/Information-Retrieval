   Handling Misconduct

STUDIES/REPORTS

   ORI conducts some studies in-house while others are done under
   contract. The studies are policy, applied or mission oriented.  The
   results of the completed studies are presented; abstracts are presented
   for the studies in progress. The reports were prepared by various
   groups that have reviewed the PHS effort to respond to allegations of
   research misconduct and promote the responsible conduct of research.
   ORI staff prepared the reports on the whistleblowers conditional
   privilege and the Annual Report on Possible Research Misconduct.
