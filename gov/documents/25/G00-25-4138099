   NLCD: National Land Cover Characterization Dataset Published on the
   Geography Network
   News and Announcements The National Land Cover Characterization project
   was created in 1995 to support the original Multi-Resolution Land
   Characterization (MRLC) initiative and fulfill the requirement to
   develop a nationally consistent land cover data set from MRLC data
   called National Land Cover Data 1992 (NLCD 92). This culminated in the
   September 2000 completion of land-cover mapping using a modified
   Anderson level II classification for the conterminous United States. In
   addition to satellite data, scientists used a variety of supporting
   information including topography, census, agricultural statistics, soil
   characteristics, other land cover maps, and wetlands data to determine
   and label the land cover type at 30 meter resolution. Twenty-one
   classes of land cover were mapped, using consistent procedures for the
   entire U.S. and a subsequent accuracy assessment was performed. The
   resulting land cover dataset is being used for a wide variety of
   national and regional applications, including watershed management,
   environmental inventories, transportation modeling, fire risk
   assessment, and land management. More information can be found on the
   NLCD website at http://edc.usgs.gov/programs/lccp/.
