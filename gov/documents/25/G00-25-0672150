   Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACS) Database

   The Office of Electronic Government, Acquisition Systems Division (MEE)
   in partnership with the Office of Acquisition Policy (MV) is developing
   a searchable database of Government-wide Acquisition Contracts,
   Multi-agency contracts, FSS Schedules, Blanket Purchase Agreements, and
   other contracts established for interagency use. The database will
   enable agencies to explore the use of existing multi-agency contracting
   vehicles to satisfy their requirements before developing new contracts,
   thereby eliminating duplication of contracts for the same supplies or
   services. Users will be able to search the database, which will be
   available on ARNet, for contract information using various criteria.

   A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation rule that would require
   contracting officers to populate the database is expected to appear in
   the Federal Register this month. This project is an integral component
   of the Integrated Acquisition Environment under the President's
   Management Agenda. For additional information, contact Bill Morgan at:
   202-501-3748 or via email: bill.morgan@gsa.gov.

   Accepting Digital Identity Credentials

   The Office of Electronic Government (OEG) is developing the foundation
   for customer-centric, interoperable E-Gov services. OEG is promoting
   the ability to cross-certify disparate public key infrastructure (PKI)
   domains that authenticate the identity of individuals who need to
   securely interact with the government. Cross-certification provides a
   trust framework wherein digital credentials are evaluated against a set
   standard, providing the technical and legal infrastructure necessary
   for Federal agencies to accept digital credentials issued by other
   federal agencys and nongovernmental certificate authorities.
   Cross-certification will be accomplished through the Federal Bridge
   Certificate Authority (FBCA). The policies and procedures of the FBCA
   are governed by the Federal PKI Policy Authority, which has
   responsibility for mapping a CA's policies and practices against the
   FBCA standard. GSA is one of the six charter members of the Policy
   Authority, which also includes the Departments of Commerce, Defense,
   Justice, and Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget. For
   additional information contact Rebecca Kahn at (202) 501-6733 or e-mail
   at rebecca.kahn@gsa.gov.
