   Razmik Khachikyan notified Site Ops that no data had been collected
   from the GPS Linux machine since 1430 GMT on 11/20.    Attempts at
   pinging the computer were also unsuccessful.  T/S found that the Linux
   computer and Ashteck receiver were powered off.  Site power was down
   from 1503 to 1555 GMT on 11/20 for trench work.  Apparently the GPS
   computer and receiver ran on UPS power until that was exhausted and
   then shut down and were never restarted.  Powered the Linux computer
   and receiver on at 2020 GMT.  A ping test was then successful.  RTS
   status O.K.

   Ron Muellerschoen of JPL onsite to pursue noise problems with their
   GPS.  Ron checked everything and found the existing antenna to be the
   problem.  He replaced the AOA antenna with an *Ashtech unit.  Ron also
   moved the MET3 data cable to the Ashtech GPS Receiver to simplify the
   system operation and improve data capture.  He prepared a wiring
   diagram which was left with the system.  (Antenna information:
   Manufacturer – Ashtech, Model - Choke Ring, Voltage - 5 to 15 VDC, P/N
   - 701945-02, rev. C, S/N - CR620004601)

   Halted GPS PC acquisition at SGP at 1710 GMT after reconfiguring for
   new address (198.124.99.58). Installed a 12-port hub on 198.124.99.8
   cable (UVSR RocketPort) in the UVSR shelter. Link light on. Connected
   UVSR RocketPort to new hub. Link light on. Moved PC to UVSR shelter and
   connected Ashtech port 1 to PC tty1 and Ethernet to new hub. Link light
   on. Disconnected external Rubidium Reference from the Ashech receiver
   at JPL direction. Ron was able to ping the PC, but couldn't talk to the
   Ashtech receiver. Ron asked for a null-modem to be installed between
   the tty1 and GPS port 1. Work completed at 1740 GMT. Awaiting testing
   and data retrieval by JPL.

   Site Ops shortened the GPS antenna cable by approximately 75 feet per
   JPL request (Dave Stowers). This involved cutting off excess RG214/u
   cable and crimping on a new type-N connector. This action should boost
   the signal arriving at the receiver(s) significantly. This work began
   at 1903 GMT and concluded at 1925 GMT.

   During this work the AOA Benchmark receiver was observed to not be
   functioning. A call to Ron Muellerschoen at JPL confirmed this. JPL is
   in the process of deciding what to do about the AOA instrument.

   Site Ops was waiting to move the JPL PC out of the UVSR shelter until a
   permanent CORS style GPS antenna monument could be installed. That
   monument was installed several weeks ago and relocation of the antenna
   took place today. The new antenna is approximately 11-1/8 inches higher
   than the previous nearby antenna location. The MetPack (near the UVSR
   shelter) was raised 5-0 inches higher to center its barometer on the
   GPS antenna's horizon. All measurements are referenced to the top
   surface of the concentric aluminum rings surrounding the antenna dome.
   The CORS style monument is quite solid, being formed of an 18 inch
   diameter concrete plug that runs to a depth of 15 feet into the ground.
   Above the ground surface, the monument is 12 inches in diameter and is
   60 inches tall. The monument is reinforced with non-metallic
   reinforcing bars and has a Delrin mount for the antenna. The mount is
   fixed with regard to level and only allows rotational adjustment. Its
   final horizon was measured with a digital level at 0.5 degrees low on
   the south side and 0.2 degrees low on the east side. The JPL PC was
   relocated to the Optical trailer. Final connections between the
   instrument and computer will be made as soon as the serial multiplexer
   to be used is repaired.

   MR

   Marty Marcin notified us that the Benchmark receiver was not
   communicating. T/S found the receiver was scrambled and had garbage on
   the screen. Power cycled the receiver and reseated the cables. This
   seemed to repair the problem. RTS the unit at 2115 GMT.

   DAN

   As part of BCR-00289, the JPL GPS antenna and supporting
   instrumentation were relocated from south of the RCF to just east of
   the SGP CF Central Instrument Cluster. This action was taken to free-up
   the ARM SGP IDP1 area for IOPs and the like. The JPL GPS antenna is now
   located approximately 60m east of the ARM EBBR. This location provides
   a completely unobstructed 2Pi field of view. All supporting equipment
   is located in or near the USDA UVSR shelter approximately 30m SW of the
   antenna location. The system's metrology package is attached to the SW
   corner of the UVSR foundation safety rail. It's elevation is within
   10-15cm of the GPS antenna.

   GRS

   The antenna blew over and fell on its side some time between 2045 and
   2115 GMT during a hard rain and high wind event on 7/11/00. Stood the
   instrument back upright at 1630 GMT and then found that a nest of
   yellow jackets had built a hive in the orange duct that the instruments
   cable runs in. Left the area….in a hurry. Came back at 1800 GMT and
   sprayed the nest and killed the wasps. Tightened the rope that holds
   down the antenna and releveled the antenna at 1820 GMT. Contacted
   Martin Marcin at 2120 GMT and informed him of the outage and asked him
   to check into the instrument and make sure that it is working O.K. RTS

   Marty Marcin shipped a new Linux OS data acquisition computer to the CF
   to replace the old Linux and Mac JPL computers. Marty remotely
   collected data and shut the JPL down at 1800 GMT. Removed the Benchmark
   and Ashtech receiver serial connections from the old Linux computer and
   connected to COM1 and COM2, respectively, of the new computer. Moved
   the monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the new computer. Disconnected the
   MET3 serial connection from the old Mac computer and removed the null
   modem from the line. Connected the MET3 to ttyC0 of a multi-port serial
   card on the new computer. Powered the new computer on at 1820 GMT.
   Marty verified remote comms with all the instruments. RTS status O.K.
   at 1830 GMT. The old Linux computer, Mac computer, and 17" monitor will
   be returned to JPL.

   CAM

   Jim Liljegren requested that Site Ops check the level of the JPL
   supporting MWR. The MWR does not appear to be finding the sun other
   than at solar noon. T/S found that the level was accurate, however it
   appeared that at some point the instrument had rotated a full 360
   degrees clockwise and the power cables had made a complete wrap around
   the base of the instrument. The instrument had then 'homed' itself with
   the cables fully wrapped and was subsequently unable to rotate much
   farther than about 40 degrees clockwise from the home position before
   the cables would bind. Powered the instrument off, homed the
   instrument, and unwrapped the cables. Restored power at 1505 GMT. Also
   verified the moisture detector sensitivity setting. Adjusted the
   potentiometer until the heater turned on and then backed the
   potentiometer off 1/4 turn. Jim restarted the software remotely and
   reported that the MWR is now successfully tracking the sun.

   that the laptop was locked up and could not be powered off. Removed the
   laptop battery and disconnected power supply at 1550 GMT to shut the
   computer off. Replaced the battery and plugged power supply back in.
   Computer booted up at 1555 GMT but locked up again shortly after
   loading all of the start up applications. Was then able to power the
   laptop off with the on/off switch at 1558 GMT. Powered the laptop back
   on and this time the boot up was successful. RTS status O.K. at 1600
   GMT

   6/28/99

   CAM

   Jim Liljegren requested Site Ops assistance in verifying that the MWR
   program is running properly and that the MWR rotates freely and finds
   the sun as it should. Jim ran the program remotely and the MWR scanned
   properly and locked onto the sun. Ran the program locally and verified
   the displays were present. The display indicated an Azimuth error
   occasionally but appeared to be working properly. Jim will look at the
   code for problems.

   The system is down. The computer will not run even with all
   applications closed. Windows keeps shutting down because of an
   exception error. Called Steve Kheim.

   12/17/98

   MW

   The WR-177 program was not running this morning. The blue error screen
   was displayed indicating an ‘exception error’ had occurred. Rebooted
   the computer at 1445 GMT. Closed WVR-177, WVR Monitor, and Reach Out.
   The blue error screen appeared shortly thereafter, even with none of
   the above mentioned programs running. Rebooted again at 1455 GMT.
   Closed all of the programs and left the system as-is until 1640 GMT
   when WVR-177 was restarted.

   12/16/98

   MW

   WVR-177 was not scrolling data this morning. Quit the program at 1505
   GMT. Closed all applets. Changed the WVR-177 program properties so
   WR-177 will run in a window instead of full screen. Restarted WVR-177,
   WVR Monitor, and Reach Out in that order. As of 1528 GMT, data is
   scrolling on WVR-177, a graph is displayed on WVR Monitor, and JT-02’s
   mirror is rotating. The instrument mentor called and asked that Reach
   Out be restarted because he couldn’t monitor the system remotely.
   Restarted Reach Out at 1740 GMT. The mentor still could not communicate
   with the system so he asked that the computer be shut down and
   restarted. Restarted the computer at 1745 GMT. The mentor was able to
   communicate with the system after the restart. However, the blue
   exception error screen popped up shortly after he took command of the
   system. The mentor lost communications with the system once the error
   message appeared. Suspect that the Reach Out program is the cause of
   the errors experienced with the system lately. Restarted the computer
   once again at 1755 GMT. Closed the Reach Out and WVR Monitor programs
   at the mentors request. Will let the system run with just the WVR-177
   program running.

   12/15/98
