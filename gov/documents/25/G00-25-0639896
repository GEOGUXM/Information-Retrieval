   Observing Lightning from Space   [ Lightning Home ]

   [msfclight_new.jpg] Lightning is rapidly emerging as a phenomenon of
   increasing interest to meteorologists and climate scientists. At the
   individual storm level, real-time measurements of lightning flash rates
   provide forecasters with key information about the evolution and
   severity of thunderstorms. Lightning data are used by forest management
   personnel (to assess forest fire risks), power utility providers,
   emergency management units, recreational facilities, and the insurance
   industry. At the global scale, lightning observations are used to
   analyze natural sources of nitrogen compounds important to atmospheric
   chemistry. Global lightning distributions also provide key information
   about deep thunderstorm convection, which in the tropics is the
   principal "engine" driving the global climate system.
   The observation of global lightning activity is a nontrivial problem.
   Conventional (radio frequency) lightning detection systems have limited
   fields-of-view, and they are strongly biased when measuring lightning
   at far distances. An obvious solution is the optical measurement of
   lightning flashes from space, in either low-earth or geostationary
   orbit. This approach has been successfully developed and implemented by
   the GHCC Lightning Team.

   The GHCC's Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was launched November 1997
   with other instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission
   (TRMM) satellite. The LIS builds on successful observing campaigns that
   used optical sensors aboard U2 aircraft and the Space Shuttle to
   demonstrate that lightning could be observed from cloud-top
   measurements. The data from these campaigns led to the design and
   deployment of the prototype Optical Transient Detector (OTD), which has
   been observing global lightning aboard a low-earth-orbit Microlab-1
   satellite since April 1995. The LIS design represents a significant
   improvement in resolution, sensitivity and robustness over the OTD.
   Together, the LIS and OTD are now providing the first truly unbiased
   climatology of global total lightning, during both day and night.

   [lis.GIF] The LIS's eye is a small, solid-state camera with special
   filters that admit only the peak optical wavelength emitted by
   lightning. Software measures the background cloud scene and records
   only sudden changes (transients). The camera view is 600 km on a side,
   and each LIS pixel covers 5-10 km on the ground, matching the smallest
   storm cells that might host lightning. LIS images are overlaid on
   visible, thermal and radar images produced by other TRMM instruments.
   By analyzing images from multiple instruments, LIS investigators hope
   to match lightning flash rates with key aspects of storms, including
   updrafts, total ice content, cloud top-height and total rainfall. The
   first LIS images were released in mid-December, and daily overviews of
   images are now posted on the World Wide Web a day after they are
   collected. Both OTD and LIS data, as well as a full suite of
   cross-platform analysis software, are available from the Global
   Hydrology Resource Center (GHRC).

   [lis_tmi.gif] NASA has also approved an advanced definition study for a
   Lightning Mapping Sensor (LMS) that could provide real-time
   observations from geostationary orbit. The LMS represents the next
   logical progression in lightning detection from space. The OTD sensor
   provided a technology proof-of-concept, a truly unbiased global
   climatology and an indication of the technical difficulties yet to be
   addressed. The LIS sensor improved on the OTD design, and is collecting
   high quality science data that will allow scientists to translate
   lightning flash rate measurements into useful forecasting, scientific
   and diagnostic tools. The LMS sensor is an evolution into an
   "operational" paradigm. Continuous, real-time LMS measurements, paired
   with the scientific knowledge gained from the LIS mission, will provide
   operational weather forecasters with critical additional information,
   enabling them to decide in advance whether a developing thunderstorm,
   squall line or hurricane will become severe. Research results from LIS
   and OTD data indicate that this tool may provide crucial warning time
   to the public.
