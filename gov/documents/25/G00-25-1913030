   It's an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to the Maricopa County
   Human Services Department on the World Wide Web. Our employees envision
   Maricopa County as a community in which all residents will have
   opportunities to achieve economic self-sufficiency and enjoy a high
   quality of life.  This site is just one of the ways we hope to achieve
   that vision.  Our internet site serves a number of purposes, including:

   1) Serving as an information and referral directory to connect eligible
   county residents with our services

   2) Creating a community linkage with other public and private sector
   agencies with whom we have strategic partnerships and associations, and
   with other organizations with whom we share common goals

   3) Developing new avenues to educate and initiate dialogue with elected
   officials, other public policy decision-makers, and the community at
   large on the scope, scale, and complexity of emerging human and social
   service issues in Maricopa County

   We hope your visit with us will be worthwhile and enjoyable. Our staff
   members are committed to providing innovative, high quality services in
   the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible. In this regard, we
   welcome your feedback on ways to improve this site to meet your needs,
   and we encourage you to contact our Webmaster at
   mcastellano@mail.maricopa.gov  with your comments, questions or
   suggestions. Thanks for dropping by and please come back again.
