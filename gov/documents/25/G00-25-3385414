   The Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the
   National Institutes of Health was established to facilitate research in
   vaccine development. The VRC is dedicated to improving global human
   health through the rigorous pursuit of effective vaccines for human
   diseases. Established by former President Bill Clinton as part of an
   initiative to develop an AIDS vaccine, the VRC is a unique venture
   within the NIH intramural research program. Initially spearheaded by
   the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the
   National Cancer Institute, and the NIH Office of AIDS Research, the VRC
   is now part of the NIAID organization.
