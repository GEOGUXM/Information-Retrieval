   District of Nevada U.S.B.C.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Question:
   How do I obtain a copy of the recording of a court hearing?

   Answer:
   NEVADA BANKRUPTCY COURT has gone Digital. Copies of digital audio
   recorded court hearings may now be obtained on a Compact Disk with the
   data playable on a computer. Your computer must have a CD drive, a
   sound card, and Internet access.
   When you order a copy of a court record in CD format, you will be
   provided with instructions on how to download Free Software from the
   Internet which will enable your computer to play the digital audio
   recording of the requested court hearing.
   We feel that you will be quite pleased with the quality of the digital
   audio recorded sound playback, and that after you try the CD format,
   you will agree that the CD product is far superior to the cassette tape
   recordings. However, should you prefer cassette tapes, we also can
   provide a copy of the court hearing record in this format.
   Up to eight hours of a hearing held on one date can be provided on one
   CD. Up to Ninety (90) minutes of a hearing held on one date can be
   provided on one cassette tape. The cost of either one CD or one
   cassette tape is $20.00 each..
   For additional information on how to order a CD digital audio recording
   or cassette tape recording, you may call the Electronic Court Recording
   Department at 702-388-6587 in Las Vegas, and 775-784-5023 x114 in Reno.
