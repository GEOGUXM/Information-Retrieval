                                  Objective

   To introduce students majoring in physics to the current methods and
   problems of high energy physics research. A small number of students
   from closely related disciplines such as computer science or
   engineering are also accepted into the program.

                                 Description

   The summer intern program for physics honors students is aimed at
   outstanding college physics students who desire an opportunity to
   experience a working Laboratory environment. We award about 20
   internships per year depending on funding. The program is open to both
   U.S. and foreign students who have completed at least one year of
   undergraduate studies. Students continue to be eligible through the end
   of their senior year of studies.  No student can participate in the
   program more than once. Also, students who have begun graduate studies
   are not eligible.

   Once a student is accepted into the program, she or he is matched up
   with a physicist working at the Laboratory who has a project suitable
   for a summer intern. The projects are closely related to physics
   experiments or computing for physics experiments being carried out at
   the Laboratory. Occasionally students studying in fields closely
   related to physics are accepted into the program if it is thought that
   they could contribute to the ongoing research activities of the
   Laboratory.

   Each intern will receive a stipend based on the number of years of
   schooling the student has completed. In addition, the Laboratory will
   arrange for a shared apartment or dormitory room for all interns who
   require accommodations. Interns are also free to make their own housing
   arrangements. In either case, interns are expected to pay their housing
   costs. Transportation is provided in the form of rental cars that are
   shared by several students. It is also possible to bring personal
   automobiles.
