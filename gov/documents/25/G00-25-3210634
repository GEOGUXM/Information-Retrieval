   Judgment Rate Changes
   In December, Congress enacted the Omnibus Appropriation Act (PL
   106-554) that contained, among its various provisions, amendments to
   the federal statutes dealing with the interest rate on federal
   judgments.28 U.S.C. §1961, 18 U.S.C. §3612, and 40 U.S.C. §258(e)(1)
   tie interest rates on judgments to Treasury’s 52 week T-bill interest
   rate. Expecting that Treasury would discontinue auctions of the 52 week
   T-bills in the future, Congress passed legislation to establish a new
   interest rate index that was readily available. Treasury will, in fact,
   discontinue the auction of 52-week T-bills at the end of this month.
   The revised sections took effect on all judgments entered on and after
   December 21, 2000. Only the rate that is applied to judgments has
   changed. All other computational procedures remain the same.
