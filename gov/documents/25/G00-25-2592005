   IMPORTANT NOTICE: The Energy Commission intends to issue a Request for
   Qualifications (RFQ) in the next 30-60 days. This RFQ will solicit
   technical assistance from a team of specialists for the Energy
   Commission staff to augment their current capacity to process energy
   facility licensing applications and conduct energy studies in support
   of the planning and licensing processes. This RFQ is being issued as a
   result of the temporary, but extremely high workload currently being
   expeienced by the Energy Commission and will cover this peak workload
   over the next 1-3 years. Once the RFQ is issued, bidders will have 30
   days to submit a bid. Details on the RFP will be posted on our
   Contracts Information page at www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/

   Prior to 1975, industrial users and utilities were required to go
   through a multi-year process to obtain permits from numerous federal,
   state and local agencies before constructing new power facilities. The
   Legislature revised this process in 1975 and established a
   comprehensive siting process for new energy facilities at the
   California Energy Commission. The Legislature gave the Commission the
   statutory authority to license thermal power plants of 50 megawatts or
   greater and related transmission lines, fuel supply lines, and related
   facilities.
   The purpose of the Systems Assessment and Facilities Siting Division is
   to ensure that needed energy facilities are authorized according to
   this process in an expeditious, safe and environmentally acceptable
   manner. In addition, the division prepares all environmental
   documentation for the Commission as required by the California
   Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). To attain its objectives, the
   division maintains a staff of experts in more than 20 environmental and
   engineering disciplines. The division's range of technical expertise
   allows it to perform balanced, totally independent evaluations of
   complex and controversial projects.

   With a reorganization of the Energy Commission in 2001, the Electricity
   Office (which formally was part of the old Energy Information and
   Analysis Division) was moved to the Systems Assessment and Facilities
   Siting Division. The division is organized into four offices:
     * Electricity Office
     * Engineering Office
     * Environmental Office
     * Siting Office

                   Energy Facilities Compliance Monitoring

       Projects that have been certified by the Energy Commission are
   monitored throughout construction, operation and closure to ensure that
     the owners comply with all conditions of certification. Additional
   post-certification compliance activities include processing amendments
   for changes to projects, handling complaints and processing requests to
                               close projects.
