Welcome!

   Welcome to the NASA's Instrument and Sensing Technology Information
   Page. This page contains information on NASA's Instrument and Sensing
   Technology development programs.

   Note: As part of the continued restructuring of NASA headquarters, the
   former Spacecraft Systems Division has merged into the Advanced
   Technology and Mission Studies Division of the Office of Space Science.
   This page still includes links, information, and references to the
   Commercial Remote Sensing program, now the responsibility of the Office
   of Mission to Planet Earth.

   The Instrument and Sensing Technology program addresses the goals of
   the Space Technology Enterprise (of the NASA Strategic Plan, Feb. '96
   edition) by seeking to:
     * Reduce the size, mass, cost, and complexity of scientific and
       commercial spacecraft instrument payloads, as a step toward
       reducing the cost of access to space for these missions.
     * Provide innovative instrument technologies to enable ambitious,
       future space missions.
     * Build capability in the U.S. space commercial remote sensing
       industry through focused space technology efforts.
     * Share the harvest of space instrument technology endeavors with the
       U.S. industrial community.

   Here are some links to general background information on space sensors,
   instruments, and remote sensing:
     * Remote Sensing Basics from The Observatorium.
     * JPL has an on-line Basics of Space Flight Learners' Workbook.
       Chapter 12 is on Typical Science Instruments. This information is
       based on JPL planetary missions, and does not reflect recent
       advances in technology, but it does provide a good background.
     * Expert Definitions of Remote Sensing and Unconventional Definitions
       of Remote Sensing from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing.
     * For a more general background on Satellites see Satellite 101
       (Satellite Technology for Young People) from Hughes Space and
       Communications.
     * Spectroscopy from the Chemistry Department at Virginia Tech
       provides an excellent general overview.
     * The new Electro-Optics Branch Home Page at MSFC has some good
       background information on laser sensing of the earth's atmosphere.
     * Some good general information is available from the Space Science
       Newsgroup through their Space FAQ (frequently asked questions) for
       the sci.space hierarchy. It will soon be split across the newly
       created sci.space.{tech,science,policy} groups, but for now, it's
       being posted to all of them. The sci.space.tech moderator posts a
       more frequent short FAQ with concise answers; this is the place to
       go for more detail and references.
     * Relevant Reports (new and incomplete):
          + Report from the Planetary Surface Instrument Workshop held May
            12-13, 1995, from LPI.
     * See also Additional Information and the Spacecraft Systems Customer
       Needs Page
     * If anyone knows of other links to related, general overview
       sources, please let me know.

   facilitate access, and does not reflect all NASA supported
   competitions, such as competitions funded through a NASA Center, etc.
     * Research Opportunities from the Office of Space Science.
     * Research Announcements from the Office of Mission to Planet Earth.
     * Research Opportunities from the Office of Life and Microgravity
       Sciences and Applications.
     * I have not found a consolidated research oppotrunities page from

Instrument and Sensing Technology Overview

   These have not been updated since August 1994! I've not had time to
   update and correct these overviews recently.
     * The Instrument and Sensing Technology Program Overview is a
       HyperText Markup Language (HTML) version of the standard seven view
       graph overview of the Instrument and Sensing Technology program.
     * Space Instrument Size Drivers. This is an HTML version of a view
       graph presentation listing the major reasons why space-based remote
       sensing instruments are large, and what the options are for
       reducing the mass and/or the size of these instruments.

New Ways of Doing Business

     * The National Performance Review. The quality of service in the
       government is below what the public expects and has a right to
       expect. The majority of the American public believe that the
       government wastes much of what they pay in taxes. The National
       Performance Review is committed to finding a solution to this
       problem.
     * The NASA Commercial Technology Network has recently reworked their
       links, so the following do not work at the moment:
          + The Agenda for Change describes the essence of NASA's new way
            of doing business to support the Agency's commercial
            technology mission objectives. It provides a summary
            description of the various changes needed to successfully
            perform this mission.
          + Partnership Options for NASA and Industry. NASA believes
            quality partnerships with industry can enhance U.S.
            technological competitiveness and help the global economy.

Customer Technology Needs and Mission Plans

   We are beginning to consolidate this information on the Spacecraft
   Systems Customer Needs Page. In addition, see:
     * Space Missions acronym and hyperlink list. Each acronym is an
       anchor, click on EOS or MTPE to see how this works. This is not a
       complete list, and suggested additions are welcome.

       fleet of science platforms, the NASA Office of Aeronautics has
       sponsored a new initiative to support the development of
       technologies which will enable U. S. industry to develop mission
       capable remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) with increased operational
       capabilities while maintaining operational costs at or lower than
       the current fleet of science platforms.
