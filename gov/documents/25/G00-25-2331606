   The table below provides links to other pages that describe the
   hardware triggers that made up the gatemaster/prescaler trigger system.
   The hardware prescaler factor history can be found on the PRUDE www
   page as well as information about the software triggers.

   Links that go no place mean that no one has provided the trigger
   description. The priority of the labelling of an event in the case that
   more than one hardware trigger is satisfied is listed in the PRUDE
   KPRID prioirty table as KPRID = 10 * GM.

   Descriptions of the different MLUs are also available:
     CMLU:Charged MLU.
     PMLU:Phi MLU.
     NMLU:Neutral MLU.
     MMLU:Master MLU.
