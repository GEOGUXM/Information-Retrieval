                    COUNTY WARNING AREAS (C-47) SECTION 1

   1. Purpose. This chapter assigns specific county/parish warning area
   (CWA) to field offices for short-fuse hazards (tornadoes, severe
   thunderstorms, and flash floods) as described in WSOM Chapters C-40,
   Severe Local Storm Warnings, and E-20, Flood/Flash Flood Watch and
   Warning Program.

   "Adjoining coastal waters" assignments for short-fuse severe
   thunderstorm/ tornado and special marine warnings and stand-alone
   special marine warnings are determined with reference to coastal
   landmarks of CWAs. See WSOM Chapter D-51, Marine Services for Coastal,
   Offshore, and High Seas, and WSOM Chapter D-52, Marine Services for the
   Great Lakes, for details.

   In addition, any field office with a CWA along coastlines where
   hurricanes may threaten shall issue Hurricane Local Statements as
   appropriate according to WSOM Chapter C-41, Hurricane Warnings.

   Also, any field office can issue followup statements for either
   short-fuse or longer-fuse events for all or part of its CWA from the
   following product categories. See WSOM Chapters C-21 (Local and
   Regional Statements, Summaries, and Tables), C-42 (Winter Weather
   Warnings), C-43 (Coastal Flood Warnings), C-44 (Non-Precipitation
   Weather Warnings), C-40, E-20, D-51, and D-52, as indicated, for
   details.

     Special Weather Statements (C-21, C-40, C-41, C-42, C-44)
     Severe Weather Statements (C-21, C-40, C-42, C-44)
     Public Information Statements (C-21)
     Short-Term Forecasts (C-21)
     Coastal Flood Statements (C-43)
     Flash Flood Statements (E-20)
     Marine Weather Statements (D-51, D-52)
     Local Storms Reports (C-40)
     Civil Emergency Messages (C-44)

   Furthermore, non-forecasting field offices may, under infrequent backup
   circumstances, issue Winter Weather Warnings (C-42), Non-Precipitation
   Warnings (C-44), Lakeshore Warnings (D-52), and Coastal Flood Warnings
   (C-43) within their CWA. See the appropriate chapters for details.

   As the National Weather Service (NWS) proceeds with the modernization
   and associated restructuring (MAR), CWAs will change. Guidance outlined
   in this chapter will be valid through Stage 1 of the MAR which is
   characterized by the introduction of the Doppler weather surveillance
   radar (WSR-88D), which was developed by the Next Generation Weather
   Radar (NEXRAD) program, and the

   Automated Surface Observing System.

   2. CWA Assignments. The CWAs are designated by counties/parishes (or
   parts thereof) and independent cities surrounding an office without
   regard to state boundaries. In Alaska, assignments are made using
   topographical, political, or organizational boundaries. Full
   consideration is given as to which office is most capable for warning
   the area populace.

   3. Weather Service Headquarters (WSH) Responsibilities. The Operations
   Division of the Office of Meteorology (OM) shall approve all county
   warning assignments for Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO) and
   Weather Service Offices (WSO) that are not related to the MAR. Warning
   assignments for NEXRAD WSOs (NWSO) and NEXRAD WSFOs (NWSFO) shall be
   approved through the Transition Program Office (TPO) Change Management
   Process.

   4. Regional Headquarters Responsibilities. Each Regional Headquarters
   should review the CWA assignments in their region, consulting with
   field offices to improve the effectiveness and balance of warning
   assignments. Assignment guidelines for NEXRAD offices are listed in
   appendix A. When changes are required, Regional Headquarters shall
   forward in writing to WSH any recommended changes.

   5. Field Office Responsibilities. Field offices may recommend changes
   in CWA assignments to Regional Headquarters. Each designated office has
   primary responsibility for arranging distribution of weather watches
   and warnings for its counties/parishes or other designated areas as
   listed in appendix A.

   6. Assignment Guidelines for Modernized Offices. The factors shown
   below were used to develop CWA assignments for NEXRAD offices. These
   factors should be used for any proposed changes to the CWAs of NEXRAD
   offices. The CWA factors include forecast considerations since CWAs and
   forecast areas will become coincident later in the MAR as NWSOs and
   NWSFOs become Weather Forecast Offices (WFO).

   The following are the primary factors that formed the general outline
   of the CWAs listed in order of importance.

     a. WSR-88D coverage below 4,000 feet elevation.

   b. WSR-88D coverage below 10,000 feet elevation.

   c. Recognized metropolitan areas.

   d. Forecast considerations (coastal responsibilities, geography,
   general climatology).

   e. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio
   coverage.

   f. Area of dominate influence (media market).

   g. Local flood warning systems.

   The following are the factors used to refine the general outline of the
   CWAs.

     a. Specialized data collection networks.

   b. Spotter networks.

   c. Local and regional emergency management areas.

   d. Local climatological factors.

   e. Work load considerations.

   f. Identification of local citizens with metropolitan areas.

   Since the final configuration of WFOs in the modernized NWS is
   predicated primarily by WSR-88D coverage, forecast factors, and
   dissemination factors, state boundaries should only be used if there is
   a compelling need. Also, regional boundaries should not be considered
   as a factor in reassigning counties. Each region should coordinate the
   county assignments in the border NEXRAD offices with the adjacent
   regions. It is permissible to split a county between two NEXRAD offices
   if the factors indicate that this is needed.

   7. Strategy for Transition to Final NEXRAD Office CWA Assignments. The
   following are the implementation assumptions and strategies used for
   CWA changes related to the transition to the final NEXRAD office CWA
   realignment. This strategy is also included in the Public Service
   Transition Plan.

     * Regional and local management, in coordination with OM, shall
       reassign counties only once during the transition (i.e., there will
       be no temporary assignments of counties to an office that will not
       have final warning responsibility for that county). A given
       office's CWA responsibility, however, may change several times
       during Stage 1.
     * In general, CWA realignment of a NEXRAD office should occur
       coincident with, but no later than 60 days after the planned date
       of WSR-88D commissioning.

     -- This is true even if the new CWA includes the home county of a
     non-NWSO.

   -- Transfers from a non-NWSO will occur in parts as each adjacent
   NEXRAD office is able to assume these counties. Once all transfers are
   completed, the non-NWSO will no longer have any CWA responsibility.

     -- The NEXRAD office will retain responsibility for any counties
     that are in its original pre-Stage 1 CWA that are targeted
     eventually to go to an adjacent NEXRAD office.

     * The exceptions to the above implementation strategy are the
       following.

     -- At an office that is an Associated User of a Department of
     Defense (DOD) WSR-88D, it may not be feasible to transfer that part
     of the CWA under the DOD radar umbrella within 60 days following
     commissioning. Reasons may include the fact that the office's own
     NWS WSR-88D is not yet available or that the staff is not adequately
     trained. Regional Directors together with the impacted office's
     management, on a case-by-case basis, will determine the appropriate
     time to transfer this CWA.

   -- At an office receiving a DOD Associated Principal User Processor
   during severe weather season, transfer of that part of the CWA may be
   delayed beyond 60 days even though its NWS WSR-88D is commissioned .

     * The regions also will determine, on a case-by-case basis during
       this transition to Stage 1, any other exceptions to the timing of
       the transfer of the CWA of the non-NWSO due to any of the following
       factors.

     -- Availability of radar data and staffing; extent of the remaining
     CWA; the time that will elapse between the commissioning of the
     first and last WSR-88D that affects the CWA; and whether the
     nonNEXRAD office loses its home county early or late in the
     transition of its CWA.

   -- In the Alaska Region, those locations that will not come under the
   coverage of the WSR-88D will not have their local programs (e.g., NWR,
   warnings, forecasts, hydrology, etc.) transferred until Initial Stage 2
   (availability of Advanced Weather Interactive Processing Systems) when
   non-NWSOs are downsized to data Collection Offices.

   8. Implementation Procedures for CWA Assignment Changes. The following
   approval and notification procedures shall be followed in sequence. For
   CWA changes related to the NAR CWA baseline maintained by TPO's Change
   Management Program, preliminary notifications and actions (including
   adjustments to spotter and communications systems) shall begin at least
   60 days in advance of

   transfer of CWA responsibilities. See WSOM Chapter C-49, Warning
   Coordination and Hazard Preparedness Program, and the Public Service
   Transition Plan for further details. Proposed changes to the MAR CWA
   baseline shall be submitted to TPO, who must approve them before any
   implementation procedures can begin.

   a. If the CWA change is related to the TPO's MAR baseline, Regional
   Headquarters sends ON's Operations Division a draft letter of
   notification to users. For non-MAR CWA changes, Regional Headquarters
   sends to OM's Operations Division a request for change and the draft
   letter of notification. The draft letter of notification to users
   should detail changes to different codes and product identifiers for
   counties transferred to another office's CWA. The draft letter should
   be very similar to the examples at the end of this section.

   b. OM's Operations Division reviews the draft letter of the approved
   CWA change and coordinates with Regional Headquarters (and for MAR CWA
   changes, TPO also) on any needed modifications and/or corrections to
   the letter. An effective date for the change shall be mutually agreed
   to by OM's Operations Division and Regional Headquarters (and for MAR
   CWA changes, TPO also) allowing at least 60 days notice to users.

   c. OM disseminates the finalized notification letter to national users
   by mail, the Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) system,
   NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS), and the Family of Services (FOS)
   circuits at least 60 days before the effective date of change.
   Concurrently, field offices notify affected local users. Notifications
   on AFOS should be done using the AFOS product categories "Public
   Information Statement" (PNS) or Administrative Message.

   d. Regional Headquarters shall issue a Regional Operations Manual
   Letter to this chapter. OM's Operations Division shall issue official
   page changes to appendix A to this chapter on a quarterly basis and a
   revised appendix A in its entirety on an annual basis.

   Example 1 of draft letter prepared by Regional Headquarters
   transferring inland areas to an office that is not the area's forecast
   office:

   Dear National Weather Service Product User:

     Effective_________ at _______Central ________Time, the National
     Weather Service (NWS) will transfer short-fuse warning
     responsibility for six counties in western Kansas (Table 1) TO the
     Dodge City (DDC), Kansas Weather Service Office FROM the Goodland
     (GLD), Kansas WSO. For these counties, WSO DDC will issue short-fuse
     warning products (Table 2) and related products that give followup
     information on the warnings (Table 3). For holders of NWS Operations
     Manual Chapter C-47, County Warning Areas, this transfer is the
     update of the latest chapter issuance.

   Because of this county warning transfer, subscribers to the NOAA
   Weather Wire Service (NWWS) and the Family of Services (FOS) must take
   appropriate action to receive the short-fuse warnings and related
   products for these six counties using the DDC identifier (Tables 2 and
   3) instead of the GLD identifier. The Universal Generic Codes (UGC) for
   the counties, however, will remain unchanged (as shown in Table 1).

   Example 2 of draft letter prepared by Regional Headquarters
   transferring areas to the forecasting office (including coastal areas):

   Dear National Weather Service Product User:

     Effective ______ at _____Eastern ______Time, the National Weather
     Service (NWS) will transfer short-fuse warning responsibility for
     several counties, independent cities, and any adjoining coastal
     waters (Table 1) TO the Washington/Baltimore (WBC) Weather Service
     Forecast Office (WSFO) FROM Weather Service Offices (WSO) in
     Baltimore MD (BWI), Richmond VA (RIC), and Elkins WV (EKN). This
     transfer will give WSFO WBC total short-fuse marine warning
     responsibility for the northern half of the Chesapeake Bay including
     the Potomac River, north of a line generally from Pocomoke Sound to
     Smith Point.

   For these counties, cities, and coastal waters, WSFO WBC will issue
   short-fuse warnings (Table 2) and related products that give followup
   information on the warnings (Table 3). For holders of NWS Operations
   Manual Chapter C-47, County Warning Areas, this transfer is the
   ____update of the latest chapter issuance.

   Because of this transfer, subscribers to the NOAA Weather Wire Service
   (NWWS) and the Family of Services (FOS) must take appropriate action to
   receive the short-fuse warnings and related products for these
   counties, cities, and adjoining coastal waters using the WBC identifier
   (Tables 2 and 3) instead of the BWI, RIC, or EKN identifiers. The
   Universal Generic Codes (UGC) for the counties and cities, however,

   9. Backup Assignments. All assigned areas shall be provided with
   continuous warning service. There are three types of situations
   requiring backup. Policy for dealing with each is outlined in sections
   9.1 through 9.3. All offices issuing products/messages for another
   office in a backup operation shall issue the products as if they were
   the primary office assigned the county or counties. Communications
   codes for short-fuse warnings and related statements shall be those of
   the primary office. Station identifiers for the primary office shall be
   followed by the identifier of the backup office in the mass media
   header. More than one backup office may be designated if geographic or
   observational factors would make it difficult or impossible for a
   single designated office alone to provide backup.

   ISSUED BY ST. LOUIS
   600 PM CDT MON JUN 14 1992

     (message describes tornado warning for Randolph County Missouri
     until 6:30 p.m. CDT)

   9.1 Offices with Permanently Established Limited Hours of Operation.
   Pre-transition offices with limited hours of operation (given in WSOM
   Chapter A-12, Station Hours of Operation) shall have an assigned backup
   office which assumes its duties when that office is closed. Changes in
   the backup office assignment may be made by the Regional Headquarters
   following the directions given in section 8.

   9.2 Offices with Temporary Limited Hours of Operation. Due to staff
   shortages or other problems, an office may be assigned limited hours of
   operation for temporary periods. When this occurs, the documents
   authorizing the reduction of hours and/or service shall contain an
   assignment of a full time office as backup. This assignment shall be
   made by the Regional Director after coordination with the OM's
   Operations Division.

   9.3 Emergency Service Backup. There will be occasions when emergency
   conditions, such as fire, bomb threat, and equipment failure among
   others, require the immediate termination of service from an otherwise
   normally operational office. Under these conditions, the office
   affected should follow the regionally established service backup plan
   outlined in appropriate regional instructions.
