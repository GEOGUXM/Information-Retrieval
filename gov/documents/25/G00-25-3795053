   IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT IN RE:
   CHARLOTTE BLACKWELL : AND D. MICHAEL FISHER, : Petitioners :: v. : No.
   : LISA MICHELLE LAMBERT, : Respondent :: THE HONORABLE STEWART :
   DALZELL, : Nominal Respondent : PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
   Petitioners, CHARLOTTE BLACKWELL, and D. MICHAEL FISHER, who are the
   named respondents in Lambert v. Blackwell, et al., Civil Action No.
   01-CV-2511, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, hereby
   respectfully move the Court pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. §
   1651 and F.R.A.P. 21, for a writ of mandamus directing the district
   court to recuse itself from any further participation in that matter.1
   As set forth more fully below, in an order filed on November 21, 2001,2
   the district court refused to take such action and the intervention of
   this Court is necessary. I. Introduction 1For convenience, petitioners,
   who are, respectively, the superintendent of the New Jersey prison in
   which Lambert is serving her sentence, and the Attorney General of
   Pennsylvania, will be referred to in this petition as "the
   Commonwealth." 2Copies of the district court's memorandum and order
   appear in the Addendum to this petition. Other relevant record
   materials are contained in a separately-bound Appendix which is being
   filed with this petition. The appendix, which contains a table of
   contents, will be cited here as "App." Since many of the record
   documents relevant here were appended to the memorandum in support of
   the motion for recusal which was filed in the district court, we are
   including that motion and its supporting memorandum in toto in the
   appendix along with Lambert's response to the same. The case with
   respect to which the Commonwealth now asks the Court to issue a writ of
   mandamus (No. 01-CV-2511 (E.D. Pa.), is action in habeas corpus brought
   by Pennsylvania prisoner, Lisa Michelle Lambert, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
   § 2254. An earlier habeas case by the same prisoner was previously
   before the Court. Lambert v. Blackwell, 962 F.Supp 1521 (E.D. Pa.
   1997), vacated, 134 F.3d 506 (3d Cir. 1997), cert denied, ___ U.S. ___,
   121 S.Ct. 1353 (2001)(vacating district court's order granting habeas
   relief).3 See also Lambert v. Blackwell, 116 F.3d 468 (3d Cir.
   1997)(appeal of district court's denial of motion to stay petitioner's
   release); Lambert v. Blackwell, 164 F.3d 621 (3d Cir. 1998)(en
   banc)(vacating order of panel granting bail pending application for
   certiorari).4 On May 21, 2001, Lambert began this new habeas action,
   which was assigned to the same member of the district court who had
   handled her earlier action. (App. 1)(where the docket sheets for
   Lambert II are included). On June 14, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a
   motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), for recusal of the assigned
   judge. (App. 4-212) In its motion, the Commonwealth maintained that
   because of what had transpired in connection with Lambert's prior
   attempt to secure habeas relief, reasonable persons would question the
   district court's impartiality in her new case and, therefore, the court
   should recuse itself. (Ibid.) The Commonwealth also asked the district
   judge to defer taking other action in this case pending a ruling on
   that motion to recuse. (App. 2) He declined to do so. (App. 3)
   3Lambert's previous case, which was docketed in the district court at
   No. 96-CV-6244, will be referred to here as Lambert I, and her case
   which is now in the district court as Lambert II. 4The decision of the
   Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County which denied state post-
   conviction relief and was affirmed by Superior Court is not officially
   reported but may be found on WESTLAW at 1998 WL 558749 (Pa.C.P. Aug.
   24, 1998). 2 On November 21, 2001, the district court issued an order
   which, inter alia, denied the Commonwealth's motion for recusal. See
   Addendum. The district court's ruling in this regard, which simply
   adopted its ruling on a motion for recusal filed in Lambert I,
   completely ignored the appropriate standard for determining if recusal
   is warranted, which this Court has repeatedly reiterated in its
   jurisprudence, whether, given all that has transpired, whether persons
   would question his impartiality. The Commonwealth now files this
   petition for writ of mandamus seeking review of the district court's
   refusal to recuse itself in this action.5 II. Relevant Facts &
   Procedural History 1. Lambert began her previous habeas action, Lambert
   I, on September 12, 1996, with the filing of a pro se petition for such
   relief. (App. 33)(Petition, filed Sept. 12, 1996)(Record Document 1).6
   2. The district court appointed counsel, who filed an amended petition
   on January 3, 1997, along with a motion to conduct discovery. (App.
   3-34)(Record Documents 5 and 6). Three days later, before respondents7
   had made any response to the petition, the district court scheduled a
   status 5The Court's jurisprudence indicates that this is the proper
   procedural path to follow, see, e.g., Antar v. Antar, 71 F.3d 97 (3d
   Cir. 1995); Alexander v. Primerica Holdings, 10 F.3d 155 (3d Cir.
   1993); accord Madden v. Myers, 102 F.3d 74, 78 (3d Cir. 1996). 6Copies
   of the docket sheets for Lambert I are included in the appendix at
   pages 33-48. As the appendix reflects, the docket sheets were one of
   the appendices to the motion for recusal filed in the district court.
   In citing to the same, we will identify the particular document(s) to
   which reference is being made. In this part, references are to the
   documents of record in Lambert I, unless otherwise specifically
   indicated. 7Lambert I involved the same respondents as Lambert II.
   Accordingly, for convenience, we will refer to them here as "the
   Commonwealth." 3 conference for January 15, 1997. (App. 34)(Record
   Documents 7 and 8). During that conference, without having received and
   reviewed a response to the petition, the district court granted
   Lambert's motion for discovery, and following the conference, issued an
   order to such effect. (App. 35)(Order of Jan. 16, 1997)(Record Document
   15). In other orders issued the same day, the district court scheduled
   a second status conference for February 13, 1997, the day after the
   response to the petition was due, and again before any response to the
   petition had been filed or reviewed, the district court specially
   listed this case for a hearing to begin March 31, 1997. (App.
   35)(Record Documents 14 and 16).8 3. During the January 15, 1997,
   conference, when counsel for the Commonwealth attempted to point out
   that decisions on discovery and whether a hearing will be held should
   be made upon a review of the pleadings filed by both parties, and after
   the issue of exhaustion was addressed, the district court cut her off
   mid-sentence, telling her she was "dead wrong," (App. 50-53)(Tr.
   1/15/97 Status Conference), that in the "unusual circumstances . . .
   that exist here, I think that's simply wrong . . . ." ( Id.) 4. The
   Commonwealth filed its answer to Lambert's amended petition on February
   12, 1997, in which it formally and properly raised, as a defense, that
   Lambert, a state prisoner, had failed to exhaust her state remedies
   before commencing her habeas action as required by federal law, see 28
   U.S.C. § 2254(b). (App. 35)(Answer to Petition at pp. 4-20)(Record
   Document 20). 8The district court's order was not formulated in
   contingent terms, i.e., that a hearing would be held on the appointed
   date, in the event it were to be determined that such a proceeding
   would be required. 4 5. The day following the filing of the answer to
   the petition,9 the district court convened the second status conference
   as previously scheduled, see ¶ 2, supra, at which time, the
   Commonwealth again raised the exhaustion issue, asserting that it was a
   threshold ruling the district court needed to make before proceeding
   any further. (App. 55-65) (Tr. 2/13/97 Status Conference) Once again,
   citing the "highly unusual circumstances" it considered to exist, the
   court did not proceed to rule on that procedural issue. (Ibid.) 6.
   Rather, it permitted Lambert to continue to conduct extensive
   discovery, including nearly 60 depositions, and appointed numerous
   experts at public expense, see, e.g., (App. 36)(Order of Feb. 13,
   1997)(Record Document 24)(provisionally approving compensation in
   excess of $1000 for each of several experts). 7. Beginning on March 31,
   1997, the district court convened a hearing on the merits of some of
   the claims Lambert had raised, a proceeding which ultimately spanned
   three weeks. Prior to the completion of those proceedings, and before
   the Commonwealth had presented its case, it released Lambert to the
   custody of her attorneys. See (App. 40-41)(Order of April 16,
   1997)(Record Document 68).10 9The answer filed was voluminous,
   consisting of a pleading of 89 pages to which 674 pages of record
   material were attached as exhibits. 10As issued, the district court's
   order reflected that the Commonwealth had agreed that petitioner was
   entitled to immediate interim relief, and that was accurate at the time
   the order was entered. However, that concession was withdrawn the next
   day, (App. 77)(Tr. Of 4/17/97 at p. 2791), something to which this
   Court would point out in the ensuing appeal the district court had not
   given appropriate attention or effect. 134 F.3d 506, 511 n. 11. At the
   time the Commonwealth withdrew its agreement, the District Attorney,
   who was then representing the respondents, moved for the district
   court's recusal, citing inter alia, the fact that the court had
   expressed the view very early in petitioner's case--beginning on the
   third day of testimony to be specific--that certain witnesses were
   committing perjury. See (App.77)(Tr. Of 4/17/97 at pp. 2789-2791). In
   denying that motion, the district court, which just the day before had
   praised the 5 8. The same day, again before the Commonwealth had an
   opportunity to present its case, the Court also entered an order
   barring the assistant district attorney from Lancaster County who had
   prosecuted Lambert's case, and seven police officers who had worked on
   it, from entering the federal courthouse. See (App. 41)(Order of April
   16, 1997)(Record Document 70). 9. The first business day after the
   hearing had ended, the district court issued a ninety-page opinion, in
   which it condemned, in the strongest terms possible, Lambert's
   prosecution and conviction in the Lancaster County Court of Common
   Pleas, concluding that, in terms of prosecutorial misconduct, it had no
   peer in the annals of English-speaking jurisprudence. See 962 F. Supp.
   1521, 1550 n. 42 (E.D. Pa. 1997). 10. The district court's opinion not
   just discredited--but repeatedly railed--at the testimony of police
   witnesses and the assistant district attorney who had prosecuted
   Lambert, at times calling what it heard from them "lies" and "perjury."
   See, e.g.: <<< id. at 1541 ("[Det.] Barley committed perjury at Lisa
   Lambert's trial and [Officer] Reed almost certainly committed perjury
   before us and at his deposition"); <<< id. at n. 31 ("Barley's apparent
   perjury continued, in our view, in his testimony before us . . ."); <<<
   id. at 1542 ("[i]n some of his fantastic testimony before us, Chief
   Detective Solt claimed . . ."); <<< id. at n. 32 ("[t]here is a line in
   a witness's testimony between exaggeration and perjury. Chief County
   Detective Solt's testimony . . . seems to us to have gone well beyond
   that line . . ."); District Attorney for his candor and ethical
   behavior, said that it "had thought that [the District Attorney] and
   his colleague [i.e, his co-counsel in the habeas case] were in a
   different class than what we've heard before, and I regret to say that
   I have to reconsider that view." See (App.78)(Tr. of 4/17/97 at p.
   2795). 6 <<< id. at 1546 (referring to "a moment of unguarded candor"
   on the part of a medical expert presented by the Commonwealth); <<< id.
   at 1547 ("[n]othing can equal Mr. Kenneff's steadfast refusal to
   retract his lies to us about the use of `pencil' on the `29' Questions,
   both under oath on the witness stand . . . and in his assertions . . .
   [in] Respondent's Answer"); <<< id. at 1549 (calling the assistant
   district attorney's testimony relative to a Brady11 issue "a fantasy");
   <<< id. at 1550-51 (where the court summarized what it said were "so
   many instances of grave prosecutorial [and other] misconduct"); <<< id.
   at 1548 ("[a]gain, Mr. Kenneff was indifferent to the law, because it
   impeded his conviction of Lisa Lambert"). 11. The Court said that it
   had determined that there were at least twenty-five separate instances
   of such misconduct. In our view, a District Justice of the Commonwealth
   of Pennsylvania, former Detective Savage, may have committed perjury
   before us and obstructed justice in 1992. . . . Other witnesses in the
   state capital murder trial, including Chief County Detective Solt,
   Detective Barley, Lieutenant Renee Schuler, and Officers Weaver, Reed
   and Bowman, fabricated and destroyed crucial evidence and likely
   perjured themselves in the state proceeding. At least six seemed to
   perjure themselves before us. Agents of the Commonwealth intimidated
   witnesses both in the capital murder trial as well as in this habeas
   corpus proceeding. The prosecutor who tried the Lambert case and sought
   [her] execution knowingly used perjured testimony and presided over
   dozens of Brady-Giglio[12] violations, may have committed perjury, and
   unquestionably violated the Rules of Professional Conduct before our
   very eyes. Id. at 1550. It went on to say that as to District Justice
   Savage and First Assistant District Attorney Kenneff, Chief County
   Detective Solt, Detective Barley, Lieutenant 11Brady v. Maryland, 373
   U.S. 83 (1963). 12Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972). 7
   Schuler and Officers Weaver, Reed and Bowman, as well as the others in
   active connivance with them, we can only say that they should have
   known better than what they did--and tried to do--to Lisa Lambert. Id.
   at 1553. 12. What's more, at its end, the opinion proceeded to take the
   greater Lancaster community to task saying that it had closed ranks
   behind the good family [of victim Laurie] Show and exacted revenge
   against this supposed villainess . . . In making a pact with this
   devil, Lancaster County made a Faustian Bargain [sic]. It lost its soul
   and it almost executed an innocent, abused woman. Its legal edifice now
   in ashes, we can only hope for a Witness-like barn- raising of the
   temple of justice. Id. at 1555. 13. The district court did not simply
   reject the testimony of the assistant district attorney and police
   witnesses mentioned, supra, but it referred these individuals for
   investigation by the United States Attorney and/or judicial and
   attorney disciplinary authorities in Pennsylvania.13 In its opinion,
   the court identified the various criminal charges which it believed the
   U.S. Attorney should investigate: "witness intimidation, apparent
   perjury by at least five witnesses in a federal proceeding, and
   possible violations of the federal criminal civil rights laws." Id. at
   1550. Elsewhere, in its opinion, the district court mentioned
   "obstruction of justice," as well as the fabrication and/or
   13Repeatedly, throughout its opinion, the district court referred to
   what it called the prosecutor's "blatantly unethical (and
   unconstitutional) actions," 962 F.Supp. at 1550, and said that there
   had been "indubitable violations of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and of the Rules of
   Professional Conduct . . . ." Id. at 1551. It wrote disparagingly of
   "the degree of Mr. Kenneff's bravado and incorrigibility on the issue
   of [certain of his ethical obligations] . . . was dramatically
   illustrated . . ." during testimony he gave at the habeas hearing. Id.
   at 1540. See also id. at 1547 n. 39 (where the Court lists various
   examples of the prosecutor's alleged indifference and/or "egregious
   misconduct" relative to his ethical obligations and refers to what it
   says was his "animus before us in pre-trial proceedings," which, it
   said, "suggest[ed] not only a lack of remorse but incorrigibility"). 8
   destruction of evidence. Id. at 1551.14 14. In equally emphatic terms,
   the district court credited the testimony of Lambert as exuding
   "punctilious honesty," id. at 1534, ultimately concluding that she was
   actually innocent of Laurie Show's murder, id. at 1528-1535, 1551, and
   that "virtually all of the evidence which the Commonwealth [had] used
   to convict [her] of first degree murder was either perjured, altered,
   or fabricated." Id. at 1550. "The fact is," it said, "the Commonwealth
   rigged the proceedings in the state trial to such an extent that it was
   a trial in name only." Id. at 1551. 15. Lambert was, in the district
   court's words, "first and foremost" of victims for whom "the long
   nightmare that began in her teens is ending," and commented that it
   would, "take much more than the granting of her petition to heal the
   wounds and banish the demons that have for so long hurt and haunted
   her." Id. of 1552. 16. In the appeal which followed from the district
   court's order granting Lambert relief in habeas corpus, this Court
   concluded that the district court had erred in entertaining her
   petition; that she was obliged to exhaust her state remedies prior to
   proceeding in federal court. See 134 F.3d 506 (1997). 17. The Court
   vacated the district's order and remanded with the direction that it
   dismiss Lambert's petition without prejudice. Id. at 525. 18. The
   district court eventually did this on February 3, 1998, (App. 46)(Order
   of Feb. 3, 1998)(Record Document 131), but not before requiring the
   parties to submit briefs addressing several 14Contrary to the district
   court's impassioned assessment of their purportedly criminal and/or
   unethical misbehavior, those investigations did not reach the same
   conclusions. No charges, criminal, disciplinary, or otherwise, were
   ever initiated against any of the individuals castigated in the
   district court's opinion. 9 questions, including whether or not it was
   precluded, by this Court's ruling vacating its judgment and directing
   dismissal of the petition, from taking further action in the case. See
   Order of January 30, 1998 (Record Document 129). 19. Lambert filed a
   petition pursuant to the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42
   Pa.C.S. §§ 9541 et seq. ("PCRA"), in state court on February 2, 1998,
   in connection with which a hearing was begun on April 30, 1998 in
   Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas. See Commonwealth v. Lambert,
   No. 423-1992 (Lanc. Co.). 20. She filed a motion in this Court asking
   for release on bail during the pendency of the petition for certiorari
   she had filed with the United States Supreme Court seeking review of
   the Court's ruling vacating the district court's order granting habeas
   relief.15 21. While the state court post-conviction proceedings, for
   which Lambert was present in Lancaster, PA, were ongoing, on May 6,
   1998, a two-judge panel of this Court issued an order granting an
   application Lambert had filed with it seeking her release on bail
   during the pendency of petition for writ of certiorari she had filed in
   the United States Supreme Court. That order also provided that the
   matter was remanded to the district court for consideration of the
   terms and conditions of Lambert's release. See (App. 89-90)(where a
   copy of the order appears). 22. An hour after the issuance of the
   Court's order, without contacting the state court conducting the
   post-conviction proceedings, the district court faxed an order fixing a
   hearing on bail for May 8, 1998, and issued a writ directing the
   Commonwealth to deliver her immediately to the 15Lambert's petition was
   filed in the Supreme Court on April 28, 1998. 10 custody of the Court
   in Philadelphia. See (App. 91)(where a copy of that order appears).16
   Lambert was moved on May 7, 1998, in accordance with that order and a
   subsequent order of May 7, 1998, (App. 46)(Record Document 135),
   clarifying that Lambert was to be delivered to representatives of the
   U.S. Marshal's Office.17 23. Later on May 7, 1998, however, this Court
   stayed the May 6, 1998, order of the two- judge panel pending the
   filing of a petition for rehearing en banc. (App. 92) Though this order
   was personally delivered to the district court's chambers at once by
   this Court's staff and was reviewed, the district court nevertheless
   still required the parties to appear as scheduled the next morning. 24.
   This Court subsequently granted rehearing, vacated the panel order of
   May 6, 1998, which had granted Lambert bail, and denied her
   application. See (App. 93-95)(Orders of May 15, 1998 and August 3, 1998
   (3d Cir.)). 25. On August 24, 1998, after eight weeks of testimony by
   nearly 100 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits, the state court denied
   Lambert's petition for post-conviction relief. In its 323- page
   opinion, claim after claim, it rejected Lambert's allegations on the
   merits in no uncertain terms, including claims that the district court
   had seen her way, pointing out in several instances, that when the
   district court had ruled in her favor it had less than the complete
   picture. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 1998 WL 558749 (Pa.C.P. Aug. 24,
   1998). 16As the documents in the appendix reflect, this Court's ruling
   was faxed at 16:59 hours on May 6, 1998; the district court's order
   setting a bail hearing for May 8, 1998--and ordering her immediate
   transfer "to the custody of the Court"--was faxed at 17:55 hours. (App.
   89-91) It appears that this latter order is not docketed correctly in
   this case. Although it was issued and is dated May 6th, the docket
   reflects its issuance and entry on May 7th. See (App. 46)(Record
   Document 134). 17This, of course, served to bring the then-ongoing
   state court proceedings to a complete halt. 11 26. On September 21,
   1998, Lambert appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. 27. On
   March 29, 1999, when she served her brief on the merits in that appeal,
   she also filed motion in the district court asking leave to file a
   second amended habeas petition. (Record Document 145). In her proposed
   new petition, Lambert asserted that she should be permitted to proceed
   in federal court based on the "futility" exception to the exhaustion
   requirement, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (b)(1)(B)(i), asserting that she
   could not get a fair hearing of her claims in the Commonwealth's
   courts, making exhaustion of state remedies a futile exercise. 28. The
   very next day, on March 30, 1999, the district court directed the
   Commonwealth to reply to what Lambert had filed by April 15, 1999.
   (Record Document 146). When they did, they pointed out, inter alia,
   that the court did not have any authority to entertain Lambert's
   request; put simply, given this Court's clear instruction to dismiss
   her petition, there was nothing to amend.18 The district court took no
   action on Lambert's motion to file a second amended petition. 29. On
   December 18, 2000, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania ruled on
   Lambert's appeal from the denial of her application for PCRA, and
   affirmed the denial of the same. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 765 A.2d 306
   (Pa. Super. 2000). Lambert took no steps to seek review of Superior
   Court's ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 30. On January 29,
   2001, Lambert filed a request that the district court permit her to
   file a third amended habeas petition. (App. 47)(Record Document 154).
   Once again, the very next day, 18The Commonwealth also maintained that
   given this Court's ruling that Lambert must exhaust state procedural
   options, which was now the law of the case, she could not initiate
   another premature action in habeas. In a supplemental filing, the
   Commonwealth likewise mentioned that, given the way in which Lambert
   had structured her new pleading, it appeared to be a second or
   successive petition which was subject to the "gatekeeper" provisions
   instituted by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
   ("AEDPA"), see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A)-(E), which required her to
   apply successfully to this Court for leave to proceed before the
   district court entertain it. 12 the district court ordered the parties
   to submit their views as to whether this may be entertained and the
   parties did this on February 16, 2001. See (App. 47)(Record Document
   155). As they previously had said in response to Lambert's request to
   file a second amended petition, respondents reiterated that there was
   no longer any petition to be amended since it had been dismissed with
   prejudice by the court on February 3, 1998, as directed by this Court.
   They also pointed out that, given the pendency of the petition for
   certiorari, the district court could not act on Lambert's motion. 31.
   On February 21, 2001, the district court issued a memorandum and order
   which indicated that it would defer any action on that request pending
   a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the Lambert's petition for
   certiorari. See (App.97-104) (where a copy of that order appears). 32.
   On February 23, 2001, the Commonwealth moved for the Court's recusal in
   Lambert I. (App. 47)(Record Document 160)19 33. On March 19, 2001, the
   Supreme Court denied Lambert's petition for certiorari. 34.
   Notwithstanding the fact that Lambert I was conclusively ended by that
   action,20 the district court, on April 20, 2001, proceeded to rule on
   the recusal motion, denying it. See (App.106- 122) (where a copy of the
   district court's ruling appears). 35. On April 30, 2001, the
   Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court's
   order of April 20, 2001, in which they pointed out that, at the time
   the court acted on the 19The Commonwealth's motion indicated (at p. 2
   n.3 of the supporting memorandum filed with the motion) that it was
   being filed to put the issue before the district court when and if
   Lambert I returned to it. At the time the motion was filed, the
   petition for certiorari was still pending and, accordingly, there
   existed the possibility that Lambert I might return to the Court as the
   result of action by the Supreme Court on the same. 20Because the
   mandate had issued following this Court's vacatur of the district
   court's ruling granting relief, and had been acted on, there was no
   reason for the case to return to the district court following the
   denial of certiorari. 13 recusal motion, it had become moot since the
   denial of petition for certiorari had terminated Lambert I. (App.
   48)(Record Document 164) 36. On May 11, 2001, the Court declined to
   vacate its ruling, eschewing "whatever technical merit [their motion]
   might have . . . ." See (App. 124-131)(where a copy of that order
   appears). 37. In the same order, the district court also directed
   Lambert to re-file her third amended petition as a new action by May
   21, 2001, and directed the parties to submit memoranda in that new
   action addressing certain questions on or before July 16, 2001.21 (App.
   130-131) 38. Lambert re-filed what had been her proposed third amended
   petition in Lambert I, to begin Lambert II on May 21, 2001. (App. 2)
   Shortly thereafter, and before any action had been taken thereon, the
   Commonwealth moved on June 14, 2001, for the district court's recusal
   pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). (Id.) 39. When the district court had
   not acted on the motion for recusal by July 9, 2001, the Commonwealth
   moved to defer the submission of memoranda pending a ruling on the
   recusal 21The Court's order directed the parties to submit their views
   as to: (a) The effect of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Order No. 218,
   Jud. Admin. Doc. No. 1 (May 9, 2000) on the exhaustion question; (b)
   The effect of Commonwealth v. Fahy, 558 Pa. 313, 737 A.2d 214 (1999)
   upon the deference, if any, this Court must under the AEDPA accord the
   PCRA Court's findings and conclusions and the Superior Court's
   consideration of such findings and conclusion notwithstanding Fahy; (c)
   The present effect, if any, of this Court's findings and conclusions in
   our April, 1997 adjudication, 962 F.Supp. 1521 (E.D. Pa. 1997); and (d)
   Any other threshold matter either party deems relevant. (App.130-131)
   14 motion. (App. 2-3)(Record Document 5) 40. The district court denied
   that request on July 11, 2001. (App. 3)(Record Document 7) 41. The
   parties submitted their respective memoranda on July 16, 2001. (App.
   3)(Record Documents 8 and 9) In its memorandum, the Commonwealth
   responded to the questions posed by the Court, and under the rubric of
   other significant matters raised two things: the untimeliness of
   Lambert's petition and the unacceptability of the document that
   purported to be her petition for writ of habeas corpus, a submission
   which did not even identify the crime of which she had been
   convicted.22 42. On November 21, 2001, the district court issued an
   order which, inter alia, denied the Commonwealth motion for recusal.
   (App. 3)(Record Document 12); see also Addendum.23 43. In a footnote in
   its accompanying memorandum, the district court briefly referred to the
   motion to recuse, saying it presented no material difference from the
   motion filed in Lambert I and that it was denying the motion for the
   same reasons. See Addendum (Mem. of Nov. 21, 2001 at p. 4 n. 3). 44.
   The Commonwealth now files this petition for writ of mandamus in this
   Court seeking review of that ruling. As set forth in more detail,
   infra, the district court completely ignored the proper legal
   principles which were to inform its decision on the motion to recuse
   and its decision 22Along with its memorandum, the Commonwealth filed a
   motion to dismiss the petition, or in the alternative, to strike the
   petition. (App.3)(Record Document 9) 23The district court's order also
   denied the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss the petition, on the ground
   that it was untimely, and its alternative motion to strike the
   petition, for failing to properly set forth any claim for which habeas
   relief could be granted. See Addendum. 15 constitutes an abuse of
   discretion.24 This court should, therefore, issue a writ of mandamus
   directing the district judge to recuse himself in Lambert's pending
   habeas action. III. This Court Should Issue A Writ of Mandamus
   Directing That The District Court Recuse Itself Because What Has
   Transpired In Prior Litigation Involving This Petitioner Unquestionably
   Serves to Raise Serious Questions In Reasonable Minds About The
   Impartiality Of The Adjudication of The Claims In This Matter. "The
   right to trial by an impartial judge `is a basic requirement of due
   process.' " Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 98 (3d Cir.
   1992)(quoting In Re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955)). Impartiality
   and the appearance of impartiality in a judicial officer are the sine
   qua non of the American legal system. In Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v.
   Continental Casualty Co., 393 U.S. 145 . . . (1968), the United States
   Supreme Court stated: [A]ny tribunal permitted by law to try cases and
   controversies not only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the
   appearance of bias. 671 F.2d at 789. Haines, 975 F.2d at 98 (quoting
   Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 789 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S.
   880 (1982))(citations in original; emphasis added). Whether a jurist is
   actually "incapable of discharging judicial duties free from bias or
   prejudice . . . is not the test." Haines, supra, 975 F.2d at 98.
   "[R]ather, the polestar is `[i]mpartiality and the appearance of
   impartiality.' " Ibid. (quoting Lewis, supra, 671 F.2d at 789). That
   the public perceive the judicial process as fair and impartial is of
   paramount importance. See, e.g., Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540,
   554 (1994); Primerica, supra, 10 F.3d at 167; Haines, 975 F.2d at 98.
   Accord Antar v. Antar, supra, 71 F.3d at 101. Therefore a court must
   "preserve not only the reality 24The standard of review which applies
   in connection with a petition for writ of mandamus seeking review of a
   recusal ruling is whether there was an abuse of discretion by the
   district court. United States v. Antar, 53 F.3d 568, 573 (3d Cir.
   1995). 16 but also the appearance of the proper functioning of the
   judiciary as a neutral, impartial administrator of justice." United
   States v. Torkington, 874 F.2d 1441, 1447 (11th Cir. 1989)(quoted in
   Primerica, supra, 10 F.3d at 167, and Haines, supra, 975 F.2d at 98).
   "When the judge is the actual trier of fact, the need to preserve the
   appearance of impartiality is especially pronounced." Primerica, supra,
   10 F.3d at 166. While the conduct with respect to which a request for
   judicial disqualification is being sought typically "must involve an
   extrajudicial factor," U.S. v. Antar, supra, 53 F.3d at 574 (citing
   Liteky, supra), both this Court and the United States Supreme Court,
   have also recognized, this is not an absolute rule; there are
   circumstances when "opinions formed during a judicial proceeding may in
   certain instances give rise to a duty to recuse." Ibid. (quoting United
   States v. Bertoli, 40 F.3d 1384, 1412 (3d Cir. 1994). Accord Liteky,
   510 U.S. at 550 (where the court cited as an example a situation where,
   in the course of a trial, a judge acquires a hatred for one of the
   parties); Primerica, supra (where the events which compelled recusal
   were part of the case). In such instances, for case-based conduct to be
   seen to evince improper bias or prejudice, "the court's actions `must
   reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair
   judgment impossible.' " U.S. v. Antar, supra, 53 F.3d at 574 (quoting
   Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555). In determining if this line has been crossed,
   the question is not whether the jurist is actually laboring under a
   bias or prejudice for or against a party, see Bertoli, supra, 40 F.3d
   at 1412, but rather, "if a reasonable man, were he to know all the
   circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge's impartiality . . .
   ." U.S. v. Antar, 53 F.3d at 574 (quoting Potashnick v. Port City
   Constr. Co., 609 F.2d 1101, 1111 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 820
   (1980))(other citations omitted). Accord Primerica, supra, 10 F.3d at
   164 (" . . . the appropriate--and the only--inquiry . . . is `whether
   17 a reasonable person, knowing all the acknowledged circumstances,
   might question the district court judge's continued
   impartiality")(quoting In Re School Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d 764,
   781 (3d Cir. 1992)). "Congress enacted [28 U.S.C. §] 455(a) precisely
   because `people who have not served on the bench are often all too
   willing to indulge suspicions and doubts concerning the integrity of
   judges.' " In Re School Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d at 782 (quoting
   Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 864-65
   (1988)). The district court has never taken notice of, let alone been
   guided by these principles. As its opinion in Lambert I, which it
   adopted in this case, reflects, the only question it appears to have
   considered was whether it could be impartial. (App. 109-121) That,
   however, was not the proper question, as the decisional law discussed,
   supra, underscores. The district court was obliged to consider whether
   a reasonable person might question its impartiality. In failing to take
   the proper measure of the issue, the district court's ruling
   constituted an abuse of discretion. Simply put, it did not identify or
   employ the correct legal principles and its ruling was therefore
   seriously flawed. When governing law is actually given full effect and
   application, it compels a very different result. We submit that any
   reasonable person, aware of all that has occurred in the course of the
   prior litigation involving this habeas petitioner, could not help but
   harbor doubts--and serious doubts at that--about the district court's
   impartiality in this new action. Indeed, rare would be the person who
   would not question the district court's ability to be impartial in
   light of what it has previously said and done. Precisely the same
   problem that warranted reassignment of the trial judge in Primerica,
   supra, is present here, i.e., "that the outcome of this case `would be
   shrouded [in] suspicion' if [the assigned judge] were to continue to
   preside as trier of fact," 10 F.3d at 163 (quoting In Re School
   Asbestos Litigation, supra, 977 F.2d at 785), and there is even more
   reason 18 than there was in that case to believe that reasonable
   persons would question the Court's impartiality. For the record in
   Lambert I shows that, from the earliest moments of that case, the
   district court departed from procedural norms in habeas cases, granting
   discovery and setting a hearing date, things which favored the
   petitioner, without even waiting to receive the Commonwealth's answer
   to the petition, something the procedural rules instruct it to do. See
   Rule 8(a)(for Section 2254 cases). The court's treatment of the matter,
   as extraordinary, and thus warranting deviation from well-settled
   exhaustion rules, from the start--before even considering the contents
   of a responsive pleading-- would be troubling to a reasonable observer.
   Surely, this could be seen to raise questions of prejudgment
   notwithstanding any of the court's disclaimers about having not made up
   its mind about anything. Its actions, to a reasonable observer, might
   fairly be seen to tell a different story. At the time the district
   court permitted petitioner to embark on her wide-ranging and expensive
   discovery campaign, and at the time it set a not too distant hearing
   date, the only things before the court were the allegations being made
   by one side in this litigation.25 It had not even afforded the
   Commonwealth the most basic of due process rights, i.e., the
   opportunity to respond to the many averments contained in the petition
   and to present its views about the viability of the merits of the
   claims in it before it made these critical rulings which imposed such
   great obligations. A reasonable person might take from the undue speed
   with which the district court acted in this regard that the court
   simply wasn't interested in what the Commonwealth had to say and that
   whatever it said would 25From January 8, 1997, a few days after the
   first amended complaint had been filed, until February 7, 1997, the
   Court received a series of correspondence, either directly or as the
   result of being copied, which echoed the allegations in that petition,
   i.e., that Lambert was innocent, that prosecutors were withholding
   important information/evidence, etc. See (App. 133-154)(which contains
   copies of the correspondence). A reasonable person might see these
   communications as having affected the court's perception of this case
   and contributing to its vehemently negative views of the Commonwealth's
   witnesses and evidence. 19 be of absolutely no import; that the
   district court had already accepted, as true, at least some of what was
   being alleged by petitioner. But even if that were not the case, the
   hyperbole with which this Court repeatedly infused its decision in the
   matter--calling it a case of injustice without peer in the
   English-speaking world, for example--more than suffices to raise
   questions about the Court's ability to see things any other way. The
   vehemence of its ruling on the merits undoubtedly would make it very
   difficult for any reasonable person to believe that the district court
   can start with a clean slate in considering the Commonwealth's position
   in this litigation.26 What reasonable person would have confidence
   that, given the district court's prior, emphatic view of the facts and
   claims--a view which discredited many of the Commonwealth's witnesses
   so completely and embraced petitioner's contentions so
   wholeheartedly--the Commonwealth could, let alone would, now receive a
   fair hearing in this case which covers so much of the same ground?
   After all, as detailed, supra, the district court repeatedly called
   many of the witnesses whose testimony figures critically in the
   Commonwealth's defense of this action liars, perjurers and conspirators
   and even went so far as to refer them for prosecution as criminals
   and/or for professional discipline.27 In light of this, reasonable
   persons could believe that 26Lambert II must be treated as a completely
   new matter. See Jones v. Morton, 195 F.3d 153, 160(3d Cir. 1999)("
   `[t]ypically, when a complaint (or habeas petition) is dismissed
   without prejudice, that complaint is treated as if it never existed'
   ")(quoting Hull v. Kyler, 190 F.3d 88, 103- 04 (3d Cir. 1999).
   Accordingly, " a subsequent petition filed after exhaustion is
   completed cannot be considered an amendment to the prior petition, but
   must be considered a new action." Id. at 161. In such circumstances, a
   petitioner proceeds "as if it were the first such filing." Christy v.
   Horn, 115 F.3d 201, 208 (3d Cir. 1997). See also Slack v. McDaniel, 529
   U.S. 473 (2000)(holding that "[a] habeas petition filed in the district
   court after an initial habeas petition was unadjudicated on its merits
   and dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies is not a second or
   successive petition"). 27In some instances, the district court did
   this--or took other action of an adverse nature against respondents'
   witnesses before the testimony in the case was completed; indeed,
   before the testimony in petitioner's case was completed. See (App.
   69-70)(Tr. 4/2/97 at pp. 633-637)(where 20 the district court is
   possessed of very firmly-held opinions about the credibility--or lack
   thereof--of witnesses and evidence which figure importantly in the
   Commonwealth's defense of this case. We submit that reasonable persons
   would question whether these individuals--previously seen by the
   district court as parties to "a Faustian [b]argain," 962 F.Supp. at
   1555--could now be viewed as anything else. Similarly, given the
   court's strongly expressed convictions concerning Lambert's innocence
   and her victimization, it would be exceedingly difficult to convince
   any reasonable person that the district court could not now be affected
   by these things. After the court's having seen Lambert as the victim of
   the greatest injustice in the annals of English-speaking jurisprudence;
   after it has allowed that it will "take much more than the granting of
   her petition to heal the wounds and banish the demons that have for so
   long hurt and haunted her," 962 F. Supp. At 1552; after it has so
   dramatically exonerated her saying it "was as though [she was]
   delivered from Central Casting for the part of villainess," id. at
   1555, what reasonable person would not have questions or be skeptical
   about the district court's ability to be impartial in this new case in
   which she makes the same claims? Because, as a habeas case, this is a
   non-jury proceeding, and the judge is therefore tasked with deciding
   both legal and factual issues, the importance of ensuring that the
   public's perception of judicial integrity is increased. As Primerica
   points out, see 10 F.3d at 163, in situations where just three days
   into the hearing the district court expressed the view that it was
   hearing perjured testimony); (App. 73-75)(Tr. 4/16/97 at pp.
   2704-2710)(where the court directed counsel for respondents to report
   the Pennsylvania District Justice who was testifying to state judicial
   disciplinary authorities); and (App. 41)(Order of Apr. 16, 1997)(Record
   Document 70)(barring eight individuals from courthouse)). In Primerica,
   this Court said that reasonable persons might question the impartiality
   of a judge who, before all the evidence was received in a case, had
   expressed the view that certain witnesses may have committed perjury
   and should be referred for possible investigation by a grand jury. 10
   F.3d at 164. 21 the record reflects events or occurrences which might
   generate doubts about the impartiality of the sole arbiter of a
   dispute, it can be particularly difficult "to defuse, quiet or
   overcome" suspicions of the public and others relative to the court's
   rulings. Id. This consideration, too, bespeaks the need for recusal in
   this case. What reasonable person would believe that the court would
   not be influenced by its prior evaluation of the evidence and witnesses
   when making rulings in this case, not just on substantive questions,
   but also when it comes to important threshold procedural issues, such
   as whether Lambert has made an adequate showing of "actual innocence"
   so as to be able to overcome procedural default. See generally
   Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 , 87 (1977); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S.
   298 (1995). Even if the court were capable of divorcing itself from its
   strongly-voiced conclusions and could render rulings free from the
   influence of its prior assessment-- something about which we express no
   view as the court's ability to do this since it is not part of the
   calculus, see Bertoli, supra-- any rulings made by the court which
   favored Lambert would nevertheless be "shrouded in suspicion" in
   reasonable minds given its prior determinations. Given the district
   court's past, vehement proclamation that Lambert was actually innocent
   of the crime of which she was convicted, what reasonable person could
   not help but have grave doubts about the court's impartiality
   concerning any ruling in this case that she had made an adequate
   showing of "actual innocence" so as to avoid procedural default?
   Accordingly, the Court should, in the interest of ensuring public
   confidence in the outcome of this litigation, require the district
   judge to desist from participating.28 28Given the procedural
   developments in Lambert II, and the district court's decision to rule
   on the motion for recusal at the same time it addressed matters
   discussed in the memoranda filed on July 16, 2001 by the parties, the
   district court has in fact said that Lambert's claims are not
   procedurally defaulted; that, based on its findings of fact in Lambert
   I, which it re-adopted in Lambert II, she has established a
   "fundamental miscarriage of justice," and, accordingly, has 22 Also,
   given the repeated rejection of the district court's prior appraisal of
   Lambert's claims by the state courts, and the various investigatory
   bodies to whom such referral for prosecution or professional discipline
   was made, what reasonable person would not wonder if any continued
   participation by the same jurist might be influenced by concerns other
   than the evidence? Reasonable persons, we believe, might question if
   the court was motivated by a desire to correct perceived "errors" by
   those bodies. Certainly, the memorandum the district court issued on
   February 21, 2001, in Lambert I, would raise questions in reasonable
   minds about its ability to function impartially in this litigation. The
   manner in which the court recounted developments in Lambert I in that
   memorandum, saying, for example, that "with the Commonwealth of
   Pennsylvania's agreement that `relief is warranted'," slip op. at 1;
   and "[o]ver the dissent of Judge Roth, which was joined in by three
   other Court of Appeals judges, the Court of Appeals on January 26, 1998
   denied Ms. Lambert's petition for rehearing en banc," (App. 97-98), can
   be seen to give the strong impression that the court is operating with
   a firmly-entrenched view of the facts and claims since the court has
   chosen to focus on things--such as dissents by members of this
   Court29--which accord with its assessment and to overcome procedural
   default. See Addendum (Mem. of Nov. 21, 2001 at pp. 29-30 n. 22). While
   we recognize that the legitimacy of the district court's ruling on this
   point, and various others it addressed in its memorandum of November
   21, 2001, are issues which must be left for another day, nevertheless
   we submit that the highly unusual manner in which the district court
   has proceeded would serve to cause reasonable persons to question
   whether the district court was, or ever could, be impartial. 29The
   district court not only mentioned the dissent relative to rehearing of
   the appeal which followed its ruling on the merits of this case, but
   also the dissent expressed relative to the Court's en banc decision
   denying Lambert bail pending action on her petition for certiorari. See
   (App.103) (referring to "the release we ordered on April 16, 1997,
   confirmed on April 21, 1997, and that five members of the Court of
   Appeals were prepared to give her on August 3, 1998"). In fact, there
   were only three dissenting votes on the ruling denying bail. See
   Opinion filed at Nos. 97-1281, 97-1283 23 ignore other, more important
   things which don't, e.g., the fact that twice as many members of the
   Court did not vote for rehearing in the appeal which had vacated its
   ruling. See 134 F.3d at 525 (listing the members of the Court who had
   participated relative to the request for rehearing). There is also the
   fact that misconduct charges had been filed against the district court
   with this Court by one of the individuals whose testimony figures
   centrally in this case--Hazel Show. See (App. 156-167)(where a decision
   by this Court relative to the complaint which was docketed at J.C. No.
   99-50 (3d Cir. Feb. 22, 2000) appears). In mentioning this we do not
   mean to suggest that simply because someone associated with a case
   files a complaint against a presiding judge, it automatically follows
   that reasonable persons would question the judge's impartiality. But in
   this instance, observations by the Court in its decision lends
   additional support for the notion that reasonable persons would
   question the legitimacy of the district court's court's continued
   involvement. For although the Court ultimately dismissed this
   complaint, it nevertheless observed that, in some places, language used
   by the district court in its opinion in Lambert I was "hyperbolic and
   overly dramatic, as well as intemperate." Id., slip op. at 4. Those
   remarks, which obviously recognize that the district court was
   possessed of extremely strong views on certain issues, indicate that,
   at times, the district court's opinion exceeded what was called for.
   Such an assessment by one trained in the law and therefore mindful of
   the fact that judicial opinion-writing is to be afforded a great deal
   of expressive latitude is of no small consequence. Rather, it serves to
   show how much easier it would be for a reasonable citizen, not
   possessed of the brakes acquired in the course of legal & 97-1287(3d
   Cir., Aug. 3, 1998)(en banc)(Stapleton, Roth and McKee, JJ.,
   dissenting). This number constituted less than one-third of the ten
   judge en banc court, which decided the issue. The district court's
   opinion also indicates that the matter was considered en banc by the
   this Court sua sponte. Rather, as the record shows, respondents applied
   for en banc review with the Court on May 8, 1998. 24 training, to see
   in what the district court has said in its decision in Lambert I
   unshakable opinions about the issues, witnesses and evidence and, as a
   result, to have little or no confidence in its ability to be impartial
   in this case. Moreover, the swiftness with which the district court has
   repeatedly acted with regard to matters initiated by Lambert in the
   wake of this Court's reversal of its ruling, particularly her
   application for bail, could not help but cause a reasonable person to
   wonder if the district court isn't "chomping at the bit" to assist her,
   and to reinstate its prior ruling granting her relief. So would the
   court's actions relative to the recusal motion filed in Lambert I,
   i.e., ruling in a case that was clearly over--a case in which recusal
   had become a moot point. But if that was not enough, the complete
   deviation from any semblance of normal procedure which has pervaded
   Lambert II to date would certainly serve to fuel questions about the
   district court's impartiality. Instead of treating this case as new
   action--Lambert's first habeas action--as it was required to do, see
   Jones, supra, and n. 26, supra, the district court has proceeded as
   though this is merely a continuation of her prior case. As its order of
   November 21, 2001, shows, it has chosen to by-pass the customary
   procedural niceties not requiring her to submit a suitable pleading and
   apparently intending to never allow the Commonwealth to submit a formal
   response to the petition.30 A reasonable person, aware of all that has
   occurred, might believe that the Court cares too much about Lambert's
   claims and that, as this Court put it in Primerica, 10 F.3d at 164, the
   district court "has apparently not receded in his view" of the proper
   disposition of them. In short, this is one of the rare cases in which
   developments arising in the course of litigation warrant 30The next
   step the district court has ordained is for the parties are now to
   advise it by December 20, 2001, whether, in their respective views, any
   additional evidence is required. See Addendum (Order of Nov. 21, 2001
   at ¶ 3). 25 recusal;31 reasonable persons could believe from all that
   has gone before that the district court is possessed of a "deep-seated
