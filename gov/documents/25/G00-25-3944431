      Regional Transportation Plan

   Regional Transit Expansion Policy

      As part of the 2001 update to the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP),
      MTC is developing an associated Regional Transit Expansion Policy. The
      new policy will be a successor to MTC Resolution No. 1876 adopted in
      1988, a multiyear rail expansion program that has delivered new BART
      service to Dublin and Bay Point in the East Bay, the Tasman light-rail
      extension in Silicon Valley, and the BART extension to the San
      Francisco International Airport, expected to open in 2002.

      In April 2001, MTC adopted criteria for identifying and prioritizing
      bus and rail transit projects for inclusion in the Regional Transit
      Expansion Policy (Resolution No. 3357). MTC's preliminary evaluation of
      candidate projects submitted is contained in a report -- Regional
      Transit Expansion Policy: Initial Assessment -- published in
      conjunction with the release of the Draft 2001 RTP, in August 2001. An
      additional detailed criteria evaluation was published on October 12,
      2001.

      On November 9, 2001, the Commission's Planning and Operations Committee
      released for public comment an updated criteria evaluation and a
      recommended program of rail and transit projects. A proposed final
      program of projects was presented to the Planning and Operations
      Committee on December 14. Based on its review and comments received
      from its advisory committees and the general public, the Commission
      adopted a list of priority projects and funding agreements on December
      19, 2001.
