   Judicial Appointments

                            Judicial Appointments
   _______________________________________________________________________

     Governor Locke cares deeply about the quality of the judiciary in
     the State of Washington, and takes the honor of making judicial
     appointments very seriously. He strives to improve the quality,
     efficiency, and image of our judiciary through his appointments.
     Judicial appointments have a significant impact on the citizens of
     Washington and those who do business in this state, and are a high
     priority for the Governor. He believes that the selection of
     experienced, well-qualified and wise judges is vital to maintaining
     not only an efficient judicial system, but a just democracy and
     vital economy.

     A link to the judicial application questionnaire is located at the
     bottom of the page. The form is appropriate for appointments to the
     Superior Court, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
     Applications and letters of support should be submitted in care of
     the Governor's General Counsel, who is in charge of the Governor's
     evaluation and selection process, at the following address:

   Temple of Justice

                            Everett H. Billingslea, General Counsel
                           Office of the Governor
                           Legislative Building
                           P.O. Box 40002
                           Olympia, Washington 98504

     Or by e-mail attachment to Barbara Goody at the Office of the
     Governor. (If you choose to submit and application electronically,
     be sure to send signed hard copies of the consent forms located at
     the end of the application.)

     In order to ensure a broad base of well-qualified applicants, the
     Governor encourages all qualified individuals to submit their names
     for consideration, and asks county and specialty bar associations to
     seek out qualified members for consideration, and to develop and
     utilize judicial evaluation programs. Evaluations from the state,
     county and specialty bar associations help the Governor locate and
     evaluate the widest spectrum of candidates.

     A central goal in the Governor's judicial evaluation and selection
     process is to gather as much information about each candidate from
     as many diverse sources as possible. Before filling a vacancy, the
     thoughts of the judges on the bench where the vacancy exists are
     always considered, together with input from bar and community
     leaders, and every available bar association evaluation or rating.
     Every qualified candidate who submits an application is personally
     interviewed by the Governor's General Counsel, and finalists are
     interviewed by the Governor personally.

     The Governor's process for evaluating and selecting candidates can
     be lengthy, and every effort is made to fill vacancies as quickly as
     possible. However quality is never compromised for speed. In order
     to facilitate timely decision making, interested and qualified
     lawyers are encouraged to submit an application at any time - so
     that a ready pool of applications is on file when a vacancy opens.

     Judges appointed by the Governor generally hold office until the
     next general election, at which time the people of the area they
     serve may vote to retain an appointed judge, or elect another
     candidate. While the Governor's appointees often are not challenged,
     any appointed judge must be well prepared to launch a vigorous
     campaign to retain the seat.
