[bluebird.jpg] Using Nesting Birds to Test Predictions from Ecological Risk
Assessments

   EES-10 scientists are studying cavity-nesting western
   bluebird populations around LANL to confirm results of
   previous ecological risk studies. Additionally, they are
   developing and testing non-lethal indicators of
   ecological risk that can be applied to multi-spatial
   scales of assessment.
