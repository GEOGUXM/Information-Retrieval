   [ISMAP:com.gif]-Links to NYPA visitors centers (see text links below)
   Ready to leave cyberspace? Then come visit us! The Power Authority
   operates Visitors Centers at its three large hydroelectric projects.
   (Our participation with the Energy Center at Nine Mile Point, ended
   with the sale of our James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant to Entery Corp.
   Nov. 21, 2000)  All   tourist facilities are open admission-free
   throughout the year (contact each site for a specific schedule).

   Besides offering an up-close look at how electricity is made and used,
   these Visitors Centers also provide information about local parks and
   recreational sites, many of which were developed and donated by the
   Power Authority.

   New York State has much to offer travelers, tourists and especially its
   own local residents; we're just one more reason why you should spend
   some of your free time here!
