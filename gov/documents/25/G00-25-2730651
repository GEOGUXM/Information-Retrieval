        Note: There are several file types offered on SBA's web site. In
        some cases, the data is best displayed in its native format, e.g.,
        PowerPoint, Word, Excel, or PDF. To avoid requiring you to purchase
        expensive suites of software, we present various viewers or readers
        that are found free on the internet and offered here for download.
        Advanced users can download the viewers/readers directly from here.
        If you are not sure or want more information, we provide links to
        the parent sites for reading and/or downloading.

        [Netscape 6.x Users Potential Viewing Issues: For those of you that
        have downloaded and installed Netscape 6.0 - be advised that the
        banner, and some other things on our website may not work for you
        unless you download the "Full" version of Netscape 6.0 that includes
        java elements. Netscape's default download selection of
        "Recommended" does not give you java elements needed to view all
        things on our, and perhaps other web sites that utilize java
        scripting.]
        Instructions: Download a plug-in by clicking on the link and
        specifying a place on your computer to save the file. Once finished
        downloading, close all programs, find the file using Windows
        Explorer, and double-click on the file to install. Finally, follow
        the manufacturer's dialog boxes throughout the installation.

    SBA uses compression (zipping and unzipping/expanding/decompressing)
   software and below are some sites that provide evaluation copies of
   unzipping/expanding/decompressing software for download (listed
   alphabetically without preference):

     * Aladdin Systems site . (Note this site is selling a lot of
     expander/decompressing products but look carefully for the free ones
     shown on the same page).

     * Winzip site (Evaluation Version).

     We will gladly point to any other site that will
     decompress/unzip/expand a zipped file (for free or for an evaluation
     period) if notified. Should any of the above stop providing an
     evaluation copy, let us know and the link will be removed.
