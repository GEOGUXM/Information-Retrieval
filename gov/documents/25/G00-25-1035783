   Security Notice

   You are entering an official United States Government System, which may
   be used only for authorized purposes. Unauthorized modification of any
   information on this system may result in criminal prosecution. The
   Government may monitor or audit the usage of this system, and all
   persons are hereby notified that use of this system constitutes consent
   to such monitoring and auditing.

   Privacy Notice

   The Federal Communications Commission provides this Internet site as a
   public service. We do not obtain personally identifying information
   about you when you visit this site unless you choose to provide such
   information to us.

   The FCC posts a Privacy Act notice at those places on this site where
   the Commission needs to collect any individually identifiable
   information for use by the FCC.

   Any information collected within the context of your email inquiry or
   comment is used only for the expressed purpose of responding to your
   inquiry or comment. We collect personally identifiable information only
   if specifically and knowingly provided by you.

   For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes.
   This government computer system uses software programs to create
   summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing what
   information is of most and least interest, determining technical design
   specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
   This information is not expressed in any form that would reveal
   personally identifiable information.

   The FCC provides numerous online software programs that support the
   Universal Licensing System, Antenna Structure Registration, Auctions,
   and other FCC functions. When a user visits the FCC web site to perform
   a transaction (sending an application, initiating a query, receiving a
   query response, etc), the web server receives data or sends a response
   and then may send a cookie prior to breaking the connection with the
   user. A cookie is a small piece of software that is placed by a web
   server on users personal computers and is then used to personalize the
   site when a visitor returns. A transaction or session, may involve a
   number of such information exchanges, each followed by a break in the
   connection. In order to maintain the state (where one is in the
   process) of a transaction, the FCC web sites may place session cookies
   in memory allocated to users browsers. Session cookies permit the users
   to perform transactions as if they were connected to the FCC web site
   throughout the course of the transactions or sessions. Session cookies
   are erased from the users systems when they close their browsers.

   Freedom of Information Act

   The Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as the FOIA, (5 U.S.C. §
   552), was enacted by Congress in 1966 to give the American public
   greater access to the Federal Government's records. Congress has since
   expanded the scope of the FOIA to encompass electronic records.
   However, you do not have to file a FOIA request to obtain information
   which is routinely available for public inspection, including records
   from docketed cases, broadcast applications and related files,
   petitions for rulemakings, various legal and technical publications,
   legislative history compilations, etc. See 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.453 and
   0.455. Much of this information is available on our website. Visit the
   FCC FOIA Home Page for an informal explanation of the FOIA process at
   the FCC.
