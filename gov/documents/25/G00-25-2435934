                            Major Accomplishments

   The Surface Radiation Research Branch of the Air Resources Laboratory
   was created in 1993. One of its first achievements was the
   establishment of the surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD).
   SURFRAD is the first U.S. network of its kind to monitor the surface
   radiation budget simultaneously over a range of climates within the
   United States. Another significant accomplishment has been the design
   and assembly of a state-of-the-art Central Calibration and Field Test
   Facility for network UV-monitoring spectroradiometers and other types
   of radiometric instruments, which has involved close cooperation with
   NIST, USDA, EPA, NSF, and the Smithsonian Institution. Additionally,
   scientists at SRRB play leading roles in organizing and coordinating
   international UV monitoring efforts, conducting basic research on
   problems in radiometry and in atmospheric radiative transfer. Specific
   accomplishments during our short history include:

   SURFRAD:
     * Designed and built a robust surface radiation budget measurement
       system that operates automatically and requires minimal routine
       attention.
     * Established the first U.S. full surface radiation budget monitoring
       network, originally composed of four stations. The network
       currently has six stations in climatically diverse areas of the
       USA.
     * Developed a successful and robust system to process and manage
       SURFRAD data.
     * Completed an instrument inventory of SURFRAD instruments and their
       calibrations, and organized this information into a data base.
     * Designed and built shading platforms for the solar trackers at each
       SURFRAD station for making diffuse solar measurements.
     * Refined the clear-sky detection algorithm to use SURFRAD data.
     * Established a continuous SURFRAD data archive and data distribution
       system on the internet.
     * Added two stations in 1998 at Desert Rock, NV and near Penn State.
     * Produced solar cloud forcing estimates from SURFRAD data.
     * Installed sky imagers at all SURFRAD stations.
     * Upgraded the solar trackers at all sites.
     * Developed and implemented an interpolation program that produces
       hydrostatically consistent rawinsonde-type profiles at SURFRAD
       station locations for 0000 and 1200 UTC each day.

   CUCF:
     * Developed a UV instrument characterization and calibration facility
       in accordance with NIST standards.
     * Hosted four interagency North American UV Spectroradiometer
       Intercomparisons with NIST in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997.
     * Developed a procedure to transfer spectroradiometric calibrations
       -- traceable to the UV Spectroradiometer Intercomparisons -- to
       broad band UV instruments.
     * Designed, constructed, tested and received certification for a
       Field Calibration device for UV-monitoring spectroradiometers.
     * Developed a system to characterize cosine response of broadband and
       filtered instruments.
     * Produced zenith angle dependent calibration factors for calculating
       erythema and UV irradiance for SRRB's standard broadband UV
       radiometers for 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999.
     * Published the results of the first, second, third and fourth North
       American UV Radiometer Intercomparisons held at Table Mountain in
       1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 in the J. Res. Nat. Inst. Stand. & Tech.
     * Designed and constructed an instrumentation field testing and
       performance evaluation facility at Table Mountain near Boulder.
     * Host two visiting scientists from Rome, Italy. Dr. Daniele Fua and
       Dr. Giorgio Di Sarra collaborated with John DeLuisi and Patrick
       Disterhoft on matters concerning the Calibration Laboratory during
       the summer and fall, 1997.
     * Performed calibration audits of Mark II Brewer Spectroradiometers
       for the EPA UV Monitoring Program at 18 sites in 1998, 7 sites in
       1999, and 7 sites in 2000.

   Research:
     * Hosted two SAGE III Team meetings.
     * Provide quality near real-time surface radiation budget data to
       GCIP, university, and government scientists for the validation of
       atmospheric, climate, hydrologic, weather and satellite based
       models.
     * Coordinated writing an assessment of climate change and UV
       radiation in the Arctic for the International Arctic Monitoring and
       Assessment Program, under the auspices of the Arctic Environmental
       Protection Strategy which was signed by the eight Arctic countries
       in 1991.
     * Coordinated the two-year effort of the reassessment and re-analysis
       of the RB-meter network data (1974-1991).

       attended by over 70 participants from 18 countries.
     * First validated assessments of stratospheric ozone trends observed
       by the Umkehr and SBUV in mid-latitudes. Results were consistent
       with photochemical theory predictions.

       and the North Slope of Alaska.
     * Developed a robust empirical method to recalibrate pyrgeometers by
       transferring the calibrations of multiple standards to test
       instruments.
     * Conceived, designed, and conducted a controlled experiment at the
       ARM-CART site to accurately measure downwelling solar irradiance
       for comparison with modeled estimates of the surface irradiance to
       address the controversy over the difference between modeled and
       measured surface irradiance.

              Current Activities and Plans for 2001 and Beyond

   SURFRAD:
     * Install new SurfRad station in West Virginia.
     * Install Global Positioning System (GPS) devices at SURFRAD stations
       to retrieve water vapor loading.
     * Implement an interactive data base for instrument and calibration
       tracking.
     * Work in collaboration with universities around the country to
       create new SURFRAD stations.

   CUCF:
     * Final testing and inspection for operating certification by NIST of
       an automated Spectral Irradiance Transfer System for standard
       lamps.

   Research:
     * Publish the results of research on the nature of errors induced by
       stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols on Umkehr-retrieved ozone
       profiles.
     * Publish results of the assessment of the errors in the Umkehr
       retrieved ozone profiles
     * Create an interactive web page with the available set of 61-layer
       truth, retrieved, a priori ozone profiles and Umkehr N-values from
       the synthetic data, as well as the 61-layer error covariance
       matrices. This will provide our best ("carnot cycle") Umkehr
       solution to the community. Users will be able to try alternative
       algorithms and compare results.

       non- windowed automatic Hickey-Frieden absolute cavity radiometer.
     * Evaluate and examine results from several different calibration
       procedures used on pyranometers.
     * Test the stability and repeatability of our automated outdoor
       pyrgeometer calibration processing software and compare the results
