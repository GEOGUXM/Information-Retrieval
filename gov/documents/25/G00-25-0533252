   PICTURES FROM THE REAL EDGE: NASA POSTS U.S. TOPOGRAPHY DATA

   Displaying spectacular new 3-D images and animations of California from
   space, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena,
   Calif., today announced the release of high-resolution topographic data
   of the continental United States gathered during the February 2000
   Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) -- a mission that is creating
   the world's best topographic map.

   "The release of the California mosaic and continental-U.S. SRTM data is
   a tantalizing preview of things to come from this program," said
   Michael Kobrick, JPL SRTM project scientist. "We are processing data
   for the rest of the world on a continent- by-continent basis, mapping
   and exploring many relatively unknown regions where our maps will be
   far more precise than the best global maps in use today."

   Yunjin Kim, JPL SRTM project manager, said users in the U.S. and
   elsewhere would find wide applications for the data. "The maps produced
   from the mission will be among the most valuable, universally
   beneficial data ever produced by a science mission. National and local
   government organizations, scientists, commercial enterprises and
   civilians alike will find the data useful for applications as diverse
   as earthquake studies, flood control, transportation and urban
   planning, enhanced ground- collision warning systems for aircraft and
   better placement of cell phone towers," he explained.

   With today's release, gigabytes of digital elevation-model data,
   sampled at an interval of one measurement every 30 meters (98 feet),
   are now available to selected science investigators, with 90-meter
   (295-foot) sample imagery available to the general public. Processing
   and distribution of validated U.S. digital topographic data will
   continue on a regular basis, with completion expected this spring.

   When completed in fall 2002, more than 12 terabytes of data
   encompassing nearly 1 trillion measurements will have been processed,
   representing 80 percent of Earth's land mass between 60 degrees north
   and 56 degrees south of the equator. The areas mapped are home to
   approximately 95 percent of the world's population.

   Thomas A. Hennig, National Imaging and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) program
   manager for SRTM said, "SRTM literally captured a snapshot of the
   Earth's surface at the beginning of the 21st century that will be of
   tremendous value for years to come. The SRTM data will provide NIMA's
   customers a revolutionary leap forward in imaging information." NIMA
   partnered with NASA, Germany and Italy in sponsorship of the SRTM
   flight.

   The centerpiece of today's release is the California mosaic, a
   color-shaded relief elevation map. The image depicts California at a
   data-sample interval of 3 arc-seconds (approximately 90 meters or 295
   feet). The map depicts changes in height as colors, with blues and
   greens at the lower elevations, rising through yellows and browns to
   white at the highest elevations.

   The California mosaic image and animations are available at:

   As processing of each continent is finished, data will be sent to NIMA
   for final quality checking and copies sent to the United States
   Geological Survey's EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, S.D., for final
   archiving and distribution.

   The SRTM was flown aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour Feb. 11-22, 2000. It
   used modified versions of the same instruments that comprised the Space
   Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar that flew twice
   on Endeavour in 1994.

   The mission collected 3-D measurements of Earth's land surface using
   radar interferometry, which compares two radar images taken at slightly
   different locations to obtain elevation or surface-change information.
   To collect the data, engineers added a 60-meter (197-foot) mast,
   installed additional C-band and X-band antennas, and improved tracking
   and navigation devices.

   The SRTM mission supports NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, Washington,
   a long-term research and technology program designed to examine Earth's
   land, oceans, atmosphere, ice and life as a total integrated system.
