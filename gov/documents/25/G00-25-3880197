   October 21, 1997
          The SINDA code interface has been updated and a bug which caused
          incorrect data to be created when using SI units has been
          corrected. Download the current update from the Updates &
          Patches page.

   September 25, 1997
          If you downloaded the TPSX update file prior to Sept. 25 1997,
          then you may get an error when you try to access the built-in
          databases (JANAF and Solid Species). To solve this problem,
          download the current update from the Updates & Patches page.

   November 8, 1996
          There were a couple of logic errors in the database editor of
          Version 1.1 of TPSX. This bug prevented material properties from
          being changed. An updated executable is available from the
          Updates & Patches page.

   June 7, 1995
          A bug has been discovered in Version 1.0 of TPSX. This bug
          affects the output created in the Code Interface Window when
          using the COSMOS/M option (i.e., when creating material property
          inputs for the COSMOS/M program).

          Specifically, when the "Use database range" option is checked
          for the Temperature Range, the resulting output may have
          incorrect values for any temperature-dependent properties. This
          bug affects ONLY the Code Interface Window.
          A corrected version of TPSX is available (Version 1.01). Please
          use the Bug/Comment form to request this version if you feel you
          need it (i.e., if you use TPSX to create COSMOS/M inputs).
