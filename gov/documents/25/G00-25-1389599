   Biography:

     I graduated from the  Kolmogorov High School N2 in 1991.  In the
     same year I entered the Physics Department of Moscow State
     University, where I was doing research in plasma physics and
     supervised by professor A. A. Rukhadze. In 1997 I graduated with
     excellence and became a student of the Physics Department at SUNY at
     Stony Brook.  In March 2001 I defended a PhD thesis guided by
     professor Philip B. Allen. Since April 2001 I joined Physics
     Department   at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a research a
     Research Associate in the condensed matter theory group.

   Research:

     My research interest switched in to a field of nanoscience. In
     particular I am interested in transport through the organic
     molecules placed between the metal leads. The chemistry plays the
     crucial role of the properties of such systems. The first
     principle's Density Functional Theory is a very promising tool to
     handle these kind of problem. Developing the method of calculations
     which takes care of all the non-linear effects on a fully self
     consistent ground is the highest priority in the field. Importance
     the explicit dependence of the effective potential for these systems
     remains open. Current DFT approach might be necessary to give a
     correct quantitative description. The strong temperature dependence
     of the I-V molecule characteristics suggest the importance of the
     coupling of atomic vibrations (phonons) to the electronic channels
     responsible for the current flow. This opens the opportunities to
     combine the DFT approach to obtain realistic parameters for the
     model Hamiltonian and use the later for the analyses of the
     experimental data.
     Some recent results on Jahn-Teller instability in charged
     metallo-porphyrins are being presented on Santa Fe meeting. Abstract
     available.
