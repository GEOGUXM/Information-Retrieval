                       Mrs. Payne Comes to Washington

           73-year-old intern joins office of Rep. Christopher Cox


           WASHINGTON (Thursday, November 15, 2001)—No one calling U.S.
   Representative Christopher Cox’s office these days would be surprised
   at the mature, authoritative voice answering the phone some days. But
   they would be surprised to know that it's the voice of a UCI student.
   That’s because 73-year-old Joy Payne of Laguna Woods, California, a UCI
   political science major, has an internship with the office until
   mid-December.
           “Joy brings a unique perspective to our office,” said Rep. Cox.
   “She is currently the most senior member of my staff—by age of course.
           “In addition to learning the ropes in my office this fall, Joy
   is working on a number of pieces of legislation that enable her to
   interact with other Member offices and with federal agencies. We wanted
   to give her a complete picture of the federal legislative process.”
           Joy Payne is completing her B.A. in political science at the
   University of California, Irvine. She is working and studying this
   semester in Washington, DC, to enhance her understanding of American
   politics and government. She has been on the Dean’s Honor list for
   seven quarters, and is a member of the Golden Key Honor Society and the
   Pi Omicron Chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha.
