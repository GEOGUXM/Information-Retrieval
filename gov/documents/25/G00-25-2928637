   "The Stennis Center believes that no government, regardless of its
   history and structure, can be better than the people who make it work.
   That is why our focus is on people over policy. We are confident that
   if we can get the best possible people in public service leadership, we
   will also get good policy." - Executive Director Rex Buffington

   The Stennis Center for Public Service is a federal, legislative agency
   created by Congress in 1988 to promote and strengthen public service
   leadership in America. The Stennis Center is headquartered in
   Starkville, Mississippi, adjacent to Mississippi State University.
   Programs of the Stennis Center are funded through an endowment plus
   private contributions from foundations and corporations.

   The Stennis Centers mandate is to attract young people to careers in
   public service, to provide training for leaders in or likely to be in
   public service, and to offer development opportunities for senior
   congressional staff. Products of the Stennis Center include
   conferences, seminars, special projects, and leadership development
   programs.

   The Stennis Center has a history of successful past events which relate
   to Congress and leadership. During each session of Congress, the
   Stennis Center operates a unique, bipartisan development program for 25
   of the most outstanding high ranking congressional staff in the House
   and Senate. These veteran staff members have in turn started a
   mentoring program for younger congressional staff, called Emerging
   Leaders. The Stennis Center also has a Civil-Military Leadership
   program which connects freshmen Members of Congress with leaders in the
   armed services.  In addition, the Southern Women in Public Service
   conference, established in 1991, has featured Hillary Clinton,
   Elizabeth Dole, Geraldine Ferraro and nearly every female member of
   Congress from the South. Over 300,000 high school students from across
   the country annually compete for a spot at the John C. Stennis National
   Student Congress.

   The Stennis Center forms partnerships to expand its capacity to promote
   public service. With the U.S. Association of Former Members of
   Congress, the Stennis Center operates a program which sends two former
   Members to college campuses around the nation to meet with students
   about the importance of public affairs. The Stennis Center also
   conducts programs with the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation to
   strengthen the leadership abilities of Truman Scholars young people who
   have demonstrated a proclivity for public service careers.

   The Stennis Center welcomes sponsorship for its programs from
   foundations and corporations with an interest in the quality and
   character of public service in America.
