                  Making Annotations to Principia Cybernetica Web


   Annotations are non-refereed comments to particular pages, entered
   freely by users, and published automatically to the Web.
     __________________________________________________________________

      The simplest way to contribute to Principia Cybernetica Web is by
      making an annotation to one of the existing "nodes" of the web. An
      annotation is a comment discussing a given topic, which is directly
      entered via a form by one of our users (see the guidelines for making
      annotations). Annotations are distinguished from standard pages by
      their light grey background color, and by the word "ANNOTATION", linked
      to the present page, preceding the title.

      Annotations are not in any way evaluated or selected. Any text entered
      by a user is automatically and immediately published on our webserver,
      and linked into the annotated page (in the lower part of the side bar,
      under the header "Discussion"), and into the general list of all User
      Annotations. The editors are therefore not responsible for, or will not
      in general agree with, the text in an annotation. Although annotations
      as a rule remain available indefinitely, annotations that are no longer
      relevant (e.g. because they point out an error that has been corrected
      since) or that are offensive may be removed.

      Our intention is to provide an open forum for discussion of the content
      of our pages, so that everyone can freely contribute with alternative
      ideas, illustrations, expansions or criticisms. However, this openness
      also means that many annotations are of poor quality, with bad
      spelling, confused ideas, or low relevance to Principia Cybernetica.
      Since the editors do not intervene in the text of an annotation, we can
      only ask the people who make an annotation to reflect well about what
      they will write, and to check their text for mistakes before hitting
      the "Submit" button. The better the text that you submit, the more
      likely that it will be taken seriously by later readers.

      In Principia Cybernetica Web, annotations have the status of
      "Discussion Nodes" (see Consensus building). This is to be contrasted
      with the "Individual Contribution Nodes", which the editors have
      accepted as fulfilling the general requirements of quality, accuracy
      and relevance that characterizes Principia Cybernetica Web. Unlike
      annotations, individual contributions are added to the table of
      contents, alphabetical index and title search index. Individual
      contributions cannot be created automatically, but must be submitted to
      the editorial board. Unlike annotations, they should be seen as
      refereed publications.
