   About Us

   Women Gathered Around Computer. America's 9.1 million women-owned
       businesses employ 27.5 million people and contribute $3.6 trillion
       to the economy - yet women continue to face unique obstacles in the
       world of business. The U.S. Small Business Administration is doing
       more than ever to help level the playing field for women
       entrepreneurs, and the SBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership
       is leading the way.
       OWBO promotes the growth of women-owned businesses through programs
       that address business training and technical assistance, and
       provide access to credit and capital, federal contracts, and
       international trade opportunities. With a women's business
       ownership representative in every SBA district office, a nationwide
       network of mentoring roundtables, women's business centers in
       nearly every state and territory, women-owned venture capital
       companies, and the Online Women's Business Center, OWBO is helping
       unprecedented numbers of women start and build successful
       businesses. At every stage of developing and expanding a successful
       business, the Office of Women's Business Ownership is here to
       counsel, teach, encourage and inspire.
       If you have any questions or need further assistance, please
       contact us.
