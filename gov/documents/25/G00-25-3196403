                            Smart Coastal Growth

   Smart coastal growth maintains a balance among environmental, social,
   economic, and quality of life issues. To achieve this balance, a broad
   spectrum of considerations must be addressed, including cultural
   resources and the values and beliefs of the individuals in the
   community. NOAA Coastal Services Center projects in this theme area
   assist communities in their efforts to incorporate smart growth
   concepts into their planning and decision-making processes.

     * GOAL 1
       Coastal communities will anticipate and manage growth while
       balancing environmental, economic, and social considerations.
     * GOAL 2
       Coastal communities will consider the decision-making process,
       public involvement, and human values and beliefs in managing
       culturally significant resources. Increase capacity of regional
       planners to utilize and apply data and techniques to identify
       sensitive resources that are valued socially and culturally.
