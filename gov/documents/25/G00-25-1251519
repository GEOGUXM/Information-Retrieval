     LANSCE-1 provides the primary technologies to produce
   high-performance accelerator systems for future projects at Los Alamos
   and for applications of national importance. LANSCE-1 performs research
   and development to advance the state-of-the-art in accelerator physics
   and engineering design and analysis. The group designs and builds small
   electron and proton linear accelerators for a variety of applications.
   Group members have a wide range of expertise in linac beam dynamics,
   normal and superconducting rf structures, magnet theory and design,
   fast-magnet pulsed power, beam diagnostic measurements, high-order beam
   optics, storage rings, beam transport, mechanical engineering analysis
   and design, computer aided engineering, drafting, and manufacturing,
   accelerator fabrication, assembly, and commissioning.

   The group operates several facilities: a magnet laboratory for
   fabrication, testing, and measurement of accelerator magnets; an
   accelerating structures laboratory for development and tuning of
   room-temperature and superconducting rf cavities (SCRFLAB); and a
   beam-diagnostic development facility equipped with automated rf and
   electromagnetic diagnostics test equipment and operatered by the
   LANSCE-1 Beam Diagnostics Instrumentation Team (BDIT). . LANSCE-1 is
   home to the Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group (LAACG), which develops,
   maintains, and distributes accelerator design and simulation codes used
   worldwide by the accelerator community.
