       The Office of River Protection was established at the Hanford Site in
        December 1998. As directed by Congress in Section 3139 of the Strom
       Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, the
      U.S. Department of Energy established the Office of River Protection to
                focus management responsibility and accountability.

       The Office of River Protection oversees the Hanford Site's tank waste
       remediation system, which is a large and complex effort to remediate
         60% (by volume) of the nation's and 90% (by radioactivity) of the
          Hanford Site's radioactive waste resulting from nuclear weapons
       development. It includes remediating approximately 190 million curies
          in 53 million gallons of liquid and solid waste that have been
       accumulating in underground storage tanks for more than 50 years and
               143 million curies in cesium and strontium capsules.
