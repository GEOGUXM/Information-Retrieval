      The Secretary of State is the chief election officer for the State of
      Texas. The Secretary of States Elections Division provides assistance
      and advice to election officials on the proper conduct of elections.
      This includes hosting seminars and elections schools, providing
      calendars, ballot certification, primary election funding, and legal
      interpretations of election laws to election officials. We also provide
      assistance to the general public on voter registration and other
      election issues through our 1-800 toll-free number, 1-800-252-VOTE
      (8683), and via the Internet at elections@sos.state.tx.us.

      The Elections Division administers and maintains the Texas Voter
      Registration System, which is an online voter registration application
      designed for county officials to maintain accurate and efficient voter
      registration rolls. Currently, over 120 counties are online with TVRS.
      In addition, we maintain a statewide master file of all registered
      voters.

      Lastly, we facilitate the Project V.O.T.E. (Voters of Tomorrow through
      Education), which is a nonpartisan, statewide voter education program
      for students, pre-K through twelfth grade. This program is designed to
      educate Texas students about voting and the legislative process.
