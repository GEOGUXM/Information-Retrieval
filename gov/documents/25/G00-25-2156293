                            Health Services Unit

   The Health Services Unit, administered by the Human Resources Division,
   is located in Boulder in the garden level of the David Skaggs Research
   Center. Services are available to provide treatment for common
   illnesses (like colds and upset stomachs) and injuries (like cuts and
   back strains) occurring at work or at home. Registered nurses are
   available every workday from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.. A physician and
   an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) counselor can be seen by
   appointment. All services are provided free of charge. Staff can be
   reached at (303) 497-3801.

   Additional services provided include:
     * Allergy shots and immunizations (including an annual Influenza
       immunization);
     * Multiphasic screening examinations;
     * First Aid/CPR classes;
     * Health education classes, videos, and materials;
     * Referrals to private physicians;
     * Assistance with Workers' Compensation questions and claims;
     * Special exams as required by OSHA.

   The services provided are not a substitute for the services of your own
   private doctor. The Health Services staff can help you determine when
   it is appropriate to seek additional medical attention and they often
   work in collaboration with private physicians. They also can provide
   information about medical specialists.

   All medical information is protected under the Privacy Act and is
   available only on the written request of the employee. Counseling
   records are maintained by the Employee Assistance Program contractor in
   a location off of the DOC Boulder campus. The Employee Medical Folder
   of separated employees is forwarded to the National Personnel Records
   Center.

   Good health to you and yours!
