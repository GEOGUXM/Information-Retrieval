   Description: This is a point dataset with two accompanying 'sample
   tables' that summarizes the results of the study to inventory abandoned
   vessels and barges in Louisiana coastal waters. Such containers may
   hold oil or other hazardous wastes which could be released into the
   environment, or are potential repositories for future illegal hazardous
   waste dumping. The information gathered included location of the
   vessel, identification of the vessel and owner if determinable, and a
   priority based on its hazard potential. If hazardous materials were
   found on board, they were sampled for analysis. The sampling procedure
   called for two samples (a surface and a bottom sludge sample) to be
   taken from every compartment of every vessel. The dataset is in
   Arc/INFO export file format. A fully compliant FGDC metadata record is
   available at the Identifier given below.
