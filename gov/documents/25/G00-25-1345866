                                  Co-chair
                          Community Liaison Council

   I am the president of the Wyngate Citizens Association and co-chair of
   the Community Liaison Council (CLC) with Janyce Hedetniemi.  The CLC,
   which comprises individuals from area communities, is the formal
   representation of NIHs commitment in involving the community in
   decisions that affect their neighborhood.  We take great pride in this
   role, and we are always open to ideas and suggestions to better
   represent the community to NIH.

   The CLC is the first tier of review and comment on NIHs implementation
   of the master plan.  As such, we have become collectively well-versed
   in building design and construction.  Our representation on the CLC
   alerts us to many of NIHs activities, which we in turn, tell our
   individual constituents.

   On our Web site, you can take an active part in what we do:

   ·         Read the minutes from current and past CLC meetings to see
   what issues may affect your neighborhood.

   ·         Learn who the representatives are on the CLC;

   ·         Contact those representatives in your neighborhood to bring
   up issues that need to be addressed; and

   ·         Send us an e-mail and let us know how we can better represent
   you.

   We hope that you will find this information useful and informative.
