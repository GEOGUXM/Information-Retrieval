   Background

      The NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR) manages the
      NIH Consensus Development Program, the focal point for evidence-based
      assessments of medical practice and state-of-the-science on behalf of
      the medical community and the public. Under this program, OMAR
      organizes major conferences that produce consensus statements and
      state-of-the-science statements on controversial issues in medicine
      important to health care providers, patients, and the general public.
      NIH Consensus Statements and State of the Science Statements are
      disseminated widely, and more than 120 NIH Consensus Statements and
      State-of-the-Science Statements have been issued since the program's
      inception in 1977. Organizationally, OMAR is under the Associate
      Director for Disease Prevention in the Office of the Director at NIH.
