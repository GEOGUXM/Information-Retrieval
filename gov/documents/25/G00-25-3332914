                   Modified Magnetism at Buried Interfaces
     __________________________________________________________________

   As we enter into the era of nanoscience, where effects due to surfaces
   and interfaces often dominate, researchers more than ever need
   experimental techniques that allow them to discriminate between what
   goes on at the boundaries and in the interior of nanostructures. A team
   of two Berkeley Lab materials scientists has used x-ray standing waves
   generated with circularly polarized soft x rays at the ALS to do just
   that for palladium/cobalt/palladium trilayers similar to those that
   exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). With their technique,
   the two researchers demonstrated quantitatively that the magnetic
   properties at a palladium/cobalt interface differed from those in the
   center of the cobalt layer. Other groups are already adopting this
   approach in their own studies of buried interfaces in nanolayer
   structures.

   In a magnetic material, the magnetization usually prefers to point in
   certain "easy" crystallographic directions because the energy is lower.
   In a thin film, the easy directions typically lie in the plane of the
   film. PMA refers to the tendency in some ultrathin magnetic layers for
   the magnetization to point out of the plane, especially if the magnetic
   layer is also bounded by top and bottom metallic layers. PMA is one of
   several phenomena, such as giant magnetoresistance, exchange bias, and
   spin tunneling, that make devices based on nanolayer structures
   attractive for magnetic data storage, memory, and related applications.

   X rays reflecting from the W/B[4]C multilayer generate a standing wave
   pattern that extends into the overlying Pd/Co/Pd trilayer (above). The
      intensity distribution of the standing wave varies with angle of
    incidence q, thereby providing a way to examine how magnetic behavior
                   varies with depth z in the Co (below).

                    The Buried Face of Magnetism Revealed

   Interest in the novel behaviors that can arise as magnetic materials
   become thinner and thinner arises in part because they form the basis
   for advanced magnetic data storage and other devices. Some years ago,
   researchers discovered the curious phenomenon of perpendicular magnetic
   anistropy (PMA) in very thin magnetic layers only a few atoms thick
   that are sandwiched between layers of nonmagnetic metals. Usually, the
   magnetic field direction lies in the layer, but PMA causes it to
   sometimes point up or down.

   Understanding just why thinness causes these effects requires the
   ability to peer into each layer and especially at the boundaries
   (interfaces) between the magnetic layer and its neighbors, which
   scientists suspect may hold the keys to what is going on. Combining two
   established x-ray techniques, one that zeroes in on any selected depth
   below the surface and one that probes magnetism, two Berkeley Lab
   researchers have used the ALS to demonstrate that magnetic behavior at
   the interface between a layer of the PMA material cobalt only 2
   nanometers thick and bounding palladium metal layers is indeed
   different from that in the center of the cobalt.


   To explain the basics of PMA, researchers often use a phenomenological
   model due to Néel in which a surface term inversely proportional to the
   layer thickness lowers the energy of the perpendicular relative to the
   in-plane orientation as the thickness decreases. However, researchers
   are not able to rule out other microstructural effects, such as
   anisotropic strain or chemical intermixing at the interface between the
   magnetic and metal layers, in part because experimental techniques
   average over depths of two to three nanometers and thus cannot resolve
   physical effects localized at an interface.

   To address this issue, the Berkeley Lab team adapted the established
   technique of x-ray standing wave spectroscopy by combining it with
   circularly polarized synchrotron radiation. Standing waves build up
   within multilayer mirrors owing to the constructive and destructive
   interference of the waves reflected from each interface in the
   multilayer. Such a standing wave will extend through a PMA trilayer
   grown on top of the standing-wave generator. The difference in the
   absorption of left and right circularly polarized x rays (magnetic
   circular dichroism or MCD) at the cobalt L edges probes the cobalt
   magnetic properties. Since the depths of the periodic intensity maxima
   depend on the reflection (incidence) angle, it is possible to scan the
   standing wave vertically through the trilayer and to resolve the depth
   dependence of the dichroism by varying the angle.

                            Co absorption spectra


   Absorption by Co of a standing wave consisting of circularly polarized
      x rays varies not only with photon energy and the helicity of the
   polarization but on the scattering vector Q (related to the reflection
     angle q). Q scans show that the absorption and, hence, the magnetic
   properties, are different in the middle of the Co layer (Q = 0.16) and
                    at the interface with Pd (Q = 0.17).


   The team chose to investigate a palladium/cobalt/palladium trilayer on
   a W/B[4]C multilayer standing-wave generator. With the cobalt layer
   thickness used (2 nm), PMA does not occur, but precursor interfacial
   effects were expected to become prominent. The experimental results
   showed exactly that, as the researchers obtained cobalt MCD spectra
   over a range of angles that probed from one palladium interface to the
   center of the cobalt layer. From the MCD data, they extracted values of
   the number of missing electrons (holes) in the magnetically active
   cobalt d states and of the associated spin and orbital magnetic
   moments. The team interpreted increases in the number of d holes and
   the orbital moment near the interface in terms of hybridization of
   cobalt with palladium states at the interface and concluded that the
   two-term surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy model of Néel is
   oversimplified.

         depth dependent magnetic cirular spectra withy layer model

   Analysis of the depth-dependent magnetic circular dichroism spectra
   yield the number of holes n[h] in d states and their orbital and spin
   magnetic moments in the Co layer. The changing values with depth
   suggest a model attributing the behavior to chemical modifications near
   the Co/Pd interface.
