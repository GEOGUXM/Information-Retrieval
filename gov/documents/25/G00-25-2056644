   The ORS represents one of the largest organizations at the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH), employing approximately 1,400 people. ORS
   is NIH's primary provider of basic support services that are required
   for NIH programs to function and prosper, including:
     * Master planning, space and facilities planning
     * Space and facility management and maintenance, building renovation
       and construction, utilities management, custodial services
     * Biomedical engineering and instrumentation resources
     * Medical arts and photography, comprehensive research library
       support, veterinary resources, conference and events management
     * Occupational and radiation safety, environmental protection,
       occupational medical services, waste management and disposal
     * Security and public safety, crime prevention, employee
       transportation services
     * Mail and printing services, management of food, travel,
       interpreting, child care, fitness service contracts and other
       employee amenities

   ORS activities impact directly and indirectly many organizations and
   people including NIH ICs, scientific, administrative, and support
   staff, patients, volunteers, visitors, contractors and suppliers,
   providers of services (such as utilities, public transportation, rental
   space), other government organizations and agencies (FDA intramural
   programs, regulatory agencies, state and local governments, planning
   commissions), the surrounding neighborhood and the business community.
   ORS must respond to the priorities of the NIH and IC management, NIH
   employees, and patients by providing an exemplary physical and service
   infrastructure that will support new scientific challenges, strengthen
   the unique NIH research environment, and enhance the quality of life
   for all who come in contact with NIH.

WHAT DOES ORS DO?

   The NIH is much like a small town with its own utilities, hospital,
   library, mail facilities, and police and fire departments, all of which
   are managed within the NIH, under the Office of Research Services
   (ORS). The ORS's role is similar to that of a city government; it
   manages many of the resources and municipal services necessary to
   support biomedical research, the primary focus of NIH.

   A few examples demonstrate the scope and significance of ORS
   activities. The ORS:

     Handles approximately 33,000 pieces of US Postal Service mail daily,
   the same as the Post Office in the town of Olney, Maryland.

     Maintains:
     * 10 1/2 miles of roads
     * over 15 miles of sidewalks
     * over 42 acres of surface parking lots and 30 acres of garage
       parking areas
     * 168 acres of lawn,
     * 12 1/2 acres of shrub and flower-beds.

     Collects, transports and arranges for the appropriate disposal of
   tens of thousands of metric tons of solid waste each year and supports
   an extensive recycling program.

     Installs and maintains large utility distribution systems that
   provide electricity, steam and chilled water to campus facilities. (The
   NIH is PEPCO's largest single customer consuming roughly 360 million
   kilowatt-hours of electricity yearly.)

     Provides oversight of a number of "employee amenities", including
   cafeterias, on-campus housing, day care centers, a bank, a credit
   union, a barber and beauty shop, a Recreation and Welfare Association,
   and two fitness centers.

     Undertakes, on behalf of the NIH and the surrounding community,
   comprehensive environmental and master planning to guide future campus
   development.

     Functions as "owner and facility manager" of the more than 100
   NIH-owned and leased facilities in the Bethesda/Rockville/Poolesville,
   Maryland; Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Montana; and NIEHS, Research
   Triangle, N.C. Between 1991 and 1999, ORS acquired more than 980,000
   square feet of off campus rental space. As "owner and facility
   manager," ORS provides large numbers of professional, technical,
   support staff and other resources for building operation, maintenance
   and repair, housekeeping, and space management services.

     Plans and directs the ambitious construction and renovation program
   for buildings and campus utility systems, and the addition of seven
   major new facilities through the year 2002.

Division of Intramural Research Services

   In the NIH laboratories, the Division of Intramural Research Services
   (DIRS) and scientists strive to increase our knowledge of fundamental
   life processes and combat fatal and disabling diseases. The Intramural
   Activities of ORS contribute to the advancement of biomedical research
   by supporting these efforts through specialized services and products
   for NIH intramural investigators.

Division of Safety

   The Division of Safety (DS) was established as the first organization
   providing comprehensive safety and health services on the Bethesda
   campus. This was stimulated by new laws and regulations that were
   enacted in the 60's and 70's; executive orders that were issued; and
   the public which had become more aware of the challenges concerning the
   environment, hazardous substances and workplace safety.
   __________________________________________________________________

Division of Support Services

   The Division of Support Services (DSS) is a leader in anticipating
   emerging technologies, changing business environments, and evolving
   customer requirements and is the "best there is" at supporting the NIH
   community to obtain the best value in specialized support services.
