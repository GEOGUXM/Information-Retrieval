      The Research and Development Laboratory-Wellsboro (RDL-W) is located on
      55 acres near Wellsboro, Pennsylvania (Tioga County). Laboratory
      facilities include 3 modern buildings, 8x200-foot concrete raceways, 3
      production wells, and support equipment.

   Core Capabilities

      The RDL-W conducts research for restoration of depleted fisheries and
      other aquatic biological resources. A diversified research program in
      ecology, conservation technology, genetics, and physiology emphases the
      integration of laboratory and field studies to develop scientifically
      sound approaches to the management of aquatic ecosystems. Research is
      directed primarily towards development of information and technology to
      increase understanding of aquatic ecosystems in the northeastern United
      States and to assist client agencies to better manage these ecosystems
      and their biota. Technical assistance is provided to clients throughout
      the nation.

   Selected Research Areas

        * Intermittent Fluidization of Granular Limestone Beds with CO2
          Pretreatment for Enhanced Mitigation of Acid Mine Drainage.
        * Develop National Fish Broodstock Database (NFBD).
        * Conservation Engineering.
        * Feeding Ecology of Double-crested Cormorants in Lake Ontario.
        * Development of Techniques to Produce Juvenile Freshwater Mussels
          for Research and Restoration.
        * Development of an Index of Biotic Integrity for Fish Communities on
          the Delaware River Mainstem and Tributaries Subject to
          Perturbations from Urbanization.
