   Hydrology, Geochemistry and Geology (EES-6)
   Group Leader: Greg Valentine | Group Members

   Description
   Our mission is to apply observational, analytical, experimental, and
   modeling approaches to complex problems in geology, subsurface fluid
   flow and transport, and geomaterials. EES-6 includes more than 70
   research staff and technicians, who integrate the above approaches to
   address a variety of basic-research and applied issues. These issues
   include transport of radioactive contamination in saturated and
   unsaturated hydrologic systems, basin-scale hydrology, subsurface and
   mineral sequestration of atmospheric carbon, zero-emission coal
   technology, stochastic reservoir simulation, volcanic geology and
   hazards, novel applications of engineered geologic materials, and the
   origin of life. Alongside our outstanding computational modeling
   capabilities, a centerpiece of the groups research effort is our
   Geochemistry and Geomaterials Research Laboratory, which houses many
   state-of-the-art analytical instruments, including an electron
   microprobe, scanning electron microscope, x-ray fluorescence
   spectrometer, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer; gas
   chromatographs; and x-ray diffractometers. Our groups major
   capabilities are described below.

   Basic & Applied Research Areas
   More than 70 research staff and technicians integrate the above
   approaches in to work on a variety of research topics:
     * transport of radioactive contamination in saturated and unsaturated
       hydrologic systems,
     * basin-scale hydrology,
     * subsurface and mineral sequestration of atmospheric carbon,
     * zero-emission coal technology;
     * stochastic reservoir simulation,
     * volcanic geology and hazards,
     * novel applications of engineered geologic materials, and
     * origin of life.

     Research Laboratory: The Geochemistry and Geomaterials Research
     Laboratory, a centerpiece of the group's experimental research
     effort, houses many state-of-the-art analytical instruments--an
     electron microprobe, scanning electron microscope, x-ray
     fluorescence spectrometer, inductively coupled plasma mass
     spectrometer, gas chromatographs, and x-ray diffractometers.

   Capabilities
   Geology: Our geology capability contributes to our understanding the
   geological framework for a number of EES programs, including three
   major environmental programs (LANL Environmental Restoration [ER]
   Project, Nevada Test Site [NTS]-ER, and Yucca Mountain Project [YMP]);
   national defense programs; and basic research. We characterize geologic
   systems fundamentally (e.g., using petrology, field, and analytical
   geochemistry studies) and develop conceptual models to predict the past
   and future evolution of a geological system. We use these two areas of
   expertise (characterizing systems and developing conceptual models),
   along with data models of geological systems, to generate our numerical
   models.

   Geochemistry: Using our geochemistry capability, we contribute to the
   understanding fundamental properties of earth materials (solids and
   fluids) for a range of EES Division programs, including environmental
   programs (LANL-ER, NTS-ER, and YMP), national defense programs, and
   basic research. This capability includes both theoretical and applied
   approaches to geological and environmental fluids (primarily aqueous
   fluids) and to geological and environmental solids (primarily minerals
   and clays/colloids). We have developed a number of unique laboratory-
   and field-based analytical tools to support our efforts, and we rely on
   a host of geochemical and mineralogical modeling methods to predict
   behavior and properties. Our results are used to predict how a
   geological material (solid or fluid) evolved or will evolve in response
   to changes in its environment.

   Subsurface Flow and Transport: We are modeling complex real-world
   environmental problems in subsurface flow and transport, incorporating
   laboratory and field-test results into our numerical models. An example
   of an integrated field, laboratory, and modeling effort being conducted
   by our group is the Busted Butte Transport Test at the Yucca Mountain
   site, which we are leading. Other applications of our
   subsurface-flow-and-transport capability include studying multiphase,
   reactive flow and transport around waste disposal sites in fractured,
   unsaturated rocks; analyzing hydrogeochemical processes in saturated
   zones; evaluating regional water resources; and studying the migration
   of radionuclides, organic solvents, and vapor-phase contaminants.

   Stochastic Processes and Petroleum Reservoirs: The groups capabilities
   in stochastic processes and petroleum reservoirs are focused on
   uncertainty analyses of fluid flow and mass transport in heterogeneous
   porous and fractured media. Current applications include petroleum
   reservoir simulation and the subsurface flow and transport associated
   with radioactive waste disposal. New applications of these capabilities
   include studies in the sequestration of excess atmospheric carbon in
   petroleum reservoirs.

   Carbon Sequestration: The majority of EES-6s research on carbon
   sequestration is focused on the formation of carbonate minerals as a
   way to sequester CO2. (add another line elaborating on this.) In
   addition to our carbonate minerals effort, a member of our group has
   pioneered the overall zero-emission coal effort, forming a team of
   thirteen entities from the U.S. and Canada with interests in coal
   production and the use of coal for electrical generation. This team
   (the Zero Emission Coal Alliance) plans to pilot their process within
   five years and eventually to commericalize the process. Zero-emission
   coal technology fits well with DOEs Clean Coal Technology programs and
   vision.

   Recent Accomplishments
   Some of our recent accomplishments, many of which are described in the
   Project Descriptions and Research Highlights sections of this report,
   include
     * Completing field and modeling studies aimed at explaining apparent
       rapid transport of plutonium in ground water surrounding the Benham
       underground nuclear test at NTS.
     * Producing a major expansion of the "Hydrogeologic Atlas of the Los
       Alamos Area," coupled with successful modeling of canyon
       groundwater systems on the Pajarito Plateau.
     * Discovering two new species of hominid in Afar Rift (Africa), ages
       5.4 - 6.2 million years (collaborative project with UC Berkeley).
     * Developing a conceptual model of volcanic process for the Total
       System Performance Assessment being conducted by the Yucca Mountain
       Project.
     * Developing a moment-equation approach for two-phase flow in porous
       media.
     * Establishing the Zero Emission Coal Alliance with industry partners
       and conducting associated coal-to-hydrogen studies.

   Vision for the Future
   Our vision is to apply cutting-edge experimental,
   computational-modeling, and observational studies to complex problems
   involving subsurface flow and transport, geomaterials, and geology. We
   will apply these approaches to help solve environmental, energy, and
   defense-related problems.
