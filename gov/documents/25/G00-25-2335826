   Welcome to EDIS On-Line (EOL), which provides Internet access to public
   documents filed with the Secretary's Office in USITC investigations.
   Use EOL to obtain docketing information and to view images and request
   print copies of the public documents filed in USITC investigations
   instituted since 1996.

   Our goal is to provide you with up-to-date access to dockets
   information. Documents are scanned on a "first-in/first-out" basis. To
   assist us in providing more timely response, please use the EDIS cover
   sheet whenever filing documents with the USITC.

   I encourage you to use this service and share your comments with me and
   the Commission. I can be contacted by e-mail at dockets@usitc.gov and
   by telephone at 202-205-2000.

   Donna R. Koehnke
          Secretary
