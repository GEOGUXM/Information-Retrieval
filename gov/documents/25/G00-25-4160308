                           FEDERAL GRANT RESOURCES

       The U.S. Small Business Administration provides a variety of
       technical, financial and advocacy services to America's small
       business community. The Agency's small business financial
       assistance programs are comprised of a wide range of loan programs,
       each targeted at different markets. While SBA does offer a limited
       number of grant programs, these are generally designed to expand
       and enhance small business technical assistance (see Federal and
       State Technology Partnership Program) ; SBA does not offer grants
       to start or expand small businesses. Do however, visit New Markets
       Venture Capital Program.
       SBA's grant programs generally support non-profit organizations,
       intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments
       in an effort to expand and enhance small business technical and
       financial assistance.
