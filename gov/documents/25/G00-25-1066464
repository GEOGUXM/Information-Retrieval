Site Manager's National Committee

   The Site Manager's National Committee major task is to plan the Site
   Manager's meeting held during the Technical Conference each year. This
   is done by surveying site managers for topics of interest, working with
   the Conference Committee to provide speakers that meet the needs of the
   site managers attending.

   If you have ideas, topics of interest, or news that you would like
   other site managers to be aware of, please contact one of the Committee
   Members and share the information.

   The Indian Health Service Site Manager's Committee is made up of a
   Chairperson, Vice Chairperson and a representative from each of the
   Areas within IHS. This year's Committee is made up of:

   Chairperson
   Patricia Price, Site Manager
   Elko Service Unit, Elko, NV
