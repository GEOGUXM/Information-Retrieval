     A 3600-second exposure of the north-west quadrant of the globular
   cluster M92.

   This image was taken by students in the CSLA/JPL Consortium for
   Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) program. They used the JPL
   Table Mountain Observatory's 0.6-m (f/16) Richey-Cretian telescope and
   a Photometrics LTD™ LN2-cooled CH260 CCD camera. This is based upon a
   1024 x 1024 x 24um pixel array. PMIS™ software, running on a 100 MHz
   Pentium PC, controls the camera and the filter-wheel. The Washington
   System "C" filter was used.
