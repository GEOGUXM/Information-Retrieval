   Winter Preparations

   The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center suggests a
   winter that will be colder than the last few years but not as cold as a
   typical winter.

   To temper the spike in prices we experienced last winter, we have
   locked in approximately 15% of your annual volume for the anticipated
   consumption for all of our customers at the rate of $5.14 per MMBtu
   through May 2002. (Unless your facility has agreed to a diffferent
   rate).

   This means that your overall invoice will reflect a weighted average
   cost of gas of 2 different rates, one for the firm fixed price gas
   (15%) and the other at market rates (85%).

   Cost Avoidance Calculations

   The NCUM is in the process of streamlining how cost avoidance (savings)
   is calculated for our customers. This calls for more time to be
   dedicated strictly to contact all of the pipelines and Local
   Distribution Companies (LDCs). This new procedure is being implemented
   for all data from the fourth quarter of FY 01 onward. This will allow
   us to more quickly and accurately supply information to our customers.
   We welcome your comments and input regarding how we may better serve
   your individual natural gas needs.

   Staffing Changes

   Expertise out of National Capital Region. He can be reached at (360)
