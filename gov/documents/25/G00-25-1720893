                         Gamma-Ray Astrophysics 2001

                               April 4-6, 2001
                          Baltimore, Maryland, USA
   The GAMMA 2001 symposium was successfully held in Baltimore, Maryland
   from April 4-6, 2001 and included a Teacher's Workshop and an Advanced
   Compton Telescope Workshop on April 3, 2001. Presentations and Posters
   from the symposium can be submitted and viewed here.
   Proceedings
   Conference proceedings will be published by the American Institute of
   Physics (AIP). All contributors will be invited to submit a manuscript
   for the proceedings. We have decided to delay the submission deadline
   to June 1, 2001, but this is a hard limit. Publication date will be
   approximately October 15 2001. The page limits are 10 for invited talks
   and 5 for contributed talks or posters. The manuscript format must
   conform to the guidelines provided by the AIP. The AIP guidelines are
   available as a pdf document. Templates for LaTeX and MSWord are
   available from the AIP WWW site;
   http://www.aip.org/catalog/publish.html. The use of LaTeX or MSWord is
   not required , as long as AIP guidelines are adhered to. Manuscripts
   can be submitted as photo-ready hard copy, or in a printable electronic
   format (do not send us LaTeX source files). Hard copy should be mailed
   to: Sandy Barnes, Code 661, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt
   Maryland, 20771. Electronic copy should be e-mailed to:
   gamma2001@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov (include 1st author last name and
   paper number in the subject heading). If we are unable to print any
   electronically submitted manuscript, we will notify the author, and
   require that it be corrected and resubmitted.
   Note that the AIP LaTeX package requires that an installation procedure
   be run. This is done by running LaTeX on the file "aipproc.ins".
   References such as "Doe et al., these proceedings" can sometimes be
   problematic, since some authors choose not to submit proceedings
   manuscripts. If you wish to reference work presented at the Gamma 2001
   symposium, we would appreciate that you notify us in a separate e-mail
   at the time of submission. If the paper you reference does not
   materialize, we will ask you to make appropriate changes.

   Technical Session Information:
   The scientific program for Gamma 2001 will contain mixture of invited
   talks, contributed papers, and poster presentations covering the
   current status of observational and theoretical gamma-ray astrophysics.
   Results highlighting the nine years of the CGRO mission, as well as
   related results from space missions -- such as Chandra, XMM-Newton,
   HETE-II, and HESSI -- and from ground-based VHE gamma-ray and radio
   observatories will be major themes. Previews of upcoming gamma-ray
   missions in the new era of imaging gamma-ray instrumentation -- GLAST,
   AGILE, INTEGRAL, and Swift -- are anticipated.
   Topics to be covered include:

   Galactic Astronomy:
          Pulsars, X-rays binaries and other energetic stellar systems,
          novae, supernovae and remnants, molecular clouds, unidentified
          galactic gamma ray sources, interstellar medium, cosmic rays and
          galactic structure, nucleosynthesis.

   Extragalactic Astronomy:
          Active galactic nuclei, Seyfert galaxies, blazars, high latitude
          unidentified sources, cosmic gamma-ray background, nearby normal
          galaxies and clusters.

   Gamma-Ray Bursts*

   Solar Flares*

   Future Missions and Instrumentation

   * these topics will be limited to one oral session each

   Scientific Program:
   The scientific program for the Gamma 2001 Symposium is now finalized.
   An alphabetical listing of submitted abstracts can also be browsed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Special Session:
   On Tuesday, April 3, there will be a pre-conference workshop entitled:
   Advanced Compton Telescope (ACT) for Gamma Ray Astrophysics-II. The
   Workshop will also be held at the Baltimore Hilton. The recent GRAPWG
   report identified ACT as the highest priority new start in the major
   mission category. The emphasis of the workshop will be on instrument
   concepts for an advanced Compton telescope, progress in related
   detector technologies, and simulation activities to support
   instrumental design and performance, background estimation and
   reduction, and instrumental sensitivities. This is the second in a
   series of Workshops related to an Advanced Compton Telescope mission.
   Please check the website: http://gamma.nrl.navy.mil/ngram/ for updated
   plans for the workshop and for information from the first workshop held
   in May, 2000. If you are interested in attending, please contact either
   Jim Kurfess at kurfess@gamma.nrl.navy.mil or Dick Kroeger at
   kroeger@gamma.nrl.navy.mil.
   There is a $25.00 registration fee to attend this workshop

   Education Workshop
          An Education workshop for local middle- and high-school
          educators will be held on the day prior to the opening of the
          technical sessions (Tuesday, April 3). This will involve
          sessions on both hands-on astronomy activities as well as short
          lectures covering a wide range of astronomical topics. A web
          page with information and registration has been set up at:
          http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/compton2001.html

   Public Lecture
          " GALILEO'S HERITAGE: PLANETS, ART AND HISTORY"
          by Dr. Giovanni Bignami, Italian Space Agency
          The public lecture will be held at the Maryland Science Center
          on Wednesday evening, April 4, at 7:30 PM. Doors will open at
          7:00, but note that the entrance for the lecture is at the rear
          of the building - "Members Entrance", not on the harbor side
          (some parts of the center are closed at night). There will also
          be a Planetarium show, entitled "The Raging Sun" (about 20
          minutes long) after the lecture; both are in the planetarium,
          which seats 140. This will be free to the public. They also have
          access to the "Space Link" exhibit area prior to and after the
          planetarium show & lecture. The web site for the Maryland
          Science Center is: www.mdsci.org
     __________________________________________________________________

   Conference Banquet
   A conference banquet is being organized for Thursday evening, April 5.
   The banquet will take place at the National Aquarium in Baltimore,
   located in the world-famous Inner Harbor. Follow the journey of water
   around the world and meet its exotic inhabitants  puffins and seals,
   stingrays and piranha, an electric eel and more  up close and personal.
   The menu will feature a taste of Maryland, focusing on Baltimore with
   its Little Italy, Fells Point and Lombard Street cuisines. There will
   be something for everyone.

   International Fax: (410) 625-1060
   Hilton Baltimore & Towers - The Hilton will serve as the conference
   location. A block of rooms has been reserved at the current government
   per diem rate of $110 per night for a single room, $130 per night for
   double, and $150 for Triple and Quads (plus 12.5% state and local
   taxes). Valet parking is available thru the hotel at a cost of $21.00
   per day with in & out privileges. The daily valet parking to attend the
   meeting only is $18.00 per day. But there are many parking garages at
   reasonable costs in walking distance of the hotel.
