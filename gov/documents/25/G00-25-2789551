   DON'T FORGET THAT THE BEST WAY TO ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTIONS IS TO  USE
   THE ON-LINE MANUAL PAGE.

   To use the on-line manual page just type "man <command>," substitute
   the command you are looking up for <command>. If you're not sure what
   the exact command is, type man -k <command>, substitute a word that
   describes what you want to do for <command>.

   OR, you can click on the Manual Page icon at the top of your screen (If
   it isn't there, see "To restore your Manual Page" below). Click on the
   "Options" selection in the pull-down menu (hold the left button down).
   Select "Search." If you know the exact command that you are looking up,
   type that command in and select "Man Page." If you are not sure what
   the exact command is, type in a word that describes the command that
   you want to find and select "Apropos."

  1. I have lost my "____" icon. How do I start it up again?

   To restore the Mail

     zmail -gui &

     or

     Go to the pull-down menu under "Find." Then select "Icon Catalog,"
     next select applications. You should see the MediaMail icon --
     double-click with the left mouse button on the icon to start
     MediaMail.

   To restore your Manual Page

   xman &

   or

   Go to the pull-down menu under "Find." Then select "An Icon." When the
   small box appears, type "xman" in it with NO RETURN. Double-click on
   the icon that comes up.

   To start the Console

   Go to the pull-down menu under "System." Then select "Start New
   Console."

   Other Popular Applications:

   To start the calculator

   xcalc &

   or

   xcalc -rpn -stipple & (rpn = Hewlett Packard style; stipple = stippled
   background)

   To start the News Reader

   xrn &

   To start the Internet Access

   Mosaic & (Note the uppercase `M')

   To start the Graphics Viewer

   xv &

   (Remember, you must be in the directory where the pictures are located,
   SO . . . before you start the viewer, change directory to News -- cd
   News -- from your home directory) When the xv viewer comes up, place
   your mouse in the window and press the right mouse button.

   To start the Sound Utility

   soundfiler &

   (You must be in the directory where the sound files are located)

   To start the CD Music Player

   cdman & (Or, find the cdman icon under "Find" -- "Icon Catalog" --
   "Media Tools." OR-- Double-click on the cdrom small-icon when you have
   a music CD loaded). You control the volume with "Audio Control Panel"
   under Utilities in the cdman window.

  2. How do I change my password?

   yppasswd

   After you use this command to change your password the change will not
   take effect for about an hour.

  3. I forgot my password -- can you tell me what it is?

   No one on the system can tell what your password is -- not even the
   system administrator (it's encoded and can't be decoded). The only
   thing that the system administrator can do is remove your password and
   change it to a new one. If you have forgotten your password, you should
   contact your local TIPS site administrator (the person that has the
   password to turn your machine off) and have them send a request to
   "system" to get your password deleted and changed.

  4. How can we add new users to our machine?

   Contact your local TIPS site administrator (the person in your agency
   that can power-off your machine). The administrator will write to
   "system" (without the quote marks of course), requesting that new users
   be added. Be sure to include the full name of each new user. Your
   friendly System Administrator will write back when the new user logins
   are set up.

  5. I get the following message in my backup report, what does it mean?

   bru: warning - unrecoverable error, assuming end of volume 1

   bru: warning - close error on archive: I/O error

   bru: "/dev/tty": warning - can't open for interaction: No such device
   or address

   bru: load volume 2 and enter device [default: /dev/tape] >>

   It means your backup that was supposed to occur on the previous evening
   was not successful. The cause of that can be one of several things:

   1. Almost all of the tape drives fail occasionally on the backups. If
   it happens frequently, you've got other problems -- see the remaining
   reasons.

   2. Your tape is old and worn out. It no longer makes a good backup and
   you should replace it with a new tape.

   3. You may be using "KAO" Brand tapes -- we've found that the tape
   drives don't like that brand.

   4. The cables to your tape drive are faulty or their connections are
   loose. Check the cable connections before asking for help.

   5. The tapes are supposed to hold 2 GB of data. We've found that
   commonly they only hold about 1.8 GB. Check your disk use (on the /usr)
   directory with the "df" command. If your disk is 90% full or more you
   may be exceeding the tape's ability to hold data. Contact us (see
   below) and we can arrange for your backups to compress files during
   backup to hold all the data on one tape.

   6. If all else fails . . . your tape drive may be broke. Get help from
   TIPS, see "What is the best way to get help from TIPS" below.

  6. How can I write data to my tape drive?

   A lot of people don't realize that the tape drive is not just for
   backups. To store data on tape all you have to do is:

   tar cv <full pathname of the data you want to store>

   Bear in mind that "tar cv" overwrites anything that's on the tape. If
   you want to ADD to whatever is already on the tape you must use the
   command, "tar rv <pathname>"

   To retrieve the data from the tape drive:

   tar xv

   This restores it directly to the pathname that it originally came from.
   Your tape drive can hold up to about 1.8 GB -- yes, GIGAbytes! To get
   more details about how to use the "tar" command, just look up "tar" in
   your online manual page.

  7. How can I write to my floppy drive?

   Your floppy drive has been setup to work outside of SoftPC. In this
   manner it can be used for both UNIX and DOS data. All you have to do is
   put a floppy disk in the drive and watch the floppy icon in the
   background of your screen. In a few seconds it will have a picture of a
   floppy disk sticking out of it. This means that it's ready to use. Just
   double click on the floppy icon with your left mouse button. That will
   open a window that will show all of the contents of your floppy drive.
   Next, double click on the folder icon for your directory. That will
   open a window showing the contents of your directory. Make sure that
   you open whatever subdirectory that has the file you want to access and
   then drag the icon for that file to your floppy drive by holding down
   the left mouse button.

   Simple! Just drag and drop!

   For example, if you have a DOS file on floppy that you want to use in
   Reflex, all you have to do is put the floppy in the drive, open the
   floppy window by double clicking on the floppy icon. Then, open your
   home directory folder icon, when that opens, find the folder for your
   e_drive subdirectory -- open that, then open the folder for the Reflex
   subdirectory. Drag the file icon from the floppy contents widow to the
   Reflex directory contents window and the job is done.

  8. How do I eject my floppy disk?

   Just click ONCE on the floppy icon with your left mouse button so that
   the icon turns yellow (this means it's selected). Then, with your mouse
   on the icon or nearby (but still in the background -- NOT IN A
   WINDOW!), hold down the RIGHT mouse button and slide down to the bottom
   selection of the resulting menu to pick "Eject Floppy."

  9. My plotter won't plot.

   This appears to be a problem only with AutoCAD users. The problems seem
   to occur only with plotting to the plotter, not the laser, and they
   occur only when someone has changed their configuration from the
   original TIPS setup. Select "File" from the AutoCAD menu, then select
   "Plot." Make sure the "Plot to File" is selected, then click on the
   "File Name" button. The selected file name MUST be "Autospool,"
   otherwise your plot won't work. This is the way your AutoCAD has been
   configured by TIPS, but you may have changed it at one time to try to
   solve your plotting problems.

  10. What should my plotter settings be?

  11. How do I decode a picture or sound file from the Internet news?

   a. While in the news-reader (xrn), you should be looking at the file
   that you want to decode.

   b. Select the save button with your mouse.

   c. Give the saved file a name (Larger sound or picture files may be
   comprised of more than one file -- be sure to give them each a name
   when you save them).

   d. The files are saved in your News directory (note the uppercase N).
   Leave the news reader, change directory to News (cd News) and start the
   jot editor (jot <filename>)

   e. Edit the file to remove the header information. When you're
   finished, your first line should read "begin 644" (or whatever number
   may be appropriate). If your picture or sound file is composed of more
   than one file, you need to remove the header information from ALL
   files, and remove any tail information (including any lines that say
   "cut here") from ALL files EXCEPT the last one. In the end you should
   have a beginning file that says "begin 644" and an end file that
   includes the word "end" -- all files in between should be coded
   information ONLY.

   f. At your command line in the winterm window, type the following:

   cat <file1> <file2> <file3> <etc> | uudecode

   This is the process of "concatenating" the files together and "piping"
   them to uudecode. The "pipe" key is the shift of the backslash (\ --
   the one right above the "enter" key -- it looks like two vertical
   lines). If you have only one file, the process is identical, except
   only one file is listed. The result is that you have created a file
   with whatever name was listed after the words "begin 644."

   g. You can now delete the files that you saved from the news.

   h. To view a picture file, use the "xv" utility (see "To start the
   Graphics Viewer" under number 1 above).

   i. To listen to a sound file, type "sfplay <soundfile>" -- OR type
   soundfiler (see "To start the Sound Utility" in number 1 above).

  12. What is the best way to get help from TIPS?

   To get HELP from TIPS -- send mail to system or sysadm fully describing
   your problem. This is the best way for all concerned. Mail to system or
   sysadm goes directly to TIPS' three System Administrators. They can
   each read it and the one with the most expertise in the problem will
   respond. Response time can vary from one minute to 24-hours. Usually an
   Administrator will respond within half an hour. This e-mail system
   allows the administrators to review and discuss your problem as
   necessary to provide you the best answer. It also allows them some
   flexibility to respond when they are best able, whereas a telephone
   question may disrupt an Administrator in the middle of helping another
   user. But, since the inquiry goes to all THREE of the Administrators
   simultaneously, your question usually gets full attention faster than a
   phone call.
