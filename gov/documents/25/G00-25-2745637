Message from the Director Jack E. Snell, Director of BFRL

     Major goals of the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory are to
     improve the productivity of the U.S. construction industry, which
     now faces stiff competition from overseas firms, and to reduce the
     human and economic losses resulting from fires, earthquakes, winds,
     and other hazards. Through performance prediction and measurement
     technologies, as well as technical advances, the laboratory works to
     improve the life-cycle quality of constructed facilities. Its
     products are used by those who own, design, construct, supply, and
     provide for the safety or environmental quality of constructed
     facilities.

     The laboratory studies fire science and fire safety engineering;
     building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; and
     structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of
     the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods,
     performance criteria, and technical data that are incorporated into
     building and fire standards and codes. Staff members are involved in
     more than 100 activities to develop voluntary standards.

     The laboratory conducts investigations at the scene of major fires
     as well as structural failures due to earthquakes, hurricanes, or
     other causes. The knowledge gained from these investigations guides
     research and is applied to recommendations for design and
     construction practices to reduce hazards.
