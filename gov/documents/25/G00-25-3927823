   The Space Action Team (SAT) is an integrated multidiscipline,
   multi-directorate, cross-trained team of diverse talents and skills
   dedicated to safely, economically, and efficiently plan and execute
   facility projects to support Laboratory missions. The team's functional
   capabilities comprise Facility, Project, and Assurance Management staff
   coupled with Hazardous Waste Management (HWM), ES&H technicians, and
   craft support, teamed with professional ES&H disciplines.
   The SAT has two primary objectives. Work in partnership with its
   customers to support facility-related issues and concerns that impact
   client's research activities. Secondly, manage the laboratories surplus
   and excess facilities transition process into a lowest cost safest
   configuration. If a facility's disposition is determined as end of life
   cycle, the SAT designs and executes the decontamination and demolition
   process. SAT uses a cradle-to-grave process to achieve this, working
   hand-in-hand with its customers to define and execute their projects.
   The team's staffing configuration is designed to implement moderate to
   high-risk facility projects.

   FY9501 project categories include:
     * Decontamination and demolition of perchloric/beryllium contaminated
       exhaust systems.
     * Deactivation to lowest safest cost of 33 surplus or excess research
       buildings pending disposition.
     * Decontamination and demolition of 16 Laboratory surplused R&D real
       property facilities.
     * Planning and execution of over 260 programmatic research relocation
       and/or disposal activities (e.g., wet chemistry labs, physics labs,
       surplus low-level waste).
     * Supporting division-level organizations in their migrationjointly
       accomplishing the following:
          + colocation of functional groups to enhance collaborative
            research activities,
          + lowering operating costs and enhanced facility capabilities,
          + coordinating more efficient use of space, and
          + releasing and disposing nonessential surplus contaminated
            equipment and property.

   SAT, based in the CMS Directorate, operates as a service organization
   and supports clients throughout the Laboratory. SAT's methodology is
   outlined in two site-wide Operating Safety Procedures (OSPs) developed
   specifically for the team's unique operations and missions.
   For its efforts in recycling excess buildings, the SAT received a US
   EPA award for "Champions of Green Government" and an award from the DOE
   for "Pollution Prevention" (page 3, Sept. 21, 2001 edition of
   Newsline).
