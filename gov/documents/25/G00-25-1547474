   Subject / Author Alert Service

   Let the staff at the Scientific Library set up an Alert, or current
   awareness search, for you. Alerts can be run weekly, monthly or
   quarterly, depending on the database. This service enables you to
   receive timely updates on the latest developments in the area of your
   choice. Alerts are mailed directly to your e-mail address.
   We can create Alert profiles to:

   [di.gif] Monitor news and journal coverage of your research area
   [di.gif] Track advances in research and development
   [di.gif] Uncover important technological advances
   [di.gif] Stay current on biomedical and drug research
   [di.gif] Identify new research opportunities
   [di.gif] Track product life cycles
   [di.gif] Stay abreast of regulations and legislation

   Any possible search costs that may accrue are charged back to
   individual programs.  If this need arises, you will be contacted for
   approval and signature authorization.

   Please e-mail the Instructional Resources Librarian, or call x5840, for
   more information, or to request a search.

   Tables of Contents Alert Service Via PORPOISE

      E-mail delivery of journal tables of contents is generated using the
      Web of Science/PORPOISE feature. NCI-Frederick employees may establish
      an individualized list of journal titles for which they will receive
      contents pages for their personal use via e-mail from the web-based
      versions of Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index,
      updated weekly. Library staff  are available to assist in creating
      initial profiles, but due to the security features of the system, once
      a profile is established, it may only be changed by the requestor.


     * Simple directions for creating and updating tables of contents
       profiles

      In those rare instances where a desired title is not covered by Web of
      Science, paper copies of the tables of contents will be prepared by
      library staff and sent via inter-office mail upon request. Note that
      this service is limited to those titles subscribed to by the Scientific
      Library, in compliance with copyright law.

      Training sessions in receiving and managing tables of contents
      deliveries by e-mail are offered in the Library and may be scheduled on
      an individual basis.

      Please contact the Document Delivery Technician, at x5850, to inquire
      about titles not covered, obtain assistance in creating a PORPOISE
      profile, schedule a training session, or obtain more specific
      information about this service.
