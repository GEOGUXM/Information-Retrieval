                           Condensed Matter Theory

                              [main_photo.gif]

         Condensed Matter Theory research interacts with the materials
   research program at ANL through a mix of individual theoretical studies
       and collaborative studies with the experimental programs. These
   frequently involve detailed modeling of complex materials and phenomena
   for which new theoretical methods and concepts are developed as needed.
         Research programs are currently carried out in the areas of
     * Superconductivity
     * Electronic Structure and Properties
     * Magnetism
