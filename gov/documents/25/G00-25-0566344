   Over 120 ITS professionals lend their technical expertise to the
   Peer-to-Peer Program. The USDOT carefully selects each participant
   based on his/her qualifications, background, and experience. Most of
   the programs Peers are public sector transportation professionals who
   are active in the planning, design, procurement and implementation of
   ITS. Additional private sector Peers supplement the vast technical
   expertise of the public sector Peers to ensure the program offers the
   most complete coverage of ITS technical issues.

   technical areas and to increase the accessibility to Peers. Nominations
   for additional Peers are accepted on an ongoing basis. Just call the
   Peer-to-Peer program to receive information on nominating yourself or

                                 Responsive

   Any public agency or group that is involved in planning, evaluating,
   making decisions, or operating an ITS system or its components can
   access the Peer-to-Peer Program. The program is designed to provide
   short-term assistance to address specific, technical issues. The
   program staff will listen to the requestor's issues and suggest an
   approach to provide the assistance. Some issues may be resolved
   directly by the program staff; other specific, technical issues may be
   addressed through assistance from a Peer.

   Requestors across the nation have included:
   state DOT headquarters and district offices;
       transit authorities;
       turnpike and tollway authorities;
       metropolitan planning organizations;
       city and county transportation and public works offices; and
       transportation management agencies.

   The Peer-to-Peer Program can be contacted via:

       Telephone: 1-888-700-PEER or 1-888-700-7337
       Fax:       1-410-571-6400

   The Peer-to-Peer Program supplements the FHWA Resource Centers, FTA
   Regional staff, and FMCSA staff who are the primary providers of
   technical assistance. The FHWA Resource Centers or FTA Regional staff
   can be contacted concurrently with the Peer-to-Peer Program to satisfy
   your short-term and longer duration assistance needs.

                                Confidential

   Peers and the programs national office staff are required to hold all
   information confidential within the program. Public release of
   information (for example for a newsletter synopsis) is approved in
   advance by the agencies and Peers involved.

                                    Free

   The Peer-to-Peer Program strives to cover all costs associated with the
   assistance efforts, within the limits of program's guidelines and USDOT
   funding. Recipients of program services are asked to economize whenever
   possible to help the program stretch its resources so it can assist as
   many agencies as possible.

   The Peer-to-Peer Program will pay for travel, accommodations, meals,
   incidental expenses, and similar costs associated with on-site and
   off-site assistance. Requestors may be asked to assist in securing
   overnight accommodations, waive any conference registration fees,
   provide meeting rooms, and similar assistance typical for agencies
   receiving a visitor. Such cooperation enables the program's resources
   to be maximized.
