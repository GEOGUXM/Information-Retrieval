   NASA Marshall is developing technologies for advanced space
   transportation systems that would be 100 times cheaper and 10,000 times
   safer than today's launch vehicles. NASA Marshall also is developing
   technologies to decrease the trip times and reduce the weight of the
   propulsion systems required for interplanetary missions and journeys
   beyond our solar system.
