                 Emergency Services

   Emergency Services is one of Civil Air Patrol's best-known activity. It
     entails air and ground search and rescue, local disaster relief, as
     well as cooperation with and assistance to other emergency services
    agencies. CAP members fly 80 percent of all the hours flown on search
      and rescue missions directed by the Air Force Rescue Coordination
       Center (AFRCC) at Langley Image of Ground Team Air Force Base,
    Virginia. The center coordinates search and rescue efforts within the
      inland search and rescue region (48 contiguous states). Civil Air
     Patrol is also active in Alaska where it is directed in its search
    operations by the Alaskan Air Command Rescue Coordination Center. In
     Hawaii, the CAP works under the direction of the Pacific Air Forces
     Joint Rescue Coordination Center. In Puerto Rico, Civil Air Patrol
       works in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard and local civil
                                authorities.
   In the last five years, CAP crews have been involved in more than 5,500
     search and rescue or other emergency service missions. During this
   time, these volunteers were credited with saving the lives of more than
     425 persons and with locating the objects of their searches nearly
    2,500 times. These missions required more than 92,000 hours of flying
                                    time.

   CAP, as well as members who fly their own airplanes on these missions,
      are reimbursed by the Air Force for fuel, oil, and communication
   expenses. In addition, the Air Force now provides maintenance costs for
               these as well as for certain training missions.

       Often, CAP members also help out in missions which may involve
      airlifting blood or donor organs, medication and civil or relief
   officials to disaster areas. Disaster relief missions may also involve
    air surveillance of disaster areas, as well as the air evacuation of
   the stranded, sick or injured. Rescue work and aid are provided during
           floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other emergencies.
   CAP maintains a nationwide network of over 20,000 radio stations which
     provides an invaluable backup to state, local civil defense and Air
     Force communications. Locally, the stations support state disaster
    plans and provide communications for CAP search and rescue and other
                          disaster relief missions.
