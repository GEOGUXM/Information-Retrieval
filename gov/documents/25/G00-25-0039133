   N O T I C E ALL MEMBERS OF THE BANKRUPTCY BAR WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
   Please be advised that revised Administrative Procedures for Filing,
   Signing and Verifying Pleadings and Papers by Electronic Means has been
   published and are effective immediately. A copy of the revision is
   attached for your convenience. Specifically I direct your attention to
   Section II, Paragraph E and Paragraph F where changes have been made.
   Basically the procedures eliminate the requirement to submit proposed
   orders along with applications/motions. Additionally, original exhibits
   and/or attachments to pleadings should be retained by the filer and a
   summary of what the exhibit/attachment reflects should be attached to
   the document being filed. Also, for your information, several questions
   on the subject of submission of orders were raised at the Bench Bar
   Conference held in San Antonio in early September. In an effort to
   enlighten you on the reasoning behind the changes we have implemented,
   I ask you to read an informal memorandum prepared by Judge Larry E.
   Kelly. The memorandum is attached to this notice along with the revised
   procedures. Lawrence T. Bick Clerk of Court November 14, 2001 Rev.

   11/01 E. ORDERS 1. Orders on Motions with "20 day" or "15 day"
   "negative notice language" found in Bankruptcy Local Rules
   4001(a)(1)(B) or 9014(a). After the expiration of the last date for
   serving and filing objections, if none have been filed, the moving
   party shall submit to the court an order for entry that grants the
   relief requested in the original pleading. In addition, the following
   paragraph shall be appended at the end of the order, before the
   signature line: The entity submitting this order represents to the
   court that the underlying motion was filed and served in conformity
   with the local rules, that no pleading or response has been filed in
   opposition thereto, and that the relief to be granted by this order is
   consistent with the relief plead for in that motion." Two (2) lines
   below the line for the court's signature, at the left margin, the
   following information regarding the submitting entity shall be
   submitted: "This order was prepared and is being submitted by: Firm
   name By _____________ Attorney for (party)" 2. All Other Orders On all
   pleadings filed without "negative notice language", moving parties must
   separately submit a form of order for entry by the court for each
   pleading for which relief is requested, whether it is an ex parte
   matter [Bank. L. Rule 9013(c)], a motion seeking expedited treatment
   [Bank. L. Rule 9013(d)], an application, or a contested matter either
   in a case or in an adversary proceeding within a case. 3. Cover Sheets
   All orders being submitted to the court shall be accompanied by a cover
   sheet. The court is working on a procedure to enable parties to submit
   orders electronically which will require a specific description on the
   "subject line". The current Order Submission Form found in Appendix
   L-9022 is outdated. For this reason, the -4- Rev. 11/01 court's current
   Cover Sheet found in its local rules as Appendix L-9022 is hereby
   abrogated and a new form of Cover Sheet substituted therefor, which is
   to be used for all Orders submitted. The new cover sheet form is
   attached to this document. F. ATTACHMENTS TO PLEADINGS AND PROOF OF
   CLAIMS All exhibits or attachments to pleadings must be summarized. The
   summary only is to be attached to the document that is filed with the
   Court. A copy of the complete exhibit or attachment must be served
   together with the pleading on entities as specified in L. Rule 9013(g).
   If a hearing is required, or if the court otherwise orders, the
   complete exhibit or attachment should be provided to the Court at the
   time of the hearing and served or provided to any objecting party.
   Similarly, all exhibits or attachments to Proof of Claims must be
   summarized and only the summary is to be attached to the Proof of Claim
   that is filed with the Court. Pursuant to L. Rule 3002(a), the complete
   Proof of Claim, including original exhibits, attachments or supporting
   documentation must be served on the Debtor's attorney (or on the
   Debtor, if the Debtor is pro se) and any trustee appointed in the case.
   Upon request, creditors must provide a copy of the original
   documentation to any party objecting to their claim, as well as to the
   Court, in the event of a dispute. G. DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED UNDER SEAL A
   motion to file document(s) under seal may be filed electronically;
   however, the actual document(s) to be filed under seal shall be filed
   conventionally and only after the motion is granted. The order of the
   court authorizing the filing of such document(s) under seal will be
   entered electronically by the Clerk and a paper copy of the order shall
   be attached to the document(s) under seal and delivered to the Clerk at
   the time of the filing of the document(s). H. TITLE OF DOCKET ENTRIES
   An attorney who electronically files a pleading or other document shall
   be responsible for designating a docket entry title for the document by
   using one of the docket event categories prescribed by the court. I.
   CORRECTING DOCKET ENTRIES Once a document is submitted and becomes part
   of the case docket, corrections to the docket are made only by the
   Clerk. -5- Rev. 11/01 III. PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM DOCKET A. PUBLIC

   documents filed in the System is available to the public at no charge
   at each Divisional Office of the Clerk during regular business hours.
   B. INTERNET ACCESS Although any person can retrieve and view documents

   Monroe, Clark, King and Larry Bick From: Judge Larry Kelly Date:
   October 5, 2001 Re: Bar questions on e-filing After our judges'
   meeting, I undertook to review the issues surrounding the questions
   that Mr. Bick sent to us about submission of orders on electronic
   documents. Here are my suggestions. To do this, I'll restate the
   questions and provide answers as I go. Ultimately I believe we'd
   actually mail our response here to all registered users of cm/ecf (this
   is where these questions came from); send a copy to our bar presidents;
   and, post a copy at each clerk's office with a specific notation that
   documents being modified can also be downloaded from our website at
   http://www.txwb.uscourts.gov. Q1. Why can't the Judge use the order
   attached to the motion/application? We could do this. But remember that
   this is for electronically filed pleadings/motions or applications-thus
   we'd have to type in the case # for each case, go through the docket
   sheet to find the particular pleading, click on it, go to the end, and
   separately print each and every order one at a time. Then we'd sign the
   hard copy and the staff would then "scan" it back into the system. Of
   course there is the issue of what would even trigger the knowledge that
   there is a pleading that is "ready" for signatures. I propose to modify
   our Standing Order and Administrative Procedures (see notes after Q2).
   Q2. Why attach the order if it is not going to be signed? Why can't
   they just submit a separate order? They are having to do two different
   orders since one must have the word "Proposed" in the title. The reason
   we are not routinely signing is explained in response to question #1.
   Apparently some people think it is difficult to "delete" the word
   "Proposed" prior to printing out the already typed order, thus stating
   that they have to prepare "two different orders." Proposal: I suggest
   that we prepare a First Amended Standing Order Relating to Electronic
   Case Filing . . . with the same language as our original order, except
   that it would note that the Administrative Procedures for Filing,
   Signing and Verifying Pleadings and Papers by Electronic Means is being
   amended. Then we prepare First Amended Administrative Procedures . . .
   All we need to do here is modify paragraph II. E. 1. It now requires
   that a proposed form of order be submitted with every motion and other
   pleading requesting relief. I suggest it be restated as follows:
   "Proposed forms of orders shall NOT be submitted with electronically
   filed pleadings. The actual order to be signed by the court will be
   submitted in accordance with the procedures outlined below." (The rest
   of our procedures require no further amendments) Q3. Why are they
   having to be responsible for holding the order until the response
   deadline has passed? If they file conventionally, they do not have to
   do this, so why is electronic filing different? First we need to
   remember that most bankruptcy courts in the country either do not allow
   negative notice pleadings at all, or the type of pleadings which can
   utilize negative notice is severely limited, e.g., TX/E and TX/S don't
   allow negative notice on objections to claims. With conventional
   pleadings, the court staff physically has a document in their hand
   which shows the name/case no. and type of pleading. It is easy to
   organize alphabetically, match up with responses if and when filed, and
   to pull when the requisite time period has passed. However, with
   electronically filed pleadings the staff not only has no physical
   document to use for matching up and determining when the time period
   has passed, they don't even know it has been filed. It is difficult to
   run reports every day to determine IF a pleading with negative notice
   has been filed (as some are filed daily), and to keep up with the time.
   Furthermore, we run into the same problem with orders as discussed in
   response to Q#1. Frankly we believed that the attorneys pretty much
   kept up with the time periods based on the number of calls we receive
   when orders don't get signed promptly. However, with the new procedure,
   judges can rely on the express representations, sign the orders
   promptly and the difficulties in "finding" negative notice pleadings
   and keeping up with dates are done away with. Q4. Having to append that
   paragraph on orders regarding motions with negative language is very
   time consuming. Why is that necessary? With computers and the ability
   to make "form orders" or to "cut and paste," it is difficult to
   understand how a boilerplate phrase is "time consuming". The purpose of
   the language is multiple. In the past we have occasionally experienced
   unfortunate incidents where an attorney files a pleading seeking one
   form of relief (e.g., motion to dismiss without prejudice; motion to
   avoid lien) and then submit an order with different relief (e.g., order
   dismissing with prejudice; order denying claim in full (they did not
   challenge the amount owed or the liability in the original filing, only
   the effectiveness of the security). The boilerplate language will allow
   the judges to rely on the representation, sign the orders without
   having to verify each case/pleading one at a time as to the time period
   having properly run without a response having been filed, and similarly
   rely on the representation as to the consistency of relief being
   ordered. In the event of a misstatement, the court is not limited by
   the 10-day appeal period because Rule 60 would open the door to relief.
   Without this process we might not be able to continue our liberal use
   of negative notice pleadings.
