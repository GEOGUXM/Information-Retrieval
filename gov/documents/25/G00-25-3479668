   ARS National Program Because of narrow profit margins and due to their
   fixed geographical locations most farms and ranches have only limited
   flexibility to respond to changing factors in their environment. Every
   farm or ranch is a complex system of interacting components residing in
   a natural and socioeconomic environment. A high degree of management
   skill is required of modern producers. The primary products of the
   Integrated Agricultural Systems National Program are information and
   tools for use by farmers and by consultants in farm planning and
   decision-making within the complex socioeconomic-physical-technical
   environment of the farm or farms for which they are responsible. The
   overall problem to be addressed is provision of science-based
   information and its effective retrieval, management, and analysis for
   agricultural management decision-making. This includes historic,
   recent, and real-time information and data. The goal is to help farmers
   retrieve, understand, and apply this information to the development and
   effective management of whole farm systems within the context of their
   ecosystems and communities. Effective response to farm/ranch issues
   requires that partnerships be established in which research is
   conducted jointly with farmers and with participation from community
   stakeholders.
