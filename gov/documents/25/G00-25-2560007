Marine Fisheries Review Guidelines for Authors
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Marine Fisheries Review publishes review articles, original
   research reports, significant progress reports, technical notes, and
   news articles on fisheries science, engineering, and economics,
   commercial and recreational fisheries, marine mammal studies,
   aquaculture, and U.S. and foreign fisheries developments. Emphasis,
   however, is on in-depth review articles and practical or applied
   aspects of marine fisheries rather than pure research.

   Preferred paper length ranges from 4 to 12 printed pages (about 10-40
   manuscript pages), although shorter and longer papers are sometimes
   accepted. Papers are normally printed within 4-6 months of acceptance.
   Publication is hastened when manuscripts conform to the following
   recommended guidelines.

    The Manuscript

   Submission of a manuscript to the Marine Fisheries Review implies that
   the manuscript is the author's own work, has not been submitted for
   publication elsewhere, and is ready for publication as submitted.
   Commerce Department personnel should submit papers under a completed
   NOAA Form 25-700.

   Manuscripts must be printed (double-spaced) on high-quality white bond
   paper and submitted with two duplicate (but not carbon) copies. The
   complete manuscript normally includes a title page, a short abstract
   (if needed), text, literature citations, tables, figure legends,
   footnotes, and the figures. The title page should carry the title and
   the name, department, institution or other affiliation, and complete
   address (plus current address if different) of the author(s).
   Manuscript pages should be numbered and have 1.5-inch margins on all
   sides. Running heads are not used. An "Acknowledgments" section, if
   needed, may be placed at the end of the text. Use of appendices is
   discouraged.

    Abstract and Headings

   Keep titles, headings, subheadings, and the abstract short and clear.
   Abstracts should be short (one-half page or less) and double-spaced.
   Paper titles should be no longer than 60 characters; a four- to
   fiveword (40 to 45 characters) title is ideal. Use heads sparingly, if
   at all. Heads should contain only 2-5 words; do not stack heads of
   different sizes.

    Style

   In style, the Marine Fisheries Review follows the "U.S. Government
   Printing Office Style Manual." Fish names follow the most recent
   edition of the American Fisheries Society's Special Publication, "A
   List of Common and Scientific Names of Fishes from the United States
   and Canada." The "Merriam-Webster Third New International Dictionary"
   is used as the authority for correct spelling and word division. Only
   journal titles and scientific names (genera and species) should be
   italicized (underscored). Dates should be written as 3 November 1986.
   In text, literature is cited as Lynn and Reid (1978) or as (Lynn and
   Reid, 1978). Common abbreviations and symbols such as mm, m, g, ml, mg,
   and þC (without periods) may be used with numerals. Measurements are
   preferred in metric units; other equivalent units (i.e., fathoms, þF)
   may also be listed in parentheses.

    Tables and Footnotes

   Tables and footnotes should be printed separately and double-spaced.
   Tables should be numbered and referenced in text. Table headings and
   format should be consistent; do not use vertical rules.

    Literature Cited

   Title the list of references "Literature Cited" and include only
   published works or those actually in press. Citations must contain the
   complete title of the work, inclusive pagination, full journal title,
   and the year, month, volume, and issue numbers of the publication.
   Unpublished reports or manuscripts and personal communications must be
   footnoted. Include the title, author, pagination of the manuscript or
   report, and the address where it is on file. For personal
   communications, list the name, affiliation, and address of the
   communicator and date of communication.

   Citations should be double-spaced and listed alphabetically by the
   senior author's surname and initials. Co-authors should be listed by
   initials and surname. Where two or more citations have the same
   author(s), list them chronologically; where both author and year match
   on two or more, use lowercase alphabet to distinguish them (1979a,
   1979b, 1979c, etc.). Authors must double-check all literature cited;
   they alone are responsible for its accuracy.

    Figures

   All figures should be clearly identified with the author's name and
   figure number, if used. Figure legends should be brief and a copy may
   be taped to the back of the figure. Figures may or may not be numbered.
   Do not write on the back of photographs. Photographs should be black
   and white, 8 x 10 inches, sharply focused glossies of strong contrast.
   Potential cover photos are wel- come, but their return cannot be
   guaranteed. Magnification listed for photomicrographs must match the
   figure submitted (a scale bar may be preferred).

   Line art should be drawn with black India ink on white paper. Design,
   symbols, and lettering should be neat, legible, and simple. Avoid
   freehand lettering and heavy lettering and shading that could fill in
   when the figure is reduced. Consider column and page sizes when
   designing figures.

    Finally

   First-rate, professional papers are neat, accurate, and complete.
   Authors should proofread the manuscript for typographical errors and
   double-check its contents and appearance before submission. Mail the
   manuscript flat, first-class mail, to: Editor, Marine Fisheries Review,
   Scientific Publications Office, National Marine Fisheries Service,
   NOAA, 7600 Sand Point Way N.E., Seattle, WA 98115.

   The senior author will receive 50 reprints (no cover) free of charge
   and 50 free copies are supplied to his or her organization. Cost
   estimates for additional reprints can be supplied upon request.
