                U. S. Labor Department Equips Workers To Respond To
                              Future Anthrax Threats
         New Partnership Will Develop Anthrax/Biohazard Clean-up Training
                                    Curriculum

      WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a new
      training partnership with the Laborers International Union to develop
      an anthrax/biohazard training curriculum. The new partnership was
      prompted by the recent anthrax outbreaks across the country.

      A grant totaling $208,650 from the Labor Department's Employment and
      Training Administration was awarded to the Laborers as a first step in
      this partnership. The course material will be developed and tested
      through the combined expertise of the Labor Department's Occupational
      Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Laborers and other
      appropriate government entities.

      "Our best response to anthrax and other threats of bioterrorism is to
      be prepared," said John L. Henshaw, assistant secretary of labor for
      OSHA. "It is important that we have workers who are well trained to
      respond to such threats safely and at the same time can help the
      country get back to normal as quickly as possible."

      The Laborers' certified hazardous waste workers will utilize this new
      curriculum to upgrade their skills and fine-tune the training process.
      After pilot tests are complete, the curriculum will be used by other
      organizations to train workers in the removal of biochemical agents,
      including twelve OSHA Training Institute Education Centers and state
      and local One-Stop centers.

      The final training curriculum for distribution across the country will
      include training manuals, CD-ROM and web-based curriculum, a PowerPoint
      presentation and other training tools.
