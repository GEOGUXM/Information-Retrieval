   The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is a
   multi-laboratory, interagency program that was created in 1989 with
   funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The ARM Program is
   part of DOE's effort to resolve scientific uncertainties about global
   climate change with a specific focus on improving the performance of
   general circulation models (GCMs) used for climate research and
   prediction. These improved models will help scientists better
   understand the influences of human activities on the earth's climate.

   In pursuit of its goal, the ARM Program establishes and operates field
   research sites, called Cloud and Radiation Testbeds (CARTs), in several
   climatically significant locations. Scientists collect and analyze data
   obtained over extended periods of time from large arrays of instruments
   to study the effects and interactions of sunlight, radiant energy, and
   clouds on temperatures, weather, and climate.
