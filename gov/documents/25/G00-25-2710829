                            Microwave Radiometry

                                [3dline.gif]

   [why.gif] Remote sensors can be broadly classified as either active or
   passive. Active sensors send out a beam of acoustic or electromagnetic
   energy and measure how the medium perturbs it. Passive sensors emit no
   energy of their own. By listening at microwave frequencies, it is
   possible to measure the roughness of the ocean surface or moisture
   content of the atmosphere. Ground-based, airborne, and space-based
   microwave radiometers are used in climate and atmospheric modification
   studies, cloud physics, and ocean-surface sensing.

  How does Atmospheric Radiometry work?

   Atmospheric radiometers measure the emissions of the atmosphere itself.
   For example, a microwave antenna pointed into the air receives an
   abundance of thermal radio emissions from the atmosphere's various
   constituents. Each constituent possesses a unique emission spectrum
   that corresponds exactly to its absorption spectrum. Radiometers
   "listen" at frequencies selected to best sort the constituents out.

  Measuring Integrated Water Content

   By monitoring microwave emissions from the zenith at 23 and 31 GHz, it
   is possible to measure both the total water-vapor content and the
   liquid-water content of a vertical atmospheric column. Because the
   23-GHz channel is near a water-vapor emission line, the vapor emission
   is about twice as strong as for liquid water. At 31 GHz, on the other
   hand, the ratio is roughly inverted. Thus, a dual-frequency radiometer
   provides the information required to solve two equations for the two
   unknown quantities.

  An airborne two-channel microwave radiometer

   This instrument, operating at 23.87 and 31.65 GHz, was designed at ETL
   to provide a detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of cloud
   liquid for research in meteorological areas such as cloud physics,
   climatology, severe storms, and aircraft icing. A modified antenna
   system permits measurements of microwave radiance over ocean and land.
   The instrument can look upward, downward, or cycle between upward and
   downward. The system has been designed to operate on either the NOAA
   P-3 or the King Air aircraft, shown here.

  How does Ocean-Surface Radiometry work?

   The brightness temperature of the ocean surface at microwave
   frequencies is observed to increase with ocean-surface roughness.
   Empirical calibration of microwave emissivity permits estimates of
   ocean-surface wind speed, within certain limits. The Special Sensor
   Microwave Imager (SSM/I) on the DMSP military satellites uses this
   principle to map ocean surface wind speeds globally. Recent
   polarimetric and multi-look tests with airborne radiometers at various
   angles of incidence on the ocean surface show promise for determining
   surface-wind direction, as well.
