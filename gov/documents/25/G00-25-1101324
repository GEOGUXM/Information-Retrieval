    Carbon Sequestration

       Fossil fuels will remain the mainstay of energy production well into
       the 21st century. Availability of these fuels to provide clean,
       affordable energy is essential for the prosperity and security of the
       United States. However, increased concentrations of carbon dioxide
       (CO2) due to carbon emissions are expected unless energy systems reduce
       the carbon emissions to the atmosphere.

    Worldwide Capacity of Carbon Reservoirs

       To stabilize and ultimately reduce concentrations of this greenhouse
       gas, it will be necessary to employ carbon sequestration - carbon
       capture, separation and storage or reuse.

       Carbon sequestration, along with reduced carbon content of fuels and
       improved efficiency of energy production and use, must play major roles
       if the nation is to enjoy the economic and energy security benefits,
       which fossil fuels brings to the energy mix.

       The Presidents Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)
       underscored the importance of carbon sequestration in its report
       "Federal Energy Research and Development for the Challenges of the
       Twenty First Century." PCAST recommended increasing the U.S. Department
       of Energys (DOEs) R&D for carbon sequestration. The report stated: "A
       much larger science-based CO2 sequestration program should be
       developed. The aim should be to provide a science-based assessment of
       the prospects and costs of CO2 sequestration. This is very high-risk,
       long-term R&D that will not be undertaken by industry alone without
       strong incentives or regulations, although industry experience and
       capabilities will be very useful."

       The joint Office of Fossil Energy and Office of Science April 1999
       draft report Carbon Sequestration: State of the Science subsequently
       has assessed "...key areas for research and development (R&D) that
       could lead to an understanding of the potential for future use of
       carbon sequestration as a major tool for managing carbon emissions."

       To be successful, the techniques and practices to sequester carbon must
       meet the following requirements:
        1. be effective and cost-competitive,
        2. provide stable, long term storage, and
        3. be environmentally benign.

    Using present technology, estimates of sequestration costs are in the
   range of $100 to $300/ton of carbon emissions avoided. The goal of the
   program is to reduce the cost of carbon sequestration to $10 or less
   per net ton of carbon emissions avoided by 2015. Achieving this goal
   would save the U.S. trillions of dollars.

   Further, achieving a mid-point stabilization scenario (e.g., 550 parts
   per million CO2) would not require wholesale introduction of zero
   emission systems in the near term. This would allow time to develop
   cost effective technology over the next 10-15 years that could be
   deployed for new capacity and capital stock replacement capacity.

   The near term program will examine and identify a spectrum of
   science-based sequestration approaches that have the greatest potential
   to yield the cost-effective technologies that are required. For
   example, a competitive solicitation was issued in FY 1998 and resulted
   in the selection of 12 innovative novel concepts for the control of
   atmospheric emissions of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. In May 1999
   six of the most promising concepts were selected for further study.

   Modeling and assessments provide the capabilities to evaluate
   technology options in a total systems context, considering costs and
   impacts over the full product cycle. Further, the societal and
   environmental effects are analyzed to mental effects are analyzed to
   provide a basis for assessing trade-offs between local environmental
   impacts and global impacts.

   In the mid-term, sequestration pilot testing will develop options for
   direct and indirect sequestration. The direct options involve the
   capture of CO2 at the power plant before it enters the atmosphere
   coupled with "value-added" sequestration, such as using CO2 in enhanced
   oil recovery (EOR) operation and in methane production from deep
   unmineable coal seams. "Indirect" sequestration involves research on
   means of integrating fossil fuel production and use with terrestrial
   sequestration and enhanced ocean storage of carbon.

   In the long term, the technology products will be more revolutionary
   and rely less on site-specific or application-specific factors to
   ensure economic viability.

   The program portfolio covers the entire carbon sequestration "life
   cycle" of capture, separation, transportation, and storage or reuse, as
   well as research needs for the two other major energy related
   greenhouse gases of concern, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxides (N2O).
   Specifically, the program has six elements:
     * Cost effective CO2 capture and separation processes.
     * CO2 sequestration in geological formations including oil and gas
       reservoirs, unmineable coal seams, and deep saline reservoirs.
     * Direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean and stimulation of
       phytoplankton growth.
     * Improved full life-cycle carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems.
     * Advanced chemical, biological, and decarbonization concepts.
       and
     * Models and assessments of cost, risks, and potential of carbon
       sequestration technologies.
