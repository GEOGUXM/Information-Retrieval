   The North Carolina District's monthly Seminar Series is devoted to
   exploring the integrated nature of different facets of water-resource
   policy, management, and scientific research. Representatives of local,
   State, and Federal agencies, universities, and private organizations
   are invited to attend and participate. The Seminar Series has provided
   an excellent forum for the exchange of ideas and has served to foster
   collaborative initiatives.
