   ADVISORIES
   Ocean or bay water advisories are issued to alert the public of
   possible elevated bacteria levels associated with urban and storm
   runoff at storm drains, creeks and rivers that can impact ocean and bay
   waters.

                          (image: Warning! Aviso!)

   The Environmental Health Division advises swimmers that the levels
   of bacteria can rise significantly in ocean and bay waters adjacent
   to storm drains, creeks, and rivers during and after rainstorms. The
   elevated bacteria levels of bacteria may continue for a period of at
   least 3 days depending upon the intensity of the rain and the volume
   of the runoff.   Swimmers should avoid coastal waters impacted by
   discharging storm drains, creeks, and rivers, and beach users should
   avoid contact with any runoff on the beach during dry or wet weather
   conditions. (rain advisory posted 1/28/02).
