   Using the Trip Planner

   The new Trip Planner helps you create free, custom transit plans
   wherever Metro Transit goes--instantly, anytime.

   The Trip Planner currently provides information for Metro Transit,
   Sound Transit Express routes operated by Metro and Sounder Commuter
   Rail service.

   Information obtained using the Trip Planner is based on regularly
   scheduled service and normal conditions. At this time, the Trip Planner
   does not give information based on interruptions or cancellations of
   service, or for special event service.

   You can access information for known interruptions and special event
   service on the Metro Online Bulletins page. You can also subscribe to
   Transit Alert!, an e-mail service which will notify you of major
   unplanned disruptions in Metro service.

   For more information, or to comment on the Trip Planner, please use the
   "Comments" button on this page. For telephone assistance, please call
   Metro's Customer Assistance office at the numbers shown in the
   directory.
