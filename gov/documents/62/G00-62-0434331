   The Daily Treasury Statement (DTS) is part of a triad of Treasury
   financial reports. The DTS summarizes data on the cash and debt
   operations of the Treasury based on reporting of the Treasury account
   balances of the Federal Reserve banks. The Monthly Treasury Statement
   is a report of the government receipts and outlays, based on agency
   reporting. The U.S. Government Annual Report is recognized as the
   official publication of receipts and outlays with which all other
   reports containing similar data must be in agreement.

   DTS files are available in ASCII file format, viewable from any web
   browser and in Portable Document Format (PDF). To view PDF files you
   will need to use the Acrobat Reader which is free to install and use.
