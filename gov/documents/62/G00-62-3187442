1.      Purpose. This chapter specifies the procedures for the domestic aviation
- wind and temperature aloft forecast program.

2.      Responsibility.

2.1     National Meteorological Center (NMC) . The NMC is responsible for produc
ing scheduled wind and temperature aloft forecasts from the Limited Fine Mesh (L
FM) numerical model for the locations in the conterminous  U.S. and Alaska (incl
uding adjacent over-water locations). However, NMC does not amend these forecast
s.

2.2     Honolulu Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO). The Honolulu WSFO is re
sponsible for preparing and issuing scheduled and amended wind and temperature a
loft forecasts for locations in Hawaii.

The Pacific Region Headquarters has authority to change this program to meet loc
al requirements. Such changes should be documented by Regional Operations Manual
 Letters (ROML's) .

2.3     Area Forecast (FA) Centers. The WSFO's having responsibility for issuing
 FA's and In-Flight Advisories have the responsibility for issuing wind and temp
erature aloft  forecast amendments (see section 8).

3.      Locations. Forecasts are issued by NMC for locations depicted geographic
ally in exhibits D-24-1 and D-24-2 and listed alphabetically by states in Append
ix A.

The Honolulu WSFO issues wind and temperature forecasts for Honolulu (HNL), Hilo
 (ITO),  Lihue (LIH), and Kahului (OGG).

Forecasts for intermediate locations and levels may be determined by interpolati
on.

4.      Levels. Wind and temperature forecasts are issued for the following leve
ls. All levels are Mean Sea Level (MSL).

   Wind forecasts are not issued for levels within 1,500 feet of a
   location's elevation. Temperature forecasts are not issued for levels
   within 2.500 feet of a location's elevation.

   5.    Format. Wind and temperature forecasts are issued in bulletins
   identified by the letters "FD' in the heading. The numbers (11 & 12, 13
   & 14, and 15 & 16) following the letters FDUS for the conterminous U.S.
   and (1, 2, and 3) following FDAK for Alaska indicate 6-, 12-, and
   24-hour forecasts, respectively.

   The symbolic form of the forecasts is "DDff+TT" in which "DD" is the
   wind direction, "95" the wind speed, and "TT" the temperature.

   Wind direction is indicated in tens of degrees (two digits) with
   reference to true north, and wind speed is given in knots (two digits).
   Light and variable wind or wind speeds of less than 5 knots are
   expressed by "9900." Forecast wind speeds of 100 through 199 knots are
   indicated by subtracting 100 from the speed and adding 50 to the coded
   direction. For example, a forecast of 250 degrees, 145 knots, is
   encoded as 7545. Forecast wind speeds of 200 knots or greater are
   indicated as a forecast speed of 199 knots.

   Temperature is indicated in degrees Celsius (two digits) and is
   preceded by the appropriate algebraic sign for the levels from 6,000
   through 24,000 feet. Above 24,000 feet, the sign is omitted since
   temperatures are negative.

   5.1    Format for 3,000- Through 39,000-Foot Levels. The bulletin
   format for the 3,000- through 39,000-foot levels is shown below.

   the FAA's Weather Message Switching Center (WMSC) only in the
   conterminous U.S. for those locations listed in Appendix A with a
   number symbol (#).

     # Transmission time varies on AFOS

     + Forecasts are not transmitted on Service A teletypewriter circuits
     but are available from WMSC through Request/Reply circuits.

   When more than one forecast is available for a particular valid time or
   period of use, the forecast based on the latest observational data will
   be used. For example, the forecast transmitted at 1640Z which is valid
   at 1800Z and based on 1200Z data should be used immediately upon
   receipt instead of the previously issued (12-hour earlier) forecasts
   valid at 1800Z.

   7.    Distribution. The conterminous U.S. and Alaska FD bulletins are
   entered directly into the WMSC by NMC. Distribution of individual
   reports to area and supplemental circuits is accomplished in accordance
   with instructions in the Federal Aviation Administration Data
   Communications Handbook 7110.80.

   8.    Amended Forecasts.

   8.1    Responsibility. All WSFO's having responsibility for issuing
   FA's and In-Flight Advisories also have the responsibility for FD
   amendments in their respective areas. Wind and temperature forecasts
   should be kept as accurate as possible for use by the aviation
   community.

   8.2    Criteria. Amended forecasts should be issued when actual or
   expected changes in wind or temperatures are, in the forecaster's
   judgment, of sufficient magnitude to be of importance to aircraft
   operations. Pilot reports (PIREP's) should be monitored on a continuing
   basis to detect problem areas that may require amendments. The
   appropriate Center Weather Service Unit (CWSU) or the Central Flow
   Weather Service Unit (CFWSU) should be called for needed PIREP
   information in that area. The CWSU's and CFWSU will also initiate calls
   to respective WSFO-FA Centers when discrepancies in observations and
   forecasts are found. The criteria listed below may be considered as
   guidance.

   Wind

   With forecast speed of 5 knots to less than 30 knots, amend if observed
   or forecast: direction changes by 45 degrees or more; or speed changes
   by 20 knots or more.

   With forecast speed of 30 knots or more, amend if observed or forecast:
   direction changes by 30 degrees or more; or speed changes by 20 knots
   or more, except, a. 30 knots for forecast speed between 70 and 100
   knots, b. 40 knots for forecast speed between 100 and 135 knots, or c.
   50 knots for forecast speed greater than 135 knots.

   Temperature

   Amend if observed or forecast temperature changes by 5 degrees Celsius
   or more.

   8.3    Format. Amended forecasts will be issued in the same format as
   scheduled forecasts. FAA Data Communications Handbook 7110.80 describes
   the procedures for entering amended forecasts into the WMSC via
   request/reply circuits.

   8.4    Distribution. Distribution of amended forecasts is identical to
   the scheduled forecasts for the locations concerned, except that
   amended FD's are entered into the WMSC via the dedicated Request/Reply
   circuits.

   9.    Delayed Forecasts. If the scheduled FD transmission is delayed,
   users should continue using the valid FD's based on 12-hour earlier
   data until NMC transmits the new forecast.

   10.    Wind and Temperature Aloft Forecasts in AFOS. These forecasts
   have the following AFOS product identifiers.

     CCCNNNXXX - AFOS Product Identifier

   For scheduled forecasts

     CCC = Node identifier: NMC
     NNN = Product category: FD1, FD2, FD3, FD8, Fug, FDO (FD10)
     XXX = Product designator: FD Locations (e.g., EMI. etc.)

   For amended forecasts

     CCC = FA offices
     NNN = FDA
     XXX = FA offices

   11.    Retention. NMC will retain regularly issued FD's, and FA Centers
   will retain amended FD's for the time period specified in WSOM Chapter
   D-90.
