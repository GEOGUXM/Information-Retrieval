       CRAPO PRESENTS IDAHO VETERANS HISTORIES TO LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

       Senator interviewed vets in Lewiston, Pocatello, and Twin Falls


   Washington, DC - As part of the Library of Congress' Veterans History
   Project, Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has presented LOC Librarian Dr. James
   Billington with several histories of Idaho veterans. The histories
   include videotaped interviews with several veterans, historical
   photographs, and written biographical information. Crapo conducted the
   interviews during the congressional recess in late August.

   The veterans are as follows:

     Raymond Bailey, Lava Hot Springs
     --was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and several Oak Leaf
     Clusters during World War II, and now is the mayor of Lava Hot
     Springs.

     Roland Gardner, Twin Falls
     --joined the military after the Bataan Death March in 1943, but was
     rejected and told he had to finish high school first; served in
     WWII, the Korean Conflict, and the Vietnam War.

     Lynn Richmond, Lewiston
     --served in World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star.

     William Woodfin, Buhl
     --served in World War II and was honored with the Purple Heart, the
     Bronze Star, and a combat infantry badge.

   Crapo and his staff are continuing to collect veterans histories, and
   are coordinating efforts with the Idaho State Historical Society
   Veterans History Project and the Idaho Education Association. The
   histories will be collected in the American Folklife Center at the
   Library of Congress. For those interested in participating in the
   project, more information on the veterans history program is available
   on the web at www.loc.gov/folklife/vets and on Crapo's Senate web site,
