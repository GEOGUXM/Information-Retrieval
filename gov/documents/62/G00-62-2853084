                 SIERRA NEVADA FOREST PLAN AMENDMENT APPEALS

                              DECEMBER 27, 2001


   Yesterday I completed my examination of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
   Amendment appeals to determine if departmental discretionary review of
   Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth’s November 16 appeal decision is
   warranted.


   I affirm Chief Bosworth’s decision and his instructions to the Pacific
   Southwest regional forester.  Therefore, I will not conduct a
   discretionary review.  I have returned the Chief’s appeal decision to
   the agency to implement in accordance with his instruction to the
   regional forester to reexamine certain aspects of the forest management
   plan.


   I am confident that the regional forester will put forth an aggressive
   plan to respond to the chief’s decision and that he will continue to
   engage the public through an open, cooperative process.  I am also
   confident that the regional forester’s action plan will address a
   number of issues raised in the appeals that I reviewed.


   The Sierra Nevada Framework would not have been possible without the
   hard work of many Forest Service employees, interested citizens,
   governmental agencies and a host of others.


   I am grateful to each person who had a part in this activity and
   wholeheartedly encourage all participants to remain engaged throughout
   the process of refining, implementing, and where necessary, amending
   the plan.
