   System Features   Project Progress

   Help Desk:
   The Implementation Team has completed the setup of the Personic Help
   Desk for HR users to use for any type of question or problem
   experienced. Users will be able to call 667-8570 to get help on any
   type of issue with the Personic system. If the user's need is
   immediate, they can page the help desk by calling 996-1373 and will
   receive a live response by phone within 10 minutes (guaranteed!). This
   pager will be staffed from 8:00 to 5:00, Monday thru Friday. For help
   that may not be as time sensitive, users can send email to
   personic@lanl.gov.

   Project Update

   From the Project Leader...
   "The project team members have done an outstanding job in preparing for
   the implementation of Personic. We're very proud of all that has been
   accomplished and are confident that HR users will enjoy using this
   powerful tool! We also hope that using Personic will help HR realize
   increased success as we move towards our new structure, and that using
   Personic will help us provide even better service to our customers.
   While we are confident that all will go well, we are not overly
   confident in believing that nothing can go wrong. Often when things
   don't go exactly as expected with a new system, users may find it easy
   to blame the "system" or those involved in the process redesign. My
   sincere hope, as well as the hope of the project team, is that all of
   you will join us in taking ownership of these kinds of issues and work
   together to solve them, thus making it invisible to the customer. Our
   primary goal is to "delight the customer" in the way we deliver HR
   services, and we all have to work together to accomplish this very
   important goal! Please feel free to contact me or any project team
   member with any and all concerns or issues that may arise. Thanks!"
   Shelly

   System Test:
   On October 3rd the Implementation Team completed a full test of the
   Personic system "end to end", and it was a complete success. The Team
   gained profound knowledge in a couple of areas and built upon the high
   level of confidence that this implementation will be a success. Perhaps
   the most rewarding outcome was seeing all of the pieces that have been
   so carefully designed all working together to produce the final product
   that truly is greater that the sum of its parts.

   Training:
   From the Implementation Training Director:
   "Thank you HR Personic users for signing up for Personic Training and
   setting up your NT-MAD accounts! The four hour training is being held
   the weeks of October 9 and 15 at the White Rock Training Center.
   Trainees can expect to learn how Personic Workflow takes candidates
   through the application to hire or disqualification process. Personic
   training will also be a great opportunity to learn more about each of
   our hiring processes as the tool allows us to handle all applicant
   types in basically the same manner."
