                    Washington State Foreign Trade Zones

   Several ports in Washington State currently operate Foreign Trade Zones
   (FTZ), and other ports can quickly acquire sub-zone authority if
   needed. A foreign trade zone is an enclosed geographic site within the
   United States or near a U.S Customs port of entry where foreign and
   domestic merchandise is generally considered to be in international
   commerce. Imported materials or merchandise may enter FTZs without
   being subject to U.S. import duties unless later entered for
   consumption into the commerce of the United States. Hence, among the
   potential benefits of a Foreign Trade Zone location are postponing duty
   payments until imported goods leave the FTZ and enter the U.S. market
   or allowing foreign components to be assembled with U.S. components and
   re-exported without the complication of paying and drawing back duty.
   Duty rates on assembled components can be less than the duty rate on
   the parts. FTZ operators, lawyers and accountants can all provide
   further information on the benefits of locating in an FTZ.

   The Foreign Trade Zones Board has general information on foreign trade
   zones. For more specific information or for information on a particular
   zone, contact zone administrators directly. The Board can be reached
