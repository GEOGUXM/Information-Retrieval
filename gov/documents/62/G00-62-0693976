   Beginning his professional career as a Meteorological Technician with
   the U.S. Weather Bureau's (now the National Weather Service) Atlantic
   Weather Patrol, Mr. Schmidlin's federal service spans over forty years.
   After graduation from the Pennsylvania State University with a degree
   in Meteorology, Mr. Schmidlin continued to serve with the weather
   service at multiple assignments and duty stations. He eventually
   accepted an assignment at the NASA Wallops Flight Station with a
   contingent of weather service professionals supporting NASA's Wallops
   range.
   In 1978, he transferred from the National Weather Service to the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Wallops, joining the
   science staff of the Directorate of Applied Sciences. He continues to
   manage both the science experiments and the resources of several
   ongoing research projects in the Observational Science Branch.
   Mr. Schmidlin is a participating scientist in the national and
   international meteorological and atmospheric measurements investigation
   community. He is a member of American Meteorological Society, the
   American Geophysical Union, and is a member of upper air working group
   of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology (OFCM) and a similar working
   group of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). He has been
   involved with numerous measurement programs and campaigns including
   EXAMETNET, MAP/WINE, Mac-Epsilon, GUARA, DYANA, the International and
   National Radiosonde Intercomparisons, and others including correlative
   measurement data to a number of satellite systems, e.g., the HRDI,
   WINDII, HALOE, and TOVS instrument teams for the UARS, TOVS, and CRISTA
   investigations.
