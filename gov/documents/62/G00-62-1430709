        Safety: TMF Hazard Orientation must be given to all new employees
     (existing TMF employees to catch up with requirement) or science users
     or visitors before leaving TM-17 to conduct any work. Two ways this may
     be accomplished, either via the video/CD or reviewing the documentation
      with their supervisor or sponsor. The signed documentation is kept on
      file and is required for tracking purposes. Safety and Health Program
              Requirements: Working at the Table Mountain Facility

                          1. JPL TMF Hazard Orientation
                                       Or
                        2. Non JPL TMF Hazard Orientation
      If working alone at anytime you must sign out a Personal Alert Button
       from the Operations desk and wear it at all times. This button will

        Notifier Panel indicates where you are and notifies not only our
       Operations staff but also Apple Valley Communication of a possible
      problem. The Operations staff will investigate the trouble and report
                             or seek emergency help.

       The JPL PI Science User is required to perform or obtain the proper

                               Job Hazard Analysis
                                  PPE Training
      Must be trained in all areas that are applicable: A few examples are:
                              Hazard Communication
                                 Fall Protection
                                     Lasers

                              Chemical Hygiene Plan
           Site specific training; LN2 handling and filling procedures

     Colleges or Outside businesses must provide the same information to JPL
     Safety Office for review and acceptance before they will be allowed to
     work at TMF, they are responsible to conduct their safety training and
      prove it was done. Also provide a signed copy of their organizations
       IIPP (if working for a California based company that has 10 or more
     employees) for review and acceptance by JPL Occupational Safety Office.
                All signed documentation must be on file at TMF.

          Use of facility: NASA must approve the use of the facility by
      non-JPL/NASA businesses if they aren't contracted or subcontracted to
               JPL or NASA in the form of a Facility Use Request.

                      1. Requestor must have a JPL sponsor.
       2. The JPL sponsor writes a request to the Contracts Administration
               Office describing: Who, What, When, Where, and Why.
       3. Liability, data sharing, safety, security, etc. must be meet for
                             approval to be granted.
         4. The Table Mountain Science and Technology committee must be
       presented with new science programs that want to locate at TMF, the
             committee will then assess any science conflict issues.
       5. When all parties have approved, the facility use request will be
                                    granted.
