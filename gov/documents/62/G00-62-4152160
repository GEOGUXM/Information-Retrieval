                                 Rail Safety
                       State Safety Oversight Program

     In response to Congressional concern regarding the potential for
     accidents and incidents on rail transit systems, the Intermodal
     Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) added Section
     28 to the Federal Transit Act (codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 5330).
     This section requires the FTA to issue a regulation creating the
     first state-managed oversight program for rail transit safety.


   Last Updated Title Description
   11/2000 1999 Annual Report The FTA State Safety Oversight Annual Report
   for 1999 summarizes activities performed to implement the SSO Program
   during Calendar Year 1999.
   10/1997 Regulation and Updates FTA published the regulation, "Rail
   Fixed Guideway Systems; State Safety Oversight," in 1995 (49 CFR Part
   659).  On October 1 every year the regulation is updated.  Any Federal
   Register Change Notices affecting the regulation published within the
   previous 12 months are incorporated into the body of the regulation.
   The most recent regulation, along with any unincorporated Change
   Notices are available here.
   09/1999 Reporting Template

   Note:  This document is in Microsoft Word format
   To allow for the individuality of reporting agencies, FTA allows each
   agency to develop its own reporting format, including items such as
   accident cause classifications.  Some agencies have indicated that they
   would prefer to report using a standardized form.  In response, FTA has
   developed this SSO Annual Reporting Template.  This format is fully
   acceptable for Annual Certification and will help streamline the
   process.

   Oversight Rule and its implementation and implications.
