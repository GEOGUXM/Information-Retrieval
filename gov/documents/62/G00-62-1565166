  1993 Commodity Flow Survey

   Sample Statistical Area Locator Maps Showing 1993 Commodity
   Flow Survey NTARs.

   These two maps represent a type of map included in a typical Census
   Bureau publication to show the location and extent of specialized
   statistical areas for which data is published but which may not be
   completely familiar to the data user. These maps are examples of what
   will accompany the 1993 Commodity Flow Survey publication to help data
   users locate and identify the National Transportation Analysis Regions
   (NTAR). The NTAR is one of the types of geographic areas for which the
   data will be published. These maps are in Adobe PDF and require the
   Acrobat reader mentioned above.

  Notes on the Maps and the Scanned Images

   All the maps displayed here were provided by staff of the Cartographic
   Operations Branch, Geography Division (GEO-COB). The NTAR and the
   Agricultural Atlas maps presented here in Adobe PDF were translated
   from the Post Script format into PDF using the Adobe Distiller software
   by the GEO-COB staff and the Products and Services Staff of Geography
   Division.

   The maps based on the 1990 Census of Population (the GIF images) were
   scanned from the original published maps by Don Badrak of the Computer
   Support Branch (GEO-CSB) on a Macintosh IIfx with a Microtek IIHR
   scanner using Adobe PhotoShop 2.5. The images were saved at 300dpi and
   transferred to an SGI Indigo R4000, where he saved them as 300dpi
   JPEGs. The mini map images (file-mini.gif) GIF files were saved at a
   size of 250x196. The thumbnail GIFs (file-thumb.gif) are 100x78.
