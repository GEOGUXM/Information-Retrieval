  Computational Electromagnetics

   Applications that require modeling of electromagnetic (and acoustic)
   wave propagation are extremely broad, ranging over

                                          Device design

     Antennas and waveguides

     Microcircuits and transducers

              Low-observable aircraft     Nondestructive testing

     Turbines

     Jet engines

              Railroad wheels (acoustics) Imaging

     Geophysics

     Medicine

     Target identification

   At NIST, applications include the modeling of antennas (including those
   on integrated circuits), waveguides (microwave and photonic),
   transducers, and in nondestructive testing.

  Time-Domain Methods

   Radiation and scattering of acoustic and electromagnetic waves are
   increasingly modeled using time-domain computational methods, due to
   their flexibility in handling
     * Wide-Band signals,
     * Material inhomogeneities, and
     * Nonlinearities.

   For many applications, the accuracy of the computed models is centrally
   important. Nevertheless, existing methods typically allow for only
   limited control over accuracy and cannot achieve high accuracy for
   reasonable computational cost.

  Project Goals

   This project, a collaborative effort directed by B. Alpert (NIST), L.
   Greengard (New York University), and T. Hagstrom (University of New
   Mexico), and supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research
   Projects Agency (DARPA) Applied and Computational Mathematics Program,
   has the goal of the development of algorithms and codes for
   high-accuracy time-domain computations, addressing key weaknesses of
   existing methods, specifically
    1. Accurate nonreflecting boundary conditions (that reduce an infinite
       physical domain to a finite computational domain),
    2. Suitable geometric representations of scattering objects, and
    3. High-order, stable spatial and temporal discretizations for
       realistic scatterer geometries.

  Progress to Date

   Fundamental progress in numerical algorithms for wave propagation has
   been achieved by the project, in two of these areas:
     * Efficient computation of the exact nonreflecting boundary
       conditions, reported in
       Bradley Alpert, Leslie Greengard, and Thomas Hagstrom, Rapid
       Evaluation of Nonreflecting Boundary Kernels for Time-Domain Wave
       Propagation, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 37, 1138-1164
       (2000), and
     * High-order convergent discretization techniques, reported in
       B. Alpert, L. Greengard, T. Hagstrom, An Integral Evolution Formula
       for the Wave Equation, Journal of Computational Physics 162, 1-8
       (2000).
