     This microscopic image of a colloidal gel taken on the ground is a
    snapshot of the formation process being studied in the Experiment on
    Physics of Colloids in Space on board the International Space Station
     during Expedition Four. The gel in the image consists of 95 percent
   liquid and 5 percent colloid particles less than 5 microns in diameter.
   The gel being grown on the International Space Station contains nearly
    1000 times less colloid, consisting of 99.992 percent water and only
   0.008 percent colloids. Scientists are using the microgravity of space
   to get a better picture of the gel formation stage. On the ground, the
     clumps would sink to the bottom of the container before the sample
                                   gelled.
