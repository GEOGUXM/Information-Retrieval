   SAGE III Data Products Users Guide
   The SAGE III Data Products User's Guide provides a general description
   of the measurement technique, instrument, mission, and sampling
   coverage. The charge coupled device (CCD) assignments for solar and
   lunar are described in Appendix A. Instructions for accessing the SAGE
   III Data Product files are also provided, and detailed descriptions of
   their content and format are provided in Appendices B through E.

   SAGE III Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs)
   SAGE III Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs) provide the
   theoretical basis — both the physical theory and the mathematical
   procedures and possible assumptions being applied — for the
   calculations that have to be made to convert the radiances received by
   the instruments to geophysical quantities. The geophysical quantities
   are then available to the scientific community for studies of the
   various characteristics of the Earth system.

   Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS) Tools
   Get the latest version of HDF-EOS software, tools and documentation
   supported by the Earth Observing System (EOS).

   SAGE III Validation Plan
   The Validation Plan outlines an approach to verify the SAGE III
   measurement and retrieval algorithm system and a strategy to acquire
   correlative measurements in order to validate the accuracy and
   precision of the SAGE III Standard Science Products. The plan covers
   the first 2 years of operation of the SAGE III/Meteor-3M mission.

   SAGE III Publications
   A bibliography of publicly available papers regarding SAGE III.

   SAGE II Publications
   A bibliography of publicly available papers regarding SAGE II, the
   predecessor of SAGE III.
