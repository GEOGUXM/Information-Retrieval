Securities Act of 1933

   Often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, the Securities Act
   of 1933 has two basic objectives:
     * require that investors receive financial and other significant
       information concerning securities being offered for public sale;
       and
     * prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of
       securities.

   The full text of this Act is available at:
   http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/sldtoc.html. (The SEC does not control or
   maintain this site.)

Purpose of Registration

   A primary means of accomplishing these goals is the disclosure of
   important financial information through the registration of securities.
   This information enables investors, not the government, to make
   informed judgments about whether to purchase a company's securities.
   While the SEC requires that the information provided be accurate, it
   does not guarantee it. Investors who purchase securities and suffer
   losses have important recovery rights if they can prove that there was
   incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information.

The Registration Process

   In general, securities sold in the U.S. must be registered. The
   registration forms companies file provide essential facts while
   minimizing the burden and expense of complying with the law. In
   general, registration forms call for:
     * a description of the company's properties and business;
     * a description of the security to be offered for sale;
     * information about the management of the company; and
     * financial statements certified by independent accountants.

   Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after
   filing with the SEC. If filed by U.S. domestic companies, the
   statements are available on the EDGAR database accessible at
   www.sec.gov. Registration statements are subject to examination for
   compliance with disclosure requirements.

   Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the Commission.
   Some exemptions from the registration requirement include:
     * private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions;
     * offerings of limited size;
     * intrastate offerings; and
     * securities of municipal, state, and federal governments.

   By exempting many small offerings from the registration process, the
   SEC seeks to foster capital formation by lowering the cost of offering
   securities to the public.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934

   With this Act, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The Act empowers the SEC with broad authority over all aspects of the
   securities industry. This includes the power to register, regulate, and
   oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well
   as the nation's securities self regulatory organizations (SROs). The
   various stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and
   American Stock Exchange are SROs. The National Association of
   Securities Dealers, which operates the NASDAQ system, is also an SRO.

   The Act also identifies and prohibits certain types of conduct in the
   markets and provides the Commission with disciplinary powers over
   regulated entities and persons associated with them.

   The Act also empowers the SEC to require periodic reporting of
   information by companies with publicly traded securities.

Corporate Reporting

   Companies with more than $10 million in assets whose securities are
   held by more than 500 owners must file annual and other periodic
   reports. These reports are available to the public through the SEC's
   EDGAR database.

Proxy Solicitations

   The Securities Exchange Act also governs the disclosure in materials
   used to solicit shareholders' votes in annual or special meetings held
   for the election of directors and the approval of other corporate
   action. This information, contained in proxy materials, must be filed
   with the Commission in advance of any solicitation to ensure compliance
   with the disclosure rules. Solicitations, whether by management or
   shareholder groups, must disclose all important facts concerning the
   issues on which holders are asked to vote.

Tender Offers

   The Securities Exchange Act requires disclosure of important
   information by anyone seeking to acquire more than 5 percent of a
   company's securities by direct purchase or tender offer. Such an offer
   often is extended in an effort to gain control of the company. As with
   the proxy rules, this allows shareholders to make informed decisions on
   these critical corporate events.

Insider Trading

   The securities laws broadly prohibit fraudulent activities of any kind
   in connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities. These
   provisions are the basis for many types of disciplinary actions,
   including actions against fraudulent insider trading. Insider trading
   is illegal when a person trades a security while in possession of
   material nonpublic information in violation of a duty to withhold the
   information or refrain from trading.

Registration of Exchanges,
Associations, and Others

   The Act requires a variety of market participants to register with the
   Commission, including exchanges, brokers and dealers, transfer agents,
   and clearing agencies. Registration for these organizations involves
   filing disclosure documents that are updated on a regular basis.

   The exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)
   are identified as self-regulatory organizations (SRO). SROs must create
   rules that allow for disciplining members for improper conduct and for
   establishing measures to ensure market integrity and investor
   protection. SRO proposed rules are published for comment before final
   SEC review and approval.

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935

   Interstate holding companies engaged, through subsidiaries, in the
   electric utility business or in the retail distribution of natural or
   manufactured gas are subject to regulation under this Act. These
   companies, unless specifically exempted, are required to submit reports
   providing detailed information concerning the organization, financial
   structure, and operations of the holding company and its subsidiaries.
   Holding companies are subject to SEC regulations on matters such as
   structure of their utility systems, transactions among companies that
   are part of the holding company utility system, acquisitions, business
   combinations, the issue and sale of securities, and financing
   transactions. The full text of this Act is available online at:
   http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch2C.html (The SEC does not
   control or maintain this site.)

Trust Indenture Act of 1939

   This Act applies to debt securities such as bonds, debentures, and
   notes that are offered for public sale. Even though such securities may
   be registered under the Securities Act, they may not be offered for
   sale to the public unless a formal agreement between the issuer of
   bonds and the bondholder, known as the trust indenture, conforms to the
   standards of this Act.

Investment Company Act of 1940

   This Act regulates the organization of companies, including mutual
   funds, that engage primarily in investing, reinvesting, and trading in
   securities, and whose own securities are offered to the investing
   public. The regulation is designed to minimize conflicts of interest
   that arise in these complex operations. The Act requires these
   companies to disclose their financial condition and investment policies
   to investors when stock is initially sold and, subsequently, on a
   regular basis. The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the investing
   public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as
   well as on investment company structure and operations. It is important
   to remember that the Act does not permit the SEC to directly supervise
   the investment decisions or activities of these companies or judge the
   merits of their investments. The text of the Investment Company Act of
   1940 is part of the Internet web page located at:
   http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/sldtoc.html. (The SEC does not control or
   maintain this site.)

Investment Advisers Act of 1940

   This law regulates investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this
   Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising
   others about securities investments must register with the SEC and
   conform to regulations designed to protect investors. Since the Act was
   amended in 1996, generally only advisers who have at least $25 million
   of assets under management or advise a registered investment company
   must register with the Commission.The full text of this Act is
   available online at: http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch2D.html.
