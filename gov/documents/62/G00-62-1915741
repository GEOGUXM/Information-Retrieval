   State of California Board of Optometry Disciplinary Guidelines and
   Model Disciplinary Orders (May 1999) To establish consistency in
   disciplinary penalties for similar offenses on a statewide basis, the
   Board of Optometry has adopted these uniform disciplinary guidelines
   for particular violations. This document, designed for use by
   administrative law judges, attorneys, optometrists and ultimately the
   board, shall be revised from time to time following public hearing by
   the board and will be disseminated to interested parties upon request.
   This document is divided into three sections as follows: (1)
   Disciplinary guidelines for specific violations of the Optometry
   Practice Act and other related laws; (2) model language for use in
   crafting disciplinary orders; and (3) guidelines for the imposition and
   assessment of administrative fines and citations. The board recognizes
   that these penalties and conditions of probation are merely guidelines
   and that mitigating or aggravating circumstances may necessitate
   variations in individual cases. Additional copies of this document may
   be obtained by contacting the Board of Optometry at its offices in
   Sacramento, California. There may be a charge assessed sufficient to
   cover the cost of production and dissemination of copies. Disciplinary
   Guidelines The board recognizes that these penalties and conditions of
   probation are merely guidelines and that mitigating or aggravating
   circumstances may necessitate deviations. If there are deviations or
   omissions from the guidelines, the board would request that the
   Administrative Law Judge hearing the matter include some statement of
   this in the Proposed Decision so that the circumstances can be better
   understood and evaluated by the board upon review of the proposed
   decision and before its ultimate action is taken. For purposes of this
   document terms and conditions of probation are divided into two general
   categories: (1) General Conditions which are those conditions of
   probation which will generally appear in all cases involving probation
   as a standard term and condition; and (2) Specific Conditions which are
   those that address the specific circumstances of the case and require
   discretion to be imposed depending on the nature and circumstances of a
   particular case. B&P refers to the California Business and Professions
   Code. CCR refers to the California Code of Regulations General
   Probationary Conditions The five standard conditions of probation
   generally appearing in every case are as follows: 1. Obey all laws [26]
