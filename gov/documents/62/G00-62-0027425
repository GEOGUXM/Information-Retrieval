   Newton Time RESULT: ~24 Type Ia supernovae Keck discovered while still
   brightening, at new moon Cerro Tololo Perlmutter, et al., in
   Thermonuclear Supernovae, NATO ASI, v. 486 (1997) We developed a
   strategy to guarantee a group of supernova discoveries on a certain
   date. Just after a new moon, we observe some 50 to 100 high-galactic
   lattitute fields-each containing almost a thousand high-redshift
   galaxies-in two nights on the Cerro Tololo 4-meter telescope with Tyson
   & Bernstein's wide-field camera. We return three weeks later to observe
   the same fields, and then examine the images of all of the tens of
   thousands of galaxies. On average, some two dozen Type Ia supernovae
   will thus be discovered just before new moon-and while still
   brightening, since the three week time baseline is less than the rise
   time of a Type Ia supernova. We follow the supernovae, with
   spectroscopy at maximum light at the Keck telescope, and with
   photometry over the following two months at the CTIO, WIYN, INT, and
   (particularly for the highest redshifts) the Hubble Space Telescope.
