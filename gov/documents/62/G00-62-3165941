Death Valley is Alive!


   Death Valley is Alive! at the San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands.
   This special exhibit is open in the museums Hall of History through
   January 13. It is free with museum general admission.

   "Death Valley is Alive" is a new exhibit created by the County Museum
   and sponsored by a grant from the California Council for the
   Humanities. During the exhibition, visitors can explore the natural
   history and culture of the Death Valley region, from its geologic
   beginnings 1.3 billion years ago, through time to visits by pioneers
   and prospectors, and its eventual preservation as a natural park. The
   exhibit is divided into thematic sections:

   [citbul1a.gif] What are deserts?
   [citbul1a.gif] 1.8 billion years of geological history in Death Valley
   [citbul1a.gif] Humans in Death Valley, from Native Americans to Death
                  Valley Scotty
   [citbul1a.gif] Paleontology
   [citbul1a.gif] Biotic communities
   [citbul1a.gif] Preserving Death Valley and its natural and cultural
                  resources

   Huge photomurals with text panels are enriched by artifacts and
   touchable specimens. There is an interactive display that challenges
   visitors to guess how plants can survive in a desert, and a large,
   mechanical map that offers different perspectives of the valley,
   including satellite imagery.

   The exhibit will travel to other museums and educational institutions
   starting in the summer of 2002. For information on the exhibit schedule
