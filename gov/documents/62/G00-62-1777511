  What Should I Tell My Children?
   __________________________________________________________________

   The simple answer is...the simple truth. Children learn to react to
   tragedy by observing their parents. Respond calmly and truthfully,
   being careful not to share more information than your child asks for.

   Act in a calm but concerned manner and reassure children of their
   safety.

   Young children depend on adults for their nurturing and safety. They
   may feel helpless when they hear frightening news, because they may not
   have the ability to imagine ways to prevent trauma.

   Be honest with children about your feelings. It is ok to tell children
   that you are afraid, sad, or concerned but also tell them that you know
   we, whether its family, community, the nation, or the world can get
   through the tragedy.

   Give children limited choices to help them restore a sense of personal
   power in their own environment. These choices may include what to have
   for dinner or what story to read at bedtime. Winning a game will give
   younger children a sense of competence and mastery.

   Keep the daily routine as undisturbed as possible to keep life
   predictable. Putting together puzzles will restore a sense of
   predictability, control, and order. Eating, sleeping, and going to
   school at the same times is also important. At bedtime, mention
   casually that you will see them in the morning.

   It may be helpful for children to draw what they have seen or heard.
   This gives parents a chance to explore and examine their child's
   emotional experience and creates opportunities to discuss how children
   process their fears. This is particularly important for children who
   appear to have no reaction to the traumatic event.

   Older children should be encouraged to write about the feelings they
   are having about what they are seeing and hearing. Scrapbooks of
   newspaper and magazine articles allow them to create their own view of
   the trauma and gain a sense of mastery over it.

   Family discussions help children understand that they are not alone in
   their fears and concerns.

   Help older children discover related information to the events
   unfolding in the news. This will help them understand the difference
   between reality and fantasy.

   If a child asks how God could let this happen, one response is to say
   that people don't know why God lets things happen the way He does.

   If your child appears to lose faith in you, reassure them that you will
   do what is in your power to keep them safe. Don't promise what you
   can't do and make sure you keep your promises. If you promise that you
   will be home at a certain time - be there. If something happens and you
   can't get home when you promised, call or send a message with someone
   who will tell your children.

   Finally children may feel reassured if they can research disaster
   information online. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
   a child-friendly webstie at http://www.fema.gov/kids.
