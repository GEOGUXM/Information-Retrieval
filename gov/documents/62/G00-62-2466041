   Dear Visitor,

   If you are here it is probably because you came from  Mike Solinas'
   page at http://www.solinas.com/
   (the WEB Wanderer). As you will notice I am not the author the pages
   you are about to visit
   ( World of Beams ), but I am involved with this group (click at
   http://bc1.lbl.gov/CBP_pages/PEOPLE/people.html if you need
   confirmation!). In particular I plan to
   develop JAVA applets and programs related to these pages.

    I would love comments about potential JAVA applets which could be
   linked to the various phenomena
    shown on  World of Beams as well as stand-alone applications for
   download. So please do not hesitate
   to contact me at forest@kekvax.kek.jp or btl@csa1.lbl.gov . Certainly
   links to other related pages would
   be welcome too. Any high schools over there??? Any Mac programming
   volonteers?

   You may also visit my own educational page! Download track.exe and try
   the Martin maps and the Quispel
   Map. The Martin map 1 is also available in a semi-functioning applet.

   For any other concerns  related to  World of Beams you can send your
   comments to the authors.

   OK, (back)  to the World of Beams
