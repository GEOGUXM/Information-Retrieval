                  High Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment

   NASA's airborne Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer (ROWS) recently
   participated in an experiment conducted by the Office of Naval
   Research's High Resolution Remote Sensing Program. Field measurements
   were taken during June 1993 off the coast of North Carolina near Cape
   Hatteras. Five aircraft and two ocean research vessels participated.
   All ROWS flights, aboard NASA WFF's T-39, coincided with the passage of
   the ERS-1 satellite SAR. A primary experimental objective was to
   increase understanding of the relationship between submesoscale surface
   roughness features and the synthetic and real aperture radar (SAR and
   RAR) signatures obtained when illuminating these features. Two key
   physical processes at play in the generation of features near the gulf
   stream north wall are strong gradients in currents and large air to sea
   temperature differences. Several fundamental elements needed to
   properly model radar backscatter from these features are the underlying
   swell field in the region and, more importantly, small-scale roughness
   characteristics. ROWS participated in the experiment to provide broad
   spatial coverage of the long-wave directional field about the High
   Resolution Experiment sites and to attempt investigation of small-scale
   roughness using ROWS backscatter analysis.

   For the High Resolution Experiment, the primary ROWS data products are
   the 2-D long-wave (> 40 m wavelength) spectra and altimeter-derived
   surface mean square slope. The data report presents these primary ROWS
   data products. Additional data related to the mean backscatter measured
   with the spectrometer are still being processed.
