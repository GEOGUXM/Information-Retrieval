                              Congratulations!
     On behalf of the GovernorÂ’s Office on Service and Volunteerism (GO
     SERV), I want to congratulate the following collaborations on their
    selection as 2002 Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning grantees.
     Each of the projects listed will individually and cumulatively make
       significant contributions to the State of California. Each will
           actively engage children and other community members in
   service-learning programs that honor the legacy and values of Cesar E.
                                   Chavez.

                      Budget Negotiations and Contracts
   Your total grant award will be subject to contract negotiations, which
   may include budget caps enacted by the Cesar Chavez Day Task Force. It
   is not possible to give you an exact award amount because these factors
   may alter the budget you requested. GO SERV staff will contact you soon
                   to discuss your service-learning plans.

                                 Sincerely,
                                CHUCK SUPPLE
                             Executive Director
