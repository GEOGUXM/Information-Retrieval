                                   Snap-1

   The Snap-1 satellite is a candidate for flight testing FlightLinux.
   Snap-1 was launched on June 28, 2000. It is a prototype nanosat,
   constructed by Surrey Satellite Technology. The cpu is an StrongARM
   SA1100, with 6 megabytes of memory. Numerous ports of Linux to the
   StrongArm Processor are already available, including RedHat and
   MontaVista Software, who have a RT Linux variant. A treatise on
   installing ARMLinux is available on the web.
