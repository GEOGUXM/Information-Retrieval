                   United States House of Representatives
                   Terrorist Victims Flag Memorial Program
   Pursuant to House Resolution 239, 107th Congress, Adopted September 14,
                                    2001

                         INFORMATION AND GUIDELINES

   The United States House of Representatives adopted the Terrorist
   Victims Flag Memorial Resolution of 2001, to honor the victims of the
   terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Through this Flag Program, a
   Representative may provide, at no cost to the recipient, a U.S. Flag
   flown over the Capitol Building to a surviving victim or the family of
   a deceased victim of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The
   information below will advise you whether you should request a flag
   from your Representative and how to do so.

   Who may request and receive a U.S. flag flown over the Capitol through
   the Terrorist Victims Flag Memorial Program:

   The Family of A Deceased Victim

     * An immediate survivor of a loved one who lost his or her life in,
       or due to, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including
       subsequently related rescue and recovery operations;
     * Since only one flag can be given in honor of a deceased victim,
       please submit only one request per family of a deceased victim. If
       multiple requests are received in honor of a deceased victim, the
       House will only fulfill the FIRST request received for a deceased
       victim.

   A Surviving Victim Who Sustained Physical Injury

     * An individual who sustained bodily injury as a result of the
       terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or as a result of
       subsequently related rescue and recovery operations.

       Complete Sections 1 and 3 if you are requesting as the family for a
       deceased victim. Complete Section 2 and 3 if you are a physically
       injured victim.
     * Print and mail the completed form to the U.S. Representative who
       represents the congressional district where you live. Address your
