   NASA BALLOON MAKES RECORD-BREAKING FLIGHT

   Larger than a football field and flying near the edge of space, a NASA
   scientific balloon has set a new flight record of almost 32 days after
   completing two orbits around the South Pole.

   The record-breaking balloon carried the Trans-Iron Galactic Element
   Recorder (Tiger) experiment, designed to search for the origin of
   cosmic rays, atomic particles that travel through the galaxy at near
   light-speeds and shower the Earth constantly.

   The pilotless, helium-filled scientific balloon was launched from
   McMurdo Station, Antarctica, at 6:30 a.m. EST on Dec. 20, 2001. The
   balloon traveled approximately 8,800 miles (about 1,400 kilometers)
   before landing about 31 days, 20 hours later at 3:03 a.m. EST, Jan. 21,
   284 miles (458 kilometers) from the McMurdo Station. Payload recovery
   operations are in progress.

   The previous endurance record for a long-duration balloon flight was
   set in January 2001 from McMurdo. The flight was one orbit of the South
   Pole that lasted 26 days. The Tiger mission was able to more than
   double the amount of continuous science observational time over any
   previous balloon mission.

   "We are excited with the duration of this flight, which allowed the
   scientists to get ample science to perform their studies," said Steve
   Smith, Chief of the Balloon Program Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight
   Center's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va. "We routinely
   have long- duration balloons that float for up to two weeks, but to
   have one flight last for over 31 days is very rewarding."

   Scientific balloons are made of thin polyethylene material, about the
   same thickness as ordinary sandwich wrap. An enormous balloon was
   needed to hoist the two-ton Tiger experiment to about 125,000 feet
   (38,100 meters). The Tiger balloon is taller than the Washington
   Monument, which stands just over 555 feet high. As the balloon rises,
   the gas it contains expands. The balloon used for this Antarctic flight
   expanded to a diameter of more than 424 feet (129 meters) and weighed
   3,687 pounds (1,674 kilograms).

   To complete the flight, the experiment and its parachute float to the
   ground after being separated from the balloon by radio command. Helium
   was released from the balloon for its descent near McMurdo station.

   "The importance of Tiger is that it is the first experiment that has
   both sufficient collecting power and adequate resolution to measure
   abundances of all nuclei from iron through zirconium," said Tiger
   Principal Investigator Robert Binns, Washington University, St. Louis.
   "This will enable us to determine whether the cosmic-ray source is hot
   or cold, gas or solid. We have already seen in our quick-look analysis
   of flight data that Tiger's resolution is sufficient to resolve those
   nuclei."

   Personnel from the National Scientific Balloon Facility, Palestine,
   Texas, who support approximately 25 NASA balloon flights annually from
   sites worldwide, conducted the launch, flight and recovery operations
   of the Tiger balloon mission. Antarctica ground and air operations
   support was provided by the National Science Foundation's Office of
   Polar Programs.

   Tiger is a collaboration among Washington University; NASA's Goddard
   Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.; California Institute of
   Technology, Pasadena; and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. The
   Wallops Flight Facility manages NASA's Scientific Balloon Program for
   the Office of Space Science, NASA Headquarters.
