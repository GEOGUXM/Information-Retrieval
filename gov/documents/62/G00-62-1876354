Detailed Demographic Data From Census 2000 Released for Washington

   On July 11, 2001, the U.S. Commerce Department's Census Bureau released
   the first detailed demographic data based on Census 2000 questions
   asked of all people and about every housing unit in the state of
   Washington. The electronic file (Summary File 1) includes statistical
   data on the following population items: sex, age, race, Hispanic or
   Latino origin, household relationship, and household and family
   characteristics. Housing items include occupancy status and tenure
   (whether the unit is owner- or renter-occupied). Summary File 1
   contains 286 tables for states, counties, county subdivisions, places,
   census tracts, ZIP code tabulation areas, as well as congressional
   districts for the 106th Congress and, where applicable, American Indian
   and Alaska Native areas and Hawaiian home lands. For most subjects,
   data for census block groups and blocks also are shown. full text
