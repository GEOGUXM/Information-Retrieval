The Weather Machine
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Los Alamos Weather Machine is a collaborative effort between the
   people in CIC-12 and ESH-17 of Los Alamos National Laboratory. It is an
   outgrowth of the ESH-17 meteorological monitoring program. This
   monitoring program, which is required by U. S. Department of Energy
   orders in support of Laboratory operations and emergency preparedness,
   is described in the Meteorological Monitoring Plan.

   At the suggestion of Lee Ankeny, the original Gopher version of the
   Weather Machine was set up in 1993. The http version, with a revised
   home page, was established in 1995. In 1996 Darrell Holt and Lee added
   the data access capability to the http version. Jeff Baars and Greg
   Stone contributed documentation, design ideas/implementation, and
   overall meteorological direction. Julie Jensen contributed early design
   ideas, and Anne Garnett and Carolyn Robinson provided editorial help.

   The Weather Machine also provides links to Internet sites at the Ohio
   State University and Unisys for current weather conditions around the
   country and selected weather forecast products.
