Goals of ARM Research

   Achieving ARM's programmatic objectives should lead to the improved
   treatment of atmospheric radiation in climate models, explicitly
   recognizing the crucial role of clouds in influencing this radiation
   and the consequent need for accurate descriptions of the presence and
   properties of clouds in climate models. There are key scientific issues
   which must be resolved to achieve these objectives:
    1. What are the direct effects of temperature and atmospheric
       constituents, particularly clouds, water vapor and aerosols on the
       radiative flow of energy through the atmosphere and across the
       Earth's surface?
    2. What is the nature of the variability of radiation and the
       radiative properties of the atmosphere on climatically relevant
       space and time scales?
    3. What are the primary interactions among the various dynamic,
       thermodynamic, and radiative processes that determine the radiative
       properties of an atmospheric column, including clouds and the
       underlying surface?
    4. How do radiative processes interact with dynamical and hydrologic
       processes to produce cloud feedbacks that regulate climate change?

   The first three of these questions can be directly addressed through
   measurements over the lifetime of ARM, although modeling studies are
   also required. The fourth question is more difficult to approach
   because cloud feedbacks arise from different physical mechanisms and
   may have different sensitivity on diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual
   time scales. Addressing this question effectively will require
   extensive modeling studies and the collection of observational data
   over all relevant time scales.

   Because ARM is a combined measurement and modeling program (including
   laboratory measurements where appropriate), a central feature of the
   program is an experimental testbed for measuring atmospheric radiation
   and the properties controlling this radiation, such as the distribution
   of clouds and water vapor. A principal objective of this testbed is to
   develop a quantitative description of the spectral radiative energy
   balance profile under a wide range of meteorological conditions. The
   intent is that the measurements will be sufficiently comprehensive to
   allow testing of parameterizations through comparisons of field
   observations with model calculations of the radiation field and
   associated cloud and interactions.

   While it is easy to state the intent of measurements to be made at such
   a testbed, there are practical and scientific issues that arise in the
   implementing such a system. These issues include not only the
   development of the instrumentation and the interpretation of the data,
   but also the selection of the geographical locations in which the
   measurements need to be made. The three ARM sites were selected to
   provide the opportunity to observe a wide range of climatologically
   important meteorological conditions.
