   Earth To Orbit and Beyond - The Challenges


   Earth To Orbit Home Program Description The Challenges For Teachers For
   Students For Parents Contact Us

   The Earth to Orbit Engineering Design Challenges are organized around
   the challenges faced by NASA engineers in developing the next
   generation of aerospace vehicles. Each challenge engages students in a
   classroom activity that leads them through the design, testing, and
   evaluation process used by engineers in developing new technology.
   These challenges are designed for the Middle and High school student.

                 Thermal Protection Systems Design Challenge
                            (Heat and Conduction)

   When spacecraft travel at high speeds through the Earth's atmosphere
   they generate high temperatures on their surfaces due to frictional
   heating. Space vehicles must have thermal protection systems to protect
   them from this heat. In this challenge, students learn about the
   process of how NASA engineers design lightweight but effective reusable
   thermal protection systems. Working in two-person teams they design,
   build, and test a thermal protection system of their own. They use
   simple materials such as wood dowels, hot-melt glue, aluminum foil and
   copper screening to build a model that can withstand the heat of a
   propane torch. The models are tested under a tight protocol in order to
   maintain classroom safety. As a culminating activity, each team
   prepares a poster session documenting and summarizing their design and
   testing activity.

                   Spacecraft Structures Design Challenge
                               (Newton's Laws)

   The structural elements that hold together an aerospace vehicle must be
   strong and as light as possible in order to minimize the fuel needed to
   get to orbit. NASA engineers continually strive to develop new
   materials and methods in structural design. In this challenge, students
   will undertake the problem of designing a strong but lightweight thrust
   structure that can withstand the launch of a bottle rocket by means of
   a wooden lever. Using simple materials such as: craft sticks,
   cardboard, and hot-melt glue students strive to make their structure
   lighter while maintaining its' strength. The goal is to construct a
   launcher that can repeatedly withstand the force of launching a
   one-kilogram bottle of water one meter into the air. The scientific
   focus is on understanding forces, structures, and energy transfer.

                      Electodynamic Propulsion Systems
                             (Electromagnetism)

   Current rocket-fueled propulsion satellites are expensive to launch
   because of the weight of the fuel. Also, the amount of fuel that can be
   carried is limited to the amount of space available on the spacecraft.
   NASA engineers are devising a system that uses the Earth's natural
   magnetism to push satellites into higher and lower orbits around the
   plants using an electronic conducting wire or "tether". Students will
   try to move a model "satellite" along a track using their own design
   with a specific set of materials. They will explore and discover things
   such as the affects of wire in relation to: size, shape, strength,
   direction of current, and its relationship to a magnetic field.
