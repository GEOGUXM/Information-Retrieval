       Located on the second floor of the Harvard Street Neighborhood Health
       Center, the VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Dorchester is the
       first clinic to serve the veterans of the City of Boston. The clinic,
      designed to serve those veterans living in the Dorchester, Roxbury, and
        Mattapan neighborhoods, is the result of a successful collaboration
        between VA and the private sector. Serviced by the MBTA's number 28
      bus, the clinic is conveniently located on Blue Hill Ave., across from
                                  Franklin Field.
