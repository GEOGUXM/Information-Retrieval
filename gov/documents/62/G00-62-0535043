   What our program does:

   The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program provides
   benefits authorized by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness
   Compensation Program Act. The Program goes into effect on July 31,
   2001. The Department of Labors Office of Workers Compensation
   Programs is responsible for adjudicating and administering claims filed
   by employees or former employees (or their survivors) under the Act.

   Compensation of $150,000 and payment of medical expenses from the date
   a claim is filed is available to:

            the Department of Energy, its contractors and subcontractors;
            and
          + the employees cancer is determined at least as likely as not
            related to that employment in accordance with guidelines
            issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, or
