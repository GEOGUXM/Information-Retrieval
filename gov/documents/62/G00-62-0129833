   Future Space Shuttle launches may be supported by detailed measurements
   of clouds obtained from the ground with millimeter-wave "cloud" radars,
   such as those developed at NOAA's Environmental Technology Laboratory.
   NASA has numerous launch commit criteria regarding the presence of
   various kinds of clouds, which are intended to eliminate the
   possibility of a catastrophic lightning strike to the ascending space
   vehicle. However, some of these criteria may be more restrictive than
   necessary, causing numerous expensive, but needless, weather delays.
   NOAA/ETL will participate in an experiment at Cape Canaveral, Florida,
   in February 2001 to better observe clouds and assess launch criteria.
   The project, known as the Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC), will
   involve research aircraft, airborne and ground-based electric field
   mills, and ETL's NOAA/K scanning cloud radar.

   Millimeter-wave radars use wavelengths that are more than 10 times
   shorter than those of conventional storm surveillance radars, such as
   NEXRAD. The ability of these millimeter-wave systems to detect weak
   non-precipitating clouds with a remarkable degree of spatial resolution
   has been amply demonstrated in recent years. This capability can be an
   asset to rocket launch operations by more accurately and more
   comprehensively revealing the altitudes, thicknesses and structure of
   cloud layers in the launch pad vicinity than has been previously
   possible. This high-resolution information can be used to determine
   whether launch window restrictions regarding thick and high ice cloud
   conditions have been applied too conservatively based on the currently
   available coarse-resolution precipitation radar observations. NOAA/ETL,
   an international leader in the development of cloud radars, will
   operate its dual-polarization, Doppler cloud radar at Kennedy Space
   Center during the February project to examine the problem in
   collaboration with scientists from NASA, the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research, the Air Force, and the Universities of Arizona
   and North Dakota. A Shuttle launch is scheduled during the project. In
   addition to addressing the launch commit criteria, the radar's
   measurements will be used in the project's studies of cloud physics and
   cloud electrification processes. The radar's polarization data will be
   particularly useful in the electrification studies by providing
   information about cloud particle shapes and types.
