   In pursuing its mission, FSL develops software that may be of use to
   others engaged in high-technology weather research and system
   development. From time to time, software will be made available for
   downloading through this page.

   In December 2000, FSL adopted an Open-Source Software License, in
   support of the Federal Government's efforts to encourage this new way
   of developing and sharing software.
   FSL has developed several applications in the Java computer language.
   Source code for some of these is available on our Java page.

   The Scalable Modeling System (SMS) is a high level software tool set
   developed to simplify the parallelization of atmospheric, oceanic,
   hydrological, and climate codes. It is currently available as a public
   domain software release from the SMS Software Page.

   The Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) is a data
   distribution and packaging project that provides value-added,
   quality-controlled observations from FSL's Central Facility for the
   purpose of supporting meteorological research. Included in MADIS is
   software to make it easy to read the observations.
