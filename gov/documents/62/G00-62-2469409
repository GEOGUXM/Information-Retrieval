                                Screen Saver
          ________________________________________________________

   The Space Shuttle Payload Information Source Screen Saver is now
   available for download. The slide show style screen saver will flash
   over 20 beautiful images of the Space Shuttle going through ground
   preparations, launch and on-orbit operations.

   The file you are about to download is a self-installing executable.
   When run, it will automatically install as your default screen saver.
   You can choose to run the executable from its current location, or save
   it locally to run the installation at any time. The file is rather
   large (2.7M), so be patient, it's worth it.
