 [DNA double helix, 36kb]

    Welcome! I'm a biophysicist in the new division of Computational & Systems
    Biology within the Biology and Biotechnology Program at LLNL. In my work I
    pursue the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, maily DNA and proteins.
    Many projects within the BBRP are tightly coupled, as you can see in a
    recent article. In particular, I have been studying DNA-drug and DNA-solvent
    interactions. My primary tool is molecular dynamics simulation, although I
    often rely on quantum chemical calculations as well. My CV (resume) provides
    a complete list of my publications.

     * Some of my projects include:
         1. Anti-cancer drugs: Drugs that covalently bind to DNA.
         2. Anti-sense compounds: DNA-solvent interactions. Includes
            on-line reprint!
         3. BCNU: The stealth DNA crosslink.
         4. Developing DNA adduct parameters for MD
         5. Abasic DNA: some dynamics
         6. Parallel DNA: How does it form?(Not ready yet.)

     * Protein Data Bank
     * A few Unix scripts that I wrote.


   Fun stuff for friends and curiosity seekers. (Includes views of my
   brains!)
   These WWW pages were first published in 1995 when I was at Sandia
   National Labs. I was greatly assisted by Derrick Lee and Rick Bamra who
   were college summer students at Sandia in 1996.

   My work at LLNL is done under the auspices of the U.S. Department of
   Energy, contract W-7405-ENG-48. Material on this web site is
