   Utah Scales

               Domestic Violence Courts
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Introduction

   Prior to 1997, the State of Utah had no specific court process
   available to address the complex nature of domestic violence cases. Yet
   numerous studies have shown that domestic violence is a problem that
   affects families in a number of destructive ways. For example, the
   American Bar Association Commission on Domestic Violence notes that
   nearly one out of every three adult women will experience at least one
   physical assault by a partner during adulthood.

   The creation of Utah’s first Domestic Violence Court in Third District
   Court (Salt Lake) in 1997 was thus an attempt to combat the problems
   associated with domestic violence as well as to acknowledge that
   domestic violence is indeed a crime and will not be permitted. Prior to
   the establishment of Domestic Violence courts, judges noticed that the
   same offenders were consistently reappearing in court. By creating an
   environment that dealt specifically with domestic violence, it was
   hoped that unified treatment and reviews of offenders would reduce the
   number of repeat offenders.

   Utah currently has two programs available to process domestic violence
   cases, one in Salt Lake City and another in West Valley City.

   Frequently Asked Questions

   How do Domestic Violence Courts Work?

   Once a plea of guilty is either entered or found by the court,
   offenders are given a choice between treatment intervention and
   incarceration. If intervention is chosen, the court orders the
   perpetrator to actively participate in, pay for and complete treatment
   during a probation period. Treatment begins with an evaluation with a
   counseling agency. Upon review by the agency, the offender may be
   assigned community service hours with non-profit organizations, undergo
   counseling, or pay a fine.

   Perpetrators are monitored during their probation through monthly
   reports that are submitted to the court. These reports remind the
   perpetrator of his/her accountability and allow the court to indirectly
   monitor the treatment process. If an offender does not fulfill the
   elements of his/her treatment, they will be brought in for a
   non-compliance hearing where they face the possibility of jail time.

   What are the Basic Philosophies Guiding Domestic Violence Court
   Methodology?

   Domestic Violence Courts operate upon several philosophies. These
   include:
     * Holding the Perpetrator Accountable: The court instructs the
       perpetrator that they are solely responsible for the abuse that
       occurred. By participating in treatment intervention and following
       exact court orders, the offender may reestablish their role within
       the community as a productive, rather than destructive one. If the
       offender chooses not to comply, it will be made clear that
       consequences will result.
     * The Victim is Offered Assistance: The court acts to prevent further
       victimization while restoring the victim’s sense of self-respect.
       This is accomplished by allowing the victim to meet with a Victim
       Advocate, creating a safety plan in case of future misconduct, as
       well as acknowledging before the court that the victim is not
       responsible for the abuse and deserves to live free of fear.
     * Learned Behavior Can be Changed: In order for offenders to make
       substantive changes in their behaviors, they work with treatment
       providers who give them the skills necessary to interact in normal
       relationships. The courts clearly delineate the positive
       consequences for compliance as well as the negative implications
       for non-compliance thereby producing a high rate of adherence with
       probation and treatment.
     * Periodic Reviews Encourage Vigilance: The court orders constant
       reviews in order to ensure initial contact with the treatment
       provider as well as to monitor continued participation. This
       constant and consistent process is done to help the offender break
       free from destructive learned behavior.

   Why are Domestic Violence Courts Necessary?

   Studies have long shown that domestic violence poses many negative
   consequences. This damage includes not only the immediate danger posed
   to family members confronting domestic violence but also:
     * Higher incidents of sexual assault and child abuse aimed at
       children within the family. It is estimated by the American Bar
       Association’s Commission on Domestic Violence (Commission) that in
       homes where partner abuse occurs, that children are 1500 times more
       likely to be mistreated.
     * An increased likelihood that children within the family will
       develop drinking and behavioral problems.
     * Children exposed to domestic violence are statistically more prone
       to repeat the offenses of their parents, thus creating a cycle of
       abuse.
     * Domestic violence may have negative effects on a woman’s ability to
       support herself and her family. Statistics from the Commission have
       shown that women facing domestic violence have a greater difficulty
       maintaining their jobs.

   Preliminary studies conducted by Brigham Young University have
   concluded with positive results. University students noted generally

   recidivism rates for specific cases held before Domestic Violence
   court.
