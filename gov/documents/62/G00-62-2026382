                         Virtual Frog Dissection Kit
     __________________________________________________________________

   This award-winning interactive program is part of the "Whole Frog"
   project. You can interactively dissect a (digitized) frog named Fluffy,
   make movies, and play the Virtual Frog Builder Game. The interactive
   Web pages are available in a number of languages.

   Jump into Entry to the kit (you must be able to view images). the kit.

   Help and additional information available include a tutorial, an
   overview of how the system works, a paper that was presented at WWW
   '94, and a paper that was published in COMPCON '95. For some other
   interesting frog and biology-related pages, see Also of Interest.
   Frog statistics, including how many times it has been accessed in
   different languages.

   We welcome your suggestions and comments. Comments from teachers and
   students are especially welcome. Please note, however, that we are
   computer scientists, not biologists. We will not be able to help you
   with your homework (see biology-related information for help). Also, we
   don't know of any animals other than the frog that have a
   computer-graphics based virtual dissection page. We get frequent
   requests for this information. If someone has done such a page for a
   fetal pig, cat, etc., we'd be interested in hearing about it.

   USGS-BRD (US Geological Survey Biological Resources Division) has
   launched Frogwatch USA - a new volunteer-driven frog and toad
   monitoring program.
