      The Hawaiian Islands were formed during the last few million years by
      the gradual accretion of basaltic lava flows. Scientists believe that
      the islands' geologic features were formed by successive periods of
      volcanic activity interspersed with submergence, weathering, and
      fluctuating sea levels. The islands are generally surrounded by coral
   reefs and contain numerous bays.
   Today the waters around the main Hawaiian Islands of Kauai, Oahu,
   Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kaho'olawe constitute one of the
   world's most important North Pacific humpback whale (Megaptera
   novaeangliae) habitats and the only place in the U.S. where humpbacks
   reproduce. Scientists estimate that two-thirds of the entire North
   Pacific humpback whale population (approximately 4000-5000 whales)
   migrate to Hawaiian waters to engage in breeding, calving and nursing
   activities.

   One area, Penguin Banks, is noted for highest concentrations of
   humpback whales during their winter sojourns in Hawaii. While in
   Hawaii, Humpback Whales are found in shallow coastal waters, usually
   less then 100 meters (300 feet). The average water depth in Penguin
   Banks is about 60 meters, but water depths can range from 50 meters to
   200 meters. Observations from research subs at Penguin Banks and in
   other sanctuary areas have indicated that the seafloor is composed
   primarily of sand with occasional outcrops of coarse sediment,
   limestone talus, limestone holes, and platforms.
   The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary's primary
   focus is the giant cetaceans who come to sanctuary water to breed,
   calve and nurse their young before returning north to the colder waters
   of the Bering Sea. However, Hawaii also provides harbor for fin, minke,
   pygmy, false killer, and right whales; and the warm waters teem with
   many species of dolphin including bottlenose, spinner, striped and
   rough-toothed. Sea turtles, sharks, monk seals, a thriving coral reef
   ecosystem, and diverse populations of seabirds are other important
   elements of Hawaii's marine environment.
   The marine waters around the Hawaiian islands contain a variety of
   cultural riches of national significance--settlement patterns and
   resource management patterns as well as historical
   treasures--archeological sites, fishponds, and shipwrecks. Over the
   ages, Native Hawaiians have used the ocean for fishing, aquaculture,
   trade, transportation, and communication as well as religious
   practices, and its role in Hawaiian life cannot be underestimated.
   Cool ocean currents and persistent northeasterly trade winds contribute
   a subtropical climate to the islands. The average wind velocity is
   between 10 and 20 knots, but velocities over 20 kt for more than a week
   are not uncommon. Occasionally, periods of southerly, or kona, winds
   may bring storms. Ocean temperatures are lower than other areas of the
   same latitude and range from 21° C to 29°C.
   The photo gallery contains images which portray only a small portion of
   the living and physical resources of the sanctuary. In addition, it
   portrays some of the major uses of the sanctuary. For a more detailed
   description of the marvels of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale
   National Marine Sanctuary, visit the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale
   National Marine Sanctuary description on the Marine Sanctuaries section
   of this site.

                               The Collection

   The Living Sanctuary presents 17 photos depicting marine mammals, fish,
   and invertebrates. Among these images are humpback whales, monk seals,
   dolphin, corals, crabs, shrimp,and urchins to name just a few.

   Habitats presents 10 photos depicting the various marine and near shore
   habitats making up the sanctuary. Included in this section you will
   find tidepools, coral reefs, an underwater crater, and other
   representatives of the diverse habitat making up the sanctuary.

   People and the Sanctuary presents 20 images depicting the many ways
   that human beings use the sanctuary and its adjacent areas. You will
   see people recreating, researching, monitoring, harvesting resources,
   and learning the important lessons that the sanctuary has to offer.

   The Sustainable Seas Expeditions photos from the January 2000
   expedition are unavailable.

   The Kids Gallery for the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National
   Marine Sanctuary contains two poems and an essay about Sylvia Earle,
   leader of the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, from children in Hawaii.
