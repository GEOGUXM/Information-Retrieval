                      Welcome to the Payment Workshop!
      In order to receive your Truman Scholarship funding, you need to
     formally request it. The Truman Foundation can process your payment
              request only after you complete Steps 1-5 below.
                      How long will this process take?
     Several factors contribute to the receipt of your Truman funds. You
                             need to anticipate:
     * The time required to complete the Payment Request form (about 30
       minutes)
     * The time it takes your institution's financial aid officer to
       complete the Educational Expenses and Support form (this varies
       greatly)
     * The time it takes the Foundation to process your payment after all
       relevant paperwork is completed (about a month)

   Step 1. Download the payment request paperwork. This includes three (3)
                          forms and one worksheet.
                           1. Payment Request Form
                  2. Educational Expenses and Support Form
              3. Direct Deposit/EFT Enrollment and Change Form
                    4. Worksheet for Payment Request Form
                                   Details
       Step 2. Give the Educational Expenses and Support Form to your
       Financial Aid Officer to be completed. You must do this before
                           progressing to Step 3.
                                   Details
    Step 3. Complete the Worksheet for Payment Request Form (approximate
   time to complete: 30 minutes). This form requires careful attention to
     detail to be completed correctly. Transfer this information to the
                            Payment Request Form.
                                   Details
     Step 4. Fill out the Direct Deposit/EFT Enrollment and Change Form.
       Your bank manager needs to fill out Section 4 of this form. All
    scholarship payments are made via electronic funds transfer. If this
    information is incorrect, you will not receive your payment. (If your
    bank account information has not changed since your last payment and
    you have received a payment in the last 18 months, you do not need to
                            complete this step.)
                                   Details
    Step 5. Mail the completed Payment Request Form, Educational Expenses
   and Support Form, and Direct Deposit/EFT Enrollment and Change Form to:
                   Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation
                            712 Jackson Place, NW
                            Washington, DC 20006
                                   Details

                             DETAILS [Steps 1-5]

                                   Step 1.
         Additional documentation needed prior to certain payments:
     First payment of each academic year: transcript and approved Annual
   Report. First payment of graduate school: approved Graduate Study Plan.
    In order to download forms, you need to install Adobe Acrobat. Click
                  here to get Adobe Acrobat if you need it.
                              Return to Step 1
                                   Step 2.
   You complete Part I of the Educational Expenses and Support Form; your
    Financial Aid Officer completes Part II. This step could take several
   weeks, depending upon the accessibility of your Financial Aid Officer.
     Do not wait until the last minute to have this form completed. This
    Educational Expenses and Support Form should reflect the expenses for
    the academic year, not term. If your expenses are different from the
   average student at your institution, you should have your Financial Aid
      Officer complete the form with this in mind. You are required to
   include all scholarships, grants, loans, etc. in Item 11 of this form.
                              Return to Step 2
                                   Step 3.
   Read the Worksheet in its entirety. Skipping sections may cause you to
   have incorrect information on the Payment Request Form, which will, in
                            turn, delay payment.
                              Return to Step 3
                                   Step 4.
   Payments can be made only to Scholars; therefore, your name must appear
       on the checking account. Each time you change checking account
        information, you must complete another form. Without updated
   information, you will not be able to receive a scholarship payment, as
            all payments are made via electronic funds transfer.
                              Return to Step 4
                                   Step 5.
    You may FAX (202-395-6995) all forms except the Payment Request Form.
   The Truman Foundation must have your original signature on this form in
   order to process your payment request. Questions? Call Meredith Farmer
                             at (202) 395-3530.
