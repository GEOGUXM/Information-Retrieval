   Debentures are issued in settlement of mortgages insured by the Federal
   Housing Administration (FHA), which is part if Housing and Urban
   Develpment (HUD). The Bureau of the Public Debt issues, services, and
   redeems them on behalf of the Department of Housing and Urban
   Development (HUD). Debentures are issued in book-entry form in

   Interest is payable seimiannually, normally on the first day of January
   and July, at the rate in effect as of the date the commitment was
   issued. Debentures mature either 10 or 20 years from the issue date.
