   Indian Preference
   The Indian Preference Law and the Indian Preference policies of the
   Indian Health Service have evolved from the Indian Reorganization Act
   of 1934. The intent of the United States Congress was to facilitate
   Indian self-government.
   The United States Supreme Court has held that the Indian Preference Law
   does not constitute harmful racial discrimination or violate the due
   process clause of the Fifth Amendment, but is reasonably and rationally
   designed to further Indian self-government. The Indian Preference law
   is a distinct statute that does not violate Title VII of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
   All claims of Indian Preference violations are processed under
   applicable grievance procedures.
