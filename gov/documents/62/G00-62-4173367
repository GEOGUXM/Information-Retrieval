   Below is a list of buildings visited regularly by P-25 members. This
   list is probably only of interest to foreign visitors and their hosts,
   who need to specify which buildings will be accessed during their stay.

   See http://s6server.lanl.gov/isec/newta.html for currently approved
   buildings.

   Maps: see http://www.lanl.gov:80/tools/maps/maps.html for maps of the
   Lab and the region.

   This list is not necessarily complete. If you know of buildings that
   need to be added, let me know please.
