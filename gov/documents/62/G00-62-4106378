                              The Federal Plan
                         for Meteorological Services
                           and Supporting Research
                              FISCAL YEAR 2002

   FCM-P1-2001


     Since 1965, the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological
     Services and Supporting Research (OFCM) has developed a federal plan
     that articulates the provision of meteorological services and
     supporting research by agencies of the federal government. This
     yearÂ’s plan provides Congress and the Executive Branch with a
     comprehensive document that documents proposed programs for FY 2002
     and reviews agency programs in Fiscal Year (FY) 2001. Narratives,
     timelines, and schedules are current as of June 2001. This year's
     featured article is titled Research to Operations: Bridging the
     Valley of Death.
