                                  11:00 AM

             Good morning.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor and
        privilege to join all of you to celebrate the 25^th anniversary of the
        Ready Reserve Force.

    The Port of Baltimore is the perfect setting to mark this milestone in
   maritime support of our nations security.  It is the birthplace of the
   Star Spangled Banner, which today is proudly sung throughout the land
   with renewed fervor.

    It is home to the SS John W. Brown, one of only two surviving Liberty
   Ships from World War II, and now a museum to honor the many who served
   our nation.

    And today, the Port remains a center of commerce for the Free State,
   generating nearly $2 billon in economic benefits.

    I want to welcome our sealift partners with us today, Rear Admiral
   David L. Brewer, Commander of the Military Sealift Command; Rear
   Admiral Edward Fahy of the US Transportation Command; Capt. Timothy
   Brown, International President, Masters, Mates & Pilots; Michael Sacco,
   President, Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and President,
   Seafarers International Union; Richard T. duMoulin, Chairman, President
   & CEO of the Marine Transport Corporation; and Paul Cammaroto, Chief
   Engineer of one of the great ships that stand at the ready in service
   to our nation, the Cape Wrath.  Thank you for your continued commitment
   and support of our strong maritime partnership.

    It has been said that times of crisis bring out the very best in any
   community, in any Nation.  And that has certainly been true in America
   over these past weeks.

    The events of September 11^th have saddened and angered our nation,
   but these brutal attacks of terror cannot will not break the spirit of
   the American people. More than ever before, we are a nation resolved to
   move forward, to rebound, to rebuild.  We will not let the evil of
   terrorism reign.

   President Bush said in his remarks to the families and friends of those
   who perished at the Pentagon, Our cause is just, our nation is strong
   of heart, firm of purpose.  Inspired by all the courage that has come
   before, we will meet our moment and we will prevail.

   Indeed, the American people will prevail because of capable men and
   women like those here today, men and women who believe in the
   principles on which this great nation was founded freedom, liberty,
   democracy.

    For 25 years, our nations Ready Reserve Force has been at the ready to
   aid in the defense and protection of those principles.  And we a
   grateful nation thank you and honor your outstanding service today.

    In its first real test of military readiness, the RRF more than proved
   its worth to our nation during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm the
   most concentrated military lift exercise in American history.

    The Cape Henry and the Cape Inscription the first RRF ships to arrive
   in Saudi Arabia along with their sister ships, helped ferry nearly one
   quarter of the 3.2 million short tons of dry cargo needed to support
   allied forces in the Persian Gulf.

    And today, the RRF remains ever at the ready to support rapid, massive
   movement of military supplies and troops anywhere in the world.

                In this time of national crisis, no RRF ships have been
   activated to date, but they and their crews are mission capable and
   ready to support any surge sealift requirements when called upon.

                This readiness would not be possible without the support
   of a strong public private partnership between government, industry and
   labor.

    While the RRF began with an agreement between MARAD and the Navy, it
   has matured into a partnership that relies on the American maritime
   industry and American labor to serve our nations defense.  It is a
   partnership that has grown stronger over the years, and today is more
   effective and more productive than ever.

    The key to the RRFs success is its use of experienced American ship
   operating companies which manage the ships, and the skilled and
   dedicated professionals from maritime labor organizations who crew
   them.

                The RRF has served America well.  President Bush and I are
   proud of your accomplishments, confident of your capabilities, and
   determined to give you the tools to continue your exemplary record of
   service and success.

            To that end, the Department of Transportation and its maritime
   partners are working together to ensure that the RRF continues to have
   what it needs to maintain readiness.

            The Department is also working to assist the Congress with its
   effort to craft legislation that will enhance the security of our
   nations ports and maritime borders.

            Time and time again, our nations merchant marine, maritime
   industry, and merchant seafarers have responded to Americas call.  I am
   confident that they will do so again, whether tomorrow, next week, next
   year, or in the distant future.
           Finally, I want to congratulate and thank the past and present
   employees of the Maritime Administration for their stellar efforts in
   service to our nation, especially today, in support of the Ready
   Reserve Force program.

           To all of our sealift partners, congratulations on 25 years of
   exemplary service to our nation.  We thank you and we salute you.
