                              GAMS Project Summary

   The Guide to Available Mathematical Software project of the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) studies techniques to
   provide scientists and engineers with improved access to reusable
   computer software components which are available to them for use in
   mathematical modeling and statistical analysis. One of the products of
   this work is an on-line cross-index of available mathematical software.
   This system also operates as a virtual software repository. That is, it
   provides centralized access to such items as abstracts, documentation,
   and source code of software modules that it catalogs; however, rather
   than operate a physical repository of its own, this system provides
   transparent access to multiple repositories operated by others.

   Currently two software repositories are indexed: one maintained for use
   by NIST staff (parts of which are accessible to public), and netlib, a
   publically accessible software collection maintained by Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville
   (netlib in Tennessee) and Bell Labs (netlib at Bell Labs). This
   represents some 9,000 problem-solving modules from more than 100
   software packages. The majority of this software consists of Fortran
   subprograms for mathematical problems which commonly occur in
   computational science and engineering, such as solution of systems of
   linear algebraic equations, computing matrix eigenvalues, solving
   nonlinear systems of differential equations, finding minima of
   nonlinear functions of several variables, evaluating the special
   functions of applied mathematics, and performing nonlinear regression.
   These components are especially useful to research scientists
   developing applications software. Among the packages cataloged are :
   the IMSL, NAG, PORT, and SLATEC libraries; the BLAS, EISPACK, FISHPAK,
   FNLIB, FFTPACK, LAPACK, LINPACK, and STARPAC packages; the DATAPLOT and
   SAS statistical analysis systems; as well as other collections such as
   the Collected Algorithms of the ACM. Note that some of the libraries
   and packages cataloged are proprietary, and are available only from
   vendors. (The developers are identified for each package.) Source code
   of proprietary software products are not available through GAMS,
   although related items such as documentation and example programs often
   are. These are cataloged here since they are available for use
   internally at NIST. Software from freely available packages can be
   downloaded directly via GAMS.

   All cataloged problem-solving software modules are assigned one or more
   problem classifications from a tree-structured taxonomy of mathematical
   and statistical problems. Users can browse through modules in any given
   problem class. To find an appropriate class, one can utilize the
   taxonomy as a decision tree, or enter keywords which are then mapped to
   problem classes. Search filters can be declared which allow users to
   specify preferences such computing precision or programming language.
   In addition, users can browse through all modules in a given package,
   all modules with a given name, or all modules with user-supplied
   keywords in their abstracts.

   Several user interfaces to the system have been developed :
     * an HTTP gateway (you are using it now)
     * a Java-powered World Wide Web client

   Please report any problems to gams@nist.gov.
