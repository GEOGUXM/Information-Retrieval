   Motor Carrier Safety Programs
   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, a modal administration
   within the U.S. Department of Transportation, regulates and supports
   the Nation's interstate commercial carrier industry. The vision of the
   FMCSA is to develop and promote, in coordination with other
   Departmental modes, data-driven, analysis-based, and innovative
   programs to achieve continuous safety improvements in the Nation's
   highway system, intermodal connections and motor carrier operations. In
   cooperation with our partners and customers, we strive for a 50 percent
   reduction in all fatalities and injuries on our Nation's highways by
   the year 2010. Our ultimate goal is a crash-free commercial motor
   vehicle transportation environment.
