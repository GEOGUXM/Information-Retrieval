   The USGS Energy Resources Program has developed the Digital Earth
   Explorer (DE^2), an interactive program that makes available, over the
   Internet, various map coverages and datasets that can be used for
   decision making on energy and related land-management issues. This
   system can integrate various databases from USGS scientific
   investigations with state-of-the-art digital and Internet capabilities
   to provide scientific decision support. The system is designed to
   consist of comprehensive National geospatial coverage and Internet
   accessibility for rapid analysis of emerging issues. The DE2 includes
   capabilities for user-driven GIS (geographic information system)
   mapping and user-defined queries of coverages and active databases that
   are linked from many sources.
