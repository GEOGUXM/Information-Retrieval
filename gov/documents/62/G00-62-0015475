   ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST 2 & 3 and 4 & 5 ELIGIBILITY POOL INFORMATION
     * Applicants who apply and meet the requirements will be added to the
       pool. Applicants will receive notice that they have been placed in
       the eligibility pool, or that they do not meet the eligibility
       requirements.
     * When a vacancy occurs, applicants in the pool will receive by mail,
       a position announcement which will outline the specifics for that
       opening. Announcements will include information such as duties,
       location, hours of work, and the examination process that will be
       used to identify the most qualified applicants for the position.
       Those who are interested in competing for the opening, including
       applicants interested in transfer or promotion, must apply by
       submitting the materials requested in the position announcement.
       There will be no penalties for not applying.
     * Applicants will receive a score which will only apply to the
       specific position announcement. The top candidates will be referred
       to the hiring supervisor for interview and appointment
       consideration using the standard register referral process. Since
       different exams will be used for each vacancy, applicants may
       receive a difference score for each position for which they apply.
       Score notices for each position announcement will be mailed to the
       applicant.
     * Open Competitive applicants will remain in the pool for one year or
       until they request removal or are no longer eligible. If applicants
       are still eligible and interested in this type of employment at the
       end of a year, they may call Department of Personnel at (360)
       753-2305 or (360) 753-2306 to request that their name remain in the
       pool for one more year or may call at any time to update name,
       address, phone, and availability information. Promotional
       applicants (current state employees in permanent status within the
       State Merit System) will remain in the pool until they request
       removal or are no longer eligible.
