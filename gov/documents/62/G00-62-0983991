   GPO Background

   For more than 140 years, The Government Printing Office (GPO) has kept
   America informed by producing and distributing Federal government
   information products. GPO combines conventional technology with
   state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government
   information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that
   serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and
   the American public.

   Through the Superintendent of Documents programs, GPO disseminates the
   largest volume of U.S. government publications and information in the
   world.

   The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) is by far the largest and
   best known of the Superintendent of Documents programs. Established by
   Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its
   Governments information, this program involves the acquisition, format
   conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the
   coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the
   District of Columbia and U.S. territories.

   The mission of the FDLP is to disseminate information products from all
   three branches of the Government to more than 1,300 libraries
   nationwide. Libraries that have been designated as Federal depositories
   maintain these information products as part of their existing
   collections and are responsible for assuring that the public has free
   access to the material provided by the FDLP.

   Authorized by Title 44, U.S.C., the FDLP and the Cataloging and
   Indexing Program, which produces the Monthly Catalog of the United
   States, are administered by the Library Programs Service (LPS). Out of
   a total GPO work force of more than 3,200, LPS has slightly more than
   100 employees. While most of the GPO work force is engaged in processes
   for printing documents, procurement of printing or CD-ROM replication,
   developing World Wide Web applications, or tasks relating to or in
   support of these functions, LPS has unique responsibilities within GPO
   and is comprised of two divisions:
     * The Library Division performs library-related functions
       (acquisition, classification, format conversion, cataloging,
       inspections, etc.).
     * The Depository Distribution Division is responsible for the
       receipt, shipment preparation, physical distribution of
       publications, and the screening and fulfillment of any claims for
       LPS-shipped paper and electronic publications.

   LPS also manages the distribution component of the International
   Exchange Service (IES) Program for the Library of Congress.

   The Depository Library Council to the Public Printer consists of 15
   members from the library and information community and assists GPO in
   identifying and evaluating alternatives for improving public access to
   government information through the FDLP and for optimizing resources
   available for operating the Program. Established in 1972, it is
   structured to provide the Public Printer with a diverse range of
   opinion and expertise.
