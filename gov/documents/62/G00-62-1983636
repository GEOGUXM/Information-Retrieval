    Senator Clinton Urges President To Include Broadband Access In Budget
                                 Priorities

      Initiatives to Expand Access Would Benefit Rural and Underserved
                           Communities in New York

   Washington, DC - Today, in a letter to President George W. Bush,
   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (NY) asked that in his fiscal year 2003
   budget he include proposals to expand broadband access to more rural
   and underserved communities. Broadband, or high-speed Internet access,
   is the avenue through which Internet users can send and receive larger
   amounts of electronic information at speeds greater than what
   "narrowband" or dial-up access provides through traditional telephone
   lines. Early last year, Senator Clinton introduced legislation to help
   replace narrowband technologies with broadband technologies in rural
   and underserved communities.

   Additionally, Senator Clinton urged the Administration to support
   Senator Rockefeller's Broadband Internet Access Act (S. 88), which
   achieved the same goal as her legislation. This measure - which would
   provide tax credits for five years to companies investing in broadband
   equipment to serve rural and low-income areas -- was included in the
   economic stimulus package, which passed the Senate Finance Committee.

   "Any plan to stimulate our nation's economy must ensure that the jewels
   of technological innovations are accessible, affordable and rapidly
   transmitted to every corner of New York and our nation," Senator
   Clinton wrote. "As you establish the nation's budget priorities for the
   upcoming fiscal year, I would like to urge you to include in your
   budget proposal, incentives and opportunities for deploying broadband
   technologies to every corner of the nation. As I travel around New York
   State, I see firsthand just how critical the need for high speed
   Internet access is to businesses struggling to compete in the 21st
   century marketplace."

   Senator Clinton introduced her broadband legislation on March 1st as
   part of New Jobs For New York - a package of seven bills she introduced
   designed to spur job growth in upstate New York and around the nation.
