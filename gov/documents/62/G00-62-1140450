   NIH Consensus Development Conferences are convened to evaluate
   available scientific information and resolve safety and efficacy issues
   related to biomedical technology. The resultant NIH Consensus
   Statements are intended to advance understanding of the technology or
   issue in question and to be useful to health professionals and the
   public.

   Each NIH consensus statement is the product of an independent,
   non-Federal panel of experts and is based on the panel's assessment of
   medical knowledge available at the time the statement was written.
   Therefore, a consensus statement provides a "snapshot in time" of the
   state of knowledge of the conference topic.

   When reading or downloading NIH consensus statements, keep in mind that
   new knowledge is inevitably accumulating through medical research.
   Nevertheless, each NIH consensus statement is retained on this website
   in its original form as a record of the NIH Consensus Development
   Program.

   Each statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a
   policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government. The format of
   consensus conferences and the style of the ensuing consensus statements
   have evolved over the years and may continue to adapt to changing
   circumstances.
