                    Imagine the Universe! Special Exhibit

               A Tribute to the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory!

                        Deployment of CGRO by STS 37

   Welcome to the Special Exhibit on the magnificent science results from
   the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). Through it's almost 10 years
   of performing gamma-ray observations of celestial objects, the Compton
   Observatory introduced us to a little-known world of gamma-ray bursts,
      exotic pulsars, and blazing active galaxies. Indeed, the Compton
    Observatory defined gamma-ray astronomy, illuminating for us the most
        energetic, violent events that the Universe can dish out. The
    Observatory's four main instruments (BATSE, OSSE, COMPTEL and EGRET)
   captured an unprecedented chunk of the electromagnetic pie, covering a
     broader range of energy than any other observatory -- six orders of
     magnitude, a million times wider than the optical range. Compton's
                     greatest hits are equally as broad.

   This exhibit highlights some of the exciting discoveries made by CGRO.

                         Proof is in the Numbers...

         Compton's proof is in the numbers. The Observatory recorded
   approximately 400 gamma-ray sources; before Compton, only about 40 were
      known. BATSE detected over 2600 fleeting gamma-ray bursts; before
      Compton, only about 300 had been detected. There are roughly 180
   Compton-specific professional science journal articles per year, about
       one every other day. Below, we discuss some of the highlights.

   * Gamma-Ray Bursts
       * Radioactive Decay in Supernova Remnants
       * Blazars
       * Solar Flares
       * Unidentified Sources

   You can find an advanced level discussion of these (and more!) results
                       from CGRO in the CGRO Web Site.
