     OSM is the Regulatory Authority for coal mining operations that occur
   on Indian lands in the Western United States. As such, OSM WRCC is
   responsible for the review and decisions on all applications to conduct
   mining operations and, if a mining permit is issued, OSM is responsible
   for inspection of the mines to ensure that the public and the
   environment is protected, and ultimately OSM is responsible for
   ensuring that mining operations are fully reclaimed before the lands
   are returned to the tribes.

   The Indian Lands Program in the Western Region currently includes seven
   active operations and three inactive operations in reclamation on the
   Navajo, Hopi, Crow and Ute Mountain Ute reservations, in Arizona, New
   Mexico, Montana and Colorado. These coal operations encompass about
   118,000 acres or roughly 185 square miles of surface area and include
   some of the largest coal mines in the country.

   Activities for the Indian Lands program are carried out by the
   Albuquerque and Casper Field Offices and the Program Support Division
   in Denver.

   Program activities include:
     * providing direct technical assistance to the Tribes to support
       their participation in SMCRA * related activities
     * managing permitting activities including review of new
       applications, permit issuance, and related actions such as permit
       renewals, revisions, transfers, permit orders, and mid- term
       reviews

     * conducting a minimum of four complete and eight partial inspections
       a year on each active mine
     * issuance of enforcement actions such as notices of violations, as
       necessary
     * notification, coordination and consultation with citizens, agencies
       and tribes
     * responding to citizenÂ’s complaints and concerns
     * reviewing legal and financial information submitted by coal
       companies for permit clearance and bond determinations
     * administration of enforcement procedures including financial
       penalties for violations
     * conducting National Environmental Policy compliance on permitting
       decisions
     * ensuring compliance with cultural resource protection laws and
       regulations
     * providing public access to files related to the mining operations
