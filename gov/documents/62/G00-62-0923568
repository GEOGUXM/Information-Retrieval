   The Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL) was established in
   1962 to study airsacculitis in broiler chickens. When the losses from
   airsacculitis were brought under control by the implementation of
   [suzanne2.jpg] improved flock management procedures, the laboratory's
   research program evolved to address other emerging disease problems of
   the poultry industry. The laboratory scientific staff provides a
   diverse pool of expertise including veterinarians, microbiologists,
   immunologists, molecular virologists and an agricultural engineer. The
   support staff consisting of technicians, animal caretakers, and
   administrative office personnel is critically important to the overall
   operation of the laboratory. The current total staff of 46 also
   includes contract support personnel, undergraduate students, graduate
   students, and postdoctoral fellows. The laboratory complex consists of
   many separate buildings located on 32 acres donated by and adjacent to
   the University of Georgia. There are specialized facilities, some of
   which were designed and operated to contain highly infectious diseases
   of poultry where they may be studied safely, posing no threat to the
   environment or poultry industry. Nearby laboratories include the
   USDA-ARS Russell Research Center, the Environmental Protection Agency,
   and the University of Georgia Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center.
   In the thirty-six years of its existence, SEPRL has maintained close
   ties with industry, academia, and other government agencies,
   consistently striving to provide an open, responsive research
   atmosphere.
