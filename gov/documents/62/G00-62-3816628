   ARTICLE C.1 Introduction.


   In patients with spinal cord injuries, sensation below the level of
   injury is lost despite the fact that the tactile and proprioceptive
   receptors and their associated afferent neurons are usually intact. If
   appropriate connections to these afferent neurons could be achieved,
   they could be used as transducers for touch, force and position in
   functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) systems. This sensory
   information is needed for closed loop control of FNS and for restoring
   sensation. In on-going studies in Denmark, step lift-off information,
   obtained from a chronically implanted electrode on the sural nerve, has
   been used to control lifting of the foot during the swing phase in an
   individual with stroke related foot-drop. In another study, the
   feasibility of obtaining contact/release information from the lateral
   surface of the index finger has been demonstrated in a quadriplegic
   volunteer using a cuff electrode placed on a digital nerve in the hand.

   A contract was initiated two years ago to investigate, in an animal
   model, the feasibility of extracting signals for control and for
   sensory feedback from electrical recordings in peripheral nerves using
   cuff electrodes. This research has demonstrated stable physiological
   function, as measured by conduction latency, of cuffed peripheral
   nerves in cats for periods of 6 months. The signals recorded from these
   cuff electrodes reflect the mixture of cutaneous and proprioceptive
   receptors in skin and muscle and typically show a rapidly-adapting
   response to contact and a lesser rapidly-adapting response to release.

   Nerve cuff recordings can provide event related information such as
   time of contact and release of objects. They might also provide joint
   position and contact force information but more selective chronic
   recording techniques may be more suitable. This investigation will
   study the feasibility of obtaining sensory information including force
   and position related signals from peripheral nerves in animals on a
   chronic basis. Although human studies are not solicited, it is
   anticipated that this research will lead to future studies in humans.

   This RFP represents a competitive renewal of a contract that will
   expire in January, 1996. A bibliography listing publications from
   current and prior NPP supported studies is available from the Neural
   Prosthesis Program, NINDS, NIH, Room 916, Federal Bldg., Bethesda, MD.

   Article C.2 Statement of Work

   Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to develop and perfect in an animal model,
   chronic recording methods for extracting sensory information about
   human fingertip contact, grasped object slip, finger position, and
   grasp force from chronic recordings of the afferent activity of sensory
   receptors.

   Specifically the contractor shall:

   1. Give consideration to selecting recording methods that:

   a. Have the potential of providing safe, reliable recordings in humans
   for periods of years.

   b. When used in human applications, could provide relatively isolated
   information from the sensory endings in the thumb pad and in the finger
   pads of the second and third fingers.

   c. Could, in human applications, provide information from the
   proprioceptive receptors in the muscles of the hand and wrist.

   2. Select a suitable animal model for chronic recording of afferent
   nerve activity. Consideration shall be given to modeling electrode
   placement sites for a potential human neural prosthesis application.

   3. Obtain or fabricate chronic electrodes and associated cables and
   percutaneous connectors for chronic recording of sensory afferent
   activity.

   a. Electrodes and cables shall be designed using biocompatible
   materials that would be suitable for potential future human implants.

   b. Electrodes and cables shall be designed with the goal of producing a
   chronic implant that causes minimal nerve damage.

   4. Investigate the possibility of extracting information about contact,
   grasped object slip, limb position and contact force from chronically
   recorded neural activity using the animal model and electrodes from
   parts 2 and 3.

   a. Devise recording, processing, and detection methods to extract this
   information from recorded neural activity in a restrained animal.

   b. Modify these methods as needed to function in an unrestrained animal
   and in the presence of stimulation artifacts associated with functional
   electrical stimulation.

   c. Record activity for periods of at least 6 months and devise
   functional measures to track any change in neural response over this
   time.

   d. Evaluate any histological changes in the nerves that occurred over
   the period of chronic recording and, if possible, correlate these
   changes to changes in functional response

   5. Cooperate with other investigators in the Neural Prosthesis Program
   by collaboration and sharing of experimental findings.
