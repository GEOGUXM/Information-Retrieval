   The Department of Water Resources respects the privacy rights of those

   explains our privacy policies and provides notices required by
   Government Code Section 11015.5.

   The Department does not use cookies or other devices or databases in
   order to collect personal information about Internet users. Some of our
   sites may use cookies to offer faster responses or help customize
   users' sessions. Like most Internet sites, we do keep standard log
   records to improve our sites, to provide better information in the
   future and to be sure we are using resources wisely. These logs may
   include the user's IP address or system domain name, computer type,
   browser version, date and time of the visit, names of files requested
   and the referring page.

   For Internet users of systems requiring accounts, we may log the above
   information as well as the departmentally assigned user names. Our logs
   do not record anyone's Internet user name or email address. In order to
   respond to user requests, we may ask users for email or postal
   addresses or other information. Providing this information is entirely
   voluntary.

   We also have a responsibility to protect the computing resources of the
   Department. If we believe someone is trying to break into, has broken
   into or has otherwise abused our computers over the Internet, we can
   use the information in our logs to try to find those who are
   responsible. As part of these efforts we may share the information with
   law enforcement agencies and others. More information is in the
   Security notice below.

   Information in our logs and other records is subject to the limitations
   set forth in the Information Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code Section
   1798). Except as noted, the Department may not distribute or sell any
   electronically collected personal information about users to any third
   party without the permission of the user. Electronically collected
   personal information is also exempt from requests made pursuant to the
   California Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250). Users may
   request removal of electronically collected personal information as
   defined in Section 11015.5 of the California Government Code. Such
   requests should be made to the Chief of Records Imaging and Retrieval,

                                  SECURITY

   This computing system is operated by the State of California and is for
   official use only. Unauthorized access, unauthorized attempted access,
   or unauthorized use of any State computing system is a violation of
   Section 502 of the California Penal Code and/or applicable Federal Law,
   and may be subject to prosecution. Individuals using this computing
   system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject
   to having their activities on this system monitored and recorded by
   system personnel. All http, ftp, telnet and other Internet accesses are
   logged (see Privacy notice above). In the course of system maintenance,
   trouble shooting or security investigations, the activities of
   authorized users may also be logged. These logs are routinely deleted
   as problems are resolved except when a violation of Section 502 of the
   California Penal Code is suspected. Anyone using this system expressly
   consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring
   reveals possible evidence of criminal activity, further legal action
   may be taken.
