                                     CFDLIB

   CFDLIB is the Los Alamos LIBrary of computer codes capable of solving a
   wide range of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems in two or
   three space dimensions. The codes are related to one another by virtue
   of a set of common features. These include the use of Finite-Volume
   computational schemes in which all state variables are cell-centered; a
   multiblock data structure that enables highly efficient processing on
   modern supercomputers; and an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) split
   computational cycle. All flow speed regimes are accessible in the
   library, ranging from fully incompressible to hypersonic; and code
   volumes exist that enable multifluid and multiphase computations with
   an arbitrary number of fluid fields, each with their own set of
   conservation equations. The design of each code volume in the library
   is modular, making the development of codes for specialized
   applications exceptionally fast. For example, a k-epsilon model of the
   Reynolds stress, developed for one code volume, is easily inserted into
   another because of the common data structure among the codes.
