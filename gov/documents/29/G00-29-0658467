   Decisions

   Notes about Decisions

   This site contains the Board's decisions in all appeals issued since
   October 1, 1996, and all travel, relocation, and transportation rate
   cases.  The Archive Page, at http://www.gsbca2.gsa.gov, contains the
   Board's decisions in appeals and protests issued from October 1, 1992
   through September 30, 1996.

   New decisions are typically added to the web on Friday.  Indexing for
   the search engine is done over the weekend.  It is possible that if you
   search for a decision late on a Friday afternoon it may be on-line but
   not indexed yet, so if the decision is very important to you please
   double-check in the actual decision category page before assuming that
   the decision is missing based on the search results.  Every attempt is
   made to update the decision pages at 4:00 PM on Friday to minimize the
   possibility of discrepancy.

   Documents on the following pages are available in three formats: HTML
   (Text), WordPerfect 5.1 (in a self-extracting zip file), and (for
   decisions for the month of August 2000 and subsequent months) Adobe
   Acrobat (PDF) format.

   The text and pdf files may be searched, displayed, printed, and
   downloaded easily.  When viewing decisions in the text format please
   use the "back" key on your browser to return to the index page.

   The WordPerfect 5.1 file is compressed into a self-extracting zip file
   which may be downloaded.  Once downloaded, execute it and the
   WordPerfect 5.1 document will emerge.  After the file has been
   downloaded, the downloaded file may be deleted.

   Footnotes in Decisions

   Documents in WordPerfect format include all footnotes.  Documents in
   text format which are dated before November 15, 1997, do not include
   footnotes.  (The utility program we were using stripped footnotes from
   the documents.)  If you wish to view the footnotes in those documents,
   please refer to the same documents in WordPerfect format.  Documents in
   text format which are dated on or after November 15, 1997, include
   footnotes.  Footnotes in these documents are identified as [Foot #].
   Footnote text will appear at clearly delineated places within the
   documents.

   Page may be searched via the search below.  Searching is limited to a

   responses returned will reflect rate cases.  How to search (including
   search tips) is explained on the search pages.  Search results include
   a brief summary of the beginning of the decision.  Clicking on the case
   number will display the decision in text format.

   Regulations Applicable to Board Cases

   Federal Acquisition Regulation

   The Federal Acquisition Regulation is issued jointly by the Department
   of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration.  The FAR codifies uniform
   policies for acquisition of supplies and services by executive branch
   agencies.

   Two principal sources of travel regulations apply to the travel and
   relocation expenses decisions issued by the Board.

   Federal Travel Regulation

   The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) is issued by the Administrator of
   General Services and governs travel and transportation allowances for
   Federal civilian employees, and relocation allowances for Federal
   civilian employees and certain new employees.

   Joint Travel Regulations

   The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) are issued by the Department of
   Defense (DOD).  They implement statues and regulations (including the
   Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) issued by the General Services
   Administration) pertaining to per diem, travel and transportation
   allowances, and relocation allowances, with application to civilian
   employees in DOD.
