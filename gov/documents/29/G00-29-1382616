                           Special Access Program

   On February 20, 1986, the President announced a program to guarantee
   access to the U.S. market for Caribbean-produced textile products
   assembled from fabric formed and cut in the United States. Caribbean
   countries entered into bilateral agreements with the United States
   under which guaranteed levels of access were established for their
   exports of qualifying assembled textile products. These guaranteed
   access levels are distinct from the quotas or designated consultation
   levels which apply to textile products that do not meet the
   requirements of the Special Access Program. Textile products that meet
   the requirements of the Special Access Program must be entered under
   heading 9802.00.80.15 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
   States (HTSUS), which applies to articles assembled abroad from U.S.
   components, and are subject to duty on the value of the assembled
   textile product less the value of the U.S. components. The program has
   been implemented by Federal Register Notices dated June 11, 1986 (51 FR
   21208); October 20, 1986 (51 FR 37214); May 15, 1987 (52 FR 18414);
   July 10, 1987 (52 FR 26057); November 15, 1989 (54 FR 47549); December
   6, 1989 (54 FR 50425) and June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26394). In a Federal
   Register Notice dated August 30, 1995 (60 FR 45144), the Committee for
   the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) announced the
   establishment of a similar Special Access Program for textile products
   assembled in ATPA designated countries from fabric formed and cut in
   the United States.

   In order to qualify for Special Access Program treatment, a textile
   product must meet the following requirements:

   (1) the product must be assembled in a CBI or ATPA country with which
   the United States has entered into a bilateral agreement regarding
   guaranteed access levels under the Special Access Program;

   (2) the product must be assembled from fabric formed and cut in the
   United States; i.e., all fabric components of the assembled product
   (with the exception of findings and trimmings, including elastic
   strips) must be U.S. formed and cut. This requirement applies to all
   textile components of the assembled product, including linings and
   pocketing, except as provided in (4) below. Greige goods imported into,
   and then finished in, the United States are not considered fabric
   formed and cut in the United States. Fabric that is woven or knitted in
   the United States from yarn is considered U.S.-formed;

   (3) the importer of the product and the exporter of the component parts
   from which the product is assembled must be the same entity or person;
   and

   (4) findings and trimmings of non-U.S. origin may be incorporated into
   the assembled product provided they do not exceed 25 percent of the
   cost of the components of the assembled product. Findings and trimmings
   include sewing thread, hooks and eyes, snaps, buttons, Abow buds,@
   decorative lace trim, elastic strips, zippers, including zipper tapes,
   and labels. Elastic strips are considered findings or trimmings only if
   less than one inch in width and used in the production of brassieres.
   Certain non-U.S. formed, U.S. cut interlinings for suit jackets and
   suit-type jackets may currently qualify as findings and trimmings under
   a temporary amendment to the Special Access Program. See 62 F.R. 49206
   (September 23, 1997), 62 F.R. 66057 (December 17, 1997), and 63 F.R.
   51903 (September 29, 1998);

   (5) upon entry into the United States, the product must be classified
   under heading 9802.00.80.15 of the HTSUS.

   The specific recordkeeping requirements are outlined in Federal
   Register Notices 54 FR 50425 (December 6, 1989) and 63 FR 16474 (April
   3, 1998).

   CITA has determined that the Special Access/Special Regime Export
   Declaration (Form ITA-370P) is no longer necessary for the efficient
   administration of the Special Access Program. As a result, effective
   May 4, 1998, for component parts exported from the United States on or
   after May 4, 1998, participants in the Special Access Program are no
   longer required to file and present the Special Access/Special Regime
   Export Declaration (Form ITA-370P). For assembled products imported
   into the United States that were made from component parts exported
   from the United States on or after May 4, 1998, participants in the
   Special Access Program will no longer be required to file and present
   this form. Participants should be aware, however, that the
   representations made at the time of entry of products alleged to
   qualify under the Special Access Program continue to be subject to
   federal law prohibiting false or misleading statements.

   In order to determine that participants in the Special Access Program
   comply fully with the Special Access Program requirements set forth in
   this Notice, Customs will continue to conduct a series of Post Entry
   Compliance reviews. These reviews will be conducted for entries made
   for the first quarter of 1998 and shall continue for each successive
   quarter. During the course of such a review, the participant must
   provide Customs officials with evidence, through the documents
   describes above, that all products entered under the Special Access
   Program qualify for Special Access Program treatment.
