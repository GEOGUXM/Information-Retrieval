                               For Retirement

   You may already participate in a 401(k) or other similar thrift plan.
   It's wise to make use of these plans, designed primarily for
   retirement. These plans, however, usually have some heavy-duty
   restrictions or penalties if you pull your money out early. Savings
   bonds can be used before retirement, if necessary, helping to protect
   your retirement investments. Bonds can also supplement your other
   retirement savings.

   There are a couple ways you can use bonds to save for your retirement.
   One way is to start saving regularly today and defer paying taxes on
   the interest that your bonds earn. After retirement, you can cash bonds
   to supplement your retirement income and report the tax-deferred
   interest as income at that time (when you might be in a lower income
   tax bracket).

   Another way you can add to your regular retirement income is to
   exchange your E/EE bonds for Series HH bonds. The HH bonds will pay you
   interest semiannually for up to 20 years. You can continue to defer
   paying taxes on the EE/E bonds that you exchange although the interest
   you receive on the HH bonds is taxable in the year it's paid.
