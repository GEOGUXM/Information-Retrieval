   NIH 2002 Comparability Increase for Employees Whose Pay is
   Administratively Determined (AD)

   Dr. Kirschstein has approved comparability increases for employees
   whose pay is administratively determined (AD pay plan). This includes
   members of the Senior Biomedical Research Service (RS pay plan), and
   Senior Level and Senior Technical pay plans (SL/ST). The increases are
   effective January 13, 2002, and will be entered by OHRM centrally for
   all affected employees. The increases are the same percentage amount
   received by GS and SES employees at similar pay levels. A summary of
   the changes follows. Because of the restriction that NIH not approve
   salaries above $200,000, the increase will be limited so that no
   employeeÂ’s salary exceeds $200,000 as a result of the increase.

  Employees whose 2001 salary, including locality, is above $131,615 (ES-3)
