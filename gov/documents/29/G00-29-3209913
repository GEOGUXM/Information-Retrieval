   Systemic Management

   The Marine Mammal Laboratory's Systemic Management Studies Program
   develops and provides management advice based on empirical information.
   Systemic management accounts for complexity, has the goal of achieving
   sustainability, and applies broadly. Special emphasis is placed on the
   National Marine Fisheries Service's objective of achieving sustainable
   fisheries in harvesting fish resources simultaneously from individual
   species, groups of species, and ecosystems. The work of this program
   includes developing and identifying general principles for management.
   Such tenets are of special importance in management to allocate
   harvests over time, space, and alternative species while accounting for
   factors such as population dynamics, genetic effects of harvesting,
   predator/prey relationships, competition and nutrient flow in
   proportion to their relative importance. (References)

   This program also analyzes incidental take data of marine mammals in
   the domestic ground fish fisheries of the North Pacific.

   Systemic management requires synthesis and integration of information
   to include not only single-species approaches, but also management that
   applies at the level of ecosystems and entire ocean basins. The data
   and information used in this program are taken from the published
   literature or are provided by cooperating projects and other field
   programs. The incidental take of marine mammals is assessed using
   fishery observer data collected from commercial fisheries (primarily
   groundfish trawl and longline fisheries).
