       Chart 4 - Distribution of Chapter 11 Filings
       Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code is usually used for business
       reorganizations. Therefore, Chapter 11 cases tend to be the larger,
       more complex cases pending before a bankruptcy court. The chart
       above shows the distribution of Chapter 11 filings for the year. A
       typical pattern in the Eastern District of Virginia is that a high
       percentage of the Chapter 11 cases are filed in the Alexandria
       Division, which includes a large area of suburban Washington, DC.

       spreadsheets are provided for each of the four divisional offices
       and for the Eastern District of Virginia as a whole. Tables contain
       several years worth of data.
