                            Services to Turn off
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is an attempt to document which services should be turned off
   after a system has been installed. It does not list the more well known
   services such as telnet, rsh, rlogin, etc since it is assumed the admin
   knows whether or not these services should be turned off. Instead, this
   document tries to describe some of the other not-so-well known services
   in /etc/inetd.conf that should be turned off. This is just a guideline
   based on a sampling of systems and should not be treated as policy. As
   always, please test any changes you make on a test system (if possible)
   or during a test window before committing to a production system.

     __________________________________________________________________

   SGI Services To Turn Off
     * finger - Used to get who is logged into the machine (remote
       finger).
     * http - Leave on if you are offering up a webserver and using inetd
       to start the http daemon. In practice, this is a bad idea since too
       many web connections can completely kill your system. In any case,
       you should be using the apache distribution from kits.
     * wn-http - Another webserver. Should use apache instead.
     * bootp - Leave on if this is a boot server
     * tftp - Leave on if this is a boot server, font server, roboinst
     * ntalk - Leave on if you need to use the talk utility
     * tcpmux - Needed if system serves non-standard services that do not
       have a well known port (such as a local service). If you aren't
       running a local service (i.e. one developed here) you probably
       don't need this. Services such as taped and dbserv, which were
       developed here, don't know about tcpmux and specify the port they
       need to talk to in their config files. So turning this off won't
       affect them. It will affect SGI's scanner, printer and sysadm
       services, though. With the exception of sysadm, which is used for
       CXFS, I don't think we use any of these here.
     * sgi-dgl - Leave on if you need a graphics library server
     * echo - Used for testing. Echoes out what comes in.
     * discard - Used for testing.
     * daytime - Used for testing.
     * chargen - Used for testing.
     * uucp - Old, turn it off.
     * mountd - Leave on if you are serving NFS files.
     * sgi_mountd - Leave on if you are serving NFS files.
     * rstatd - Leave on if you rely on this to get system stats, like the
       farms system or rup
     * walld - Leave on if you like to allow others to rwall this syste
     * rusersd - Leave on if you need to do remote monitoring of whose
       logged on
     * rquotad - Leave on if you need use quotas on NFS served filesystems
     * sprayd - Used for testing.
     * bootparam/1 - Provides info for diskless clients.
     * ypupdated - Insecure, leave off
     * rexd - Insecure, leave off
     * sgi_videod - Used for video devices like DIVO or DIVO_DVC boards.
     * sgi_toolkitbus ????
     * sgi_snoopd - Gives network traffic data to clients which have
       subscrided. Turn off.
     * sgi_pcsd - Leave on if you are running CaseVision/Workshop
       Debugger.
     * sgi_pod - Printer Object Database Server. Turn this off.
     * sgi_xfsmd - Used for the GUI tool to create xfs filesystem. Don't
       be a weenie. Use CLI.
     * sgi_espd - Embedded support partner which can provide useful
       information if you are using it. However, you have to have esp
       chkconfig'd on.
     * sgi_esphttpd - Allows you to view the esp reports via http. Better
       to leave this off and use apache instead.
     * ttdbserverd - Tooltalk, should turn this off.
     * tcpmux/sgi_scanner - Unless you have a scanner on this machine and
       need to be able to access it remotely, turn this off. If you turned
       off tcpmux, this us probably useless anyway.
     * tcpmux/sgi_printer - Leave on if you use lpsched and not flpr

     __________________________________________________________________

   SUN Services To Turn Off
     * name - Used for name service. This is a central service provided by
       datacomm so this should be off.
     * talk - Leave on if you want to use the talk utility
     * comsat - Works with biff to tell you when you have mail and pops up
       the first 7 lines or 560 chars onto your terminal
     * finger - Used to get who is logged into the machine (remote
       finger).
     * uucp - No one really uses this anymore.
     * tftp - Leave on if this is a font/boot server

     * discard - Used for testing.
     * daytime - Used for testing.
     * chargen - Used for testing.
     * 100232/10 - This is the sadmind service for remote administration.

       patch.

     * rstatd - Leave on if you rely on this to get system stats, like the
       farms system or rup
     * ufsd - Per bug 4143953, ufsd never shipped with Solaris and never
       will. So, this is a bogus entry in the /etc/inetd.conf
     * 100221/1 (KCMS Profile Server) Kodak color management
     * fs - Sun font Server
     * 100235/1 - Leave on if you are using cachefs, I don't think anyone
       is.
     * 100068/2-5 (rpc.cmsd) - Leave on if you use calendar manager. There
       are security patches which should be installed with this first.
     * 100083/1 - tooltalk. There have been enough security problems with
       this that it should be turned off.
     * kerbd/4 - Leave off. Used fermi kerb5 or AFS instead.
     * printer - Since we use flpr, this shouldn't be necessary
     * dtspc - If you use the DT login stuff, you may want to leave this
       on

   Linux Services To Turn Off

   By default, Fermi Red-Hat Linux comes with all services supported by
   inetd or xinetd turned off.
   By default ssh is turned on if it is installed.
   Kerberizing a machine doesn't change the state of a service. Ie. If
   telnet was turned on before, the kerberized version will be turned on.
   If telnet was turned off, the kerberized version will be turned off.
