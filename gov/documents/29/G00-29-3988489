    An illustrated overview of the Airborne Topographic Mapper

   The ATM measures topography to an accuracy of ten to twenty centimeters
   by combining measurements from an airborne laser altimeter and GPS
   (global positioning system) receivers. The ATM has demonstrated this
   accuracy at distances as great as a thousand kilometers from any base
   station.

   The current ATM instruments (ATM2 and ATM3) and their predecessors have
   a history going back twenty-five years. The instruments commonly fly
   aboard the NASA P3-B based at Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia. ATM2
   has also flown aboard several twin-otter (DH-6) aircraft. A major task
   of the ATM over recent years has been the measurement of the Greenland
   ice sheet with the goal of determining changes in the ice sheet
   elevation. Other uses have included verification of satellite
   altimeters , and the measurement of sea-ice thickness. The altimeter
   often flies in conjunction with other instruments, and has been used to
   measure sea-surface elevation and ocean wave characteristics.

   New applications are always being investigated. Measurement of coastal
   beach dynamics and monitoring of beach erosion was begun in 1995 with
   an initial airborne survey of northern Assateague Island in conjunction
   with the National Park Service's ground-based monitoring effort. Also,
   in 1994 an aerial survey was compared against the FAA regulations to
   determine airfield obstruction clearances at the Wallops Flight
   Facility.

   The ATM grew out of the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) project,
   which was conceived in 1975 as an airborne testbed for new applications
   of laser remote sensing. The topographic mapping and ocean
   fluorosensing functions of the AOL were separated in 1994 when the old
   AOL hardware was replaced by two new systems, now known as the ATM and
   the AOL.
