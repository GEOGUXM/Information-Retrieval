From the Directors Desk: Honoring NHMFL Chief Scientist, J. Robert Schrieffer

   In the last issue of NHMFL Reports, I devoted this space to a recap of
   2001 NHMFL conference activity, including major meetings on magnet
   technology, ICR, NMR, EMR, condensed matter and materials physics. I
   remarked then that the "signature event for the year will surely be a
   special symposium on October 19 in honor of NHMFL Chief Scientist and
   Nobel Laureate Bob Schrieffer."

   What I could not imagine then was just how extraordinary the event
   would be. The program was packed with outstanding talks and discussions
   and the evening banquet attracted nearly 150 people, including five
   other Nobelists: Phil Anderson, Alan Heeger, Walter Kohn, Bob Laughlin,
   and Horst Störmer.
