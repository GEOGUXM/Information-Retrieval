   Reactor Analysis Division Synopsis


   [atom.gif]

      The major objective of the research performed by Argonne National
      Laboratory's Reactor Analysis Division is to advance the design and
      operation of nuclear energy systems. The Division's charter encompasses
      the development of next-generation fission reactor and fuel cycle
      concepts, the advancement of computational techniques for evaluating
      and optimizing nuclear energy system performance, and the investigation
      of innovative technologies for safely disposing of spent reactor fuels
      and other nuclear materials.

      Currently, much of the Division's research focuses on developing,
      validating, and deploying computational software needed to demonstrate
      and optimize the electrometallurgical process for treating spent
      nuclear fuel. This software models treatment process unit operations
      and characterizes material inventories and flows for the various
      process steps, including waste form production and packaging. The
      Division's researchers are also modeling the performance of waste forms
      in a geologic repository, both on the basis of theoretical
      considerations (via molecular-level modeling) and empirically from the
      results of waste form production and qualification efforts.

      The Division seeks to enhance computational methods for characterizing
      the performance and safety features of operating reactors, both
      domestically and internationally. The objective of this work is to
      exploit advances in numerical methods and artificial intelligence
      techniques, as well as the continuing advances in computing
      technologies, to devise software that plant operators can use to
      optimize reactor performance and improve their ability to confirm
      reactor safety. Much of this research is conducted in collaboration
      with foreign and domestic organizations, within the framework of the
      International Nuclear Safety Center at Argonne.

      The Reactor Analysis Division also pursues research in nonnuclear
      areas, adapting or extending computational technologies developed in
      the context of its nuclear energy mission. Examples are development of
      advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and control capabilities for fossil
      energy systems and other industrial processes; simulation of advanced
      transportation system concepts; and computationally intensive
      interrogation and interpretation of databases and/or in-service
      inspection of sensor signals to optimize component and system
      maintenance and replacement activities.

      The Division has a strong interest in cooperative research with
      visiting scientists and in supporting scientific education through a
      variety of student programs. To learn more about these programs,
      contact the Reator Analysis Division.

      The Division, which employs about 60 researchers, operates an
      extensive, workstation-based computer network and an Advanced
      Simulation and Controls Laboratory. Its research is sponsored
      predominantly by the U.S. Department of Energy.
