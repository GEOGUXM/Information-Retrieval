   On-line Geologic Map Databases

   The San Francisco Bay Region Project makes regional geologic maps and
   on-line digital geologic map databases for the San Francisco Bay area.

   Geologic maps show the age and distribution of geologic materials, the
   orientation of layered rocks, and the position of active and ancient
   faults.

   In addition to helping understand how the landscape around us formed,
   geologic maps are used in the search for minerals and petroleum, the
   study of groundwater and groundwater pollution, and (especially in the
   San Francisco Bay area) the study of geologic hazards.

   Geologic maps show the position of faults that might break in an
   earthquake and geologic materials that can magnify the amount of
   shaking felt during a quake.

   Geologic maps can also show the location of geologic conditions
   susceptible to landslides.

   The California Division of Mines and Geology has the regulatory
   responsibility to make maps showing the distribution of geologic
   hazards in California, and the USGS provides geologic information to
   them for that effort.

   Geology of the Cordelia and the northern part of the Benicia 7.5 minute
   quadrangles, California

   Above: Geologic Map of the Cordelia and the northern part of the
   Benicia 7.5 minute quadrangles, California. The colors on the map
   represent different rock types. Cross-sections, rock unit descriptions,
   and index maps are included to interpret the geology and its impact on
   humans.
