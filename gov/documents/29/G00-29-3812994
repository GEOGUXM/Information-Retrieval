STANDARD GENERAL LEDGER (USSGL)

   Updated: January 24, 2002

   The USSGL provides a uniform Chart of Accounts and technical guidance
   to be used in standardizing Federal agency accounting, which supports
   the preparation of standard external reports required by central
   agencies. The Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) USSGL Supplement
   (released annually) is composed of five major sections: Chart of
   Accounts, Account Descriptions, Accounting Transactions, USSGL
   Attributes, and Report Crosswalks.
