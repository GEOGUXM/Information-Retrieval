   WATER RIGHTS ADJUDICATION - gila river

   Why have I been contacted?
          You are being served with a New Use Summons because the records
          of the Arizona Department of Water Resources indicate that you
          may have initiated a new use of water between July 1, 1991 and
          December 31, 2000.

   How did this come about?
          Because the property you own is located within the lands drained
          by the Gila River and its tributaries, the use of water on your
          property may be affected by an on-going court proceeding known
          as the Gila River Adjudication. The adjudication is a
          comprehensive court proceeding to determine the nature, extent
          and relative priority of rights to use water in the Gila River
          System and Source.

   What is a "new use summons"?
          It is an order from the Maricopa County Superior Court, which is
          handling the adjudication, to assert any claims to water you may
          have in the Gila River system and source by filing the
          appropriate court-approved form.

   What paperwork do I need to file?
          For each of the seven watersheds, there are four court-approved
          statement of claimant forms:

     * an irrigation water rights form,
     * a stockpond water rights form,
     * a domestic water rights form, and
     * a form for other water rights.

   Seven watersheds? How do I know which is my watershed?
          You may locate your watershed by viewing the map, and by calling
          the Adjudication Hotline at 1-866-246-1414.

          You may obtain the form(s) you need for filing your claim(s)
          from the Arizona Department of Water Resources, or by
          downloading them from this website.

   How do I download the forms?
          Click here to go to the "Forms" section. Locate the correct
          form(s) and do one of two things:

    1. Print directly from the web page.
    2. Right click on the form you wish to obtain, and select "Save Target
       As." Choose a directory on your hard disk drive where you wish to
       save the form. Then you may open the file and print it.

     Note: The forms are Adobe Acrobat documents. To work with these
     files, you will need to obtain and install the Acrobat Reader. If
     you do not have Acrobat Reader, you may obtain a free copy from
     www.adobe.com

   Why must I file a form in the first place?
          All groundwater users should file the appropriate statement of
          claimant form for their groundwater use to defend their use in
          the event other claimants assert that groundwater is
          appropriable under state law, or is subject to claims based upon
          federal law.

   How much does this cost?
          The filing fee for an individual is $20. The filing fee for a
          corporation, municipal corporation, the state or any political
          subdivision, or an association or partnership, is two (2) cents
          for every acre-foot of water claimed, or $20, whichever is
          greater.

   How do I pay?
          The filing fee should be paid by check or money order made
          payable to the order of the "Arizona Department of Water
          Resources." The Court will not consider your claim unless the
          filing fees for the claim have been paid.

   What happens if I dont file?
          You may lose the right to use the water of the Gila River system
          and source if you fail to file a statement of claimant with the
          Arizona Department of Water Resources. This may happen even
          though you have received a permit, certificate or other approval
          from the Arizona Department of Water Resources.

          You do not obtain a right to use water by filing a statement of
          claimant form. Rights to use water must be acquired in
          accordance with state or federal law. In many cases, you cannot
          initiate a new or increased use under state law until the
          appropriate permit, certificate or other approval has been
          received from the Arizona Department of Water Resources.

   What does the 90-day deadline mean? Can I lose my rights if my
          paperwork isnt processed in time?
          The state law requires a claimant to submit paperwork within 90
          days of receipt of the summons. The Court may extend the time
          for good cause.

          Because of recent budget reductions and the effect on manpower,
          do not be concerned that you will lose your rights. If you file
          within a reasonable time, your rights will be protected.

          Note: The Arizona Department of Water Resources is receiving a
          high volume of telephone calls regarding the adjudication
          process. Our staff is responding to calls in the order we
          receive them. If you leave a message, we will return your call
          as soon as possible. However, reductions in statewide services
          stemming from budget cuts may prevent us from returning your
          call as quickly as we would like. We appreciate your patience.

          We understand that rights holders may be concerned about the
          90-day time period for filing the necessary forms. Please be
          advised that your water rights will not be jeopardized by the
          length of the process. State law allows rights holders to file
          adjudication forms after expiration of the 90-day period.

          A final note: In case your neighbors wonder when their notices
          will arrive, the Department is mailing New Use Summons to water
          rights holders in alphabetical order.

          Thank you again for your understanding

   What else do I need to consider?
          After you have filed a statement of claimant in this
          adjudication, you must notify the Arizona Department of Water
          Resources of any of the following changes in, or concerning,
          your statement of claimant:

         1. a change in your address,
         2. an assignment of your statement of claimant to another person,
         3. a transfer to another person of all or part of the land for
            which a water right has been claimed, and
         4. a transfer to another person of all or part of the water right
            claimed, if the claimed water right has been severed and
            transferred to another parcel of land.

          Notice of any of the changes identified in this paragraph must
          be filed with the Arizona Department of Water Resources within
          thirty (30) days of the change using a form approved by the
          Court. This form is available from the Arizona Department of
          Water Resources.

   What if I have sold the property?
          If you have sold the property which is located in the Gila River
          System, you should download and complete the two forms titled
          "Assignment" and "Well - Change of Ownership."
