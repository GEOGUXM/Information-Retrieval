   issues about medical care, prescriptions, preventive testing and mental
   health services. We will also help you with questions regarding the

   program allows you to request that the Department obtain an impartial
   review of HMO decisions concerning:
     * the medical necessity of a proposed treatment; or
     * experimental or investigational therapies for certain medical
       conditions; or
     * denied claims for out of plan emergency or urgent medical services.
