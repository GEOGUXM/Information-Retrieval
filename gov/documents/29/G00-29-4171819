                                LAFCO Reform

   Please see below for new information.

   On September 26, 2000, Governor Gray Davis signed into law AB 2838
   (Chapter 761, Statutes of 2000), authored by Assembly Speaker Robert M.
   Hertzberg. This legislation, titled the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local
   Government Reorganization Act of 2000, marked the most significant
   reform to local government reorganization law since the 1963 statute
   that created local agency formation commissions (LAFCOs) in each
   county. The legislation resulted from the recommendations of the
   Commission on Local Governance for the 21st Century, created by
   legislation enacted in 1997. The Commission's recommendations were
   included in its final report, titled Growth Within Bounds, issued on
   January 20, 2000. The Commission ceased to exist on July 1, 2000,
   pursuant to a statutory sunset provision.

   AB 2838 requires the Office of Planning and Research to establish task
   forces and/or consult with affected local agencies to accomplish the
   following:

     (1) By July 1, 2001, in consultation with the State Controller,
     convene a task force composed of representatives of cities,
     counties, special districts, and local agency formation commissions,
     as nominated by their statewide organizations and associations, with
     expertise in local government fiscal issues for the purpose of
     creating statewide guidelines for the incorporation process. The
     guidelines shall be completed by January 1, 2002 and shall serve as
     minimum statewide guidelines for the incorporation process. The
     guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, information to
     assist incorporation proponents to understand the incorporation
     process, its timelines, and likely costs. They shall also provide
     direction to affected agencies regarding the type of information
     that should be included in the comprehensive fiscal analysis of an
     incorporation, as well as suggestions for alternative ways to
     achieve fiscally neutral incorporations. The guidelines shall be
     advisory to the commissions in the review of incorporation
     proposals. (Government Code, Section 56815.2)

     (2) Not later than July 1, 2001, in consultation with individual
     local agency formation commissions, the California Association of
     Local Agency Formation Commissions, and other local governments,
     prepare guidelines for the service reviews to be conducted by
     commissions pursuant to the statute. The service reviews shall cover
     the municipal services provided in the county or other appropriate
     area designated by the LAFCO. The review shall include a written
     statement of the LAFCO's determinations with respect to each of the
     following:
    1. infrastructure needs or deficiencies;
    2. growth and population projections for the affected area;
    3. financing constraints and opportunities;
    4. cost avoidance opportunities;
    5. opportunities for rate restructuring;
    6. opportunities for shared facilities;
    7. government structure options, including advantages and
       disadvantages of consolidation or reorganization of service
       providers;
    8. evaluation of management efficiencies; and
    9. local accountability and governance.

     The commission shall comprehensively review all of the agencies that
     provide the identified service or services within the designated
     geographic area. The review shall be conducted before, or in
     conjunction with, but no later than the time the LAFCO considers an
     action to establish or to update a sphere of influence. (Government
     Code, Section 56430)

   The following material should be of assistance to local agency
   formation commissions in fulfilling their new responsibilities under
   the Act. These documents are in PDF format and require Acrobat Reader,
