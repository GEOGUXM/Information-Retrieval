   LAPS wind analysis

   The analysis portion of the NOS Narragansett Bay Local and Analysis and
   Prediction System (NBLAPS) generates hourly, high-resolution surface
   analyses of atmospheric conditions for the bay region. NBLAPS uses
   surface observations from traditional observing platforms operated by
   NWS, FAA, and DOD and also NOS PORTS for Narragansett Bay. Hourly
   analyses will be generated and displayed on a regular basis starting by
   February 1, 2002.

   These analyses are being used as surface forcing for an experimental
   estuarine forecast systems to be developed by other partners of the
   Narragansett Bay National Oceanographic Partnership (NOPP) Project.
