   The NIMH web site (www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/childmenu.cfm) has been
   awarded a five-star rating by the Tufts University Child & Family
   WebGuide for its child and adolescent mental health information. The
   award letter cited NIMH for "providing a substantial amount of applied
   research information on mental health issues, covering learning
   disabilities, brain functioning, ADHD, medication, diagnosis, causes,"
   and "for making a significant amount of material accessible to child
   development experts, parents and others who work with children." The
   information honored is a special section of the NIMH web site, which
   received over seven million "hits" from consumers last month.

   Created by the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts
   University in Medford, Massachusetts, the WebGuide identifies,
   describes and evaluates web sites that contain the most credible child
   development information available. Only a small percentage of sites
   pass the WebGuide's rigorous screening process and of these, less than
   10 percent receive a five star award.

   The WebGuide is a not-for-profit resource that was developed in
   collaboration with the Society for Research in Child Development, with
   input from parents, childcare professionals, and noted child
   development experts. It is the first online resource for parents,
   child-care professionals, and students that systematically evaluates
   the web sites it lists.

   NIMH is one of the 27 components that make up the National Institutes
   of Health, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
