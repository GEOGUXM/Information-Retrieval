          The Los Alamos Applied Mathematical Sciences program supports
          basic research in applied mathematics and computational
          techniques for problems critical to current Laboratory
          applications and areas likely to nucleate future Laboratory
          programs, including modeling of physical systems and design of
          algorithms to facilitate solution of large-scale problems using
          high-performance computers. The program also serves as a bridge
          among university, industry, and Los Alamos researchers and
          encourages transfers to and from the Laboratory of
          state-of-the-art mathematical theory and advanced computational
          techniques.

          Research is focussed into two areas: traditional applied
          mathematics research, and predictability of complex systems.
          Critical funding comes from the Applied Mathematical Sciences
          (AMS) division of the Department of Energy.
