   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry RELEASE September 2,
   1999 PUBLIC COMMENT BACKGROUND In April 1999, the California Department
   of Health Services, Environmental Health Investigations RELEASE Branch
   (CDHS-EHIB) under a cooperative agreement with the Agency for Toxic
   Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released the consultation
   "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Plutonium Contamination in Big
   Trees Park" [1]. In that public health consultation, an analysis of the
   plutonium-associated radiological dose that might be received by
   individuals using the park was determined not to be a public health
   concern. Nonetheless, the main question not answered in that document
   was how the plutonium (Pu1) reached the park. ATSDR and CDHS-EHIB made
   three specific recommendations regarding the need for additional
   sampling in Big Trees Park. These recommendations as published were as
   follows: 1. We recommend further sampling of Big Trees Park and the
   Arroyo Seco Creek sediments to determine the vertical and horizontal
   extent of the Pu 239 contamination. 2. We recommend further evaluation
   of the distribution of contaminated sludge throughout the Livermore
   Valley, and other areas. This would include assessing the different
   avenues for gathering information on where sludge may have been
   distributed, and if locations are identified that may have received
   contaminated sludge, assessing the feasibility of various approaches to
   characterize the potential plutonium in those areas. 3. PUBLIC COMMENT
   We recommend that potential contaminant releases from sewer line
   ruptures be investigated in future health consultations focusing on
   sediments in the Livermore Valley RELEASE or LLNL discharges to the
   sanitary sewer system. PURPOSE OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTATION ATSDR
   is preparing this public health consultation to address the following
   issues: 1) Overall quality of the data collected during the 1998 Big
   Trees Park sampling event; 2) evaluate the possible pathways by which
   Pu reached the park and; 3) if additional consideration should be given
   for an area-wide sampling for Pu in residential soils. PUBLIC COMMENT 1
   RELEASE Elements have been assigned either one or two letter
   abbreviations. The abbreviation for plutonium is Pu. When a number is
   associated with the name or the abbreviation, this indicates the mass
   of the particular element. For example, Pu 239 represents plutonium
   with a mass of 239. If two numbers are given such as Pu 239/340, this
   indicates that typical radiochemistry laboratory analyses cannot
   differentiate between Pu 239 and Pu 240 because the energies of their
   decay is almost identical and cannot be differentiated by the counting
   equipment. 1 PUBLIC COMMENT STATEMENT OF ISSUES A series of public
   meetings were held in the city of Livermore in 1997 and 1998. One
   outcome of RELEASE these meetings was that the regulatory agencies
   composed of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE) and CDHS-Radiological Health Branch
   (CDHS-RHB), agreed that additional sampling in Big Trees Park was
   warranted. DOE and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL),
   with regulatory oversight, developed a new sampling plan. This sampling
   plan released for public comment, was finalized in October 1998 [2].
   Included in this sampling effort was a split sampling plan in which
   approximately 10% of the samples collected would be supplied to ATSDR
   for independent analysis [3]. As stated in the sampling plan the
   purpose of the 1998 round of sampling was to describe methodologies,
   analytical procedures, and related tasks to determine how the plutonium
   identified in the previous public health consultation could have
   reached the park; that is, to collect environmental samples for a
   pathway analysis. The sampling plan required collection of soil samples
   at various locations and depths within the Big Trees Park. The major
   locations included grid samples to determine if the pathway was air
   dispersion, the current Arroyo Seco channel and the old channel before
   the realignment of the creek to determine if the pathway was releases
   of Pu from LLNL via sewer line breaks or via overland flow from the
   southeast quadrant of LLNL, and sampling in and around ornamental trees
   to determine if the pathway was use of contaminated PUBLIC COMMENT
   sewage sludge as a soil amendment. Other sampling areas included a
   disked area done at the request of a community member to evaluate the
   dust and dirt as a possible inhalation and ingestion pathway, the Big
   Trees Park extension, and sampling in the playground of the Arroyo
   RELEASE Seco Elementary School. A detailed discussion of the rationale
   associated with these locations is beyond the scope of this public
   health consultation but is available in the 1998 Sampling Plan document
   [2]. Previous Sampling Events The first publically reported sampling of
   Big Trees Park was released in 1994 when the EPA National Air and
   Radiation Environmental Laboratory was doing confirmatory surveys of Pu
   contamination in the southeast quadrant of LLNL [4]. Big Trees Park and
   two additional city parks in Livermore were chosen to represent areas
   considered background. Based on these results, Pu might be elevated in
   the surface soils of this park and the two additional parks in
   Livermore. In response to the discovery of Pu in Big Trees Park, LLNL
   in 1995 repeated the Big Trees Park sampling for verification purposes
   [5]. Details of these sampling events can be found PUBLIC COMMENT in
   the CDHS-EHIB and ATSDR public health consultation [1] and the
   referenced documents [4,5]. Because each of the previous sampling
   efforts had different data quality objectives, the data RELEASE between
   these sets should not have been analyzed as a combined group for
   several reasons. In ATSDR's opinion, these included, but are not
   limited to, a lack of available inter-laboratory quality control and
   assurance from independent laboratories, variations in the
   methodologies used 2 PUBLIC COMMENT for the analyses, lower limit of
   detection issues, and precision and accuracy for the intercomparison of
   data sets. These factors have been discussed at several public
   meetings; CDHS-EHIB, ATSDR, and the regulatory agencies have also
   discussed these issues through a RELEASE series of correspondence.
   Additional discussion of the previous data sets is not warranted and,
   therefore, is beyond the scope of this document. Data Quality, Quality
   Control and Quality Assurance Activities For the 1998 sampling of Big
   Trees Park, the issues of data quality were addressed through a more
   in-depth oversight by the EPA and CDHS-RHB, public participation via a
   comment period, a split sampling plan among LLNL, EPA, and ATSDR, and
   regulatory analysis of the split sampling data by EPA. ATSDR
   involvement in this process was three-fold: 1) Serve as a central
   collection point for public comments; 2) Arrange for an independent
   laboratory analysis of approximately 10% of the collected samples and;
   3) Participate in the data quality review for the purposes of this
   sampling event. A data quality team was established consisting of the
   federal agencies, ATSDR, EPA, and DOE, and the state and laboratory
   entities, CDHS-RHB, and LLNL. The team was selected based on their
   knowledge of radiation chemistry, radiological measurement protocols,
   and familiarity with radiation measurement instrumentation. Identical
   data packages including results, quality control PUBLIC COMMENT
   samples, protocols and analysis procedures were supplied and reviewed
   by this team. Discussions on the methods for this team review were
   discussed in the DOE offices in Oakland, California prior to sample
   collection. Present for these technical discussions were
   representatives from RELEASE CDHS-EHIB and RHB, ATSDR, EPA, DOE, and
   LLNL. Additional technical deliberations and discussions of data
   validation issues were via conference telephone calls or via electronic
   mail. The EPA Quality Assurance office in San Francisco also requested
   a review of the quality control and quality assurance issues by its
   Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Montgomery, Alabama, and the Indoor
   Environments National Laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada. The latter
   organization also reviewed analytical methods, quality control
   procedures of the participating laboratories, and evaluated the results
   with respect to the samples collected per the split sampling plan. The
   conclusion of this evaluation was that, overall, the data among the
   laboratories were in close agreement and "most of the data is useable
   without qualification" [6]. Statistical considerations for radiological
   data analysis PUBLIC COMMENT Typically, results from the analysis of
   radioactive samples are expressed as a 3-number set that includes the
   measured result, an indication of the uncertainty in the measurement,
   and the minimum detectable activity. Therefore, many statistical
   considerations must be taken into account during the evaluation of
   these samples, especially those samples at or near values RELEASE
   considered background values. These considerations include method of
   sample collection and preservation, the methods of analysis, and
   laboratory quality control and assurance that the samples are handled
   identically. These issues all contribute to the general term "error." 3
   PUBLIC COMMENT Furthermore, the instruments used to measure the
   radioactivity also contribute to the uncertainty error, the error of
   the measurement denoted as the 2 sigma error (2F). The 2F error means
   that there is a 95% confidence that the reported value is correct with
   only a 5% chance that the "true" RELEASE number is outside the range in
   the given interval. For example, 10 ± 3 means that the measured value
   is 10 with an error of 3. This is interpreted as the true number is
   between 7 and 13. Occasionally, the 2F error is larger than the
   measured value, for example, 10 ± 15. In this situation, the sample
   should be considered to be a non-detect or zero. When radiological
   samples with concentrations that approach either the lowest level that
   can be detected by the instrumentation or approach the levels
   associated with background, are analyzed, the 2F error increases
   dramatically. Therefore, finding 2F values approaching 50% or more of
   the measured value is common in these situations. Therefore, these data
   could be considered not to be significantly different from background
   or a non-detection. For this consultation, ATSDR analyzed the data
   using the following procedures that were established by ATSDR prior to
   the start of the data evaluation: 1. Does the laboratory-derived value
   exceed the minimum activity or level of instrument detection (MDA)? If
   the value is less than the MDA, then the sample measurement is not
   significant and no additional evaluation is needed. 2. PUBLIC COMMENT
   Does the laboratory-derived value exceed the reporting limit as
   outlined in the sampling plan? If the sample is above the reporting
   limit, continue with the evaluation. 3. RELEASE Is the measured
   laboratory-derived measurement greater than the MDA but less than the
   reporting level? If so, continue with the evaluation. 4. Is the 2F
   interval less than the laboratory-derived measurement and what
   percentage does it represent? If the 2F is less than 25% of the
   laboratory reported value, consider the measurement a valid
   measurement. If the 2F is more than 25% attempt to evaluate using other
   methods such as duplicate samples. DISCUSSION Overall Data Quality
   During the sampling, approximately 10% of the samples were sent to the
   Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)2 in Atlanta for
   independent analysis of Pu 238, PUBLIC COMMENT and Pu 239/240 by alpha
   spectroscopic techniques, and for Americium 241 (Am 241) by low 2
   RELEASE The identification of non-government affiliated private
   laboratories in this document is neither an endorsement nor a
   recommendation of their capabilities. Their mention is provided for
   informational purposes only. ATSDR has an Interagency Agreement with
   the Division of Federal Occupational Health (DFOH), Health Resources
   Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. The
   laboratory services of Georgia Tech were obtained through a subcontract
   administered by DFOH. 4 PUBLIC COMMENT energy X-ray analysis with
   verification as needed by alpha spectroscopy. ATSDR also requested the
   laboratory analyze samples by gamma spectroscopy for additional
   products that might be present in the soil samples. Another set of
   samples from the same locations was supplied to RELEASE LLNL for
   analysis by their laboratories and a third set consisting of all
   samples collected was supplied to General Engineering Laboratory (GEL),
   the prime laboratory for sample analyses, under contract to DOE. The
   data quality review process only allows for an intercomparison of those
   samples evaluated by the three laboratories. Therefore, only Pu 238, Pu
   239/240, and Am 241 were considered. Briefly, the quality of the data
   collected during the 1998 sampling of Big Trees Park was very good.
   Comparisons of the results from the three reporting laboratories were
   in good agreement with respect to the reported Pu 239/240 values.
   Therefore, ATSDR and the regulatory agencies are comfortable that the
   results for the remainder of the samples are a true representation of
   the environmental conditions in Big Trees Park. Figure 1 shows these
   reported values from each laboratory for the major radionuclide of
   concern, Pu 239/240, expressed as Pu 239. From this figure, one can see
   that most of the samples were indistinguishable from one laboratory to
   another. Furthermore, a statistical analysis these samples, called
   Analysis of Variance, suggest that these measured values are identical
   to one other. PUBLIC COMMENT Lab Comparisons (QC) Pu-239 0.7 0.6 0.5

   the agencies involved with the quality assurance process were satisfied
   with the acceptability of the data set, the final data sets were
   distributed to the regulatory agencies and ATSDR. LLNL also posted the
   results on their World Wide Web site at the following addresses:
   http://www-envirinfo.llnl.gov/ RELEASE or
   http://www-erd.llnl.gov/bigtrees/ and includes maps of the sampling
   locations and the sampling results. These results are used in the
   development of this public health consultation. Overall, LLNL and EPA
   collected 379 samples for Pu 238 and Pu 239/240 analysis, 117 samples
   were also used for Am 241 analysis, and 101 samples were also used for
   metals analysis. These samples included duplicate samples as internal
   checks on laboratory procedures. The metals included in the analysis
   were those commonly found in sewage sludges - chromium, copper, lead,
   nickel, and zinc [2]. The sampling plan required a reporting level of
   Pu 239/240 at 0.005 picocuries per gram (pCi/g) equivalent to 2 x 10 -4
   becquerels per gram (Bq/g). This value approaches the regional
   background as determined by LLNL and other reports as referenced in the
   sampling plan [1,2,4,7]. The background values as reported by LLNL and
   based on approximately 200 samples, shows a typical environmental
   distribution of Pu 239/240 with an estimated geometric mean
   concentration3 of 0.0026 pCi/g (1 x 10 -4 Bq/g) [2]; Gallegos reported
   Pu 239/240 levels ranging from 1.2 x 10 -4 Bq/g (3.2 x 10 -3 pCi/g) to
   2 x 10 -4 Bq/g (5.4 x 10 -3 pCi/g) upwind and PUBLIC COMMENT downwind
   from LLNL, respectively [7]. Furthermore, converting data collected by
   Hardy [8] into the more common units of picocuries per gram from
   millicuries per square kilometer by using standard values for soil
   density, one estimates the Pu concentration at 2.2 x 10 -4 Bq/g (6 x 10
   -3 RELEASE pCi/g); this also agrees with LLNL data. Other estimates of
   background concentrations of Pu 239/240 suggests regional differences
   exist possibly related to weather conditions and soil disturbing
   activities which have been shown to alter radionuclide concentrations
   in soils [9]. Because of uncertainties involved with radiological
   detection at extremely low levels, ATSDR health physics staff use a
   value of 3 to 5 times greater than the suspected background values as
   an indicator of significance. Therefore, the reporting level of 0.005
   pCi/g (2 x 10 -4 Bq/g), a value twice the reported background, is
   considered valid for the purposes of the sampling plan. Analytical
   processes report a minimum detectable activity or level (MDA or MDL).
   Table I summarizes the numbers of samples, the number of samples in
   which the MDA value was above the reporting level and the number of
   samples in which the detected activity was below the MDA. Because the
   MDA is a variable that depends on the sample characteristics and
   instrument operational restraints (background, counting time, etc.),
   the detector instrumentation and their PUBLIC COMMENT computer related
   programs can report values below the MDA once these restraints are
   taken into account. The computer-estimated values below the MDA are
   usually reported as either the MDA or non-detects; that is, no activity
   in the sample under investigation. 3 RELEASE The geometric mean is used
   to measure the central tendency of a data set, especially if the data
   set is not evenly distributed. 6 PUBLIC COMMENT When all samples
   collected from Big Trees Park are reviewed as an entire group, the
   following information is observed. The highest concentrations of the
   radionuclides and their locations were as follows: A) Pu 238 detected
   at 8.57 x 10 -2 ± 0.018 pCi/g (3.17 x 10 -3 Bq/g) in grid location
   RELEASE G0103 (10 cm depth); B) Pu 239/240 at 0.774 ± 0.11 pCi/g (2.9 x
   10 -2 Bq/g) in grid location G0103 (10 cm depth) and; C) Am 241 at
   0.205 ± 0.066 pCi/g (7.6 x 10 -3 Bq/g) in grid location G0104 (5 cm
   depth). For comparison, the EPA Region IX Preliminary Remediation Goal
   is 2.5 pCi/g for Pu 239/240 and the National Council on Radiation
   Protection and Measurements (NCRP) recommends approximately 51 pCi/g
   for each of these radionuclides in a park scenario to be used as
   screening level indicator for the evaluation of additional actions
   [10]. The most stringent NCRP value is 7.8 pCi/g for a sparsely
   vegetated rural area. Table I. Data Summary for Big Trees Park 1998

   Radiological Considerations Air pathway The soils samples used to
   evaluate the air pathway were collected from the grid locations (coded
   GXXX where XXX represents numbers). Collection depths ranged from 5 cm
   to a depth of 40 cm. The analysis of these samples was for Pu 238, Pu
   239/240, and Am 241. Only those samples that met the criteria
   previously discussed were used in the analysis; in all 111 samples from
   all depths met ATSDR's pre-established criteria. Several issues are to
   be considered for evaluating this pathway. Among these are: 1) the size
   and location of the grid; that is, is there sufficient separation of
   the sampling locations to give PUBLIC COMMENT adequate spatial
   distribution of samples; 2) the comparison of the grid with other
   locations within the park, and; 3) comparison of the grid locations
   with other Livermore Valley sampling locations considered background
   and listed in the sampling plan [2]. RELEASE The air pathway analysis
   was performed by comparing the Pu concentration in the grid area using
   the top 5 cm samples and comparing those to the Pu distribution at 5 cm
   depths from other locations in the park, comparing the 5 cm depths to
   the 10 cm and 20 cm depths, and from 5 7 PUBLIC COMMENT other locations
   near the laboratory and south of the laboratory as listed in the
   sampling plan [2]. These samples, listed in the sampling plan, are
   coded HOSP, MET, MESQ, ERCH, and RRCH. For the analysis, ATSDR used
   analysis tools for investigating small numbers of samples called the
   RELEASE t-test and the F-test [11]. A t-test evaluates the average or
   mean of a distribution of samples to determine if they are similar. One
   result of this test is the calculation of a "t value" that can be
   compared to a tabulated value. The tabulated value is called the
   critical value, found in any book on statistics, is used in business,
   scientific, or any other discipline in which a statistical analysis is
   required. If this "t value" is less than the tabulated value, then
   there is no difference between the values evaluated. In a similar
   manner, the F-test is a procedure to determine if the variation in the
   sample measurements is significant. If the measured "f value" is
   greater than the critical tabulated value, then the chance that the
   samples are identical is small [11]. The grid sample values also were
   entered into a geographical information system (GIS) to display the
   spatial configurations to determine if a distribution pattern could be
   visualized. If the Pu reached the park via the air pathway, the Pu
   concentrations in the associated grid locations should be significantly
   different from the Pu at other surface areas in the park. This would
   not necessarily rule out the air dispersion pathway as other locations
   within the park could have been impacted by the air releases. If the Pu
   in the top 5 cm of soils is significantly different from that in the
   samples collected 10 and 20 cm, then either air dispersion or other
   methods of distribution are possible. The other 5 sampling locations
   listed in the sampling plan were chosen PUBLIC COMMENT for the
   following reasons. First, the winds in the Livermore valley, based on
   wind direction reports show that little wind, if any come from the
   north; therefore the ERCH samples could represent a background location
   [7]. The HOSP samples are west of the ERCH samples and RELEASE could
   also be considered similar to the background samples. The MET and MESQ
   samples are at the west boundary of LLNL, and these samples could be
   expected to be impacted by air releases when the wind blows from
   easterly to westerly directions. The RRCH location, north of Interstate
   580 near Vasco Road, is a downwind direction when the wind blows from
   the south across the laboratory property. The results of the analyses
   of these data are given in Table II. In essence, the soils in the top 5
   cm from the grid locations are not significantly different from the
   soils collected from the other 5 cm samples from the areas within the
   park, from the soil samples collected at 10 cm in the grid area, or
   from soils collected in the top 45 cm of the tree wells. At other
   areas, both in the park and outside the park, the 5cm depth samples
   were significantly different. Those samples at the laboratory boundary,
   MET and MESQ, have Pu concentrations lower than soil samples collected
   in the park. This would not be expected if air dispersion were the
   pathway- Pu is a dense PUBLIC COMMENT material and would deposit at
   higher concentrations closer to the release point. Furthermore, the
   grid samples are essentially identical across the park and in the tree
   wells which apparently received the sewerage sludge; this type of
   distribution would not be expected if the Pu had been deposited via the
   air pathway. RELEASE In those areas that are downwind of the
   laboratory, the concentrations of Pu in soils are higher than those
   concentrations found in the park. In 1980, the California Department of
   Health 8 PUBLIC COMMENT Services collected soil samples from areas
   east, northeast, and east northeast at a distance of up to 2 kilometers
   (1.2 miles) from LLNL, approximately the same distance Big Trees Park
   is from LLNL. These directions are downwind of LLNL the majority of the
   time [12]. The geometric RELEASE mean concentration of Pu 239/240 from
   these locations was 0.068 pCi/g (2.5x10-3 Bq/g) as compared to the
   geometric mean of 0.017 pCi/g (6.3 x 10-4 Bq/g) for the top 5 cm
   throughout the park. This would suggest that Pu in the park is not the
   result of atmospheric deposition from LLNL activities. The GIS spatial
   analysis indicated that the Pu is not uniformly distributed and these
   values did not fit a continuous distribution as would be expected from
   an atmospheric dispersion pattern. Table II. Statistical Comparison of

   RELEASE Is the Pu in the park the result of atmospheric fallout? The
   question has been raised as to the chance that the Pu in Big Trees Park
   is the result of atmospheric nuclear testing. All nuclear 9 PUBLIC
   COMMENT weapons detonated in the atmosphere release various amounts of
   Pu radioisotopes at different isotopic ratios. Over time, these ratios
   vary as the material decays. An analysis of the Pu and Am found in the
   park can be compared to these measured fallout levels. The ratios of
   the values in RELEASE the park and those found in fallout is given in
   Table III. Based on this analysis, the Pu in the park does not appear
   to be the result of atmospheric fallout as the ratios are 4 to 15 times
   higher than values normally associated with fallout deposition. Table

   13302-MS, UC-000 and UC-702 [13]. PUBLIC COMMENT Conclusion: Based on
   the analyses of the grid samples and comparing them to areas where air
   deposition is known to have occurred, ATSDR does not believe that the
   presence of plutonium in Big Trees Park is the result of air
   deposition. Arroyo Seco Pathway RELEASE Samples collected to test the
   hypothesis that Pu was released to the former Arroyo Seco channel are
   coded beginning with B-FAS. The hypothetical pathways for Pu entering
   the arroyo would include bulk flow (overland flow) from the southeast
   corner of the laboratory or via a possible sewer line rupture. If Pu
   was released to the arroyo, samples collected in the former arroyo
   channel or the current channel would indicate this as the pathway
   whereby Pu reached the park. The results of the samples from the
   previous arroyo channel were below the MDA, the highest
   computer-estimated value was 0.00345 pCi/g (1.3 x 10 -4 Bq/g) for Pu
   238 and 0.00229 pCi/g (8 x 10 -5 Bq/g) for Pu 239/240. No Am 241 was
   detected. For the samples collected in the current Arroyo Seco (coded
   SSS-AS) duplicate samples were collected at each location. The highest
   Pu 238 computer estimated value detected was less than the MDA; that
   value was 0.00269 pCi/g (1 x 10 -4 Bq/g). For Pu 239/240, of the two
   samples collected at a depth of 25 centimeters below the surface
   downstream from the concrete channel, PUBLIC COMMENT one sample was
   identified at a concentration of 0.0432 pCi/g (1.6 x 10 -3 Bq/g) and
   the duplicate was below the MDA. Pu 239/240 was only detected in one
   other sample at this depth, that sample location also was downstream of
   the concrete channel. The duplicate for that sample was RELEASE below
   the MDA as well. Samples obtained from the arroyo immediately
   downstream from the LLNL outfall near East Avenue and Building 111 on
   LLNL property, and upstream of the outfall showed no Pu activity; that
   is, all were below the MDA. Furthermore, all samples collected a depth
   of 5 centimeters were below the reporting level or less than the MDA.
   10 PUBLIC COMMENT Conclusion: Based on the results, the current Arroyo
   Seco channel does not appear to be the source of Pu in Big Trees Park.
   Although 2 samples suggest the presence of Pu, the duplicate samples do
   not validate these apparently elevated levels. This suggests either a
   RELEASE random deposition of Pu from areas currently in the park, a
   random error associated with Pu deposition, or a possible error in the
   laboratory analysis. Nonetheless, because no other samples collected in
   the arroyo at either 5 cm or 25 cm contained Pu above the detection
   level, there is no indication that Pu ever entered the Arroyo Seco from
   the LLNL outfall in the southwest corner of the site, from overland
   transport from the southeast corner of the facility to surface
   collection areas that enter the outfall areas near Building 111, nor
   from any reported sewer line break. Sewage Sludge Pathway The
   investigation of this pathway was through analysis of samples collected
   around the ornamental trees. These samples, coded TR, were collected
   around 10 trees and at depth intervals of 0 to 45 cm, 45 to 90 cm, and
   90 to 135 cm. The soil samples were taken inside the tree well and
   outside the tree well. The tree well is the hole dug prior to planting.
   If soil amendments containing sewage sludge were added during the
   planting, the radionuclide concentrations inside the well compared with
   the soils from similar depth intervals outside the wells could be used
   for these analyses. For samples to be valid for analysis, 2 criteria
   had to be met. Firstly, the detected concentration had to be greater
   than the MDA; secondly, the detected concentration had to be greater
   than the 2F error of the measurement. Tree well samples and PUBLIC
   COMMENT samples from outside the tree well that do not meet these
   criteria can be considered indistinguishable. RELEASE Upon analysis, 8
   ornamental trees fit the criteria for one or more of the radionuclides
   under consideration. It is interesting to note that only the top 0 to
   45 cm sample from each of the trees suggested the presence of elevated
   concentrations of radionuclides. The ratios associated with these trees
   are shown in Table IV. For those Pu 239/240 samples within the tree
   wells, the 2F error average was less than 25% indicating the detected
   concentration was significantly higher than the MDA. Conversely,
   outside the tree well, the 2F error averaged 67% suggestive that these
   samples are more closely associated with nominal background
   concentrations. Conclusions: From this analysis, the following
   information can be deduced: 1) The ratio of radionuclides at depths
   greater than 45 cm within the tree well as compared to the outside area
   are not significantly different from background; 2) Pu or Am
   radionuclides do not increase with depth; 3) Because the concentrations
   of these radionuclides at depth (greater PUBLIC COMMENT than 45 cm) are
   indistinguishable from background, no widespread distribution of
   radioactive materials has occurred and; 4) Sewage sludge containing Pu
   radionuclides was most likely applied to these ornamental trees as the
   area outside the tree wells is not contaminated. RELEASE 11 PUBLIC

   Other Sampling Locations Eastern Extension of Big Trees Park Soil
   samples collected from the eastern extension of Big RELEASE Trees Park
   (coded BPE) did not contain any Pu 238 above the reporting limit. One
   sample obtained from a depth of 40 cm was above the MDA with a reported
   concentration of 0.0019 pCi/g (7 x 10 -5 Bq/g). Twenty-five soil
   samples were analyzed for Pu 239/240; all values were below the
   reporting level but 8 samples were above the MDA. Of the 8 samples,
   duplicate samples were collected in 7 instances. The duplicates were
   below the MDA. Table V gives the synopsis of the information for these
   8 samples. Disced Area Four samples (coded DISK) collected in this area
   were analyzed for Pu radionuclides. The results of the Pu 238 analysis
   indicate that no Pu 238 was found above the detection limit. The
   analysis of samples for Pu 239/240 showed that all samples were below
   the reporting limit; however, one sample was above the MDA. That sample
   has an associated error of approximately 75% and is questionable with
   respect to its reported value. PUBLIC COMMENT Playground Pu 238 was not
   detected in soil samples from the playing field (coded PLAY) above the
   reporting value of 0.005 pCi/g (2 x 10 -4 Bq/g) with most samples being
   reported at less than the MDA. The few samples in which the value was
   greater than the MDA also were suspect as RELEASE the associated error
   of the measurement was more than 70%. Fifteen soil samples were
   collected for Pu 239/240 analysis with one sample from a depth of 40 cm
   exceeding the reporting limit and one sample from 5 cm essentially at
   the reporting limit. Sample duplicates did not contain Pu 239/240; that
   is, the reported values were below the detection limit. 12 PUBLIC

   RELEASE Pathway Analyses - Metals Considerations Samples for metals
   analysis were collected from the ornamental trees area and the grid
   area. With respect to samples collected from the ornamental tree area,
   sample collection was from inside and outside the tree well. All metals
   were detected above the MDA. ATSDR believes that if sludge had been
   used as a soil amendment, the amendment would be used either as a
   mulch-type material applied to the surface around the tree trunk or
   uniformly mixed in with soil in which the tree was planted  the tree
   well. Therefore, the ratio of individual metals at each depth compared
   with the same metal concentrations outside the tree well area at the
   same depths should answer this question. PUBLIC COMMENT Sampling was
   around 10 trees and at depths of 0 to 45 cm, 45 to 90 cm, and 90 to 135
   cm. To evaluate the results, a ratio was calculated by dividing the
   concentration of the individual metals in the tree well at a specific
   depth by the concentration of the same metals at the same depth outside
   the tree well. If the concentration inside the tree well is higher than
   the concentration outside the RELEASE tree well, the ratio is greater
   than 1.0; the higher the ratio, the higher the concentration inside the
   tree well. If the ratio is greater than 2.0, ATSDR considered the
   concentration inside the tree well to be significantly different that
   the concentration outside the tree well. Many trees did not show
   significant differences in metals concentrations at any depth between
   the tree well and 13 PUBLIC COMMENT outside the tree well. Results from
   Tree 3, the tree with the greatest differences, are given in Table VI.
   Only the concentrations of the metals in the top 45 cm of soil in the
   tree well were elevated; the samples at the deeper depths are not
   elevated. This is reflected in the ratio of metals RELEASE
   concentrations as shown in Table V as well. These data suggest that
   sewage sludge was added to the surface soils, at least around this
   tree, as the concentrations in the top 45 cm is about 8.5 to 10 times
   that at found outside the tree wells. Table VI. Ratio of metals
   concentration associated with Ornamental Tree 31 Depth (cm) Chromium

   1.44 1.38 1.47 90-135 0.94 0.95 0.92 0.96 1.01 1. The ratio is the
   concentration inside the tree well as compared to outside the tree
   well. Metals analysis of samples collected from the grid area suggests
   that the concentrations of metals in this area are similar to the
   metals concentration in those samples collected outside the tree PUBLIC
   COMMENT wells. Soil samples from the grid that were collected from
   depths ranging from 5 to 40 cm exhibited the same concentrations as
   soil samples collected at a minimum depth of 0 to 45 cm from outside
   the tree wells. Conversely, the metals concentrations in grid samples
   were lower than the metals concentration of the soil sample collected
   from within the tree wells. This also RELEASE suggests that sewage
   sludge was added as a soil amendment to the trees. Health impacts of
   heavy metals in Big Trees Park ATSDR has established environmental
   media evaluation guides (EMEG) for many common heavy metals found in
   the environment. EMEGs represent the concentration in an environmental
   media below which no adverse health effects are expected to occur. For
   the heavy metals reported in Big Trees Park, only the only EMEG
   established is for zinc with an EMEG of 600 milligrams per kilogram
   (parts per million, ppm). The highest concentration of zinc reported
   was about 74 ppm. Another evaluation guide used by ATSDR, the reference
   media evaluation guide or RMEG is listed for nickel. The RMEG for
   nickel is 40 ppm for chronic ingestion by a pica child. Although 40
   soil samples from Big Trees Park exceeded this RMEG, only 2 samples
   collected from the grid were at the surface (5 cm depth). However,
   throughout the entire park, the average nickel PUBLIC COMMENT
   concentration was less than this RMEG. Conclusion: ATSDR does not
   believe any adverse health effects from nickel would occur RELEASE
   based on site wide concentrations and depth of contamination. 14 PUBLIC
   COMMENT Is there a need for additional sampling in the Livermore
   Valley? As previously discussed [1], sewage sludge containing Pu
   released from LLNL was distributed on demand to the community. The log
   book indicating who received this sludge has not been available [1].
   Nonetheless, LLNL RELEASE in May 1973 sampled the yards of three
   laboratory individuals who received the sludge, knew where the sludge
   had been placed, and knew what types of soil disturbing activities had
   taken place since the addition of the sludge to those yards. Table VII
   shows the results of the 1973 sampling. Table VII. Results of 1973

   PUBLIC COMMENT 1. Concentrations expressed as pCi/g. 2. The error is
   expressed as a percentage. For example 10 ± 1 is expressed as 10 ±10%
   RELEASE At Location 2 where the highest concentration of Pu 239/240 was
   detected, the concentration is below the EPA Preliminary Remediation
   Goal of 2.5 pCi/g and below the NCRP recommendation for additional
   action of 51 pCi/g [10]. Therefore, these yards would not be considered
   a candidate for any additional activities and no additional sampling
   would be warranted. ATSDR bases this conclusion on the following. The
   contamination in excess of nominal background concentrations occurred
   in the top 1 centimeter (top 3/8 inches). In the 25 or more years since
   the sludge had been distributed, any one or more of the following
   events could have occurred: 1) exterior home remodeling; 2) extensive
   landscaping; 3) normal weathering such as erosion of soils and general
   yard maintenance activities; 4) new owners who would not know if sludge
   had been used and; 5) city expansion into outlying areas or purchase of
   pre-existing private PUBLIC COMMENT land. Because of these possible
   activities, any sampling locations would be very difficult to identify
   and, if Big Trees Park and the employees' yards are a model, then the
   Pu possibly detected would be below federal action levels. RELEASE 15
   PUBLIC COMMENT CONCLUSIONS An extensive sampling plan and sampling
   activities were implemented to evaluate potential RELEASE pathways
   whereby Pu reached the Big Trees Park in Livermore, California. The
   pathways evaluated included air dispersion, dredging of the Arroyo
   Seco, sewage sludge distribution, and atmospheric fallout deposition
   from LLNL activities. Based on this analysis, ATSDR believes the most
   credible pathway whereby Pu radioisotopes were introduced into Big
   Trees Park was the application of sewage sludge as a soil amendment.
   This is based on a comparison of the concentrations of both Pu and
   heavy metals collected from within tree wells to the concentrations
   present outside the tree wells. Although Pu is elevated in the park,
   these levels are below levels of both health concern per EPA Region IX
   Preliminary Remediation Goals and below the recommended levels
   requiring additional activities as discussed by the NCRP. No other
   pathway appears to be a viable pathway for its presence.
   RECOMMENDATIONS No further actions are recommended. PUBLIC COMMENT Paul
