   Sandia Primary Responsibilities


    Our pimary mission Protecting critical infrastructures. Helping make
        the world a safer place. Responding to new external threats.
   Nuclear Weapons Energy and Critical Infrastructure Nonproliferation and
                     Materials Control Emerging Threats

   Sandias nuclear weapons mission is rooted in an exceptional science
   and engineering base. This foundation is broad as it is deep  the
   result of the cumulative knowledge and ideas of highly talented,
   multidisciplinary researchers working to solve complex national
   security problems. This breadth and depth of technical know-how makes
   Sandia uniquely qualified to work on some of the nations most pressing
   challenges. These challenges are increasingly outside the realm of our
   traditional notion of national defense. They may include searching for
   ways to thwart terrorist attacks using chemical or biological agents or
   developing ways to protect critical infrastructures that provide
   energy, transportation, and communication.
   Its a rapidly changing world, and Sandia is working toward making it a
   safer, more secure one. The common thread linking all of our work is
   our dedication to science with the mission in mind.
