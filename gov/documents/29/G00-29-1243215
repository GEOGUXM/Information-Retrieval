   Full-Time Higher Education under TANF:  Other States' Practices and
   Policy Options for Washington  (#01-06-3301)
   In the spring of 2001, the Washington State Legislature directed the
   Washington State Institute for Public Policy to recommend how
   Washington could consider adding a targeted, stand-alone higher
   education component to the WorkFirst program in a way that is
   cost-neutral and consistent with the WorkFirst philosophy. This report
   examines other states practices, federal TANF regulations, and research
   regarding welfare and higher education. [ Jim Mayfield - November 2001]

   An Assessment of WorkFirst Post-Employment Services  (#01-06-3301)
   This study examines the impact of Post-employment services provided by
   the Washington State WorkFirst program. Post-employment services are
   intended to help employed WorkFirst clients stay employed and find
   better paying jobs. The analysis shows that clients who receive
   Post-employment services have higher rates of employment, earn more,
   and work more hours than similar clients who did not receive those
   services. The study also evaluates the impact of more intensive
   Post-employment services provided in the Spokane area and examines the
   costs associated with supporting employed clients. [Steve Lerch and Jim
   Mayfield- June 2001]

   WELFARE CASELOAD TRENDS IN WASHINGTON STATE, 1997-2000: Analysis of
   Long-Term Welfare Use and the Approaching Time Limits  (#01-01-3301)
   This report looks at the three-year history of the state's welfare
   reform program, WorkFirst, and assesses some of the key issues facing
   welfare reform in the coming years.  One of the foremost issues is the
   5-year time limit on welfare benefits, which will take effect in
   Washington State beginning August 2002.  Approximately 7,600
   individuals on WorkFirst may reach the 5-year time limit between 2002
   and 2003.  This study describes these high risk cases, outlines the
   factors that increase the likelihood of remaining on welfare, and
   follows program participation of long-term recipients.  [Mason Burley
   with Steve Lerch and Jim Mayfield - January 2001]

   EVALUATING WORKFIRST: Analyses of Cost-Effectiveness, Barriers to
   Employment, and Job Search Services  (#00-06-3301)
   This study examines three questions about the Washington State
   WorkFirst program: Is TANF cost-effective, are WorkFirst clients
   becoming harder to employ, and does participating in WorkFirst Job
   Search improve employment outcomes? The analyses support the following
   conclusions: 1) When compared with AFDC, the government spends more per
   TANF household. Under TANF, however, fewer clients use welfare, and
   overall welfare costs are less.  2) According to four specific factors
   that impact employment, clients on the caseload in February 2000 were
   no harder to employ than clients on the caseload when WorkFirst began
   in August 1997.  3) For those with no recent work experience, job
   search increases employment rates. Results for clients with a recent
   work history are mixed. WorkFirst replaced AFDC as the states welfare
   program in 1997.  [Steve Lerch and Jim Mayfield with Mason Burley -
   June 2000]

   Welfare and Employment Outcomes of the WorkFirst Program (#99-12-3301)
   This report analyzes the welfare and employment outcomes of clients in
   the WorkFirst program, Washington States implementation of the federal
   Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.  WorkFirst
   clients are more likely to gain employment, have higher earnings, work
   more hours, and leave the caseload when compared to similar clients
   under Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Jobs, Opportunities, and
   Basic Skills (AFDC-JOBS).  [Steve Lerch and Jim Mayfield - December
   1999]

   WorkFirst Job Search Services:  Preliminary Analysis (#99-06-3301)
   An analysis of outcomes associated with Job Search services provided by
   the Washington State WorkFirst program. After statistically controlling
   for client characteristics, local economic conditions, and other
   factors, this analysis shows that females participating in WorkFirst
   Job Search have higher employment rates, higher earnings, and lower
   welfare use than females with no recorded WorkFirst activity. The
   report is part of a legislatively mandated evaluation of WorkFirst
   prepared by the Institute under contract with the Joint Legislative
   Audit and Review Committee.  [Steve Lerch, Jim Mayfield, with Mason
   Burley -June 1999]

                                 Child Care

   The Family Resource Wage Progression Model: Estimating Resources
   Available to Low-Income Families in Washington State (#98-02-3302)
   The Family Resource Wage Progression Model was developed for the Child
   Care Copayment Affordability Study. The model calculates tax payments,
   food stamp benefits, TANF grants, and child care copayments (accounting
   for different family sizes and regional variations).  This paper uses
   the model to illustrate how two different child care copayment
   schedules (Washington and Oregon) affect the resources of  low-income
   families in Washington State.  [Mason Burley - February 1998]

   Child Care Copayment Affordability Study:  Are Washington State's Child
   Care Copayments Reasonable and Affordable? (#97-12-3301)
   The Washington State Institute for Public Policy was directed in EHB
   3901 to conduct a study of reasonable, affordable child care copayments
   that are realistic for low-income families.  This report discusses the
   affordability of Washington's new child care copayments and reviews the
   child care copayment schedules of other states.  A micro-simulation
   model of family resources is used to evaluate Washington's copayment
   schedule with respect to affordability guidelines developed for the
   study.  [Jim Mayfield and Mason Burley - January 1998]

                               Working Papers

   These papers document some of the research relating to the Legislative
   Evaluation of WorkFirst.  Those marked "Draft" have not been reviewed
   and do not represent evaluation findings.  Comments about these drafts
   or other papers are welcome and should be directed to Jim Mayfield

   Evaluating the WorkFirst Program's Data Elements (DRAFT)
   This paper describes the data elements available for research on
   WorkFirst outcomes.  A table listing the number of persons engaged in
   WorkFirst activities between August 1997 and November 1999 is also
   provided.  [November 1999]

   WorkFirst Client Activity and Service Flow (DRAFT)
   This paper describes general WorkFirst program elements, illustrates
   the complex links between program elements using a client activity flow
   chart, and then summarizes general trends in client activity during the
   implementation phase of WorkFirst (August 1997 through December 1998).
