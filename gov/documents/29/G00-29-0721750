   DCIS Home Our Mission
     __________________________________________________________________

   The DCIS mission is to provide the data collection and reporting
   capabilities needed to enable HHS to comply with the reporting
   requirements mandated by Public Law 93-400 for the reporting of
   procurement actions. DCIS provides a single system capability within
   HHS that collects, edits and stores information on individual
   procurement and contracting actions executed by the Operating Divisions
   (OPDIVs) and other offices of HHS. It creates a HHS-wide database of
   the collected information; forwards selected information about HHS
   procurement and contracting actions reportable under Public Law 93-400
   to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) operated by the Federal
   Procurement Data Center (FPDC) of the General Services Administration
   (GSA); and reports on selected contract actions and data to specified
   organizations within HHS.
