   Schools Post Gains On Academic Performance Index -- Eastin Announces Monetary
                                Awards Eligibility

                       SACRAMENTO "I am pleased to announce that two-thirds
      of California public schools showed increases in their students
      Academic Performance Index (API) last year," said State Superintendent
      of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, as she released the 1999-2000 API
      growth reports for the states public schools.

                       "What is especially good news," Eastin continued, "is
      thatfor the first timewe are able to financially reward schools for
      their efforts. We can finally give them more than a pat on the back for
      all their hard work."

                       The API is the cornerstone of the 1999 Public Schools
      Accountability Act (PSAA), which established a statewide accountability
      system for California public schools. (See Attachment A.) The API is a
      numeric index that ranges from a low of 200 to a high of 1000. The 1999
      API established the baseline for each schools academic performance and
      an annual growth target. Each schools target is set at five percent of
      the difference between the schools API and the statewide performance
      target of 800.

                       To meet their API growth targets, schools must not
      only meet their five percent schoolwide targets but also demonstrate
      comparable improvement for ethnic and socio-economically disadvantaged
      subgroups within the school with large enough numbers to be
      significant.


      Eastin noted, "Our goal is to ensure that all students demonstrate
      academic achievement. Requiring all numerically significant subgroups
      to meet academic growth targets makes a strong statement that we want
      every student to succeed. No one should be left behind. This
      accountability program allows us to track the progress of schools in
   meeting that goal."


   In addition to establishing the API and annual growth targets for each
   school, the PSAA calls for cash awards for schools and staff based on
   API growth, as well as assistance for schools not meeting their
   targets.

                    Results of the Stanford 9 test, given in spring 1999
   and spring 2000 as part of the states Standardized Testing and
   Reporting (STAR) program, were used to calculate a schools 1999 API and
   2000 API growth results. The same information is included for ethnic
   and socio-economically disadvantaged student subgroups.

                    Three awards will be given to schools and/or school
   employees, based on API growth between 1999 and 2000: (1) the Governors
   Performance Award (GPA), (2) the School Site Employee Performance Bonus
   (Senate Bill 1667), and (3) the Certificated Staff Performance
   Incentive Award (Assembly Bill 1114). The GPA and Certificated Staff
   Incentive awards are ongoing programs, based on annual API growth
   results; the School Site Employee Bonus is a one-time award.

                    Seventy-one percent of California schools with an API
   met their growth targets, while 67 percent are eligible for awards. To
   receive any of these awards, elementary and middle schools must show
   that 95 percent of their eligible students took the Stanford 9 in 2000,
   while high schools must show a participation rate of 90 percent. In
   addition, schools that already had APIs of 800 or above must have at
   least a one point gain to be eligible for awards. (See Attachments B
   and C.)

                    The following amounts have been allocated for the
   three awards: up to $150 per student for schools that are eligible for
   the GPA; $350 million, half to schools and half to all school employees
   (certificated and noncertificated), for the School Site Employee Bonus;
   and $100 million to all certificated staff at a school, including
   teachers, principals, and other administrators, for the Certificated
   Staff Incentive Award.

                    Schools with a 1999 API in the lower half of the
   statewide rankings may be eligible for the Certificated Staff Incentive
   Award. In addition to meeting the test participation criteria, schools
   must show a growth of at least two times their schools targets.


   "Schools showing the biggest gains will receive the most money under
   the Certificated Staff Incentive Award," Eastin explained. One thousand
   certificated staff in schools with the largest growth will receive
   $25,000 each; 3,750 certificated staff in schools showing the next
   largest gains will receive $10,000 each; and 7,500 certificated staff
   in schools demonstrating achievement will receive $5,000, until the
   $100 million allocated for this program is gone.


   GPA and School Site Employee Bonus award money will be distributed
   after January 1, 2001. Schools eligible for the Certificated Staff
   Incentive Award can apply in December 2000, and funds will be awarded
   early next year.

                    In addition to the awards program, the PSAA
   established the Immediate Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program
   (II/USP)a phased intervention program for schools that are not meeting
   their targets. This years funding will be used to support 430 schools
   that did not meet their 19992000 growth targets and volunteered for the
   program. (An initial 430 schools received funding last year.) Each
   II/USP school receives a $50,000 planning grant and up to $200 per
   student for two years. The II/USP schools that continue to fall below
   their targets or do not show significant growth may be subject to local
   interventions or eventually statewide sanctions.

                    Not every school will have an API report at this time.
   (See Attachment D.) For example, 470 schools miscoded student
   demographic data for the spring 2000 STAR test, and this information
   must be corrected by the testing contractor before their API reports
   can be completed.

                    Reports for these schools will not be posted until
   December 7, when the complete reports for API growth are scheduled for
   release. The December posting for all API schools will also include
   similar schools growth ranks, which indicate how well each school did
   compared to the 100 schools most similar to it in terms of student
   population.

                    Eastin further noted that a few schools will not
   receive an API due to possible irregularities that occurred during 2000
   STAR testing. The CDE is currently working with districts to determine
   whether test scores of students in specific classrooms were
   inappropriately influenced by teachers or other staff.


   "We understand that the need to have students do well on the STAR tests
   has increased the anxiety level among staffs and their students, but
   the integrity of the test is important to the entire community. The
   rules apply to everyone, and the adults in our schools must be role
   models for our students," Eastin said. "I will seek legislation to give
   the California Department of Education authority and funding to pursue
   instances of unethical adult behavior."


   In conclusion, Eastin said, "We will include other data in the API when
   we feel confident that the information used is accurate, valid, and
   reliable." In addition to the STAR results, the API could include other
   assessments, such as the High School Exit Examination, and graduation
   and attendance rates. The law requires that test results make up at
   least 60 percent of the API.

                    The 19992000 API growth reports are posted today on
   the California Department of Educations Web site at
   http://api.cde.ca.gov.

                    The Web site includes summary reports for each
   elementary, middle, and high school receiving growth results. The
   reports show the percentage of students taking the 2000 STAR, the 2000
   API (growth), the 1999 API (base), the 1999-2000 growth target, the
   19992000 growth, whether the school met its target, and eligibility for
   the GPA and School Site Employee Bonus. (See Attachment E.)
