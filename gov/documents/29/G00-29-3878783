   Financial Reports

   Highlights From the 2001 Annual Report
   In fiscal year 2001, TVAs power system extended its record of
   efficient operation, selling 161.4 billion kilowatt-hours of
   electricity for total revenues of nearly $7 billion. TVA reduced its
   debt by $610 million, a decrease that brings total debt reduction to
   $2.3 billion over the past five years and lowers the proportion of
   revenues absorbed by interest payments from 34 cents to 23 cents of
   each revenue dollar. TVA accomplished this even as it invested the
   funds needed to increase generating capacity, add miles of transmission
   lines, install new customer delivery points, and add new clean-air
   equipment to protect the environment. The result of the improvements in
   our transmission system, were proud to report, is 99.999 percent
   reliability in delivering the needed power to our customers for the
   year.
