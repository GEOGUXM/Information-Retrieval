                    Ice drift from SSM/I ice motion data

   [ssmi1992_7_9ant.gif] Ice drift is plotted based on SSM/I ice motion
   data from 1988 to 1995 in Antarctica and in both Weddell and Ross Seas.
   The algorithm was implemented by Peter Woiceshyn at JPL. To view the
   plot, select the location, year and month.
