   Results for NCEP's 2001 Operational Implementation of the GFDL Coupled
                      Hurricane Model Prediction System



   CONTENT OF WEB PAGE:

   The following are the results of testing in anticipation of the
   operational implementation for the 2001 hurricane season of the Coupled
   GFDL Hurricane Model for the Atlantic basin.  The coupled system is a
   prototype for forecasting tropical cyclones.

   Results for the east Pacific basin (EPAC) are also provided.

   PROPOSED GFDL HURRICANE PREDICTION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:

   While Atlantic basin storms will use the coupled hurricane model, EPAC
   storms will continue to make use of the GFDL uncoupled system.  The
   forecasts for both basins will run with the 2001 upgrades to NCEP's AVN
   global model.

   The 2001 GFDL Hurrican Prediction System is described in detail on web
   page:

   TABULAR RESULTS:

   The results for 48 EPAC and 51 Atlantic basin tropical cyclone cases
   are summarized in tabular form.  These data can be seen by clicking on
