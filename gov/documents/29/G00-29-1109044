                       NASA Web Site Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site...

     * . . . to read or download information: We may collect and store
       information for statistical purposes. For example, we may count the
       number of visitors to the different sections of our site to help us
       make them more useful to visitors. Similar information is gathered
       for anonymous ftp, remote account login, or for other comparable
       types of connections.
     * . . . to send us an E-mail: By sending us an electronic mail
       message, you may be sending us personal information (e.g., name,
       address, E-mail address), as in an official Freedom of Information
       Act request. We may store the name and address of the requester in
       order to respond to the request or to otherwise resolve the subject
       matter of your E-mail.
     * . . . to register: Some of our sites ask visitors who request
       specific information to fill out a registration form. For example,
       vendors looking for marketing opportunities by visiting our
       Electronic Grants or NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites may be
       asked to "register" to obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or
       other NASA opportunities. Other information which may be collected
       at these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other
       means, enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal
       of providing better service to our customers.

   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
