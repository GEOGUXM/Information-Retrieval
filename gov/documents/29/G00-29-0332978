                          Annual Sanctuary
                          Ocean Count


   The volunteers of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine
   Sanctuary are members of the community--residents, visitors, students
   and senior citizens. In 1994, the first group of volunteers appeared at
   the broken-down Maui office to offer their kokua (help) in renovating
   the building.

    The Maui sanctuary office, an old ionsphere station, was renovated by
                            sanctuary volunteers.

    The new Maui sanctuary office after more than 3,000 hours of donated
                  time and effort by sanctuary volunteers.

   During the first year alone, sanctuary volunteers logged more than
   3,000 hours of donated time and effort. Since that auspicious
   beginning, they have surpassed all expectations and continue to amaze
   the staff with their dedication, energy and endless aloha. In 1997, we
   proudly saw several of our volunteers receive the prestigious National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Environmental Hero Award for
   outstanding services.

   Sanctuary volunteers work with staff at various events like this one at
   the Waikiki Aquarium. Activities often include games, craft activities
   and information distribution.

   Sanctuary volunteers contribute in a variety of ways including staffing
   outreach events, completing office tasks and hosting school groups and
   visitors at the Maui office's education center. The also give
   presentations on numerous marine-related subjects, including humpback
   whales, native coastal plants, marine life and the historic royal
   fishpond located at the Maui site. Some of our artistic volunteers have
   produced educational tools, such as a 6-foot-long whale puzzle and the
   popular "Whale of Fortune" trivia game. Others have helped with ground
   maintenance and improvements by refurbishing the new education center
   and erecting our flagpole.

  The Strength of the Sanctuary Comes from Its Volunteers

   "Our volunteers bring with them a lifetime of experiences, information
   and energy. They become the staff, our outreach program and the face
   and voice of the Sanctuary Program. Without them, the sanctuary would
   only exist on paper"

     --Allen Tom, sanctuary manager

   "I grew up in the Kihei area and have witnessed changes over time to
   the Hawaiian coastline. I wanted to get involved to do something."

     --Gloria Adlawan, volunteer

   "There is a lot of work to be done and I enjoy being a part of the
   effort to save these magnificent, intelligent creatures"

     --Gordon Moore, volunteer
