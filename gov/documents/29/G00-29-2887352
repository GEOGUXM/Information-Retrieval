    thePURPOSE

   The purpose of theHIVE is to demonstrate the usefulness of low cost
   high performance computers on NASA's earth and space science
   applications and to study the ability of theHIVE to fulfill the need
   for a high performance computing resource integrated seamlessly into
   the working environment of multiple personal workstations.

    theARCHITECTURE

   theHIVE is a Beowulf-class parallel computer, (e.i. a cluster of PCs
   running LINUX, connected by its own private LAN.) theHIVE is a cluster
   of 64 compute nodes, BEEs and 2 types of host or frontend nodes, the
   QUEEN and one or more DRONEs. The QUEEN administers theHIVE and the
   DRONEs allow access to theHIVE by users and data gathering facilities,
   such as remote sensing satelite antenas.
