Supreme Court to Review Final Report on Out-Of-State Lawyers

   Revised Rules Proposed for California Practice

   San FranciscoThe Supreme Courts Advisory Task Force on
   Multijurisdictional Practice has presented to the Supreme Court its
   final report containing recommendations to ease and clarify current
   restrictions on the practice of law in California by attorneys who are
   not members of the California State Bar.

   Chaired by San Francisco attorney Raymond Marshall, the task force was
   appointed in January 2001 and was charged with reviewing current
   restrictions on out-of- state lawyers practicing in California and
   whether changes should be made.  After a series of meetings, the task
   force issued an interim report last August that was widely distributed
   for comment.  The panel considered the extensive comments received
   before competing the final report.

   The Supreme Court today released the report to the public and will
   review the task forces recommendations and take action at an upcoming
   administrative conference.

                               RECOMMENDATIONS

   The report concludes that, at this time, California should not adopt a
   system of comity or reciprocity that would license out-of-state
   attorneys in general to practice law in California without passing the
   California bar exam.  Instead the report recommends that the current
   rules be eased to allow certain categories of out-of-state lawyers to
   practice in California.  The task force suggested two mechanisms to
   permit these out-of-state lawyers to provide legal services in
   California.
     * Registration: This process would be similar to admission to the
       State Bar of California, but would not require an attorney to pass
       the California bar exam.  It would permit an attorney licensed and
       in good standing in another jurisdiction in the U.S. to practice
       law in California on an ongoing basis.

     * Change in the definition of the unauthorized practice of law: This
       would allow out-of-state attorneys to undertake a specified task
       without violating California law.  This approachoften called a safe
       harborwould apply when an attorneys involvement in California is
       too brief or infrequent to warrant the time and expense that would
       be required with registration.

   The report recommends that two classes of out-of-state lawyers be
   permitted to register to practice as follows:
     * In-house counsel providing out-of-court legal services exclusively
       for a single, full-time business entity employer (e.g., a
       corporation or partnership) that does not provide legal services to
       third parties.

     * Public interest lawyers providing legal services to indigent
       clients on an interim basis before taking the California bar exam,
       under the supervision of an experienced member of the State Bar.

   The task force recommends that the definition of the unauthorized
   practice of law be modified to permit two additional categories of
   out-of-state lawyers to undertake certain tasks in California:
     * Transactional and other non-litigating lawyers providing legal
       services in California on a temporary and occasional basis.

     * Litigating lawyers providing legal services in California in
       anticipation of filing a lawsuit in California, or as part of
       litigation pending in another jurisdiction.

   The task force concluded that these changes would provide useful steps
   to accommodate current needs, while continuing to ensure the publics
   interests are protected.

   The California Supreme Court is responsible for regulating and
   disciplining attorneys who practice law in this state.  The full text
