   The Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector (PSRD) experiment is
   flying on Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker (MACH-1) payload

   PSRD (note: this link will lead you to a non-government site)
   experiment was scheduled to fly on the Fast Reaction Experiments
   Enabling Science, Technology, Applications and Research (FREESTAR)
   payload. Due to the rescheduled launch date of FREESTAR payload from
   2001 to 2002, PSRD experiment will fly on MACH-1 payload in November
   2001. PSRD experiment will measure cosmic ray background data in
   support of the development of a critical component to be flown on the
   Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer instrument on the International Space
   Station.

   In place of PSRD, SEM-13 (note: this link will open the page in a new
   browser) is scheduled to fly. SEM (Student Experiment Module) is an
   educational initiative which allows students to fly simple experiments
   and become involved in space flight and research.

   15th SSPP Anniversary

   As the SSPPO enters the new millennium and approaches the 15-year
   anniversary of the first Hitchhiker mission, it is our intention to
   begin an ongoing dialogue with our customers to keep them abreast of
   the state of the Project. The creation of this newsletter is one aspect
   of that dialogue. Other aspects of this dialogue occur during our
   Symposium, which we will continue to hold on a four to five year basis
   depending on the number of missions flown. If you have other
   suggestions as to how best we may communicate with you, please feel
   free to send questions and inquire via our web site to the Project
   staff so that we might address your concerns and issues. The Project
   has a very long tradition of supporting small STS user payloads. In
   addition to these ongoing Hitchhiker, GAS and SEM activities, the
   Project is pursuing the possibility of performing Mission Management
   and Integration Engineering services for other core strategic GSFC
   missions. This shift in what type of missions we support is borne out
   of the necessity to more strategically align the Project with Core GSFC
   activities. Notwithstanding that GSFC is our most frequent customer,
   consisting of nearly 30% of all missions, the prevailing view of GSFC
   management is that while we are a worthwhile endeavor and perform a
   valuable function, we are not a core GSFC function. So as to stay
   aligned with GSFC management, the transformation of which missions the
   Project supports is, I say, necessary for continued growth and
   prosperity of the Project and supportive of our endeavors to obtain an
   official Space Station role.
