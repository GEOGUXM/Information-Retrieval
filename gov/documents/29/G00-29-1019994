The ROSAT Mission
(1990-1999)

   ROSAT, the Röntgen Satellite, was an X-ray observatory developed
   through a cooperative program between Germany, the United States, and
   the United Kingdom. The satellite was proposed by the
   Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik (MPE) and designed,
   built and operated in Germany. It was launched by the United States on
   June 1, 1990. The mission ended after almost nine years, on February
   12, 1999.

   The U.S. ROSAT Guest Observer Facility (GOF) is located at NASA's
   Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The GOF is part of
   the Office of Guest Investigator Programs (OGIP) in the Laboratory for
   High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA).

   In conjunction with the ROSAT GOF is the SAO ROSAT Science Data Center
   in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
