     * Human Genome Project. The JGI has completed the draft sequence of
       human chromosomes 5, 16, and 19, which total nearly 10% of the
       human genome. Related mapping projects include the identification
       and mapping of mouse clones syntenic to human chromosome 19.
     * Microbial Genomics. October 2000 is "Microbial Month," during which
       fifteen microbes important in bioremediation, human and plant
       pathogenesis, and carbon sequestration are being sequenced.
     * Fugu Genome Project. The JGI is currently sequencing Fugu rubripes,
       the pufferfish.
       fish.
     * Ciona Genome Project. The JGI is currently sequencing Ciona, the
       sea squirt.
     * White Rot Genome Project. The JGI is currently sequencing white rot
       fungus.
     * Genomic Diversity. Current projects include mouse, sea urchin,
       fish, and other sequencing projects aimed at understanding gene
       repertoire differences between organisms, and at deciphering gene
       regulatory control elements and networks.
     * Instrumentation. The JGI relies heavily on automation and complex
       instrumentation to achieve high throughput sequencing.
     * Computational Genomics. The informatics group supports JGI
       sequencing and functional genomics activities, and develops and
       implements algorithms for annotation, assembly, and comparisons of
       genomes.
     * Research and Development. The next generation of technologies are
       under development in the R&D group.
