   In terms of assigned personnel, the Minneapolis Division is considered
     a medium-sized office relative to the FBI's other 55 field offices
    throughout the country, but it is one of the largest field offices in
   terms of territory, as it covers three states: Minnesota, North Dakota,
    and South Dakota. Although a great number of Special Agents and other
    FBI personnel serve out of the Minneapolis Office proper, many others
    work out of the 14 Resident Agencies scattered throughout this area.
