   The New England Coastal Basins study unit is one of 59 National Water
   Quality Assessment Program studies across the United States. The
   National Water Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA) is designed to
   describe the status and trends in the quality of a large,
   representative part of the nation's surface and groundwater resources,
   and to provide a sound, scientific understanding of the primary factors
   affecting the quality of these resources. NAWQA will provide a basis on
   which regional and national level policy decisions can be based, in
   order to protect, use, and enhance water resources.

   The New England Coastal Basins (NECB) study unit includes many
   important New England rivers, and represents a mixture of urban and
   industrial areas, rapidly urbanizing areas, and large forested areas.
   Major rivers and their watersheds include the Kennebec, the
   Androscoggin, the Saco, the Merrimack, the Charles, and the Blackstone
   Rivers. Study activities in the New England Coastal Basins began in
   1996 with planning work. The monitoring phase began in the fall of 1998
   and continues through 2001. For more information about the NECB,
   contact Keith Robinson, study chief, at: kwrobins@usgs.gov.
