                                 NOTEWORTHY
     __________________________________________________________________

     * Having failed to receive unanimous consent to proceed to the
       Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act (H.R. 1140,
       H.Rept. 107-82), Majority Leader Daschle on Tuesday (November 26)
       filed cloture on his motion to proceed to H.R. 10, the
       Comprehensive Retirement Security and Pension Reform Act of 2001.
       Senator Daschle intends to use H.R. 10 as a vehicle to offer the
       text of H.R. 1140 or something similar. A cloture vote on the
       motion to proceed to H.R. 10 will occur on Thursday, November 29.
       This Notice addresses H.R. 1140 as it was passed by the House.
     * Proponents, including the 75 cosponsors of the Senate version (S.
       697), note H.R. 1140 would improve the Railroad Retirement System
       by increasing benefits (through greater surviving spouse's
       benefits, a lower retirement age, accelerated vesting, and repeal
       of the maximum benefit limit), lowering payroll taxes, and
       increasing returns on Railroad Retirement funds by allowing them to
       be invested in private securities.
     * Senators opposed to H.R. 1140 contend the bill (1) would drain
       $15.6 billion from the 2002 surplus, (2) would fraudulently hide
       this money drain by redefining outlays, (3) would allow government
       ownership of private companies, (4) would increase benefits to and
       would decrease taxes on railroad workers in the face of a $40
       billion unfunded railroad pension liability, (5) would lower the
       retirement age for railroad workers from 62 to 60 while the
       retirement age for other workers is rising from 65 to 67, (6)
       ultimately would increase taxes on rail employers, and (7) that
       there have been no Senate hearings on the bill.
     * The House approved H.R. 1140 on July 31, 2001, by a vote of 384-33.
     * The Bush Administration in a May 8, 2001, letter expressed its
       opposition to allowing government investment in the stock market,
       as H.R. 1140 would do (see Administration Position section, p. 6).
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 HIGHLIGHTS
     __________________________________________________________________

     H.R. 1140 would make significant changes to the Railroad Retirement
     system. Borne of an agreement between railroad labor and management,
     the bill would (1) enhance retirement benefits for rail workers and
     their widows, (2) reduce payroll taxes on employers, employee
     representatives, and employees, and (3) allow Railroad Retirement
     funds to be invested in the stock market. The enhanced benefits
     would include:
     * Allowing 100 percent benefits for widows and widowers of eligible
       retirees (compared to 50 percent in current law),
     * Lowering the retirement age from 62 to 60 years,
     * Allowing full vesting in the retirement program after 5 years
       (compared to 10 years in current law), and
     * Eliminating the upper limit on retirement benefits.

     Payroll taxes on employers and employee representatives would be
     reduced in 2002 and again in 2003. Thereafter, payroll taxes on
     these groups and employees would float according to the ratio of
     assets to liabilities (benefits payable). If assets are less than
     four times benefits, payroll tax rates would rise. If assets are
     greater than six times benefits, tax rates would fall. This would
     occur without congressional action.

     Finally, H.R. 1140 would create a National Railroad Retirement
     Investment Trust that would be authorized to invest railroad
     retirement funds in securities, including stocks and bonds.
     Proponents argue the higher rates of return on private securities
     would better enable the Railroad Retirement system to meet its
     obligations to retirees.

     Support for H.R. 1140 is overwhelming in both the House (where it
     passed 384-33) and the Senate, as measured by the 75 senators
     sponsoring its counterpart, S. 697. However, objection was heard to
     the motion to proceed, thus precipitating the cloture vote. [For
     details on opponents' concerns, see the Other Views section of this
     Notice.]
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 BACKGROUND
     __________________________________________________________________

     The following text is taken from House Report 107-82, Part I, (May
     24, 2001, pp. 11-13).

     The railroad retirement system was created separate from the Social
     Security program through a series of laws enacted in the 1930's,
     culminating in the Railroad Retirement and Carriers' Taxing Acts of
     1937. There was ample precedent for legislation taking into account
     the particular circumstances of the rail industry. Numerous laws
     pertaining to rail operations and safety, as well as the Railway
     Labor Act of 1926, had been enacted since the Interstate Commerce
     Act of 1887, and many more have been enacted since the 1930's.

     The need for a separate railroad retirement system arose from the
     inadequate financing of many of the railroads' preexisting private
     pension plans, and a desire to promote employment opportunities for
     younger workers in the nation's largest industry through the
     creation of a system of immediate benefit payments to older workers
     based on accumulated service. Social Security did not begin paying
     benefits until 1940 and did not credit service prior to 1937.

     Substantive changes to the Railroad Retirement and Carriers' Taxing
     Acts of 1937, including its replacement by the current Railroad
     Retirement Act of 1974, and substantive amendments to that latter
     Act have generally been enacted on the basis of joint
     recommendations negotiated by representatives of rail labor and
     management.

     The last major reform of railroad retirement occurred in 1983 with
     enactment of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act. This Act raised
     tier 2 tax rates on both employers and employees, and for the first
     time subjected railroad retirement tier 2 benefits to federal income
     tax. It also raised the age at which one can receive a full annuity
     from 60 with thirty years of service to 62 with thirty years of
     service.

     The railroad retirement system is administered by the Railroad
     Retirement Board, which is an independent agency in the executive
     branch of the United States Government. The Board has three members,
     each of whom is appointed by the President and confirmed by the
     Senate. The Railroad Retirement Act requires that one Board Member
     be appointed upon the recommendation of railroad labor and another
     Member appointed on the recommendation of rail management. The Chair
     is appointed to represent the public at large.

     The primary annuities paid under the Railroad Retirement Act consist
     of two different components called tiers. The tier 1 benefit is
     based upon both the railroad and non-railroad earnings of the
     railroad employee, using social security formulas, and approximates
     (with some minor exceptions) what would be payable under the Social
     Security Act. Tier 2 benefits are based on an employee's railroad
     service only and are computed under benefit formulas in the Railroad
     Retirement Act. Tier 2 is the functional equivalent of a private
     industry-wide pension plan.

     In fiscal year 2000, the Railroad Retirement Board paid $8.3 billion
     in retirement and survivor benefits to 724,000 beneficiaries. At the
     end of fiscal year 2000, there were 308,597 railroad retirees,
     161,283 spouses or divorced spouses of retirees, and 211,291
     survivors receiving railroad retirement benefits.

     Payroll taxes on railroad employers and employees serve as the
     primary source of funding for railroad retirement benefits. Other
     sources include fund transfers under the financial interchange with
     the Social Security system for tier 1 benefits; investment earnings
     from the trust funds; general revenue appropriations for vested dual
     benefits; income taxes on benefits; and a work hour tax paid by
     railroad employers called the supplemental annuity tax.

     The changes made in H.R. 1140 apply only to the tier 2 component of
     railroad retirement and are funded entirely by payroll taxes on
     railroad employers and employees and earnings from the investment of
     those taxes. Currently, railroads pay a 16.1 percent payroll tax and
     employees pay a 4.9 percent payroll tax for tier 2 benefits. H.R.
     1140 would not create any general fund subsidies to the railroad
     retirement system.

               Legislative History and Committee Consideration

     On September 17, 1998, the Subcommittee on Railroads held a hearing
     on H. Con. Res. 52, modifying the Railroad Retirement tier 2
     Benefits for Widows and Widowers, which had been introduced by
     Congressman Jack Quinn (R-NY). H. Con. Res. 52 was a concurrent
     resolution urging that the railroad industry, including rail labor,
     management and retiree organizations, open discussions for
     adequately funding an amendment to the Railroad Retirement Act of
     1974 to modify the guaranteed minimum benefit for widows and
     widowers. Following the hearing, rail labor and management initiated
     discussions on a comprehensive reform of railroad retirement.

     H.R. 4844, introduced in the 106th Congress, was cosponsored by the
     bipartisan leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure
     Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, and represented the
     agreement between management and a majority of rail labor that came
     out of those negotiations. Following Committee consideration, H.R.
     4844 was brought to the House floor, where the bill passed 391-25.
     The legislation was subsequently reported out of the Senate
     Committee on Finance, but not considered on the Senate Floor. The
     Railroad Retirement reform measure was reintroduced in the 107th
     Congress by Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure
     Committee, Don Young, and Ranking Member Jim Oberstar, as H.R. 1140.
     H.R. 1140 was identical to the House-passed version of H.R. 4844. In
     Committee, the Subcommittee on Railroads amended H.R. 1140,
     inserting new effective dates to reflect the passage of time, and
     making other minor technical changes. On May 9, 2001, the
     Subcommittee on Railroads met in open session and favorably reported
     H.R. 1140. On May 16, 2001, the Committee on Transportation and
     Infrastructure met in open session and favorably reported H.R. 1140.

                               BILL PROVISIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

     TITLE I - AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1974

     Sec. 101. Expansion of widows' and widowers' benefits.

     This section would increase widows' and widowers' Tier II benefits
     from 50 percent to 100 percent of the amount for which the deceased
     employee would be eligible.

     Sec. 102. Retirement age restoration.

     This provision would lower the full retirement age for railroad
     workers from 62 to 60.

     Sec. 103. Vesting requirement.

     This section would reduce the length of service required to be fully
     vested (i.e., fully eligible) for benefits from 10 years to five
     years of post-December 1995 employment.

     Sec. 104. Repeal of railroad retirement maximum.

     This provision would eliminate the current maximum limit on total
     monthly benefits a retiree may receive. Currently, this limit is
     based on the average of the two highest-earning years of the last
     ten years of employment.

     Sec. 105. Investment of railroad retirement assets.

     This section would create a National Railroad Retirement Investment
     Trust that would invest federal railroad retirement funds in
     securities, including stocks and bonds.

     Sec. 106. Elimination of supplemental annuity account.

     The bill would eliminate this fund and direct the Treasury to
     transfer its assets to the National Railroad Retirement Investment
     Trust.

     Sec. 107. Transfer authority revisions.

     This section governs how excess administrative funds may be
     invested.

     Sec. 108. Annual ratio projections and certifications by the
     Railroad Retirement Board.

     This section would require the Railroad Retirement Board to
     calculate annually the ratio of assets to benefits for purposes of
     determining annual Tier II tax rates. If assets are less than four
     times benefits, Tier II taxes would automatically increase. If
     assets are greater than six times benefits, the tax rates would
     automatically decrease.

     TITLE II - AMENDMENTS TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986

     Sec. 202. Exemption from tax for National Railroad Retirement
     Investment Trust.

     This section would make the National Railroad Retirement Investment
     Trust a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c).

     Sec. 203. Repeal of supplemental annuity tax.

     The supplemental annuity tax ($0.265/worker/hour) finances a benefit
     for long-time railroad employees. This section would eliminate the
     supplemental annuity tax and finance this benefit out of the
     Railroad Retirement Account.

     Sec. 204. Employer, employee representative, and employee tier 2 tax
     rate adjustments.

     This section would change the current Tier II tax rates for
     employers, employee representatives, and employees. Employers and
     employee representatives would see their rates cut in 2002 and 2003.
     After 2003, all three groups would face tax rates determined by the
     10-year average account benefit ratio formula.

                        Tier II Tax Rate
                        Current           2002           2003      2004 - Beyond
Employers
            16.1 percent 15.6 percent 14.2 percent 8.2-22.1 percent
Employee Representatives
            16.1 percent 14.75 percent 14.2 percent 8.2-22.1 percent
Employees
             4.9 percent  4.9 percent  4.9 percent  0.0-4.9 percent
     __________________________________________________________________

                           ADMINISTRATION POSITION
     __________________________________________________________________

     On May 8, 2001, National Economic Council Director Lawrence B.
     Lindsey and Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell E.
     Daniels wrote congressional leaders to express the Administration's
     concerns with H.R. 1140. They wrote [emphasis added]:

     Last week, the President appointed a Commission to Strengthen Social
     Security, which has been instructed to make recommendations to
     strengthen and modernize Social Security according to six reform
     principles. One of these principles is that, 'Government must not
     invest Social Security funds in the stock market
     .' Under H.R. 1140, the reserves in a Federal retirement trust fund
     would be invested in the private equities market, and the proceeds
     from those investments would be used to pay for federal entitlement
     benefits.

     While we are concerned about this fundamental shift in trust fund
     policy, we are sympathetic to some of the goals of this legislation,
     such as its provision to increase widows' benefits in the railroad
     retirement system.

                                    COST
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored H.R. 1140 as reported
     by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on May 16,
     2001. According to CBO:

     The net effect of H.R. 1140 would be to decrease the budget surplus
     by $15.5 billion from 2002 through 2006 and by $14.6 billion over
     the 2002-2011 period. Because there is little precedent for the
     purchase of private securities by the federal government,
     alternative budgetary treatments are possible that could
     substantially alter the budgetary impact.

     For fiscal year 2002, CBO estimates H.R. 1140 would result in
     increased outlays of $15.5 billion and a revenue loss of $0.1
     billion for a total decrease in the surplus of $15.6 billion.

     The House-passed version of H.R. 1140 would, according to the
     Congressional Research Service, "direc[t] the purchase and sale of
     non-governmental assets (other than gains or losses from such
     transactions) to be treated as a 'means of financing' rather than as
     an outlay for scoring purposes. This change is likely to
     substantially decrease the cost estimate of H.R. 1140." Republican
     Budget Committee staff address this issue in the following section.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 OTHER VIEWS
     __________________________________________________________________

                                Senator Gramm

               (Congressional Record, 11/27/01, S12036-12038)

     I think I can say without any fear of contradiction that of all the
     bills I have ever seen on which cloture has been filed, this comes
     closest to simply being an overt effort by two established and
     powerful special interests to literally pilfer the retirement fund
     that is available for railroad retirees, and the backing for that
     retirement fund. . . .

     In railroad retirement, we have one worker supporting three
     retirees. Every problem we have in Social Security, multiply it by
     9, and you have some index of the problem in railroad retirement.
     Also, you have the implicit taxpayer guarantee behind that program.
     . .

     What gave rise to the bill that is now before us in the form of a
     cloture motion is that railroads, facing some financial difficulty,
     got together with the railway unions and basically said: We have
     built up a base of financial assets - in this case Treasury bonds -
     of $19.2 billion. So what we should do is take $15 billion of that
     money out of the retirement program and roughly give half of it to
     the railroads and give half of it to the retirees. And, in the
     process, commit the taxpayer to deal with the problem if insolvency
     is faced in the future. . . .

     [T]hey came up with a clever ruse. The clever ruse is to say: Look,
     let's take this $15 billion and invest it. Instead of having it in
     Government bonds, we will invest it in stocks and bonds. So as a
     result of this new investment and the new rate of return that we
     will get, we will be able to do some things to help the railroads
     and to help the employees.

     The problem is, before any investment is ever made, they are
     lowering the retirement age. They are cutting taxes on the
     employers. They are expanding benefits for employees, and when you
     add it all up, even with a higher rate of return that they hope to
     gain over the next 25 years, the trust fund will be $28.7 billion
     lower under this new proposal than it would be under current law.
     The $15 billion in question would be completely pilfered over the
     next 17 years. These are not my numbers. These are the numbers of
     the Railroad Retirement Board.

     I remind my colleagues that beginning this year, based on the Social
     Security solvency bill we passed in the early 1980s, the retirement
     age for American workers is starting to go up. We are moving from 65
     to 67, the age that you have to be to draw full Social Security
     benefits. . . .

     At the very instant that we are raising the retirement age for
     everybody else from 65 to 67, remarkably, almost unbelievably, we
     lower the retirement age for people who work for railroads from 62
     to 60.

     Survivors of railway workers already get substantially better
     benefits than survivors from Social Security, but we raise those
     benefits. We change the vesting requirements. The net result is that
     over 17 years, roughly $7.5 billion is taken out of the railroad
     retirement trust fund and is given to the railroads. Roughly $7.5
     billion is taken out of railroad retirement and given to
     beneficiaries by lowering the retirement age, by raising survivor
     benefits, by changing the vesting requirements - in essence,
     increasing benefits. . .

     The victim, as is usually the case when powerful vested interests
     get together, is the taxpayer. The taxpayer stands in line to cover
     shortfalls in the future. . .

     That is the problem before us. If the bill is in fact brought up, if
     cloture is obtained, then I think there have to be some changes. I
     do not per se object to investing the money. I think there have to
     be protections for the railroad worker to be sure the Government
     doesn't direct the investments to benefit some interests other than
     the worker. There needs to be some firewall between the investment
     committee and the Government.

                               Senator Nickles

               (Congressional Record, 11/27/01, S12038-12039)

     Unfortunately, the majority leader is now moving forward with some
     legislation which, I think we have informed him, leaves a lot to be
     desired and which doesn't fit into any national criteria as far as a
     national emergency. . .

     This bill wasn't written by the Finance Committee. . . This bill had
     no input by the Finance Committee. Not one member of the Finance
     Committee has had any input in this bill. This is a bill written by
     and for special interests. . . They benefit themselves by increasing
     benefits, cutting taxes, and keeping Uncle Sam as the guarantor of
     the benefit. . .

     They increase benefits far and above what almost any other pension
     plan in America has. Name another private pension plan that has a
     100-percent survivor benefit. Social Security doesn't do that. . .
     For Social Security, you don't get full retirement benefits at age
     60. . . .

     [Some have asked], isn't this $15 billion that we are transferring
     to them their money? No, not really. They may claim it is in a trust
     fund. I have looked it up. For the life of the railroad retirement
     system, the total amount of money paid out in benefits exceeds all
     the payroll tax contributions by employees and companies by about
     $90 billion. That means Uncle Sam has been putting in and
     subsidizing a lot of money for the railroad retirement system since
     its inception. . .

     [T]hey reduce payroll taxes significantly in the immediate few
     years, and then they expect that by the years 2020 and 2021 the
     payroll taxes will go up about 69 percent. In other words, under
     their own scheme, they say: Oh, we are going to have lots of
     problems. . .

     We have asked for hearings on the bill. This bill has never had a
     hearing in the Senate . . .

                Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan

     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan made the following remarks
     at a January 25, 2001, Senate Budget Committee hearing on the
     federal budget outlook:

     The federal government should eschew private asset accumulation
     because it would be exceptionally difficult to insulate the
     government's investment decisions from political pressures. Thus,
     over time, having the federal government hold significant amounts of
     private assets would risk sub-optimal performance by our capital
     markets, diminished economic efficiency, and lower overall standards
     of living that would be achieved otherwise.

                     (Republican Budget Committee Staff)

     Caution: Dangerous Railroad Crossing Ahead

     Last week [July 31, 2001], the House of Representatives passed (384
     to 33) H.R. 1140 - the Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement
     Act of 2001 which would not only increase railroad retirement
     benefits but would also permit the federal railroad retirement trust
     fund to be invested in private securities. Both CBO and OMB estimate
     that the provision allowing private investment in equities would
     increase outlays by $15.3 billion in FY 2002. The House, hoping to
     avoid the inconvenience of a $15.3 billion outlay in 2002 and a
     corresponding reduction in the surplus, directed OMB to record the
     $15.3 billion as a means of financing and not an outlay.

     Two weeks ago the Bulletin explained in detail why the federal
     purchase of equity investments is properly scored as an outlay. As a
     refresher, the budget of the federal government is a cash budget,
     not a capital budget. It currently treats other investments, from
     infrastructure to R & D, to education and training as an outlay.
     There is no consensus to treat financial investments any
     differently. The House "directed scorekeeping" language would
     require OMB to record the $15.3 billion outlay as a means of
     financing. Regardless, privately investing federal trust fund
     surpluses means that the government will have less cash to pay off
     the public debt, resulting in higher government interest payments to
     the public. In the case of Railroad Retirement, the outlay of $15.3
     billion in federal funds means that debt held by the public will be
     $15.3 billion greater than it otherwise would have been, resulting
     in an additional $10 billion in debt service over the next 10 years.

     The House's deviant budgetary treatment of a government-controlled
     investment in the private markets sets a troubling precedent for
     Social Security Reform. Under current scorekeeping practices, both
     publicly and privately-controlled investments of federal trust fund
     balances in equities are treated consistently - they would increase
     outlays. Almost every policy expert believes that the Social
     Security system needs to receive a greater rate of return on
     accumulated funds than provided by low-yielding government bonds.
     Much of the debate revolves around whether the Social Security funds
     should be invested collectively by the federal government or
     individually through privately-controlled accounts. If
     publicly-controlled investments were recorded as a means of
     financing (and consequently no longer decreased the surplus) these
     railroad retirement-type proposals would have a significant
     advantage over proposals to create individual accounts.

     As a final note, inserting directed scorekeeping language will
     change the budgetary treatment of these transactions only after the
     bill becomes law. Astute budgeteers know that, despite the language
     in the House bill, one can not avoid the Budget Act points of order
     that lie against this bill. CBO, as always, will score the
     legislation as if the directed scorekeeping language were not
     present. Only if the bill is enacted would CBO record the costs as
     directed. Thus the measure would be subject to two 60-vote points of
     order: a section 302(f) point of order because the measure would
     cause the Finance Committee to exceed its allocation and a section
     306 point of order because of the inclusion of the directed
     scorekeeping language. If the bill is enacted as passed the House,
     budget enforcement mechanisms will be prevented from reflecting the
     real cost. So you can be sure that Congress then will be poised to
     spend this $15 billion twice - without having to make the otherwise
     difficult decision of allocating scarce resources. . . .
