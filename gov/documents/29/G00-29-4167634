   Walden Encourages 2nd District Residents to Fill Out On-line Survey

   Congressional survey on www.walden.house.gov offers Oregonians opportunity to
                register opinions on local, national concerns

   WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) today encouraged
   residents of Oregons 2nd District to fill out the opinion survey
   featured on his website, www.walden.house.gov.  The survey asks
   Oregonians their opinions on a variety of local and national issues,
   including the war on terrorism, education reform, efforts to stimulate
   the economy, and the federal governments policies regarding endangered
   species.  The congressional survey is a new addition to Waldens site,
   which also contains a year-end report to taxpayers, updates on the
   Klamath Basin crisis, and other developments in Congress.

   Keeping abreast of the concerns of Oregonians is one of the most
   important aspects of my job, said Walden.  Understanding the positions
   of the people I represent in Congress is critical to my being able to
   serve them effectively.  I hope many people will take advantage of the
   new survey on my website and let me know about the issues that are most
   important to them.

   Waldens website features timely information about proceedings in
   Congress and allows Oregonians to sign up for his weekly e-mail
   newsletter, the Oregon Congressional Connection.  Oregonians can also
   communicate their opinions to Congressman Walden via email at
   greg.walden@mail.house.gov.

   Congressman Walden represents the Second Congressional District of
   Oregon, which includes the 20 counties of southern, central and eastern
   Oregon. Rep. Walden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce
   Committee and The House Committee on Resources
