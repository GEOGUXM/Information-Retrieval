   [healtiptxt.gif] Understanding Food Labels

   Once upon a time, words like "light" and "low-fat" on food packages had
   no real nutritional meaning. As a result, shoppers were often led to
   believe they were buying products that were more healthful than they
   actually were. Nutrition information labels were also confusing and
   hard to read. But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed all
   that.

   See CalPERS Health Pages for more information.
