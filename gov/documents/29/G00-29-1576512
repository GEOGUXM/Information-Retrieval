   the Bankruptcy Bar for the Western District of North Carolina SUBJECT:
   CHANGE IN FILING PROCEDURES FOR NEW PETITIONS AND SCHEDULED
   DEFICIENCIES The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western
   District of North Carolina has been "live" on the nationwide Case
   Management/Electronic Filing System (CM/ECF) since March 2001. For the
   past year, the court has provided extensive CM/ECF training for
   approximately 200 attorneys, trustees and their staffs. Given the
   length of time since system implementation and the extensive training
   program, the court has determined the following: 1. EFFECTIVE JANUARY
   1, 2002: A diskette containing petitions scanned and saved in a pdf
   format must be attached to any petitions and scheduled deficiencies
   filed non-electronically. Instructions on how to save a document in PDF
   format are located on the court's web site (www.ncwb.uscourts.gov)
   under CM/ECF Information. A scanner will be located in the public area
   in the Clerk's Office. 2. EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2002: Unless leave of
   court is allowed to file in paper form, all petitions and scheduled
   deficiencies filed by attorneys are to be filed electronically. If
   leave of court is allowed to file in paper form, the attorney will be
   required to conform to the diskette requirement listed above. The
   Clerk's Office will continue to provide ECF training classes.
   Information about and registration for these classes is located on the
   court's web site under "CM/ECF Attorney Training Registration."
