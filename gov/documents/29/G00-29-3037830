Congressionally Mandated National Health Care Disparities Report

     In 2001, the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and
     Education Act directed the Agency for Healthcare Research and
     Quality (AHRQ) to prepare a National Health Care Disparities Report.
     The Institute of Medicine's "Committee for Guidance in Designing a
     National Health Care Disparities Report" will provide guidance to
     the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on the design of the
     national report on racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in
     health care. It will address issues including how to measure access
     to health care and how to assess the impact of socio-economic status
     and other population factors. It will also look at data sources that
     might be used in the report.
