      Message from the National Service Trust Office
      Former and current AmeriCorps members should be aware that the National
      Service Trust is continuing to experience a delay in receiving mail,
      including requests for payments. This delay is caused by the U.S.
      Postal Service treating Corporation mail for anthrax. (Mail for other
      federal agencies in this area is being treated, too). This delay is
      causing a delay in the processing of education award and interest
      payments.
      We continue to suggest that, for the time being, payment requests
      should not be mailed to the Trust. You can notify your schools and
      lenders that Voucher and Payment Request Forms and Interest Accrual
      Forms can be faxed to the Trust at this fax number: (202-565-2742). The
      Trust also receives United Parcel Service deliveries. We are promptly
      processing all payment requests that we receive.
      We regret any inconvenience that this has caused. For a six-week period
      in October and November, we were receiving no mail. We have put all
      available resources into processing the backlog of payment requests so
      that we can make the payments as quickly as possible.
