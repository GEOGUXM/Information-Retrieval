                                DV-2003 Over

   The registration period for the Diversity Visa Lottery (DV-2003) which
   ran from October 1, 2001 until October 31, 2001 is now over. Winners
   will be selected at random by computer from among all qualified entries
   received during the mail-in period.

   Successful registrants will be contacted by mail between May and June
   2002. Only those selected will be notified by the Kentucky Consular
   Center. If you do not receive written notification by July 2002, then
   you were not selected for the DV-2003 lottery. Neither the Kentucky
   Consular Center, National Visa Center nor U.S. embassies and consulates
   abroad will be able to provide a list of successful registrants.

   The dates for the next diversity visa lottery (DV-2004) have not yet
   been determined. You may wish to check this site again after August
   2002 for updates on the DV-2004 visa lottery.
