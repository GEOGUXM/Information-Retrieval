   Dear Dr. Hyman:

   We, the members of the National Institute of Mental Health's Genetics
   Workgroup, are pleased to forward our report to you and the National
   Advisory Mental Health Council.

   Aided by the Institute's staff, grantees, and advocates, we have
   surveyed the field and the Institute's portfolio to identify
   significant opportunities to speed the search for the genes that
   influence mental disorders. The Workgroup determined that the Institute
   stands ready to capitalize on the rapid advances in molecular and
   statistical genetics. The tools that have been successful in detecting
   the genes that cause classical hereditary illnesses, such as
   Huntington's disease, are available for applications to more complex
   genetic diseases, such as mental disorders. Pairing these emerging
   advances with today's sophisticated diagnostic techniques offers
   unparalleled opportunities for revealing the biological components of
   mental disorders.

   The Workgroup offers 22 recommendations to expedite the discovery
   process by creating and sharing unique resources, fostering new
   collaborations, and training more researchers.

   We thank you and the Council for the opportunity to participate in this
   exciting endeavor.

PREFACE

   Mental illnesses are common, serious brain disorders that affect our
   thinking, motivation, emotion, and social interactions. Because the
   illnesses are particularly difficult to model in animals, most research
   on the causes and treatments of them has occurred in clinical
   populations. Increasingly, these studies make use of evermore
   sophisticated brain imaging technologies and cognitive neuroscience.
   Such studies will advance our knowledge of brain function by yielding
   increasing detail on what goes awry in illness. Building on these
   accomplishments, the search for disease vulnerability genes is likely
   to yield the most important tools yet in our ongoing attempts to
   understand the brain in mental illness.

   Identifying genes that may play a role in any complex disease - a
   formidable task in itself - is only a first step in understanding how a
   gene or genes affect an individual. Genes act by producing specific
   proteins that may contribute to a particular biological or behavioral
   trait. Every human carries between 80,000 and 100,000 genes; the
   products of these genes - acting together and in combination with the
   environment - enable every human characteristic. As the functions of
   genes in brain processes come to be better understood, researchers can
   begin to develop ways to intervene in processes that cause disease.
   Although such interventions can only be imagined today, NIMH already is
   investing in these strategies to lay the groundwork for tomorrow's
   discoveries. At the same time, vulnerability and "disease
   course-modifier" genes will provide extraordinary tools for both
   therapeutics and prevention research. For these reasons, NIMH is
   committed to the search for genes that create vulnerability to mental
   illness, affect the course of illness, and impact treatment.

   The task ahead is daunting. It has become clear that the genetics of
   vulnerability to mental disorders is, in all cases, complex. We still
   do not know how many different genes might contribute to vulnerability
   for any specific mental disorder, nor do we know the nature of the
   nongenetic effects that convert vulnerability into illness. Yet, if
   NIMH is to succeed in its mission, the research we support must
   capitalize on the revolution that is occurring in genomic research and
   must take very seriously the complex genetics of mental disorders.
   Ultimately, understanding the pathophysiology that underlies discrete
   forms of mental disorder will lead to novel, increasingly specific
   treatments and, eventually, to prevention.

   Toward this end, with the strong endorsement of the National Advisory
   Mental Health Council, I convened a Genetics Workgroup and charged them
   to help us to reorganize and prioritize our efforts. The Institute and
   the field owe a debt of gratitude to the Workgroup Chair, Sam Barondes,
   M.D., and to the members of the Workgroup listed in Appendix B. They
   effectively concentrated diverse expertise in a thoughtful and creative
   manner. The report that follows illustrates the energy and alacrity
   with which they addressed the urgent scientific issues before us. I
   also am deeply appreciative of the efforts of the Workgroup Staff
   Director, Jane Steinberg, Ph.D., and of NIMH staff who participated in
   this important effort. I am particularly pleased that the authors have
   acknowledged the interests and needs of readers outside of the
   scientific community and have produced a concise, comprehensible report
   that presents a list of straightforward recommendations and achievable
   goals.

   Despite the enormous scientific difficulties posed by complex genetic
   disorders, we can and must succeed. I believe this document will assist
   us significantly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   Molecular genetic approaches to understanding illness are changing the
   nature of medical research and practice in the United States. As the
   human genome is defined, the opportunity to determine genetic
   influences in mental disorders becomes a reality.

   Although the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has prepared
   well for this undertaking, much remains to be done. Rigorous diagnostic
   procedures are available for some mental disorders, but not all.
   Studies to identify the genes that influence the onset of mental
   disorders have been initiated, but too few are large enough to
   efficiently detect these genes. Dedicated investigators are working on
   various aspects of mental disorders, but more researchers with training
   in molecular and statistical genetics are required.

   To build upon the field's strong beginning, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, NIMH
   Director, convened a workgroup of experts in clinical, basic, and
   statistical genetics to review the current status of this work and to
   provide advice on how to proceed. The NIMH Genetics Workgroup met over
   a 6-month period and reviewed the Institute's portfolio; consulted
   broadly with researchers, advocacy groups, and staff from NIMH and
   across the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and generated an action
   plan for directing NIMH's efforts. The Workgroup's recommendations
   follow.

   o

     Creating and Analyzing Large, Well-documented Samples

        Recommendation 1: NIMH staff should draft a policy for the National
        Advisory Mental Health Council's consideration that provides for the
        sharing of genetic materials (i.e., DNA, diagnostic data, and
        genotypes) collected through NIMH's grants and cooperative agreements
        after a 12- to 18-month proprietary period. Staff members are
        encouraged to include all elements of the National Human Genome
        Research Institute/Department of Energy (NHGRI/DOE) policy on data
        sharing (see Appendix D).

        Recommendation 2: NIMH should continue to provide a contract for
        maintaining cell lines from individuals with mental disorders and
        appropriate relatives, as well as for distributing DNA and all clinical
        data to qualified investi-gators.

        Recommendation 3: NIMH should encourage consent procedures that
        describe and discuss the risks and benefits of DNA banking and clinical
        data sharing in genetic research.

        Recommendation 4: NIMH should issue a request for applications (RFA) to
        conduct secondary analyses of clinical samples. The RFA should provide
        support for recoding diagnostic variables and for reanalysis. If the
        RFA proves successful, a program announcement should be established so
        that this very efficient and low-cost approach can continue.

        Recommendation 5: NIMH should continue its support for core facilities
        such as NHGRI's Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) to augment
        the available genotyping and analytic resources in academic research
        facilities.

        Recommendation 6: RFAs and program announcements should explicitly
        allow international work and provide support for such shared
        undertakings when scientifically appropriate.

        Recommendation 7: RFAs for future large-scale, coordinated efforts
        should call for self-selected teams of researchers.

   o

     Fostering NIMH Collaborations

        Recommendation 8: NIMH extramural staff should invite key clinical
        genetics staff across NIH to form a coordinating committee for complex
        disorders. Of particular interest would be discussions on joint efforts
        in training, software development, hardware, statistical models,
        ethical issues, and international alliances.

   o

     Recruiting and Retaining New Researchers

        Recommendation 9: NIMH should establish multidisciplinary institutional
        training grants at the pre and postdoctoral levels that provide
        education in clinical, statistical, and molecular genetics.

        Recommendation 10: Two programs established by the National Heart,
        Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) should be adapted for use at NIMH.
        First, the NHLBI Programs of Excellence in Molecular Biology should be
        modified for use by NIMH. This NIMH initiative should provide
        investigators with expertise in the genetics of mental disorders.
        Second, short-term training programs for new investigators or
        investigators seeking to redirect their career or broaden their skills
        should be established. Rather than a brief introduction to molecular
        genetics, the courses should offer intensive, hands-on training
        opportunities.

        Recommendation 11: A new investigator's award should be created to
        provide entrance into the field without demanding long-term, high-risk
        projects for junior investigators and for established geneticists
        seeking to redirect their efforts into mental disorders. These grants,
        envisioned as 2-year awards at $50,000 to $100,000 a year, could be
        used, for instance, to analyze data sets in the repository. Other
        short-term projects should be considered as well.

   o

     Sponsoring Initiatives in the Molecular Genetics of Mental Disorders

        Recommendation 12: NIMH should issue RFAs for large-scale molecular
        genetics studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and early-onset
        depression.

        Recommendation 13: NIMH should work with the NIH Autism Coordinating
        Committee to find methods for integrating ongoing studies and their
        samples.

        Recommendation 14: A program announcement should solicit applications
        across all investigator-initiated research mechanisms for clinical,
        family, and epidemiological studies in the other mental disorders to
        develop the diagnostic tools and/or to better evaluate the role of
        genetics and the environment in contributing to the onset of these
        mental disorders.

   o

     Addressing Administrative Issues

     Extramural Research Program

        Recommendation 15: The Workgroup supports the newly formed NIMH
        integrated genetics branch and recommends that it be headed by an
        established genetics researcher who can provide the leadership and
        creativity the NIMH extramural program warrants.

        Recommendation 16: Applications on the genetics of mental disorders
        should be reviewed together with applications pertaining to other
        complex disorders in the new NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR)
        structure. The eventual panels must include sufficient clinical,
        molecular, and statistical expertise.

        Recommendation 17: The terms and conditions section of grant awards for
        genetic collection must specify a data-gathering plan and should be
        effectively monitored to ensure sufficient timely progress.

     Intramural Research Program (IRP)

        Recommendation 18: Appointing a permanent IRP Scientific Director who
        combines a very high level of scientific expertise with the vision to
        understand and appreciate the power of interdisciplinary research in
        mental disorders will advance NIMH's IRP genetics effort. Depending on
        the selection, additional genetics expertise and leadership may still
        be required at the IRP. Recruiting new leadership in genetics is
        critical to unifying and revitalizing the genetics program of the IRP.

        Recommendation 19: Genetics research at the IRP should be consistent
        with the new mission statement.

        Recommendation 20: Productive collab-oration, including data and core
        resource sharing, should be expected and fostered across IRP
        laboratories and with NHGRI and NIMH extramural staff and
        investigators.

        Recommendation 21: Reviews of the IRP laboratories must be expert and
        should promote the best genetics research by shaping the direction of
        and resources to the IRP genetics laboratories.

   o

     Establishing a Genetics Advisory Group

        Recommendation 22: The Workgroup requests that an Advisory Group be
        established to consult on the implementation of this plan and its
        impact on the extramural and intramural programs of NIMH.

INTRODUCTION

   Since its inception, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has
   recognized the importance of genetics in understanding mental
   disorders. From the earliest epidemiological studies to today's
   molecular approaches, the Institute has invested broadly in genetics
   research in hopes of discovering the interplay between genes and the
   environment in the predisposition to mental disorders. The clearest
   finding from this research is that there is no simple relationship
   between genes and mental disorders.

   Single, causative genes, such as those resulting in sickle-cell anemia
   or Huntington's disease, do not explain how mental disorders affect one
   out of five Americans. Instead, researchers now believe that several
   susceptibility genes interact with each other and with environmental
   factors to influence the risk of developing a particular disorder.
   Finding the susceptibility genes amid multiple environmental factors is
   a formidable task, but not unique to mental disorders. Many diseases,
   such as asthma, hypertension, and diabetes, appear to have equally
   complex patterns of transmission. This labyrinth of genetic
   susceptibility and environmental factors poses a great challenge to
   geneticists. These gene hunters have responded to this challenge by
   developing increasingly powerful molecular and statistical tools. What
   seemed hopelessly complicated a few years ago is becoming solvable.

   Recognizing this promise and the intensive work yet to come in
   molecular genetics, biotechnology, biostatistics, and informatics, Dr.
   Steven Hyman, NIMH Director, and the National Advisory Mental Health
   Council (Appendix A) formed a Council workgroup to explore new
   approaches and opportunities in this area. The membership of the NIMH
   Genetics Workgroup, which includes basic, clinical, and statistical
   geneticists, is presented in Appendix B. Dr. Hyman charged the
   Workgroup with considering how to invest NIMH resources selectively to
   speed the identification of the genes that influence mental disorders.
   The Workgroup was asked to provide a map for directing the research and
   infrastructure development that will be uniquely important to mental
   disorders. As part of this strategy, the Workgroup also considered how
   NIMH can best work with and build upon the efforts of other NIH
   institutes, private industry, and other key stakeholders. If all of
   these constituencies work together, the current opportunities for
   science will generate significant clinical advances for those living
   with mental disorders.

   Though the Workgroup believes that the hunt for genes that influence
   susceptibility to mental disorders is critically important, finding
   these genes is just one step toward improved clinical care. Advances in
   treatment will depend on understanding the ways in which these genes
   actually influence behavior and brain function. With this greater
   understanding, a new generation of treatments can be foreseen that will
   counteract the problems resulting from the susceptibility genes. Only
   then can the hopes and needs of individuals living with mental
   disorders and their families, so poignantly expressed in Clea Simon's
   personal story, be addressed (see The Family Illness).
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Family Illness

   I had so many reasons not to think about schizophrenia, about the
   terror it caused me as a child. When I was six, I watched my brilliant
   brother change from an engaging 16-year-old to a zombie who stared into
   space for hours. Two years later, I saw my older sister turn cruel and
   loud, screaming for what seemed like hours. I was too young to know
   anything about schizophrenia, but I knew something was terribly wrong.
   Like many with this disease, neither my brother or sister could find
   satisfactory treatment, resulting in my brother's leaping off a cliff
   to his death and in the regular recurrence of my sister's psychotic
   rages.

   Schizophrenia isn't the multiple personality of movie stereotype, but
   it is a horrible mental illness, causing aural hallucinations and
   provoking paranoid delusions that can make peculiar behavior seem
   normal to the sufferer. It often can be treated, but it isn't yet
   curable. And although public awareness of mental illness has come a
   long way in my lifetime, it's difficult not to feel cursed by the
   shadows it casts.

   For much of my life, I have tried to believe that the madness was
   behind me. After all, my brother committed suicide 15 years ago, while
   I was still in college, and I've been out of touch with my sister for
   close to 20 years. They no longer inhabit my present life, but their
   illnesses haunt me like ghosts.

   At this point in my life, that ghost has taken on a terrifying new
   shape. It haunts me now with the question: Would I have a child with
   schizophrenia? Talking with geneticists did not dispel my fears; in
   fact I soon learned that any children of mine would indeed have an
   increased risk of developing the illness that destroyed my siblings'
   lives. Although my fiancé has no relatives with schizophrenia, our kids
   would be as much as eight times more likely than the average person to
   have schizophrenia. But even for my children, schizophrenia is not a
   huge risk - their chances range from 3 to 8 percent. In the general
   population, schizophrenia occurs in one out of every hundred people.
   Several scientists told me that other considerations - such as the fact
   that both my siblings had schizophrenia - may increase the odds.
   Another factor could be the severity of my sibling's cases: Both became
   wildly, uncontrollably ill.

   These odds are all the scientists can offer me. Unlike some other
   hereditary diseases, the genes for schizophrenia have not yet been
   isolated; there is no test. All we can provide are our family
   histories; all we can get in return are percentages.

   If only the science were further along. Still, we try desperately to
   read our futures in the little information we have. The genetics of
   mental illness will be much better understood in 20 years, scientist
   say, but there isn't much chance of current research having practical
   applications within the next five years - when it would be useful to
   me. In the end, I have to face the fact that no one can tell me whether
   a child of mine would be healthy or ill.

   And so the dilemma remains, particularly for people like me who carry
   the memories of our siblings at the same time that we feel the pressure
   of encroaching age. We cannot wait for research to provide the answers.
   We must make our peace - and our decisions - with the knowledge at
   hand.

MENTAL DISORDERS AND GENETICS: WHAT WE KNOW TODAY

  Mental Illness

   Mental illnesses profoundly affect an individual's ability to think,
   feel, and act. They are also very common, affecting as many as one in
   five Americans over their lifetimes, irrespective of age, gender, or
   race. Four percent of the Nation's population lives with severe mental
   illnesses. The annual cost to the United States for treatment, social
   service and disability payments, lost productivity, and premature
   mortality is more than $150 billion.^1 The diagnosis, treatment, and
   prevention of mental illnesses continue to be crucial to improving the
   quality of life for affected individuals, as well as to reduce health
   care costs.

   Researchers and clinicians have worked for decades to reduce the
   suffering of those with these disabling disorders, and current
   treatments can alleviate symptoms for many. Unfortunately, none of
   these treatments offer sustained relief. Better treatments depend on
   discovering the causes of these disorders.

   Although mental disorders were recognized as illnesses in the mid-18th
   century, suspicion and fear often overshadowed understanding.
   Gradually, trepidation has been replaced by knowledge as the fields of
   psychiatry, behavioral science, neuroscience, biology, and genetics
   have progressed. Through research conducted in each of these domains, a
   shared finding arises: the risk of developing an illness is increased
   if another family member is similarly affected, suggesting a strong
   hereditary component.

   This finding of familial risk has been documented through twin studies,
   which use two types of twin pairs for exploring the role of
   inheritance. Identical or monozygotic twins come from the same
   fertilized egg and share 100 percent of their genes.^2 Fraternal or
   dizygotic twins come from two different fertilized eggs and share only
   50 percent of their genes, just as any biological siblings would. To
   evaluate heritability, the rate of the disorder in monozygotic twins is
   compared with the rate in dizygotic twins. If the rate among
   monozygotic twins is significantly higher, then heredity is an
   important factor. For instance, in bipolar disorder, if one monozygotic
   twin is affected, then the other has a 60 to 80 percent chance of also
   having the disorder. In contrast, a dizygotic twin of an affected
   individual has only an 8 percent chance of having the disorder.
   Similarly, a monozygotic twin of a person with schizophrenia has a 46
   percent chance of being affected, whereas a dizygotic twin has only a
   14 percent chance of being affected.

   Despite strong evidence for genetic susceptibility, no specific gene
   has been unambiguously identified for common forms of mental disorders.
   Many researchers believe that this is due, in part, to the critical
   role that the environment plays in modulating genetic susceptibility in
   mental disorders. Citing the twin studies above, researchers point out
   that monozygotic twins are not always concordant (i.e., do not share
   the disorder). Clearly, if twins with the same genes do not both have
   the disorder, there is strong evidence for the role of environmental
   factors.

   Researchers may differ on their estimates of the amount that genes and
   the environment each contribute to the onset of mental disorders, but
   once a genetic component is reliably implicated, the search for the
   source and the location of the apparent genetic component underlying
   the mental disorder can begin. The estimate of the influence of
   environmental factors on the disorder provides an index of how
   difficult the search will be.

  Models of Genetic Transmission

   When people get sick, they want to know what disease they have and
   whether it can be treated. Their next question is often, "How did I get
   this disease?" Patients understand that knowing something about the
   causes of the illness can help their treatment and possibly prevent the
   spread of the disease. This intuitive link is the essence of medical
   research. The more learned about the natural course of the disease, the
   easier it is to test ideas about how the disease may be spread or
   cured. As ideas about treating the disorder are tested, the
   understanding of the disease becomes more sophisticated.

   Genetic causes of certain diseases have been known for many years. The
   mutation in hemoglobin that leads to sickle-cell anemia was discovered
   more than 40 years ago. Many people are familiar with this kind of
   recessive genetic disorder, in which both parents pass along the
   affected form of the gene, resulting in the child's illness. More
   recently, investigators identified the gene for Huntington's disease, a
   serious disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of physical
   and mental functioning. Huntington's disease is caused by classic
   dominant transmission: people who receive just one affected gene from
   either parent develop the disease. These two types of transmission, in
   which dominant or recessive genes cause a disorder, are called "simple
   Mendelian models" because they are based on the rules of heredity
   codified by Gregor Mendel more than a century ago through his work with
   pea plants.

   Most common medical diseases do not follow the rules of Mendelian
   inheritance. Instead, these complex disorders are influenced by
   multiple susceptibility genes, each of which contributes to the
   disorder. These genes may interact in com-plicated ways to increase or
   decrease susceptibility. The more genes necessary for a disorder, the
   harder it is to detect any one of them. This difficulty is magnified by
   the role of environmental factors.

   Successfully tracking disease-related genes requires a population of
   individuals with the genetic variant and a means of identifying the
   genes in the population. Ideally, the definition of a disease should be
   clear enough so that all of the diagnosed individuals have relatively
   uniform symptoms, improving the chances for unambiguously identifying
   affected individuals for study. In sickle-cell anemia, for instance,
   experts and nonexperts can look through a microscope and see if the
   specific deformation of the blood cell - and therefore the disease - is
   present. For mental disorders, however, no clear biological test has
   been found. Further, investigators have had trouble discriminating
   specific forms of mental disorders, such as distinguishing someone
   exper-iencing depression as part of a depressive disorder from someone
   experiencing depression as part of bipolar disorder (also called
   manic-depressive disorder). Nonetheless, much progress has been made
   over the years, and researchers have developed procedures to permit the
   reliable and valid diagnosis of many mental disorders.

   Understanding genetic influences on mental disorders and other complex
   diseases is further complicated by the fact that a given susceptibility
   gene may or may not result in the disorder. This ambiguity could be due
   to environmental influences or interactions with other genes. As an
   added complication, various combinations of genes may all lead to the
   same disorder.

   Mental disorders will be considerably more difficult to understand than
   sickle-cell anemia and Huntington's disease. Such challenges are
   daunting, but with the tools and the talent available today, they are
   not insurmountable. The search for susceptibility genes in mental
   disorders will be exciting and potentially life-changing for many.

  The Tools of the Trade: Models for Locating Genes

   The human genome is the complete set of genetic instructions for an
   individual, one version from the mother and one from the father. Though
   the DNA from any two people is roughly 99.9 percent identical, the
   variation in this tenth of a percent is the source of human biological
   diversity. Inherited susceptibility to various diseases, which occurs
   when a particular form of the gene fails to give correct instructions
   for a trait or function, is one small part of this diversity.
   Researchers look for this unidentified gene by constructing finer and
   finer maps of known gene locations and functions or by comparing the
   DNA of affected and unaffected individuals.

   The first phase of identifying a disease-related gene is the collection
   of diagnostic information and blood samples from an appropriate set of
   affected individuals and their relatives. Typically, blood samples are
   drawn from family members, and the blood cells are transformed to
   preserve them. These transformed cells, called cell lines, can then be
   used to make DNA in unlimited quantities, allowing many researchers
   access to this resource. The art of this collection phase is in
   identifying appropriate families. Those in which affected individuals
   have very similar symptoms are preferable, since members of such a
   similar group are more likely to carry the same form of the gene than a
   symptomatically diverse family. At this stage, having valid and
   definitive criteria that accurately determine a particular diagnosis
   may make the difference between success and failure. The actual
   research designs selected in molecular genetics studies and the
   selected participants are closely allied, as indicated below:

   o Linkage studies are widely used to detect and locate genes that
     determine susceptibility to mental disorders. These studies are often
     based on the identification of large, densely affected families so that
     the inheritance patterns of known sections of DNA (called "markers")
     can be compared to the family's transmission of the disorder. If a
     known marker can be correlated with the presence or absence of the
     disorder, this finding narrows the location of the suspect gene. Great
     strides in linkage analysis, including laboratory and statistical
     methods, are increasing the power of this method and decreasing its
     cost.

   o Linkage-disequilibrium studies in isolated populations capitalize on
     the likelihood that the susceptibility genes for a particular disorder
     probably came from one or a few founding members. Whether the isolation
     is geographic or cultural, there are fewer individuals in the
     community's genealogies and therefore fewer variations of the disease
     genes within the population. This limited variation makes the search
     easier. In addition, the groups of markers that surround each of these
     susceptibility genes are likely to have the same limited variation,
     which further simplifies identification.

   o Association studies depend on the investigator hypothesizing that a
     specific gene or genes may influence the disorder. In this type of
     study, the investigator examines whether those people with the disorder
     have a different version of the gene than those without the disorder
     among related or unrelated individuals.

     Pinpointing the likely genetic anomaly in linkage and
     linkage-disequilibrium studies occurs once an investigator narrows the
     search to a fairly small region in the genome. That "small" region,
     however, may still be large enough to contain DNA that codes for dozens
     of traits, and the investigator must now choose which parts of the
     region to study further. Because the NIH Human Genome Project is well
     on the way to identifying the location of all genes, this mapping of
     the human genome will greatly simplify the identification of possible
     susceptibility genes. Once the genes in a narrow DNA region are
     cataloged, they may each be tested and the susceptibility gene
     identified.

  The Promise of Genetic Research

   The discovery of specific gene forms related to mental disorders holds
   great promise for advancing diagnosis and treatment of the mental
   disorders. Genetic characterization of affected individuals will offer
   insight into molecular and biochemical subcategories of the disorder
   that clinicians may not be able to discern. This more accurate
   diagnosis can direct better tailoring of today's treatments and
   initiate new lines of treatment development targeted specifically to
   the contributing factor. Even if there are many factors required to
   fully understand complex mental disorders, interventions aimed at just
   one factor may be a successful prevention or treatment strategy.

   Genetic identification will permit predictive screening for mental
   disorders to help affected individuals and their families prepare
   medically, emotionally, and financially and make helpful lifestyle
   changes. Predictive screening will greatly increase the feasibility of
   prevention studies, since interventions can be tailored for and
   provided to individuals at high risk of developing a given disorder.

THE WORKGROUP'S DELIBERATIONS

  Overview

   The Workgroup was charged by Dr. Hyman to advise the Institute on the
   opportunities for moving forward in understanding the genetics of
   mental disorders. To fulfill this charge (see Charge to the Workgroup),
   the Workgroup's initial deliberations focused on the Institute's
   current portfolio. Abstracts for every funded extramural genetics grant
   were reviewed, as were descriptions of the four intramural genetics
   laboratories. For a wider perspective, letters were mailed to all NIMH
   genetics grantees funded during fiscal year 1996, asking for advice on
   the pressing issues in molecular genetics. Advocacy groups and
   professional societies also were canvassed by mail. The Institute's
   extramural and intramural staff were invited to meet with the Workgroup
   to describe their programs, the activities they had undertaken, and
   their future goals. To more personally reach the community of
   researchers, senior and junior investigators were invited to meet with
   the Workgroup. Representatives of international collaborations, private
   industry, and other institutes also addressed the Workgroup. A list of
   speakers is presented in Appendix C. Finally, the Workgroup
   commissioned a summary of the published findings on the genetics of
   mental disorders by Dr. Steven Moldin, a member of NIMH's extramural
   staff.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Charge to the Workgroup

      The Workgroup is charged with reviewing the Institute's extramural and
      intramural research portfolio and developmental activities in molecular
      genetics. Based on these findings and the Workgroup's broad
      understanding of the field, the Workgroup should make recommendations
      regarding future research initiatives by disorder, necessary
      infrastructure development, and administrative changes that the
      Institute should undertake to facilitate the search for the genes that
      influence mental disorders.

  Status of the NIMH Extramural Research Program

   The Workgroup began the extramural portfolio review by examining the
   Institute's holdings during fiscal year 1996. Although just a year's
   effort, this sampling contains work that was submitted, reviewed, and
   funded over the last 4 to 5 years. Given the rapidly developing field
   of molecular genetics, this retrospective assessment appeared
   sufficient.

   Using a broad definition of genetics research (i.e., grants that
   involve genetic approaches or will have ramifications for understanding
   genetics), NIMH sponsored 318 grants for a total of $81.8 million in
   fiscal year l996. Using a narrow definition of genetics research (i.e.,
   grants that involve genetic approaches), NIMH supported 173 grants
   involving genetic approaches to neuroscience, behavioral, and clinical
   phenomena for a total of $44.5 million in fiscal year 1996. This amount
   is a sizable portion of the NIMH budget, approximately 10.1 percent of
   its non-AIDS l996 extramural research budget of $438.6 million. The
   portfolio was found to be diverse and promising. The breadth of the
   non-clinical research is an important investment that will serve the
   field well in developing new approaches for isolating susceptibility
   genes and in responding to the anticipated discovery of such genes.

   The Workgroup focused its attention on the equally diverse clinical
   genetics portfolio. For this portion of the NIMH funded grants, the
   Workgroup also reviewed information culled by the NIMH staff regarding
   the 107 clinical genetics grants. This overview provided a summary of
   approaches, progress, opportunities, and needs. Of the 107 grants, 6
   pertain to statistical model development and 7 to the analysis of
   existing data sets; 39 are new data collection efforts. Table 1
   provides an overview of the disorder areas in which the new data
   collections are underway. In these new collection efforts, 52 percent
   are linkage studies, and 48 percent are association studies with or
   without a linkage component. The Workgroup also considered the
   populations under study, genotyping strategies,^3 and statistical
   analysis plans.

   The educational backgrounds of the principal investigators (PIs), as
   described in the grant applications, are summarized in Table 2.
   Grantees requested consultation from molecular or statistical
   geneticists in 77 and 69 percent of the grants, respectively.

   NIMH undertook a special large-scale initiative in molecular genetics
   in 1989. The goal of the NIMH Genetics Initiative,^4 which was well
   ahead of its time, was to collect enough families to find the genes
   that influence the onset of selected mental disorders. The Initiative
   also enabled the establishment of a national repository of demographic,
   clinical, diagnostic, and genetic data from individuals with bipolar
   disorder, schizophrenia, or Alzheimer's disease to aid researchers in
   identifying factors responsible for these disorders.

   IRP's New Mission Statement

      The IRP conducts basic, clinical, and translational research to advance
      understanding of the causes, treatments, and prevention of mental
      disorders through the study of normal and abnormal brain function and
      behavior. The IRP supports outstanding research that, in part,
      complements extramural research activities and utilizes the special
      resources of the National Institutes of Health. The IRP provides an
      environment conducive to the training and development of clinical and
      basic scientists. The IRP fosters standards of excellence in the
      provision of clinical care to research subjects and in the translation
      of research into effective treatment. The IRP serves as a national
      resource in response to requests made by the Administration, members of
      Congress, and citizens? groups for information regarding mental
      illness.
        __________________________________________________________________

   Diagnosis, family history, and DNA samples were collected using
   identical procedures across multiple sites. The collecting researchers
   were given a 12-month proprietary period to analyze their data, at the
   end of which the data were made available to other qualified
   investigators. The repository contains information on 862 individuals
   with Alzheimer's disease, 432 with bipolar disorder, and 270 with
   schizophrenia.

   These researchers founded a valuable resource that is in high demand.
   Requesting investigators receive a file of demographic and diagnostic
   variables necessary for genetic analysis, with accompanying
   documentation, access to DNA samples, a code manual listing additional
   clinical and demographic data, and pedigree drawings. NIMH supports the
   repository through a contract and by requesters' fees.

  Status of the NIMH Intramural Research Program

   The Intramural Research Program (IRP) just underwent a significant
   review, which is reported in Finding the Balance: Report of the
   National Institute of Mental Health's Intramural Research Planning
   Committee (1997). The Committee strongly endorsed the role of the IRP
   and offered a new mission statement (see IRP's New Mission Statement).
   The report's 77 recommendations covered leadership, quality of science,
   training and mentoring, and clinical research as well as recruitment,
   retention, and retirement.

   The Acting Director, Acting Deputy Director, and chiefs from each of
   the four IRP genetics laboratories briefed the Workgroup. This meeting
   occurred just as the IRP was beginning to implement the report's
   recommendations. Needless to say, this was a time of considerable flux,
   and the Workgroup was particularly appreciative of the IRP staff
   members' generosity in once again discussing their research programs.
   The Workgroup heard about each chief's approach to genetics, research
   plans, and collaborative activities. Written materials also were
   disseminated, which included selected publications, protocols, and
   strategy documents. These discussions and materials were enhanced by an
   overview from the IRP's Acting Director and Acting Deputy Director. In
   addition, NIMH budget staff provided overall figures for the
   Institute's IRP expenditures in this area. The Institute reports a
   total expenditure of $15.7 million in fiscal year 1995 and $10.3
   million in fiscal year 1996 for the four separate genetics laboratories
   and any additional work in other laboratories with a secondary focus on
   genetics.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

  Overview

   The Workgroup reviewed material submitted by NIMH staff, NIMH genetics
   grantees, advocacy groups, professional societies, private industry,
   and other NIH staff. To help integrate these ideas, speakers were
   invited to discuss specific issues. These deliberations and the
   Workgroup's own considerable experience provided the context for
   reviewing the Institute's portfolio and current progress in the
   molecular genetics of mental disorders. The Workgroup was not requested
   to consider the Institute's investment in other related domains, such
   as basic neuroscience and behavioral science, nor the more applied
   areas of clinical or epidemiological research. Nevertheless, the
   Workgroup endorses these areas as critical underpinnings to molecular
   genetic efforts. The Workgroup, therefore, was particularly interested
   in generating recom-mendations that would not significantly divert
   resources from these critical areas. The intent was to develop a series
   of recommendations on investing wisely.

   The Workgroup synthesized its findings and generated six significant
   steps for furthering the field as follows:

   o Creating and Analyzing Large, Well-documented Samples
   o Fostering NIMH's Collaborations
   o Recruiting and Retaining New Researchers
   o Sponsoring Initiatives in the Molecular Genetics of Mental Disorders
   o Addressing Administrative Issues
   o Establishing a Genetics Advisory Group

   Within each of the six categories, a set of con-crete, executable
   recommendations is proposed. These recommendations are based on two
   assumptions. First, NIMH spends a significant portion of its budget on
   genetic approaches, and it is important to direct these resources into
   the most productive avenues for advancing the current understanding of
   complex disorders. Second, new forms of collaboration for both NIMH and
   its investigators will speed the search for susceptibility genes that
   influence mental disorders.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Findings of the Workgroup

   Over the past 10 years, many researchers have attempted to detect and
   map susceptibility genes for the major mental disorders. Given the
   current understanding of complex genetic disorders, it has become clear
   that much larger numbers of affected individuals must be examined to
   detect and map these genes more unambiguously than originally thought.
   Since the efficiency of molecular genetic studies is rapidly increasing
   and their cost is decreasing, it is now opportune to establish the
   large-scale ventures necessary to meet the scientific requirements of
   these investigations. Such an effort will be enhanced by NIMH's
   significant experience in conducting coordinated, large-scale genetics
   studies. Of particular note is the previously described NIMH Genetics
   Initiative, which reflects many of the qualities that the Workgroup
   finds most promising. However, much remains to be done.

   The Workgroup believes that the traditional methods and assumptions of
   NIMH staff and grantees will be of continued assistance in conducting
   genetic research but may not be sufficient for the large-scale efforts
   that many molecular approaches require. That is, the
   investigator-initiated project (often referred to by the NIH computer
   code R01) may not, by itself, accommodate the large ventures that
   molecular genetic studies of complex disorders will require. In this
   R01 approach, a principal investigator submits a research plan to
   collect a modest number of well-documented individuals or families with
   a given disorder in a specified geographic area. If the application is
   found to be meritorious through peer review, the Institute funds the
   grant for the new collection effort. NIMH has many grants of this type
   in its current portfolio, as do the other NIH institutes.

   Although there are numerous investigator-initiated studies, some have
   not been able to recruit the necessary number of participants.
   Determining the necessary number is problematic because such estimates
   are specific to the underlying mode of genetic transmission, which is
   unknown. The more complex the transmission pattern, the larger the
   study must be. Researchers who began collecting 10 years ago would have
   thought that 100 to 200 affected individuals and relatives would have
   been adequate. Now that multiple susceptibility genes are hypothesized,
   much larger samples than previously expected are necessary. If limited
   to an R01 grant approach, the investigator often seeks consecutive
   5-year grants to accrue a large enough sample of affected individuals.
   These investigators then must analyze limited samples to justify their
   funding for the next grant period. As an alternative, or in addition to
   extending the project in time to achieve an adequate sample, an
   investigator could change the diagnostic criteria and permit a broader
   range of affected individuals into the sample. Although sample size is
   increased, the added variability makes the search more difficult.

   Another difficulty facing investigators is that too few sites have all
   of the necessary staff and equipment to collect blood from
   well-diagnosed samples, transform and maintain cell lines, and
   genotype, analyze, and then identify genes. Many sites have one or more
   components, but they would benefit from access to additional
   infrastructure support to fully participate in the effort.

   To speed the discovery process, NIMH must match the realities of
   complex disorders with feasible funding mechanisms and the
   establishment of infrastructure and training opportunities. Through its
   Genetics Initiative, NIMH has already assembled many of the critical
   elements for an efficient search. Policies, programs, and initiatives
   from across NIH offer additional opportunities for strengthening the
   Institute's strategy. What remains to be done is to expand and
   coordinate the necessary resources for a state-of-the-art molecular
   genetics initiative in the mental disorders.

  Creating and Analyzing Large, Well-documented Samples

   Clinically and genetically characterized families are a rare and
   valuable resource. To invest efficiently, NIMH should insist upon the
   timely sharing of clinical data and DNA materials obtained by grantees.
   That is, there should be a standing policy that taxpayer-supported
   samples be made available to qualified investigators in a timely
   manner. The Workgroup suggests that researchers and NIMH reassess
   current policies and procedures for sharing data and materials from
   grants and cooperative agreements.

   In addition to the scientific and administrative considerations that
   are discussed in this section, the public health need must provide the
   context for reviewing these policies. The public health importance of
   sharing research materials is well expressed by John Shestack's story
   on the following page.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3:00 a.m.

   Tonight I sit with my 6-month old son sleeping beside me, and I am
   uneasy. I am excited for the future that awaits him, but I am also
   afraid. I am the reluctant master of recurrence ratios, twin studies,
   lod scores, and odds. No formula can tell me - will he be whole, or
   will he be mysteriously broken like his brother? The brother who hardly
   seems to know he exists. Five years ago, my wife and I didn't know
   anything about autism. If we thought about it at all, we knocked on
   wood and thought it was something rare, something awful, and something
   that happened to other people.

   Then we had a baby. I remember the day my son, Dov, was born. I held
   him in my arms and marveled at the continuity of life. How one day he
   would grow, go to school, get married, and have children. How one day
   he too would know the unbelievable happiness I was experiencing at that
   moment. My wife and I took Dov home to love and care for him.

   When Dov was just over a year old, something began to go terribly
   wrong. He stopped answering to his name. He lost the few words he had.
   He no longer ran to greet us at the door. Instead, we would find him
   staring at specks of dust in the sunlight. In two months, our most
   precious gift vanished in front of our eyes. This is the special curse
   of autism. You have your child, and yet you don't have him. You have a
   shell, a ghost of all the dreams and hopes you ever had. Every day is
   not a tragedy. There are good days. A ball is thrown, a word is
   learned, the bed is dry, or a hug is given freely. Once in a while, we
   clear all the insurance paperwork off the dining room table and eat
   dinner together. But there is never an easy day.

   Now my wife and I know so much more about autism. Some studies suggest
   that it may affect up to 400,000 people in the United States. Though
   some individuals will make strides through early intervention, the vast
   majority will never marry, have a meaningful job, or live on their own.
   More than half will never learn to speak. Until very recently, there
   was little hope for people with autism. When we first learned that
   autism had a genetic component, we despaired. If autism is genetic, we
   thought, then it's hopeless. Now we understand that genetic research
   provides a pathway that can lead to understanding and to treatment.
   What might the next few years of research bring for children like Dov?
   We hope that biological research will provide new answers for autism.
   That is why my wife and I work to fund research in autism and to give
   this message of hope to hundreds of parents. We encourage them to
   participate in research.

   But we also carry a message from the families to the scientists. It is
   this: you can't make it alone. Rapid progress is only possible if
   researchers work together. You may each have a piece of the puzzle, but
   the picture only emerges if you lay your piece down on the table for
   each other to see and build upon. Let everyone know what you know when
   you know it. Create strength by sharing your resources and findings.
   There are thousands of parents worrying at 3:00 a.m. and hoping for an
   answer.

   Sharing high-quality materials will solve two of the field's biggest
   problems. First and foremost, collecting large enough samples for the
   detection of susceptibility genes becomes a possibility. Without the
   sharing of materials, it is difficult to see how peer review
   committees, institutional review boards, potential subjects, or funding
   agencies could support studies that have little chance of meeting their
   scientific aims in a reasonable time frame. The Workgroup sees the
   mandatory sharing of materials as one change that can sustain the
   feasibility of R01s by uniformly boosting their scientific potential.

   Second, the availability of such a generative resource will attract
   additional molecular and statistical geneticists into the area of
   mental disorders. The Workgroup's survey of the portfolio indicates
   that more trained investigators in these areas are essential. The
   availability of rich clinical data and DNA will provide established
   geneticists with an attractive path into mental disorders research. New
   investigators also need rich materials, since years can pass before
   they can begin to accrue and then work on their own sample.
   Well-defined clinical samples will bring an infusion of new talent into
   the search for the genes that contribute to mental disorders.

   The researchers who collect the diagnostic and DNA samples are entitled
   to recognition and incentives for their critical contribution. The
   Workgroup therefore recommends granting a proprietary period of 12 to
   18 months during which the collecting investigators can make
   considerable progress on their own or with additional collaborators.
   But, in the end, the DNA samples and the clinical data must be shared
   with the scientific community.

   NIMH has been a leader by making available the clinical data and DNA
   samples from the Genetics Initiative. Staff negotiated a reasonable
   proprietary period with investigators, and, after this period, the data
   were made available to other qualified investigators. Although this is
   a strong beginning, this sharing is limited to the clinical data and
   DNA from this particular set of grants. The Workgroup was impressed by
   the broader coverage in the procedures the National Human Genome
   Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have
   jointly established (see Appendix D) for genomic research. Here, a
   policy was announced that states: (1) the specific time frame within
   which materials or results are to be shared; (2) the need for
   investigators to provide data release and sharing plans in their grant
   application; (3) the review of the adequacy of the plan and its
   conformity with the policy by peer review; and (4) the incorporation of
   the investigator's plans into the terms and conditions of the awarded
   grant. The Workgroup appreciated both the concrete time limits
   announced in the NHGRI/DOE policy and the ability of review committees
   to permit any well-justified exception to these limits. Also
   significant is the clear monitoring role that staff members are to play
   in ensuring that the plans are executed.

   The Workgroup recognizes that NIH policy on data rights is evolving and
   hopes that the NHGRI/DOE procedures are applicable to the NIMH case in
   genetics. If not, the issue of data sharing is so important that NIMH
   staff will need to explore contract options rather than grants or
   cooperative agreements. Contracts provide for the acquisition of
   materials that the Government then can distribute. The Government
   specifies exactly what the contractor should do, make, or deliver.
   Although contracts are a possibility, the Workgroup believes that the
   researchers' creativity and potential for capitalizing on serendipitous
   findings are diminished through this approach.

   Recommendation 1: NIMH staff should draft a policy for the National
   Advisory Mental Health Council's consideration that provides for the
   sharing of genetic materials (i.e., DNA, diagnostic data, and
   genotypes) collected through NIMH's grants and cooperative agreements
   after a 12- to 18-month proprietary period. Staff members are
   encouraged to include all elements of the NHGRI/DOE policy on data
   sharing.

   NIMH sets the pace in providing a self-supporting contract for
   maintaining cell lines and distributing the DNA and clinical diagnostic
   data. In this way, requestors' payment for the materials covers most of
   the costs of replenishing and distributing the DNA samples. Contracts
   such as this are a necessary vehicle for making full use of the shared
   data.

   Recommendation 2: NIMH should continue to provide a contract for
   maintaining cell lines from individuals with mental disorders and
   appropriate relatives, as well as for distributing DNA and all clinical
   data to qualified investigators.

   The data-sharing approach is predicated on informed consent from
   participants. Prospective participants in new genetic research projects
   must be asked if they will consent to having their anonymous materials
   shared with other qualified researchers. When ethicists have focused on
   the issue of data sharing, the discourse turns to privacy, individual
   rights, and the potential negative effects of such sharing. The
   Workgroup found that individuals with mental disorders and their
   families wanted to be assured of confidentiality but then wanted wide
   distribution of their anonymous samples for research.

   Recommendation 3: NIMH should encourage consent procedures that
   describe and discuss the risks and benefits of DNA banking and clinical
   data sharing in genetic research.

   Another opportunity for NIMH is the use of extant samples, in which
   NIMH has invested heavily. If valid diagnostic standards can be
   defined, these samples may be merged for re-analysis or reanalyzed
   after recoding diagnostic status.

   Recommendation 4: NIMH should issue a request for applications (RFA) to
   conduct secondary analyses of clinical samples. The RFA should provide
   support for recoding diagnostic variables and for reanalysis. If the
   RFA proves successful, a program announcement should be established so
   that this very efficient and low-cost approach can continue.

   Although there are centers in the United States and Europe capable of
   performing cost-efficient, large-volume genotyping called
   "high-through-put genotyping," the demand for such services may outpace
   these facilities. An answer to this potential rate-limiting problem is
   the broad availability of high-through-put genotyping, such as that
   soon to be available through NHGRI's Center for Inherited Disease
   Research (CIDR). In addition to offering capacity, such resources
   empower collecting researchers, who are the clinical and
   epidemiological experts, to expand their opportunities for carrying out
   such research and removing technical bottlenecks posed by genotyping.
   CIDR also provides expert consultation on study design and analysis.

   Recommendation 5: NIMH should continue its support for core facilities
   such as CIDR to augment the available genotyping and analytic resources
   in academic research facilities.

   Establishing well-identified, large samples will be facilitated by the
   establishment of international consortia. Finding ideal isolated
   populations will carry U.S. investigators around the world. NIMH should
   actively foster partnerships between American scientists and their
   counterparts in other countries. Partnership is the key word. In
   addition to establishing a full collaboration, productive international
   research requires a shared understanding of the materials that must be
   collected and their transportability, each country's patent laws,
   expectations regarding contributions to the local community, and
   publication rights.

   Recommendation 6: RFAs and program announcements should explicitly
   allow international work and provide support for such shared
   undertakings when scientifically appropriate.

   NIMH should reconsider the cooperative agreement process as well. The
   cooperative agreement is a grant that allows the Govern-ment's staff to
   provide substantial assistance through resources or collaboration.
   Through peer review, individual investigators are selected for
   participation and then asked to meet with the other awardees to design
   the eventual study. An alternative model was used by the National
   Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in its genetics program.
   Rather than having individual investigators or sites submit separate
   applications, the RFA called for teams of cooperating investigators
   across multiple sites to apply as a unified group. That way, the peer
   reviewers were able to assess the proposed research, the investigators
   knew with whom they would be working, and the methodology already was
   agreed upon within the team. This procedure seems much more likely to
   enable productive collaborations than the standard cooperative
   agreement approach or other types of RFA solicitations.

   Recommendation 7: RFAs for future large-scale, coordinated efforts
   should call for self-selected teams of researchers.

  Fostering NIMH Collaborations

   Like the researchers, the NIMH extramural staff will need to work in
   collaborative groups. Rather than focusing on what the Institute can or
   cannot do with its allocation, NIMH staff members are encouraged to
   look for new alliances within NIH as well as with private industry,
   advocacy groups, and international consortia.

   Many of the institutes at NIH are beginning to travel down this same
   road. NIMH is asked to seek out inter-institute collaborations on
   complex disorders. Each of these institutes will be investing in
   certain generic infrastructure activities that would be better
   integrated and financed if conducted in concert. A coordinating
   committee of key genetics staff from NIH should be convened to meet and
   discuss issues of genetics research and to exchange ideas.

   Ideas for consideration by that committee are:

   o All NIH communities could benefit from an NIH-wide training program
     in statistical analysis for molecular geneticists.

   o The field still requires appropriate models and software for
     analysis. Efficient computer programs are needed that implement new
     analytic methods and provide the necessary power to handle both large
     family-size and multiple genetic markers. Because these tools will not
     be specific to a disorder and no individual institute is likely to pay
     for this entire effort, a joint RFA across NIH should be developed.

   o New and revised NIH extramural policies could be reviewed to ensure
     applicability to genetics research.

   o As NIMH and other institutes move closer to finding causative and
     susceptibility genes, the consequences of these discoveries must be
     considered carefully. Resources such as NHGRI's Ethical, Legal and
     Social Implications program (ELSI) can assist in anticipating and
     considering ethical issues that might arise. For instance, as in other
     illnesses, when findings are first announced, individuals wish to make
     clinical decisions based on preliminary findings. There will be a
     sudden and significant need to train clinicians in genetic counseling.
     Additionally, issues concerning privacy and anticipated social
     implications are other areas of significant overlap. The institutes can
     build upon the experience from other disease entities via the ELSI
     program.

     The ELSI program would gain much by learning about the specific needs
     of individuals with mental disorders. Individuals with mental disorders
     will be part of the audience for health care information regarding
     other illnesses with genetic components. Also, researchers in other
     areas will find that some individuals in their studies have a mental
     disorder. Of course, the large majority of individuals with a mental
     disorder do not require special protections, but some do. Learning
     about these considerations in the consent process and when to apply
     them will be quite helpful to researchers.

   In addition to its NIH-wide activities, the coordinating committee
   should reach out to other communities invested in the outcome of
   complex genetics research:

   o Private industry is becoming an increasingly larger player in the
     field. Just as pharmaceutical companies have changed the way most
     clinical trials are conducted, similar financial forces are shaping
     genetics research. NIH staff should explore ways to advance the field
     through collaborations with business. Technology transfer opportunities
     can benefit private industry, NIH, and, ultimately, individuals with
     mental disorders and their families.

   o Advocacy groups provide opportunities for investigators to better
     understand how the results of their work may affect lives. Addressing
     these needs and concerns has multiple benefits. First, the research
     becomes more relevant to public health. Second, advocacy groups are
     interested in assisting with recruitment of participants. Third, new
     collaborations can be created, such as the jointly funded RFA supported
     by the American Diabetes Association and the National Institute of
     Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Fourth, advocacy groups are
     eager for information from genetic studies. Providing results in lay
     language will benefit these individuals and help share the excitement
     of the science with the general public.

   o International consortia for genetics research should be fostered.
     Collaborating with these consortia can reduce the barriers to
     establishing unique resources across the globe.

   Recommendation 8: NIMH extramural staff should invite key clinical
   genetics staff across NIH to form a coordinating committee for complex
   disorders. Of particular interest would be discussions on joint efforts
   in training, software development, hardware, statistical models,
   ethical issues, and international alliances.

  Recruiting and Retaining New Researchers

   The hunt for genes requires the coordinated effort of a large number of
   scientists with a good variety of skills. Genetic epidemiologists will
   likely be the key players during the phase of collecting genetic
   samples, since their expertise will result in the most consistent
   diagnostic categories being chosen, a critical element for success.
   Molecular geneticists have the expertise to generate the data that will
   be used to establish the linkage between DNA markers and the defective
   genes. Statisticians are required to analyze those data and to create
   new statistical tools to analyze very complex situations in which
   multiple defective genes may be interacting to produce a disease state.
   Interdisciplinary collaboration will be required to foster progress.

   Too few researchers are studying the genetics of mental disorders, and
   even fewer are proficient in all the areas mentioned above. Complex
   disease genetics is a rapidly expanding field, and researchers of every
   type are in great demand by academia and industry. Providing an
   adequate community of geneticists committed to working on mental
   disorders will be an ongoing challenge for NIMH. The Workgroup
   recommends establishing the following programs to lower barriers to
   entering the field and to train new and established researchers.

   Recommendation 9: NIMH should establish multidisciplinary institutional
   training grants at the pre and postdoctoral levels that provide
   education in clinical, statistical, and molecular genetics.

   Recommendation 10: Two programs established by NHLBI should be adapted
   for use at NIMH. First, the NHLBI Programs of Excellence in Molecular
   Biology should be modified for use by NIMH. This NIMH initiative should
   provide investigators with expertise in the genetics of mental
   disorders. Second, short-term training programs for new investigators
   or investigators seeking to redirect their career or broaden their
   skills should be established. Rather than a brief introduction to
   molecular genetics, the course should offer intensive, hands-on
   training opportunities.

   Recommendation 11: A new investigator's award should be created to
   provide entrance into the field without demanding long-term, high-risk
   projects for junior investigators and for established geneticists
   seeking to redirect their efforts into mental disorders. These grants,
   envisioned as 2-year awards at $50,000 to $100,000 a year, could be
   used, for instance, to analyze data sets in the repository. Other
   short-term projects should be considered as well.

  Sponsoring Initiatives in the Molecular Genetics of Mental Disorders

   The Workgroup also focused on what steps must be taken to understand
   the role, if any, of genetics in each of the mental disorders. The
   Workgroup found that the concept of readiness was a helpful index for
   making recommendations to the Institute. Depending on the existing
   empirical literature and diagnostic reliability, some disorders are
   clearly ready for large-scale molecular approaches while others require
   an investment in additional preliminary research.

   Dr. Steven Moldin, Acting Chief of the NIMH Genetics Research Branch,
   summarized the research findings that the Workgroup surveyed (see
   Appendix E). These findings include a description of each disorder and
   technical sum-maries of the current genetics findings from human and
   animal studies. Based on these published findings, Dr. Moldin
   determined for each disorder the population prevalence and the risk of
   illness for different classes of relatives of an affected individual
   (see Table 4). The precision of these estimates varies widely, due to
   differences in methodologies, number of studies, and sample sizes.
   Table 4 includes recurrence risk ratios (lambdas, or [ls.gif] ), which
   are the risks to relatives of different degrees of genetic relationship
   divided by the disorder's lifetime prevalence (i.e., how frequently the
   disorder occurs in the population). The degree of genetic relationship
   is the amount of genes two individuals would be expected to share
   (i.e., identical twins, 100 percent; first-degree relatives such as
   fraternal twins, siblings, or parents, 50 percent; second-degree
   relatives such as grandparents, 25 percent). Each pattern of relative
   risks is an important characteristic of that illness that geneticists
   can use to discriminate among models of genetic transmission and to
   estimate the magnitude of genetic effects. Also, the geneticist used
   figures like these to estimate Clea Simon's chance of having a child
   with schizophrenia.

   The disorders in Table 4 sort into two categories: (1) mental disorders
   that are ready for and require a large NIMH Genetics Initiative and (2)
   mental disorders that would benefit from nonmolecular genetic and/or
   epidemiological studies and smaller scale molecular approaches to
   better document their estimated heritability.

  Catetory 1: Molecular Initiatives

   Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism are ready for large-scale
   molecular approaches. Another disorder, a particular subtype of
   depression called early-onset depression, which begins before the age
   of 20 and tends to be recurrent and severe, should also be considered,
   although its empirical basis is not as strong as the other three. These
   disorders can be reliably diagnosed and for the first three recurrence
   risk ratios are sufficiently high. There is no recurrence risk ratio
   for early-onset depression because there is no published population
   prevalence estimate for this subtype of depressive disorder. This is
   why depression, as a whole, is not listed in category 1 but appears in
   category 2. Nonetheless, a clear preponderance of research literature
   indicates this subtype is reasonable to explore. Because autism has yet
   another important characteristic, recommendations pertaining to this
   disorder will be discussed separately, after the other three
   disorders.^5

   NIMH should develop coordinated molecular genetic initiatives in
   schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and early-onset depression. These
   initiatives should be disorder-specific and reflect the Workgroup's
   recommendations from the previous sections. Whether the RFA calls for a
   cooperative agreement or another method for collaboration among teams
   of researchers, NIMH staff must ensure that new collections will either
   establish a sufficiently large sample or augment an existing sample.
   Review criteria should emphasize the rigorous definition of the
   disorder and the comparability of data across sites. Further,
   investigators should include a timetable designating the expected rate
   of progress to serve as a monitoring tool for the NIMH project officer
   when the noncompetitive renewal is considered.

   The Workgroup thought that specifying a particular scientific approach
   was premature and leaves this to the investigators and the peer-review
   groups. Association, linkage, and linkage disequilibrium studies all
   should be solicited.

   Recommendation 12: NIMH should issue RFAs for large-scale molecular
   genetics studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and early-onset
   depression.

   Initiatives in autism need to be developed in a different manner. The
   heritability of autism is very high, but there is a significant problem
   that must be thoughtfully addressed. Families with several affected
   individuals are exceedingly uncommon. Sampling from these families must
   be accomplished in an integrated manner. Simply funding more
   investigators may result in this limited resource being divided up into
   multiple, small samples, none of which are sufficient. Thus,
   coordinated approach
