   The Stephen P. Teale Data Center, a state department within the
   Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, was formed in 1972 and
   provides information technology services and products to over 250
   customers, the majority of which are state entities. Teale goes beyond
   the traditional data center role by providing a variety of proven
   information processing technologies and the expertise to support them.
   We offer data and resource sharing which make possible business
   solutions that might otherwise be too complex or costly for customers
   to pursue on their own. Customers are charged for resources required to
   process their jobs at Teale using uniformly established rates that are
   reviewed regularly to ensure that costs are equitable and competitive.

   Teale uses multiple processing platforms that enable customers to take
   advantage of extraordinary computing capabilities without having to
   develop the required technical expertise to upgrade software or
   configure equipment and machines. The Data Center is also a repository
   for customers' applications and databases. We provide a wide variety of
   software tools that allow customers to integrate islands of data into
   information required to meet their needs. From the personal computer to
   the mainframe system, Teale provides complete integration of
   information sharing and retrieval systems.

   The Data Center receives its funding from a Revolving Fund, a
   non-governmental cost fund within the State's Administration Budget.
   The Revolving Fund receives monies through payments from customer
   agencies for information technology goods and services provided. Teale
   is 100 percent self-supporting through service recovery billing and has
   no other outside sources of funding.

   As the State's largest multi-purpose data center, Teale provides data
   processing services to some of the most critical agencies in state
   government: the Department of Motor Vehicles, California Highway
   Patrol, Department of Transportation, Department of Finance, Secretary
   of State, Department of Corrections, Board of Equalization and the
   State Controller's Office. The daily work performed by our customers
   touches the lives of nearly every Californian - from processing
   automobile licenses, inmate information and state payroll - to air
   quality standards, health care databases and much more.
