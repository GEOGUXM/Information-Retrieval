   School Districts" is an annual publication providing a meaningful
   perspective to staff in the Division of the Budget, the Legislature,
   the Education Department, and school officials concerning school
   expenditures, State Aid, and local support. This edition of the
   Analysis summarizes the finances of major school districts in school
   year 1999-00, as well as public school expenditures and State Aid since
   1981-82. In summarizing school district expenditures, the Analysis
   compares various percentiles of operating expenditures per pupil and
   describes the magnitude of the disparity in approved operating
   expenditures per pupil between districts in the 10th and 90th
   percentiles for each year. Also provided are decile tables ranked by
   wealth, expenditure per pupil and a need/resource index. These decile
   tables provide comparisons of school districts' expenditures per pupil,
   tax rates, and wealth per pupil. Another feature of the Analysis is its
   presentation of five-year trend data on full value, expenditures, State
   Aid, tax rates, and local revenue. These items are displayed on a per
   pupil basis for the entire State, New York City and the rest of State
   (school districts outside New York City). In terms of data collection,
   the total revenue from State sources displayed in the tables from
   1981-82 through 1999-00 is the State Aid reported in the Annual
   Financial Report (Form ST-3) submitted by school districts. It should
   be noted that this data item may include prior year State Aid
   adjustment payments. Data for 2000-01 is based on State Aid payments to
   school districts and does not include some grants, prior year
   adjustments, and miscellaneous revenues from State sources. Total
   expenditures for 2000-01 are based on estimates provided by school
   districts. The 1999 Income data are as of September 2001. Other items
   contained in the Analysis are as of May 2000. Data for school years
   prior to 1982-83 have not been adjusted. School Tax Relief (STAR)
   revenue is also addressed in the report. As in past years, an
   historical perspective of school finances in New York State is
   presented. Table 1 displays State Aid and total expenditures since
   1981-82 and Appendix B contains data for school years 1944-45 through
   1980-81. To assist the reader less familiar with the technical terms
   used in the Analysis, a glossary of terms is provided at the end of the
   report. iii iv CONTENTS Section Page Preface

   THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN NEW YORK STATE Introduction The
   New York State commitment to elementary and secondary education, as
   measured by revenues to school districts from State sources, has
   increased by $3.5 billion or 34.3 percent, from $10.19 billion in
   1995-96 to $13.69 billion in 1999-00. While this was occurring at the
   State level, school districts increased local tax revenue support by
   $1.99 billion, a 14.1 percent increase over the same period. This
   overall revenue commitment by State and local governments (combined
   with a slight increase in federal aid) contributed to a total
   expenditure increase of $6.1 billion or 23.8 percent during the period.
   The State's percentage of participation, presently at 43.2 percent
   (Table 1) for 1999-00, in the expenditures of school districts over the
   past 25 years has varied from a 1968-69 peak of 48.1 percent to a low
   of 37.6 percent in 1977-78. Figures such as these compare favorably
   with the 1944-45 low of 31.5 percent. New York State's capacity to fund
   education has fluctuated over the years depending on State or national
   economic prosperity. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89, the State's economic
   climate was improving. This resulted in generous increases in State
   revenue, about 10.7 percent annually. As a result, the State revenue
   portion of Total General and Special Aid Fund Expenditures rose to 44.2
   percent for 1988-89. Due to a restructuring of the New York State
   Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) payments, this percentage declined to
   41.6 percent for 1989- 90. Even with a $257 million give-back by local
   districts (1990-91 State Aid to school districts was initially reduced
   $67 million due to restructuring of TRS and Employees' Retirement
   System payments and further reduced $190 million due to the December
   1990 Deficit Reduction Assessment), the 1990-91 percentage rose to 42.9
   percent. As a result of the State's $6 billion budget deficit in
   1991-92 and the imposition of $926 million deficit reduction
   assessments against school aid the proportionate share of public school
   expenditures funded from State sources declined to 40.4 percent. The
   continuing poor economic climate in 1992-93 also resulted in a $1.03
   billion deficit reduction assessment against school aid, with the
   result that the State's share of public school expenditures declining
   to 39.1 percent in 1992-93. The State's share of public school
   expenditures continued to decline, to 38.0 percent, in 1993-94 with a
   -$167 million net transition adjustment. Since then, steady increases
   in State revenue have resulted in the State's share of total
   expenditures rising each year. Estimates for the 2000-01 school year
   with continued aid adjustments and with School Tax Relief (STAR) added
   to the calculation of State revenues, indicate a State share of 45.8
   percent, substantially above the 19-year average (1981-82 to 1999-00)
   of 41.0 percent. A review of Table 1 (and Appendix B) reveals that
   State revenue has paralleled the State's economic climate. In the
   latter 1970's, the State provided relatively modest aid increases to
   schools caused in part by the economic adjustment to higher energy
   costs and inflation. As energy costs declined and economic activity
   within the State and nation rebounded, the State 1 moved to incorporate
   new initiatives and continue support for excellence in education. In
   fact, the State revenue portion of total expenditures increased from
   39.3 percent in the 1981-82 school year to 44.2 percent in 1988-89, the
   highest State share since 1970-71 (see Figure 1). State revenue as a
   percentage of total expenditures generally declined from 1991-92 to
   1993-94, but has generally increased since then. Figure 1: Revenues
   from State Sources as a Percent of Total Expenditures Total State 48 46
   44 42 Percent 40 38 36 81-82 82-83 83-84 84-85 85-86 86-87 87-88 88-89

   School Years Although final data for 2000-01 will not be available
   until next Summer, preliminary information in Table 1 shows that Total
   General and Special Aid Fund Expenditures for public elementary and
   secondary schools are expected to increase $2.13 billion for 2000-01 to
   $33.84 billion, a 6.7 percent increase over 1999-00. However, total
   State revenue including STAR in the same period is likely to increase
   by about $1.82 billion (13.3 percent) to $15.51 billion. The impact of
   the State revenue and total expenditure increases experienced during
   the last 20 years was further enhanced by enrollment declines which
   continued without interruption from 1973-74 until 1989-90, at which
   time enrollment increases began. 2 Table 1 REVENUES FROM STATE SOURCES

   comparisons prior to the 1981-82 school year, the reader is referred to
   Appendix B of this report. ** Other than STAR, all revenues from State
   sources reported on the Annual Financial Report by school districts.
   Depending on local accounting methods, this may include prior year
   adjustments. *** Total Expenditures include expenditures made from the
   Federal Aid Fund from 1965-66 to 1973-74 and from the Special Aid Fund
   since 1974-75. Includes expenditures from the Debt Service Fund, which
   was established in 1978-79. Beginning in 1983-84, some districts
   including New York City reported negative interfund transfers to the
   General Fund, tending to reduce actual expenditures. **** Estimated.
   ***** Annual Financial Report data was used; however, the State aid
   withheld as a State share of local Teachers' Retirement System and
   Employees' Retirement System savings, which resulted from the
   restructuring noted below, was charged against revenues rather than
   expenditures. ****** Legislation for 1989-90 reduced State aid by
   approximately $684 million due to a restructuring of Teachers'
   Retirement System (TRS) payments for 1988-89 salaries. However,
   differences among districts in both accounting method used and payment
   schedule for the 1988-89 TRS salaries resulted in a total expenditure
   amount which includes about $306 million in TRS expenditures. 3 Table 2
   accounts for these enrollment changes by depicting total expenditures
   and State revenues on a per enrolled pupil basis for school years
   1981-82 to 2000-01. As Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrate, Total General
   and Special Aid Fund Expenditures per pupil increased from $3,933 in
   1981-82 to $11,020 in 1999-00, a 181 percent increase over the entire
   period and an annual percentage increase per pupil of 5.9 percent.
   Increases in State revenue (including STAR starting in 1998-99) per
   pupil reflected a similar trend, increasing from $1,544 in 1981-82 to
   $4,759 in 1999-00, a 209 percent increase over the same time span, and
   an annual percentage increase of 6.5%. The estimated 2000-01 Total
   General and Special Aid Fund Expenditures per enrolled pupil are
   $11,706, an increase of $686 (6.2 percent) over the 1999-00 school
   year. During this same period, State revenue including School Tax
   Relief (STAR) is expected to increase by $607 per enrolled pupil to
   $5,366, a 12.8 percent increase from the 1999-00 school year. Figure 2:

   contains a breakdown of total revenues and includes General and Special
   Aid Fund Revenues by funding source. State revenue, Federal revenue and
   local tax and other revenues are listed over the past 20 years. As
   noted in the table, State revenue includes School Tax Relief (STAR)
   starting in 1998-99. Revenues come primarily from local taxes and other
   sources (51.5 percent in 1999-00) and State revenue (43.9 percent of
   total in 1999-00); Federal revenue was $1.43 billion in 1999-00, which
   amounted to only 4.6 percent of total revenues. Table 3 and Figure 3
   also show that Total General and Special Aid Fund Revenues increased
   from $10.96 billion in 1981-82 to $31.2 billion in 1999-00, an increase
   of 185 percent, while State revenue increased from $4.27 billion to
   $13.69 billion, or 220 percent over the same period. At the same time,
   local and other revenues increased from $6.26 billion to $16.08
   billion, a 157 percent increase; Federal revenues increased from $427
   million to $1,430 million, a 235 percent increase over this period.
   Current estimates indicate that Federal revenue will be approximately
   $1.50 billion in 2000-01, but will comprise only 4.5 percent of total
   revenues. It is estimated that the proportion of total revenues from
   State sources including School Tax Relief (STAR) will increase to 46.6
   percent for the 2000-01 school year while amounting to $15.51 billion.
   Local tax and other revenues are expected to increase by almost $200
   million to $16.27 billion, and their proportionate share of total
   revenues will decrease by 2.6 percentage points to 48.9 percent. Figure

   PUPIL EXPENDITURES AND WEALTH BY CONTIGUOUS METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL
   AREAS (MSAs) This section describes the variation in expenditures and
   resources among the contiguous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of
   the State and among school districts of different types, based on
   definitions from the 1990 Census. Appendix C depicts the counties in
   each contiguous MSA and Appendix D the district type classification of
   school district. While the variation in statewide expenditure and
   revenue per pupil has been substantial over time, dramatic differences
   in expenditure and resource data also exist among the different
   geographic regions at any given point in time. Table 4 (based on the
   1990 definition of MSAs) shows that the NY Metro - Long Island area has
   by far the highest average Actual Value/TWPU (Total Wealth Pupil
   Units), AOE/TAPU (Approved Operating Expense/Total Aidable Pupil Units)
   for Expense, Total Expenditure/TAPU for Expense and Tax Revenue
   (excluding STAR)/TAPU for Expense of the contiguous MSAs. This region
   also has the highest Income/TWPU and Income/Tax Return. The non-MSA
   districts are lowest on Income/TWPU, Income/Tax Return, STAR
   Revenue/TAPU for Expense and Tax Rate per $1,000 Actual Value;
   accordingly they have the highest averages among the regions on other
   State revenue/TAPU for Expense. The Binghamton-Elmira region has the
   lowest enrollment and the lowest average AV/TWPU, AOE/TAPU for Expense,
   Total Expenditure/TAPU for Expense, and Tax Revenue per TAPU for
   Expense. This region has the second highest average Tax Rate (excluding
   STAR) per $1,000 Actual Value and the highest average STAR Revenue/TAPU
   for Expense. Table 4 also displays wealth, expenditure, and aid data in
   another fashion -- on the basis of pupil weighted averages for
   districts grouped by type. These type groupings are: 1) All Major
   Districts; 2) New York City; 3) Other Big 5 City School Districts; 4)
   Small City School Districts; 5) Suburban Districts; and, 6) Other
   School Districts. By comparing individual districts to both the decile
   groupings in Section III as well as the classification groups listed, a
   larger picture of the district's relative status can be gained. As
   Table 4 reveals, the mean AOE/TAPU for Expense for all major districts
   is $6,900. New York City spends $6,181 per pupil. The other Big 5 City
   School Districts have an average AOE/TAPU for Expense of $7,003
   (district spending per pupil ranges from $5,600 in Syracuse to $8,427
   in Yonkers). The Small City Districts have an average AOE/TAPU for
   Expense of $6,780 with the 50 Upstate districts averaging $6,387 per
   pupil and the 7 Downstate districts averaging $8,958 per pupil. The
   Suburban Districts have an average expenditure of $7,663 per pupil with
   the 271 Upstate districts and the 169 Downstate districts spending
   $6,272 and $9,201 per pupil, respectively. The 178 Other districts have
   an average AOE/TAPU for Expense of $6,182. 8 Table 4 1999-00 AVERAGE

   compares contiguous MSAs (1990 Census definition) on changes from
   1995-96 to 1999-00 in Total Wealth Pupil Units (TWPU), Actual Value per
   TWPU, and Income per TWPU. The non-MSA districts had the largest
   increase in Income/TWPU and the second largest increase in AV/TWPU. The
   NY Metro-Long Island region had the largest increase in AV/TWPU and
   largest increase in TWPU. Statewide, AV/TWPU increased 4.91 percent and
   Income/TWPU increased 24.75%. Statewide, TWPU increased 5.38 percent,
   with the Binghamton/Elmira MSA decreasing the most on average. The
   Buffalo-Rochester Jamestown MSA had the smallest increase in
   Income/TWPU. It is important to note that the currency of the Market
   Value Standard used to convert locally assessed property values to a
   uniform full value standard remained the same during the reporting
   period: the 1995 standard was set at January 1994 (a gap of 12 months)
   and the 1999 standard is January 1999 (no gap). Table 6 compares
   contiguous MSAs (based on the 1990 Census definition of MSAs) on
   changes in AOE/TAPU for Expense, Tax Revenue/TAPU for Expense and Tax
   Rate per $1,000 of Actual Value for the 1995-96 to 1999-00 period.
   Since 1998-99, Tax Revenue and Tax Rate exclude STAR Revenue.
   Statewide, the percent change in Tax Rate was 0.06 percent with
   increases only for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy-Glens Falls MSA and the
   Poughkeepsie- Newburgh MSA. Statewide, AOE/TAPU for Expense and Tax
   Revenue increased 13.11 percent and 4.19 percent respectively over the
   four-year period. Non-MSA districts had the largest percent increase in
   AOE/TAPU for Expense. The smallest percent increase in AOE/TAPU for
   Expense was in the Syracuse-Utica-Rome MSA. The largest percent
   decrease in Tax Rate occurred in the Binghamton-Elmira MSA. If New York
   City were excluded from the NY Metro- Long Island MSA, the remaining
   region would have the largest decrease in Tax Rate. As shown in Table
   16 New York City had an 16.2 percent increase in AOE/TAPU for Expense,
   a 22.8 percent increase in Tax Revenue/TWPU and a 19.5 percent increase
   in Tax Rate. Table 7 shows the wide range in school district
   expenditure patterns based on AOE/TAPU for Expense among the contiguous
   MSAs (based on the 1990 Census definitions) when compared to the
   statewide 25th percentile ($5,854) and 75th percentile ($8,286). The NY
   Metro-Long Island MSA contains by far the largest number and percent of
   school districts with AOE/TAPU for Expense above the 75th percentile;
   145 of the 178 school districts in the region, or 81 percent, had
   expenditures above the 75th percentile. This contiguous MSA had one
   school district below the 25th percentile of spending. In most of the
   other contiguous MSAs and in non-MSA districts, the number of districts
   in excess of the 75th percentile was extremely small. Each of these
   contiguous MSAs and the non-MSA districts had substantially higher
   numbers of districts with AOE/TAPU for Expense less than the 25th
   percentile. 10 Table 5 CHANGES IN WEALTH PER PUPIL AND WEALTH PUPILS BY

   EXPENDITURES AND WEALTH BY DISTRICT RANK Section III is designed to
   highlight the relationship between school district wealth and
   expenditure per pupil. A useful technique for portraying this
   relationship is first to rank order all districts in terms of their
   Approved Operating Expenditures per Total Aidable Pupil Unit for
   Expense (AOE/TAPU for Expense) from the lowest to the highest spending
   district. This array can then be split into 10 equally numbered groups,
   or deciles, and each of the expenditure deciles thus created can be
   described in terms of selected measures of district wealth as
   determined by Actual Value per Total Wealth Pupil Unit (AV/TWPU) and
   Income per Total Wealth Pupil Unit (Income/TWPU). The resulting decile
   tables (Tables 9 through 12) provide a quick comparison of school
   districts with similar approved operating expenditures per pupil and
   the degree to which changes in wealth are associated with changes in
   expenditure per TAPU. Table 8 provides a comparison of AOE/TAPU for
   Expense, by selected district percentiles. As noted, Total Aidable
   Pupil Units (TAPU) was used for school years 1973-74 through 1979-80;
   and since 1981-82, TAPU for Expense, which includes weightings for
   students with disabilities, has been the pupil measure. The percentile
   values displayed (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th) are for all major
   school districts excluding New York City. New York City data are shown
   separately. Table 8 also displays the difference between the 90th and
   10th percentiles, and the resulting expenditure gap expressed as a
   percent of the 10th percentile value. This expenditure gap measure can
   be viewed as a simple equality measure, with high values indicative of
   greater spending inequality among districts. As the last column of this
   table indicates, this expenditure gap generally grew into the 90's with
   a few exceptions, and has been decreasing since the 1991-92 school
   year. At 84.5 percent, the 1999-00 expenditure gap is the smallest of
   the 19 years displayed. Between the 1998-99 and 1999-00 school years,
   the median (50th percentile) district AOE per TAPU for Expense
   increased 5.4 percent or $337. For the 10th percentile district, the
   change was an increase of $270 or 5.2 percent; for the 90th percentile
   district, the per pupil change was an increase of $297 or 3.0 percent.
   Over the 19-year period, the median approved operating expenditure per
   weighted pupil has increased by about 181 percent; however, the
   expenditure gap over the same period has increased by 142 percent. In
   1980-81, the method of computing the pupil count was changed to include
   weighted students with disabilities. Since there are a relatively large
   number of students with disabilities in New York City, this method of
   calculation has served to inflate New York City's pupil count, thus
   lowering their AOE per weighted pupil figures. From school year 1980-81
   to the present, New York City's AOE per pupil has steadily declined
   relative to the median, dropping below it in 1991-92 and falling below
   the 25th percentile in 1996-97. In 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-00 New
   York City's AOE per pupil is above the 25th percentile. 13 Table 8

   _______________________ * Weighted pupil count from 1973-74 to 1979-80,
   was TAPU; 1980-81 to present, TAPU for Expense (See Glossary for
   definitions). ** The value of the district at the percentile shown
   below is listed. 14 For Tables 9 through 12, districts were ranked
   respectively on Expenditure (AOE/TAPU for Expense), Property Wealth
   (AV/TWPU), Income Wealth (Income/TWPU) and a Need/Resource Index. Based
   on the ranking value for a given table, the State's 679 major districts
   (excluding New York City) were divided into ten decile groupings. (A
   district could conceivably be in a different decile group on each
   table.) Each table displays the highest value for each decile group on
   the ranking measure as well as the decile average for the ranking
   measure and eight other data measures, plus the 1999-00 enrollment (see
   Glossary for definition). State averages and New York City values for
   each data measure are also described at the bottom of each table. The
   decile rankings of Tables 9, 10 and 11 permit the reader to compare
   individual school district information in a number of ways; it can be
   compared to other districts within its decile group, to other decile
   groups, or to the State average. For example, referring to Table 9, a
   district with a 1999-00 AOE/TAPU for Expense of $6,900 would fall in
   the lowest sixth expenditure decile (between $6,565 and $6,986). A
   district at or below $5,489 would fall in the lowest spending first
   decile. With an AOE/TAPU for Expense of $6,181, New York City would
   fall in the fourth decile, if the deciles had included New York City.
   The average AV/TWPU for the third AOE/TAPU for Expense decile grouping
   was $178,421 and the average Total Expenditure/TAPU for Expense was
   $7,866 for this same group of districts. In a review of the three
   decile tables, attention should be drawn to the fact that all three
   ranking measures are positively skewed, since their respective State
   averages are heavily influenced by the extremely high values associated
   with districts in the ninth and tenth deciles. Thus, for example, the
   pupil weighted State average AOE/TAPU for Expense (including NYC) of
   $6,900 shown in Table 9 falls into the sixth decile of expense, well
   above the AOE/TAPU for Expense of the district at the 50th percentile
   of expense ($6,564 per pupil). This is due to the pronounced effect of
   the more extreme per pupil spending patterns in the highest spending
   decile. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the case of
   Income/TWPU (shown in Table 11) since the statewide average of $110,400
   per pupil is well above the 50th percentile maximum value of $75,489.
   Once again, this is attributable to the unusually high per pupil income
   of school districts in the tenth decile of income wealth. The School
   Tax Relief (STAR) program started in 1998-99. Tables 9, 10 and 11 show
   State revenue to school districts under the STAR program on a per pupil
   basis. Generally, lower spending and lower wealth districts receive
   less STAR/TAPU for Expense. Consistent with past issues of this report,
   Other Revenue from State/TAPU for Expense does not include State
   revenue for STAR. For Table 12, districts are ranked using a
   Need/Resource Index. The need/resource index is designed to measure
   each district's (or decile's) student need in relation to its capacity
   to raise local revenues, indexed to State averages. Need is based on
   the Extraordinary Needs (EN) percent, which has been used to calculate
   Extraordinary Needs Aid since 1993-94, compared to the State average EN
   percent. The EN percent is a ratio of the lunch count, sparsity count
   and limited English proficient pupils to the district enrollment. The
   Resource measure is based on the Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR), used in
   the calculation of Operating Aid since 1984-85. The CWR is based
   equally on property wealth per pupil compared to the State average and
   income wealth per pupil compared to the State average. 15 Table 9

   Other State Revenue includes the effect of the 1999-00 Transition
   Adjustment of -$395 million. It does not include STAR. 18 In order to
   measure each district's extraordinary student need relative to its
   wealth, the EN percent, compared to the State average, was divided by
   the Combined Wealth Ratio. The resulting index value was then used to
   array the 679 major districts in the State (excluding NYC) into the ten
   ascending decile groups in the table. Districts with relatively low
   needs and high resources will fall in the first decile (pages 13 and 15
   describe the use of deciles). Districts (or district decile groups)
   that serve relatively high percentages of students with Extraordinary
   Needs but have limited resources available to address the need (a low
   Combined Wealth Ratio) would have a very high need/resource index. Had
   New York City been included in the ranking, with an index of 1.685, it
   would fall into the 8th decile. A review of the table indicates that
   high Need/Resource Index districts generally have lower property and
   income wealth than the State average. They generally spend (AOE and
   Total Expenditures per pupil) less than the State average and raise
   less per pupil in local tax revenue. High need districts tend to
   receive less STAR revenue per pupil than low need districts. They
   receive more Other State Revenue per pupil than low need districts. 19

   FOUR-YEAR CHANGES IN SCHOOL FINANCES 1995-96 to 1999-00 This section
   contains longitudinal information concerning total pupils, key
   expenditure categories, school district taxes and other revenues,
   actual valuation and personal income. Each of these items of
   information is presented by Total State, New York City and Rest of
   State. Percent changes for year-to-year increments, as well as over the
   four-year period, are shown also. Table 13 contains five pupil counts.
   Table 14 contains gross financial amounts, which are then presented on
   a per-pupil basis in Tables 15 and 16. In this fashion, trends can be
   reviewed; State totals are analyzed including and excluding New York
   City. Data in Tables 13 through 16 include major districts only. Over
   the four-year period, the Total Aidable Pupil Units (TAPU) for Expense,
   displayed in Table 13, have increased 6.1 percent in the State. The
   number of enrolled pupils has increased in each of the last four years.
   The changes in the definition of TAPU make year-to-year comparisons of
   TAPU with enrollment difficult unless the changes in definition and
   their impact are reviewed (See Glossary for changes in definition). For
   example, a significant change in the 1992-93 pupil counts was the
   legislated change in definition to exclude students with disabilities
   attending private and State operated schools. Yearly percentage
   increases in all pupil counts for New York City have been greater than
   in the Rest of State except for enrollment in 1997-98 and 1998-99,
   Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance in 1998-99 and all counts in
   1999-00. Total General and Special Aid Fund Expenditures shown in Table
   14 have increased every year for both Rest of State districts and New
   York City. In 1999-00, total expenditures increased 7.1 percent
   statewide. Over the four-year period, total expenditures increased 23.8
   percent. Approved operating expenditures over the four-year period
   increased 26.0 percent in New York City, and 17.2 percent in the Rest
   of State school districts. Statewide, approved operating expenditures
   increased 5.3 percent in 1999-00. Similar to total expenditures,
   instructional expenses increased in each year. In 1997-98, New York
   City's instructional expenses increased 11.3 percent over 1996-97 while
   over the four- year period they increased 30.4 percent. Statewide, debt
   service increased 14.5 percent for 1999-00, continuing strong increases
   in three of the last four years. New York City's debt service increases
   starting in 1991-92 are due, in large measure, to the creation of the
   New York City School Construction Authority. Over the past four years
   debt service for New York City and statewide increased 40.2 percent and
   35.8 percent, respectively. Total Revenue from State sources (including
   STAR Revenue starting in 1998-99) in 1995- 96, 1996-97, 1997-98,
   1998-99 and 1999-00 reflect reductions of $349 million, $390 million,
   $354 million, $335 million and $395 million respectively, due to
   transition adjustments. From 1995-96 to 1999-00, total State revenue
   increased by 35.6 percent for Rest of State districts and by 31.8
   percent for New York City. 21 Table 13 SELECTED PUPIL COUNTS USED IN

   2.2 913,860 6.5 10.6 23 During the 1995-96 to 1999-00 period, school
   district local tax and other revenues (excluding STAR starting in
   1998-99) for non-New York City districts increased 7.1 percent, a total
   increase of approximately $0.71 billion. Local tax and other revenues
   in New York City increased by 31.8 percent, $1.25 billion, over the
   same period. Property value and income data form the basis upon which
   most State Aid to school districts is distributed. School districts
   having increases in actual value per pupil or income per pupil in
   excess of the State average would receive less formula operating aid
   per pupil. Between 1986-87 and 1991-92, the yearly percent increases in
   actual value registered in double digits. This steep increase was due
   to a general rise in property values and was also due in part to steps
   taken by the NYS Office of Real Property Services to reduce the lag
   between the full value standard date and the assessment roll date that
   had been allowed to develop during the early 1980's. The lag was
   reduced incrementally from 54 months (in 1985) to 12 months (starting
   in 1993). The lag increased to 24 months for the 1996 actual value and
   dropped to 12 months for the 1997 actual value. Beginning with 1999
   equalization rates, the lag drops to 0 months. There is an additional
   lag between the assessment roll date and the use of valuation data for
   school aid. For example, the 1996 assessment roll data converted to
   actual value on the basis of a January 1994 equalization rate standard
   were used in the calculation of 1999-00 aid, a 5 year lag from the full
   value standard of the rate to the aid year (1994 to 1999-00). Income
   data is more current, with 1996 calendar year income used for 1999-00
   school aid. The 1996 legislation specified the use of 1994 actual value
   and income for 1997-98 aid in order to allow for the use of more final
   data for the State's budgeting purposes. This added one more year to
   the lag starting with 1997- 98 school aid. In 1999-00, actual value
   increased an average of 6.5 percent for the year, while personal income
   increased 8.2 percent. Over the four-year period, personal income
   increased by 31.5 percent for the State, while actual value increased
   by 10.6 percent. Table 15 displays per pupil (Combined Adjusted Average
   Daily Membership) averages of the first six data elements contained in
   Table 14. Total General and Special Aid Fund Expenditures per Pupil,
   Approved Operating Expenditures per Pupil and Instructional Expense per
   Pupil roughly parallel each other since 1995-96 with annual percentage
   increases in New York City slightly higher than those for the Rest of
   State (starting in 1997-98). Debt service per pupil increased in New
   York City in each year while, in the Rest of State, debt service
   decreased in 1996-97, but increased in 1995-96, 1997-98 and 1998-99.
   The percentage increase in total revenue from State sources (including
   STAR starting in 1998-99) per pupil for New York City outpaced the Rest
   of State in the first two years. On a statewide-basis, over the
   four-year period, total State revenues per pupil increased 29.4 percent
   while Total Expenditures per pupil increased 19.3 percent. Local tax
   and other revenues (excluding STAR starting in 1998-99) per pupil
   increased each year, except in Rest of State in 1998-99 and 1999-00.
   Over the four-year period, local tax and other revenues per pupil
   increased 9.9 percent. Table 16 also displays yearly per pupil averages
   based on the data elements contained in Table 14, but in this instance,
   by using pupil counts traditionally used for State Aid purposes.
   Personal income per TWPU increased by 24.8 percent over the four-year
   period. Since 1995-96, the percent changes for New York City and Rest
   of State generally reflect the percent changes in personal income.
   Except in 1995-96 and 1999-00, New York City's average income per TWPU
   24 less than the State average. In contrast, New York City's average
   actual value per TWPU was lower than the State average each year. New
   York City's average actual value per RWADA also was lower than the
   State average in each year. Over the four-year period, the State
   average actual value per TWPU and actual value per RWADA have increased
   4.9 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. The State average tax rate
   decreased 2.9 percent in 1999-00 due to a 5.1 percent decrease in Rest
   of State. Part of the reason is that STAR revenues are not counted as
   local tax and other revenues. The percent increases in Approved
   Operating Expense per TAPU for Expense generally follow the trend in
   Approved Operating Expense per CAADM shown in Table 15. Local tax and
   other revenues (excluding STAR starting in 1998-99) per TWPU increased
   9.6 percent in New York City in 1999-00 while Rest of State stayed
   flat. 25 Table 15 AVERAGE EXPENDITURES, STATE REVENUE, AND LOCAL TAX
