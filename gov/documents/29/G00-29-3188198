   Coastal Habitats

   For healthy coasts, we must preserve, conserve, and restore coastal
   habitats and their biodiversity.
   U.S. fishery stocks have been significantly affected by overfishing,
   but also by the loss and deterioration of coastal habitats, especially
   estuaries and wetlands. Landings of estuarine dependent fisheries are
   down, and the shellfishing industry is operating at historically low
   levels. Anadromous fish populations (e.g., salmon in the Pacific
   Northwest) have declined significally and the genetic diversity of many
   populations is very low, increasing the probability of disease and
   extinction. Loss of habitat and the subsequent impacts on fishery
   resources not only mean fewer jobs for the fishermen, processors and
   vendors, but also declines in recreational fisheries and their
   associated economic activity that is vital to coastal communities and
   their economies.

   Wetlands, estuaries, coral reefs, and other coastal habitats are
   essential resources for many other species as well. Migratory birds,
   marine mammals, sea turtles and some of the most diverse collections of
   species anywhere on the planet depend on healthy coastal habitats and
   good water quality for survival. These habitats have ecological and
   economic significance. Wetlands, for example, play significant roles in
   maintaining water quality, retarding erosion, retaining flood waters,
   filtering contaminants, and providing opportunities for tourism and
   recreation.

   Coral reefs, like tropical forests, are biologically diverse and a
   potentially important source of new biochemical products. Coral reefs
   are also very fragile and thus extremely sensitive and susceptible to
   physical destruction and environmental stress such as water pollution,
   siltation, and increased water temperature. Human and natural stresses
   have already greatly affected the health of coral reef systems
   worldwide, making them one of the top stewardship priorities in the
   U.S., including the U.S. territories and commonwealths.
