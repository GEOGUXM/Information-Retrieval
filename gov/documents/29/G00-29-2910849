   The study unit comprises the Nueces, San Antonio, and Guadalupe River
   Basins in Texas.  The 19961998 assessment involved only the upper parts
   of the basins.  The upper parts of the basins contain the watersheds of
   streams that recharge the Edwards aquifer, and the Edwards and Trinity
   aquifers, which were the primary focus of the assessment.
