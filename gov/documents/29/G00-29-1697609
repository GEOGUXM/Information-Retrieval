   moisture conditions, snow conditions, water supply outlooks,
   meteorological outlooks.

    Flash Flood - Flash floods can strike any time and any place with
   little or no warning. In mountainous or flat terrain, distant rain may
   be channeled into gullies and ravines, turning a quiet streamside
   campsite or wash into a rampaging torrent in minutes.

    North Central River Forecast Center Flash Flood Guidance -
   Terminology - Flash Flood Watch - Indicates that flash flooding is a
   possibility in or close to the watch area. Those in the affected area
   are urged to be ready to take action if a flash flood warning is issued
   or flooding is observed.

   deadliest in the United States today is flooding and flash flooding.
   Over the past 30 years, flood waters have claimed an annual toll of
   nearly 140 lives in this country.

    National Weather Service Low-Water Crossing Flood Safety Video - The
   NWS, as a public service, provides a video (at nominal cost) to
   disseminate motorist safety information. The video points out the

   Precipitation In The Nation. Ever wonder how the National Weather
   Service forecasts precipitation-related events across the country? The
   Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) interagency disaster survey
   team led by NOAA found that complex river characteristics and
   limitations in current National Weather Service flood forecast methods
   were the primary cause of changes in forecasts of the flood crest at
   Grand Forks, N.D.,
