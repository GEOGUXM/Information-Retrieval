   pilot, as authorized by section 403 of Public Law 103-546, to be
   available as provided in such section for expenses and equipment
   necessary for the maintenance and operation of such financial and

   Provided further, That such fund shall be reimbursed or credited with
   the payments, including advanced payments, from applicable

   performed, at rates which will recover all expenses of operation,
   including accrued leave, depreciation of fund plan and equipment,
   amortization of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) software and systems,
   and an amount necessary to maintain a reasonable operating reserve, as
   determined by the Secretary: Provided further, That such fund shall
   provide services on a competitive basis: Provided further, That an
   amount not to exceed 4 percent of the total annual income to such fund
   may be retained in the fund for fiscal year 1997 and each fiscal year
   thereafter, to remain available until expended, to be used for the
   acquisition of capital equipment and for the improvement and
   implementation of Treasury financial management, ADP, and other support
   systems: Provided further, That no later than 30 days after the end of
   each fiscal year, amounts in excess of this reserve limitation shall be
   deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury: Provided further,
   That such franchise fund pilot shall terminate pursuant to section
   403(f) of Public Law 103-356.
