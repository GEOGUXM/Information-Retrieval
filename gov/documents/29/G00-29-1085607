                            The French Angelfish

   [frenbig.jpg]


   Angelfish like this one are often considered the best looking fish to
   inhabit the reefs of the Caribbean, and the world.  The juvenile French
   angelfish is solid black with golden bars, and a rounded tail with
   golden fringe.  However, the adult has no bars, but instead each of the
   scales on its body are fringed at the very edges with gold.  The
   picture to the right, taken at Stetson Bank, is relatively unusual in
   that the fish is in the process of transforming from juvenile markings
   to adult markings.  Thus, the fish has golden bars AS WELL AS golden
   edged scales.  Makes for one pretty fish, doesn't it?
