   PUBLIC WORKS IN THE PUBLIC EYE, Wednesday, June 6, 2001
   Environmental Crimes Unit Says "If You Pollute, We Will Prosecute!"
   MPD/DPW Environmental Crimes Unit Makes Major Bust
   Investigators Anita Chavis (DPW) and Paul Kurgen (MPD), Environmental
   Crimes Unit/Team II, made four arrests and confiscated two vehicles
   during last week's surveillance of the 1100 block of Okie Street, NE,
   the site of repeated incidents of late-night illegal dumping. Following
   is a log of Chavis and Kurgen's behind-the-scenes victory, a win that
   we all can share.
   On Wednesday, May 30, the Investigators canvassed the Okie Street
   location and saw the dumpsite first-hand. After interviewing several
   local business owners, the team devised a plan to catch the criminals
   responsible for dumping entire truckloads of debris in the quiet
   cul-de-sac. The business owners, frustrated by this persistent problem,
   readily gave permission for Chavis and Kurgen to use their rooftops for
   covert surveillance, if necessary.
   On Thursday, May 31, Operation OKIE-DOKE swung into action. Unfavorable
   weather conditions kept the team on the ground that night. They took
   their places in an unmarked vehicle nearby and waited, their video
   camera at the ready. At approximately 9 PM, the dumpers arrived in a
   pick-up truck loaded down with all manner of solid waste. The two
   suspects were caught on tape illegally loading the bulky trash into a
   commercial dumpster. Team II moved in, arrested the suspects and
   impounded their vehicle. While Investigators Chavis and Kurgen were
   processing the two arrests at the Fifth Police District office, another
   culprit hit the same location, strewing a substantial amount of trash
   all over the middle of the street. The Investigators were then sure
   they could catch an even bigger fish if they kept Okie Street under
   surveillance.
   Friday night's rainy stake out yielded no incident of dumping and no
   arrests. Determined, Chavis and Kurgen went back to the scene on
   Saturday evening, June 2. At 10:58 PM, a blue pick-up truck, piled high
   with trash and debris was spotted turning onto Okie St. Investigator
   Chavis began videotaping the two male suspects as they threw furniture,
   steel pipes and appliances off their truck - and onto public space. The
   Investigators blocked the path of the truck as it tried to leave and
   both men were arrested and taken into custody.
   This week, both suspects were charged with Felony Illegal Dumping,
   which carries jail time. Additionally, one of the suspects was charged
   with violating probation stemming from a previous indictment of
   Involuntary Manslaughter.
   This case is closed, but the MPD/DPW Environmental Crimes Unit
   Investigators will continue their often dangerous work to keep our city
   streets from becoming grimy dumping grounds. DPW Director, Leslie
   Hotaling, said, "The message to all would-be offenders is clear: If you
   dump in the District, you WILL get caught."
