   Welcome to Washington!

   *** White House, FBI, Bureau of Printing and Engraving (BEP), State
   Department, and Pentagon Tours Suspended Until Further Notice ***

   * Online Tour Request Form *

   Jefferson Memorial in Cherry Blossom Season My office is happy to help
   arrange Congressional tours for the White House, Federal Bureau of
   Investigation, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, State Department,
   Kennedy Center, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, and the Capitol.
   To request tours, please complete my online tour request form.  There
   is no admission charge for most of the monuments and museums, but come
   prepared for a lot of walking.

   Feel free to stop by my office and pick up passes to the House and
   Senate galleries to observe debate on the floor of Congress.  Children
   must be six years old to be admitted to the Senate gallery.  In the
   House, children under 10 are allowed in the gallery if accompanied by
   an adult.  Both galleries are usually open between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30
   p.m.

   Parking in Washington is very limited.  Taxis, buses, and the MetroRail
   subway are available every day for transportation to Capitol Hill and
   the various attractions.  The Metro is a safe and affordable way to get
   around town.  The closest Metro stop to the Capitol is "Capitol South."

   I hope you find this information helpful as you chart your tour of our
   nation's Capital.  Please remember, White House tickets are extremely
   limited, particularly in the spring and summer months.  Please contact
   me as soon as your trip is planned. In addition to the guided
   Congressional tours that are offered, the White House also provides
   self-guided public walk-through tours that allow visitors to move from
   room to room at their own pace. A U.S. Secret Service/Uniformed
   Division Tour Officer is stationed in each room to answer questions.
