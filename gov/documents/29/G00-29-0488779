                          IFQ Cost Recovery Program
    The 2001 Cost Recovery percentage has been set at 2.0 percent of the
    ex-vessel value of IFQ harvests. Fee Summaries (billings) were mailed
       to IFQ permit holders on December 18, 2001, as premised on the
       "standard" IFQ prices compiled from information provided by IFQ
       Registered Buyers. Payments are due by January 31, 2002. RAM is
   offering several payments options this year; an IFQ permit holder may:
     * Use a credit card and pay on-line.
     * Send in a check or money order made payable to NMFS
     * Use a Credit card by calling RAM or by filling out the appropriate
       parts of the Fee Submission form and sending it to RAM

    If a permit holder disagrees with the amount due as displayed on the
    Fee Summary, and wishes to pay the 2.0 percent fee premised on actual
   receipts from the sale of IFQ halibut or sablefish, the Fee Submission
     Form must be completed and returned to RAM. Remember that a permit
   holder who challenges RAM's calculation of the amount due must be ready
    to provide receipts and other information that shows actual receipts
                           from the sale of fish.
    At the December 2001 meeting of the North Pacific Fishery Management
    Council, RAM prepared a PowerPoint presentation on the Cost Recovery
   Program. The presentation summarized the completion of the 2001 season,
          and explained how the 2002 fee percentage was calculated.

   Halibut Charter IFQs
   The North Pacific Fishery Management Council approved an individual
   fishing quota (IFQ) program for the halibut charter fleet in Southeast
   and Southcentral Alaska on April 14, 2001. This decision culminated
   eight years of debate and over 8,000 comments on managing the charter
   halibut fishery. The IFQ program would replace the guideline harvest
   level (GHL) program approved by the Council in February 2000, and
   currently under Secretarial review. No changes were made to the 2-fish
   daily bag limit or 2-day possession limit for charter anglers. The
   charter IFQ program could be implemented as early as 2003 if adopted by
   the Secretary of Commerce. For more information on the halibut charter
   IFQ program, see the North Pacific Fishery Management Council website.

   IFQ Permit
   This permit authorizes participation in fixed-gear harvests of Pacific
   halibut off Alaska, and most sablefish fisheries off Alaska. The
   permits are not specific to vessels. Permits are issued annually, at no
   charge, to persons holding fishable Pacific halibut and sablefish Quota
   Share (QS); or to those who are recipients of IFQ-only transfers from
   QS holders. Authorized pounds for annual IFQ permits are determined by
   the number of QS units held, the total number of QS units in the "pool"
   for a species and area, and the total amount of halibut or sablefish
   allocated for IFQ fisheries in a particular year. IFQ permits are
   authorized at 50 CFR Part 679.4(d).

   Quota Share (QS) Permit
   QS was initially issued to persons who owned or leased vessels that
   made legal commercial fixed-gear landings of Pacific halibut or
   sablefish during 1988-1990 off Alaska. QS is transferable to other
   initial issuees or to those who have become transferable eligible on
   NMFS' approval of an Application for Transfer Eligibility Certificate.
   Once issued to a person (at no charge), QS is held by that person until
   it is transferred, suspended, or revoked. QS permits are authorized at
   50 CFR Part 679.4(d).

   IFQ/CDQ Halibut Landing Card
   This card is required by individuals who are harvesting IFQ fish or CDQ
   halibut. IFQ cards are issued annually, at no cost, or as needed (also
   at no cost) following QS or IFQ transfers. Cards are issued to
   individuals who are IFQ permit holders or (if allowed and approved) to
   their hired masters. Authorized persons and their cards must be on the
   vessels while IFQ or CDQ halibut fishing and landings are conducted.
   CDQ cards are issued to individuals at the request of the CDQ plan
   managers. IFQ and CDQ cards are imprinted with coded magnetic
   information for use with automated transaction terminals as part of an
   electronic reporting system. These cards are authorized at 50 CFR Parts
   679.4(d) and (e), respectively.

   State of Alaska Statistical Area Charts
   A new series of ten Alaska Department of Fish and Game statistical area
   charts became effective on January 1, 2001. In addition to their use on
   State groundfish and shellfish fish tickets (other than shellfish in SE
   Alaska), these statistical areas are used in required landing reports
   submitted to NMFS for IFQ halibut and sablefish, and for CDQ halibut.
   For more information on these charts, call the Alaska Department of
   Fish and Game Commercial Fisheries at (907) 465-6147.

   permit is also required of any person who harvests IFQ halibut or
   sablefish or CDQ halibut and transfers such fish: in a dockside sale;
   outside of an IFQ regulatory area; or outside of the State of Alaska.
