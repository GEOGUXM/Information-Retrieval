      The Nonproliferation and National Security Institute (NNSI) is a
   pioneer in distance learning. NNSI first introduced multimedia delivery
       to the Department of Energy and local, state, and international
    communities in 1994. The Department of Energy's changing needs meant
    that NNSI needed to deliver training on demand, rather than according
     to an arbitrary schedule of availability. After extensive study of
    available technology and interaction with other government agencies,
    academia, and private industry, NNSI launched its multimedia distance
     learning initiative for developing and delivering training. NNSI's
     multimedia distance learning courses include those offered through
    print and electronic media, computer-based training (CBT), real-time
       interactive Web-based training (WBT), instructional television
     broadcasts (ITV), video and audio cassettes with workbooks, desktop
      computer audio/video systems for one-on-one mentoring, and video
        teleconferencing for informing or instructing small groups.
