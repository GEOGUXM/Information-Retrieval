                         EML's Quality Assessment Program


   Chemist working with bottles and beakers in laboratory
                         Chemistry is the backbone of EML.

   The Environmental Measurements Laboratory administers the Department of
   Energy's Quality Assessment Program for environmental radiological
   analysis in support of the National Analytical Management Program of
   the Office of Environmental Management.

   The EML QAP is an external, independent, performance evaluation program
   designed to test the quality of environmental radiological measurements
   reported by DOE contractor and subcontractor laboratories. The program
   provides DOE with complex-wide comparability of environmental
   radiological analyses.

   The Gamma Spectrometry Data Evaluation Program provides DOE with an
   assessment of the capabilities of participating laboratories to perform
   gamma-ray spectra analysis required for environmental management
   projects and site characterizations.
