                                    Forms

   Click on any of the following links to download these forms. You can
   then view them, save them on your computer, fill them out in your word
   processor and print them, or print blank forms to be filled out later.
   To preserve the formatting of the RTF forms, you must use a Mac or PC
   on which MS-Word v.5.1 or later is installed.

     Most forms are available in Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format).
     Check the INS forms page for more forms and information; also try
     Immigration Software for hard-to-find forms (though IRSO cannot
     vouch for its contents).

     Request for Non-U.S. Citizen or Non-U.S. Permanent Resident: for
     unclassified visit or assignment. If a guest is from a "sensitive
     country" (see list), do not initiate guest processing. Instead,
     visit the Guest Processing web page for instructions, or contact Sue
     Bowen (ssbowen@lbl.gov, x6395).

       If you are entering the U.S. as a visiting researcher or employee
       who will receive compensation from Lawrence Berkeley National
       Laboratory, you must visit a U.S Embassy or Consulate outside the
       U.S. to obtain a U.S.Visa Stamp in your passport before your
       departure. The Visa Waiver Program has restrictions -- the bearer
       (WT, waiver for tourism, or WB, waiver for business) may not
       receive any salary; the status may not be extended; and the status
       may not be changed within the U.S. to any other immigration
       classification.
