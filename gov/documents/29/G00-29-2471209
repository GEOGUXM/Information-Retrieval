   Northern District of CaliforniaFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   Filing new cases & other documents

   Question:
   What can I do to expedite filing of papers in the Clerk's Office?

   Answer:
   FILING GUIDELINES
   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
   NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
   IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL RULES, THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN
   PROVIDED TO ENSURE THAT THE FILING PROCESS IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EASE
   AND ACCURACY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR ASSISTANCE, PLEASE CALL THE
   CLERK'S OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO, SAN JOSE,OR OAKLAND.
   1. Documents are to be filed in the Clerk's Office at the location of
   the chambers of the judge to whom the action has been assigned.
   2. The Clerk's Office will retain the original plus one copy of most
   documents submitted. We will conform as many copies as you bring for
   your use. Related cases require an extra copy for each related action
   designated.
   3. The copy retained goes directly to the assigned judge. Courtesy
   copies, or instructions for couriers to deliver a copy directly to
   chambers are inappropriate, unless you have been instructed to do so by
   court order.
   4. In order to facilitate the file stamping process, each original
   document should be submitted on top of its copies. In other words,
   group like documents together--as opposed to a set of originals and
   separate sets of copies.
   5. The case number must indicate whether it is a civil or criminal
   matter by the inclusion of C or CR at the beginning of the number.
   Miscellaneous and foreign judgment matters should also be indicated
   with initials MISC or FJ at the end of the case number.
   6. The case number must include the initials of the judge and/or
   magistrate judge followed by the letters designating the case
   Arbitration (ARB), Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE) or Mediation
   (MED)--if assigned to one of those Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
   programs.
   7. The document caption should include the appropriate judge or
   magistrate judge involved in a particular matter or before whom an
   appearance is being made. This is especially important when submitting
   Settlement Conference Statements.
   8. Documents are to be stapled or Acco-fastened at the top. Backings,
   bindings and covers are not required. Two holes punched at the top of
   the original document will facilitate processing.
   9. Appropriately sized, stamped, self-addressed return envelopes are to
   be included with proposed orders or when filing documents by mail.
   10. Proofs of service should be attached to the back of documents. If
   submitted separately, you must attach a pleading page to the front of
   the document showing case number and case caption.
   11. There are no filing fees once a case has been opened. A list of
   other fees is available.
   12. New cases must be accompanied by a completed and signed Civil Cover
   Sheet, the filing fee or fee waiver request form and an original plus
   two copies of the complaint and any other documents. For Intellectual
   Property cases, please provide an original plus three copies of the
   complaint. Please present new cases for filing before 3:30 p.m., as
   they take a considerable amount of time to process.
   13. Copies of forms may be obtained at no charge. They may be picked up
   in person from the Clerk's Office forms cabinet or with a written
   request accompanied by an appropriate sized, stamped, self-addressed
   envelope for return. In addition, copies of the Local Rules may be
   obtained, free of charge, in the Clerk's Office or by sending a written
   request, along with a self-addressed, 10" x 14" return envelope,
   stamped with $3.00 postage to: Clerk, U.S. District Court, 450 Golden
   Gate Avenue, 16th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94102.

   containing information regarding files at the Federal Records Center
   (FRC) are located in the reception area of the Clerk's Office. Written
   instructions are posted by the terminals. Outside of the Clerk's
   Office, electronic access to dockets is available through PACER.
   15. A file viewing room is located adjacent to the reception area.
   Files may be viewed in this area after signing the log sheet and
   presenting identification. Files are to be returned by 3:45 p.m.. Under
   no circumstances are files to be removed from the viewing room.
   16. The Clerk's Office can only accept payment by exact change or check
   made payable to Clerk, U.S. District Court. No change can be made for
   fees or the public copy machine.
   17. Pay copy machines are located in the file viewing room for public
   use, at twenty cents ($.20) per page. Copy services are also available
   for larger copy requests. Arrangements may be made to bring in a
   personal copier by calling the Clerk's Office in advance.
