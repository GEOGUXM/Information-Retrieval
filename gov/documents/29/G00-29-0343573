   Description of research projects:

   Characterization of the expression, function, and activity of a peach
   defensin gene and its protein product. Similar proteins have been
   reported to have antifungal properties.

   Construction of plasmids containing genes which encode antimicrobial
   peptides or proteins to augment the activity of naturally-occurring
   biocontrol organisms.

   Construction of plasmids containing various gene promotor elements
   which would "drive" the expression of other genes of interest.
