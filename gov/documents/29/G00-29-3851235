                        Workplace Violence Prevention

   It is USDA's policy that every customer and employee be treated fairly
   and equitably, with dignity and respect. This policy applies not only
   to how you as an employee should act, but also how you deserve to be
   treated by others. There is no room or tolerance for harassing,
   threatening, or violent behavior at USDA.
