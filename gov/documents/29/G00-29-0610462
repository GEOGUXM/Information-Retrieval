   The MODIS Land team is developing a small number of higher-order data
   products to serve the global change research community. The products
   were selected as improvements to existing land products or as priority
   new products. The algorithms for these products have been peer-reviewed
   and are described in detail by the algorithm technical background
   documents.

   Radiation Budget Variables

     * Surface Reflectance/Atmospheric Correction Algorithm Products
       The surface reflectance product is the input for product generation
       for several land products: Vegetation Indices (VIs), BRDF, thermal
       anomaly, snow/ice, and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active
       Radiation/Leaf Area Index (FPAR/LAI).
     * Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Emissivity
       Land surface temperature is a good indicator of both the energy
       balance at the Earthâ€™s surface and the greenhouse effect because it
       is one of the key parameters in the physics of the land-surface
       processes. It is required for a wide variety of climate,
       hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical studies.
     * Snow and Ice Cover
       Snow cover, with its high albedo, is a key parameter of the global
       energy balance, reflecting much of the incident solar radiation
       back to space.
     * BRDF and Albedo
       The reflectance of the surface of the Earth depends on the
       direction of viewing and solar illumination because of the optical
       and structural properties of the surface elements. The
       bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) describes
       this dependence and may be used to normalize observed reflectances
       to a standard view and illumination geometry. It may also be
       interpreted in terms of surface properties. The albedo is closely
       related to the average surface reflectance over all angles as a
       function of solar angle. It is a key parameter controlling the
       global radiative budget.

   Ecosystem Variables

     * Vegetation Indices
       Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation
       conditions. The VIs are used as input in the land cover and land
       cover change products. They also play an important role in the
       derivation of the FPAR, LAI, and thermal products.
     * Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fractional Photosynthetically Active
       Radiation (FPAR)
       LAI defines an important structural property of a plant canopy
       which is the one-sided leaf area per unit ground area. FPAR
       measures the proportion of available radiation in the
       photosynthetically active wavelengths (400 to 700 nm) that a canopy
       absorbs.
     * Vegetation Production, Net Primary Productivity (NPP)
       This product provides an accurate measure of terrestrial vegetation
       growth and production activity.
     * Evapotranspiration & Surface Resistance
       These two parameters are essential to global modeling of climate,
       water balance and gas traces. In addition, they are required in
       estimating photosynthesis, respiration, and net primary production.

   Land Cover Characteristics

     * Fire and Thermal Anomolies
       Fire is an important ecosystem process and source of trace gas
       emissions. This product identifies the location and timing of
       fires. The product includes fire occurrence (day/night), fire
       location, the logical criteria used for the fire selection and an
       energy calculation for each fire. Experimental products are being
       developed for burned area estimation and for use with global
       models. An experimental product providing near-real time alerts of
       volcano and fire activity is being developed in collaboration
       between the MODIS team and the University of Hawaii.
     * Land Cover
       This product is used for biophysical and biogeochemical
       parameterization for input to global and regional scale models of
       climate, hydrologic processes, and biogeochemical cycling.
     * Vegetative Cover Conversion
       This product uses the 250m Surface Reflectance products to detect
       and label changes in land cover.
     * Vegetation Continuous Fields
       This post-launch product will produce 1km global fields of percent
       cover for basic land cover types.
     * At-Launch Land Cover
       This product provides two 1km land cover products derived from EOS
       heritage instruments. It will be used to parameterize algorithms in
       the early post-launch period.
