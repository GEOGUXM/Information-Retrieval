                             MkIV Interferometer

   The JPL MkIV interferometer is a high resolution Fourier Transform
   Infra-Red (FTIR) spectrometer, designed to remotely sense the
   atmospheric composition. It is the latest in a series of solar
   absorption FTIR spectrometers which have been developed at JPL during
   the past 20 years. Others include the ATMOS instrument which has flown
   four times on the Space Shuttle.

   The MkIV instrument made ground-based observations from McMurdo,
   Antarctica, in September and October 1986, and flew on board the NASA
   DC-8 aircraft for the 1987 Antarctic polar campaign (AAOE ) and the
   Arctic polar campaigns of 1987 (AASE ) and 1992 (AASEII ).
   Additionally, it has performed 13 flights from high altitude research
   balloons since 1989.

   The MkIV Interferometer operates in solar absorption mode, meaning that
   direct sunlight is spectrally analyzed and the amount of various gases
   at different heights in the Earth's atmosphere is derived from the
   shapes and depths of their absorption lines. The entire 650-5650 cm^-1
   spectral region is observed simultaneously at 0.01 cm^-1 resolution.
   Over this wide interval over 30 different gases have spectral
   signatures which can be identified, including H[2]O, CO[2], O[3],
   N[2]O, CO, CH[4], N[2], O[2], NO, NO[2], HNO[3], HNO[4], N[2]O[5],
   ClNO[3], H[2]O[2], H[2]CO, HOCl, HCl, HF, SF[6], COF[2], CF[4],
   CH[3]Cl, CHFCl[2], CFCl[3], CF[2]Cl[2], CCl[4], OCS, HCN, C[2]H[2],
   C[2]H[6] and many isotopic variants (e.g. HDO, CH[3]D). Measured
   abundances of these gases are used to test computer models of
   atmospheric transport and chemistry.

   Instrument.
   - High resolution FTIR spectrometer (very similar to ATMOS).
   - Weight = 400 kg, Size = 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 m, Power = 300 W.
   Field Deployments.
   - Ground-based observations from numerous locations including McMurdo,
   Antarctica, in 1986.
   - NASA DC-8 aircraft polar campaigns in 1987, 1989 and 1992.
   - 13 high altitude balloon flights since 1989.
   Observation Mode.
   - Measures in solar absorption mode (using direct sunlight).
   - Vertical profiles during sunset, sunrise, and balloon ascent &
   descent.
   - Entire 650-5650 cm^-1 spectral region is observed simultaneously.
   Advantages.
   - Dual detectors provide broad, simultaneous spectral coverage (HgCdTe:
   650-1850; InSb: 1850-5650 cm-1.
   - All gases are measured simultaneously in the same airmass.
   - Temperature-insensitive CO[2] provides accurate pointing knowledge,
   hence accurate vmr profiles.
   - Temperature-sensitive CO[2] lines provide accurate temperature
   information.
   - Simultaneity of gas profiles allows more stringent model comparisons.
   Objectives.
   - Test computer models of atmospheric transport and chemistry.
   - Perform correlative measurements for other experiments (e.g. UARS).
   - Monitor the atmospheric composition (early detection of changes).
