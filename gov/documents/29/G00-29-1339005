   OBJECTIVES
   [USEMAP:img7.gif]

   Our challenge is to provide superior land surface boundary data. We are
   proceeding with simulation and assimilation projects that occur online
   (interactive with the global atmospheric data assimilation system) and
   offline (one way forcing of the land surface).
   We are also committed to contributing to the scientific community. To
   that end we are actively involved with several broad projects,
   including Land Data Assimilation Systems (LDAS), Common Land Model
   (CLM), and GEWEX American Prediction Project.
   Development:
     * Assimilation of land assimilation techniques (offline and online)
       for temperature, snow and soil water
     * Forcing data for offline land simulations using merged observations
       and reanalyses
     * The Common Land Model (Offline in the LDAS environment and online
       in the next generation NASA / NCAR data assimilation system)

   Processes:
     * Better understand the interaction between the land and atmosphere,
       especially regarding precipitation
     * Investigate the impact of water vapor assimilation on the coupled
       hydro-meteorology


   Provide the highest quality land surface boundary conditions for the
                   NASA / DAO Data Assimilation Systems
