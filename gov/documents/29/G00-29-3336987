     Travel Instructions for the 4th Annual IRP Scientific Retreat: All
   people attending the retreat need to fill out an ADB form (travel.pdf)
    and submit it to the person in his/her lab or branch responsible for
                                   travel.

     1. Print out the ADB form (travel.pdf) and fill in all bold fields.

     2. Give completed ADB form to the person in your lab/branch
     responsible for travel. The form will be forwarded to the
     Administrative Office for approval.

     3. After processing, the original form will be returned to you and
     you are to carry it (or at least a copy of it) with you while
     traveling.

     4. Upon return, if you drove your personal vehicle (POV) please
     inform the person who handles travel in their lab/branch of the
     roundtrip mileage from NIH to Airlie Center and back.
