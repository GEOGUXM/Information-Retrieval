   Required Management Training is a directive from the Senior Executive
   Team that implements a new training plan for all group-level managers.
   It includes five required courses (32 hours of classroom instruction)
   and one suggested course (an additional 8 hours).

   It is required that the modules be completed as back-to-back courses
   over a four-day period, unless you have already completed some of the
   requirements. These modules will be offered twice each month starting
   in January, 2002.
