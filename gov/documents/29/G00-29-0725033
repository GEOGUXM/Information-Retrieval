   Tornadoes Banner

     Tornado Collage, Jward,99 Tornadoes are one of nature's most violent
     storms. In an average year, about 1,000 tornadoes are reported
     across the United States, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500
     injuries. A tornado is a violently rotating column of air extending
     from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are
     capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 mph or
     more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles
     long.

     Tornadoes come in all shapes and sizes and can occur anywhere in the
     U.S at any time of the year. In the southern states, peak tornado
     season is March through May, while peak months in the northern
     states are during the summer.
