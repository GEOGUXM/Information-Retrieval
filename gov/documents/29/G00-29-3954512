          Red Light Photo Audit Recommends Changes and Expansion Program

      SAN DIEGO - An independent audit recommends that the City of San
      Diego's Red Light Photo Enforcement Program be maintained at the
      current 19 locations and be expanded to additional intersections. And
      it finds that "the City should be confident that all citations issued
      to date under the photo enforcement program have been properly issued."

      The just completed report  a volume of more than 100 pages 
      recommends several changes before resuming the program, which was shut
      down in June so the audit could evaluate how the program was being
      operated. The review of the system was conducted by PB Farradyne, a
      Division of Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc. PB Farradyne was
      hired in November and the audit was received by the Police Department
      last week. Chief David Bejarano called for the audit after department
      personnel discovered discrepancies in the internal settings of three of
      the red light photo enforcement intersections.

      The report found that there was a reduction of 20-24% in red light
      violations at intersections where the cameras had been operational for
      six months. It also found "significant reductions in the number of
      collisions attributable to red light running at those intersections."

      However, the overall accident rate at photo-enforced intersections
      increased by 3%, the result of more rear end collisions after the
      cameras were installed. The audit also found that the yellow light
      times were lower than the city standard at two intersections: West
      Harbor Drive and 32nd Street (4.5 seconds vs. 4.7 seconds) and at Black
      Mountain Road and Gemini (3.8 seconds vs. 4.2 seconds). In addition,
      the audit found that yellow light times at 10 of the 19 intersections,
      while meeting City standards, national guidelines and California law,
      are 1/10 of a second lower than those called for in the CalTrans
      traffic manual. As of January 1, 2002, a new law requires that all
      yellow light times at photo enforced intersections comply with the
      CalTrans traffic manual at a minimum.
      PB Farradyne recommends several changes in the system:
       1. Move the camera activation loops behind the limit lines. Currently,
          a mathematical calculation is done to determine how far the vehicle
          was behind the limit line when the light turned red. Moving the
          loops behind the limit line will negate the need for the
          mathematical calculation.
       2. Add an additional camera that would photograph the violator behind
          the limit line while the light is red. The front view camera would
          photograph the violator in the intersection  an indisputable
          violation. Additionally, the rear view camera would capture the
          rear license plate, allowing identification of violators who remove
          their front license plates.
       3. Add additional advanced warning signs to alert drivers that they
          are approaching a photo-enforced intersection.
       4. Create a traffic safety partnership coordinating committee,
          consisting of representatives of the Police Department, Traffic
          Engineering, Public Works, traffic courts, the City Attorney's
          Office, selected community groups, and outside agencies (such as
          CalTrans and the Auto Club) that are concerned with traffic safety.
          The committee would review data on violations and citations issued,
          discuss trends and determine if any changes are needed.

      A preliminary copy of the audit was received by the department last
      week, but PB Farradyne made some changes to the document; the revised
      report was received Jan. 23. Chief Bejarano said the department will be
      working with the city's traffic engineers to conduct a complete
      analysis of the audit. "I continue to believe that this is a viable
      program to enhance traffic safety in San Diego," said Bejarano. "The
      recommended modifications will further reduce injury accidents at the
      photo enforced intersections. We will present the findings to the City
      Council, which then will decide the future of the program."

      The City began its Red Light Photo Enforcement Program on August 1,
      1998, starting with three intersections and adding 16 more over the
      next 21 months. The original contract was with U.S. Public
      Technologies, Inc. Later in 1998, the Lockheed Martin Information
      Management Services (IMS) Division acquired U.S. Public Technologies
      and its contract. In October of 2001, IMS was acquired by Automated
      Computer Services (ACS).

      Red light violations are photographed only after the traffic signal has
      changed to red. The violations are recorded on a 35 mm film cassette
      and on memory cards. The film is developed and then is transferred to
      high-resolution digital images for further processing and storage. Each
      of the recorded violations is reviewed by trained technicians to verify
      that a violation was recorded, that there is a clear view of the
      motorist's face, and that the license plate number can be clearly
      determined. For violations that meet these requirements, a citation is
      issued by a San Diego police officer.

      Before the system was shut down for the audit, 83,931 citations were
      issued to motorists. This represents 43% of the actual violations that
      occurred at photo-enforced intersections (the remaining 57% of
      violations did not result in citations because they failed to meet all
      of the requirements mentioned above).

      The entire report is available on the Police Department's Web page:
