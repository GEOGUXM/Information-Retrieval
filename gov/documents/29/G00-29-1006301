   The goal of our research is to develop experimental, theoretical and
   computational procedures to combine anatomical MRI, functional MRI, and
   MEG into an integrated structural/functional imaging technique that
   provides spatial and temporal resolution superior to any available
   imaging technique.

    Neural electromagnetic measurements (in particular MEG and EEG)
   provide a number of advantages for the noninvasive characterization of
   neural function.  These techniques measure direct physical correlates
   of the currents associated with neural activation, and provide temporal
   resolution adequate for the study of neural population responses.
   However, the general computational problem of source localization from
   such surface measurements is ill-posed and ambiguous:  multiple current
   configurations can account for any given set of surface measurements.
   By employing models of neuronal current configurations that limit the
   space of possible inverse solutions it is possible to obtain useful
   source reconstructions.  The reliability and accuracy of such
   techniques can be significantly enhanced and by employing external
   information from alternative imaging modalities such as anatomical and
   functional MRI, however the use of rigid constraints based on such data
   may introduce errors under some circumstances.

   We have developed a probabilistic Bayesian framework for neural source
   localization that effectively deals with the ambiguity of the neural
   electromagnetic inverse problem, while providing a powerful method for
   integrated analyses incorporating multiple disparate sources of data.
   This framework provides a useful and general method for describing
   extended neural sources that can exploit probabilistic maps of
   functional architecture.  This might serve as a useful construct for
   the development of database schemes that incorporate probabilistic
   descriptions of neural temporal response.

   Aims of future work include:

   Continued development of the theoretical framework and computational
   methods for integrated analysis of multi-modality image data:  Bayesian
   probabilistic analyses hold promise for useful solutions to the MEG
   /EEG inverse problem, and for integration of disparate forms of image
   data.  Probabilistic constraints on source location and spatial extent
   will be developed, based on functional neuroimaging data (fMRI or PET)
   or drawn from databases.  A second area of work will be development and
   evaluation of detailed finite difference forward models based on MRI
   techniques that produce volumetric estimates of tissue conductivity,
   allowing assessment of the effect of anisotropy and inhomogeneity of
   brain conductivity on magnetic field and electric potential
   distributions.

   Enhanced experimental and analytical methods for functional
   neuroimaging:  Event related fMRI can employ the same experimental
   designs routinely used for studies with MEG and EEG.  Extensions to
   visual stimulus generation, timing capability and analysis tools will
   be implemented to conduct such experiments.  Relevant physiological
   data (cardiac cycle, respiratory cycle, blood pressure and blood
   oxygenation) will be collected to allow assessment of the roles of
   these variables in modulating the fMRI BOLD response and to correct for
   such effects.  Investigation and development of an MR technique for
   movement monitoring and correction will continue.

   Computational tool development:  A primary goal of proposed work is to
   build a consolidated package for multimodality functional neuroimaging
   based on computational modules developed in our laboratory, including
   MRIVIEW (a tool for structure/function correlation and MRI volume
   processing) and MEGAN (a tool for the analysis of neural
   electromagnetic (NEM) data).  The consolidated package include a series
   of electromagnetic forward calculations of increasing anatomical
   realism, and will provide an extensive (and extendible) suite of
   inverse procedures with proven utility and merit. A public domain
   version of this package will be produced,  however, avenues for
   commercial development and continuing support of the software will also
   be pursued.
