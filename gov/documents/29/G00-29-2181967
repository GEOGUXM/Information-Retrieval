                               Oxygen Systems

     White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) specializes in the study of oxygen
     compatibility in space, aircraft, medical, and industrial
     applications. We investigate the effects of increased oxygen
     concentration on the ignition and burning of materials and
     components used in these applications.

     When high-pressure oxygen is present in an application, there are
     fire hazards that must be assessed and mitigated to ensure personnel
     and system safety. Fires have occurred in space applications, such
     as in the Mir Space Station fire, as well as in the following
     environments:
     * Aircraft Life Support
     * Medical Applications
     * Aerospace Applications
     * Construction Materials
     * Oxygen Production

     Typically, fire hazards are associated with the presence of ignition
     sources and with materials incompatibility. At WSTF, we perform
     hazards analyses to identify potential problems within oxygen
     systems. We test materials and components to determine their
     suitability for use in oxygen systems. We also perform postfire
     failure analyses to identify the cause of a fire and can recommend
     design criteria to avoid future problems.

     Additionally, WSTF offers site tours so you can visit our facilities
     and understand what we do. We also teach two training courses
     offered through the American Society for Testing and Materials.
     Oxygen Systems: Operation & Maintenance is a half-day course
     designed for those who assemble, operate, and maintain oxygen
     systems. Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems, a two-day course aimed
     primarily at those who design systems, was the 1998 Recipient of the
     Education Award for Excellence from the American Society of
     Association Executives.
