   Freedom of Information Act Requests

   The Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as the FOIA, was enacted
   by Congress in 1966 to give the American public greater access to the
   Federal Government's records. You do not have to file a FOIA request to
   obtain information which is routinely available for public inspection,
   including records from docketed cases, broadcast applications and
   related files, petitions for rulemakings, various legal and technical
   publications, legislative history compilations, etc. Much of this
   information is already available on the FCC website, but if you would
   still like to file a FOIA request, follow the instructions on our FOIA
   web page.
