ARISE Science Workshop, August 19-20, 1998

   A two-day workshop focused on the science to be done with the proposed
   ARISE future space VLBI mission was held in Green Bank, West Virginia,
   on August 19 and 20, 1998. ARISE is included in the long-range roadmap
   for the Structure and Evolution of the Universe theme of NASA. The
   purposes of the workshop were to increase community involvement in
   determining the science to be done with the mission and to develop a
   more detailed scientific case for ARISE for the upcoming astronomy
   decade committee. There were presentations summarizing the mission and
   its' technical status, but the remainder of the workshop was devoted to
   the scientific goals of ARISE rather than to technical details of the
   mission.

   At the workshop, a brief description of the mission was presented,
   followed by a series of invited scientific talks describing the
   possible goals for the mission in various areas. Following these talks,
   a consensus was reached on the highest scientific priorities, and on
   the plans for developing the detailed science case over the next few
   months.
