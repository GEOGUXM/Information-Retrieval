   HOW CAN I HELP? > Interships

   Thank you for your interest in Senator Voinovich's internship program.
   Past interns have found this opportunity to be very exciting and
   rewarding. Senator Voinovich and his staff are looking for qualified
   applicants to work in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo, and
   Washington, D.C. These positions are available in the fall, spring, and
   summer.

   Interns are a valuable part of the office and are responsible for both
   legislative and constituent duties. Individuals must be strong writers
   and have good communication skills. Interns will participate in all
   areas of the office and will spend roughly fifty percent of their time
   assisting the office staff with routine tasks such as opening and
   distributing constituent mail, assisting in the front office, giving
   tours of the Capitol, and running errands. The balance of their time
   will be spent assisting legislative staff with research, attending
   hearings, and tracking legislative developments. By the end of the
   internship, students have an excellent insight into the workings of a
   Senate office and how the legislative process works.

   Eligibility

   The ideal student applicant will have strong academic credentials and
   an interest in politics. Due to the high number of applicants,
   internships are limited to Ohio residents and/or students currently
   attending a college or university in the State of Ohio. Students from
   all academic disciplines are encouraged to apply.

   Application Process

   To begin your internship application please call our Internship
   Coordinator at (202) 224-3353, or email them your name, mailing
   address, and phone number directly at Internships@voinovich.senate.gov
   for an application packet. To apply for an internship, you must
   complete an application which requires a complete college transcript, a
   current resume, a one-page essay describing why the candidate is
   interested in an internship with Senator Voinovich's office and what he
   or she hopes to obtain from the experience, and two letters of
   recommendation. A phone interview may be required before a final
   decision on applicants is determined.

   If you have any questions pertaining to internships, please contact the
   Washington, DC or state offices. This position is a non-paid position,
   so selection is generally made several months in advance to allow
   students to make housing and travel arrangements. Thank you again for
   your interest.
