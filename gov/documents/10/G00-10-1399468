                             The Linked Windows

                           Interactive Data System

    [new14.jpg] LinkWinds, version 2.3 is now available. It runs on Unix
     and Linux platforms only. Our next generation package, WebWinds, is
                 written in Java and runs on most platforms.

     A new (2.3) reference manual and a user's guide to LinkWinds is now
                                  on-line.

   LinkWinds is a visual data exploration system resulting from a program
   of research into the application of computer graphics to rapidly and
   interactively accessing, displaying, exploring and analyzing large
   multivariate multidisciplinary data sets. It is being developed at the
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the sponsorship of NASA's Space Science
   Applied Information Systems Research Program (AISRP), and Mission to
   Planet Earth's information system NRA program.

   LinkWinds applies a unique data-linking paradigm resulting in a system
   which functions much like a graphical spreadsheet. It is not only a
   powerful method for organizing large amounts of data for analysis, but
   provides a highly intuitive, easy-to-learn, easy-to-retain user
   interface on top of the traditional graphical user interface. The
   linking of data displays and controls for their manipulation provides
   great flexibility in rapidly exploring large masses of complex data to
   quickly detect trends, correlations and anomalies. The system is
   comprised of a large and expanding suite of non-domain specific
   applications and provides for the ingestion of a variety of database
   formats. Its many functions and services include
     * 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional graphical displays of data.
     * The ability to deal with very large data files.
     * Interactive visual data subsetting either at the input or output
     * Supersetting to construct higher dimensionality data sets from sets
       of data files. This is useful for building time series from daily
       data accumulations.
     * Simultaneous display and analysis of multiple data sets which may
       be totally unrelated.
     * A unique and easy-to-use animation creation and display capability.
     * Interactive color manipulation.
     * A journal and macro capability allowing replay of an entire session
       or any portion thereof.
     * Hard copy of graphical displays and text.
     * A context-sensitive help system.
     * Network support for collaborative data analysis with partners
       anywhere on the internet, using virtually no bandwidth.
     * In addition to archived data sets, LinkWinds has demonstrated an
       ability to ingest and display real time data, which may be from
       spacecraft, laboratory experiments, or computer simulations.
