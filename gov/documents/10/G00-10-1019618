                         Handle System Proxy Server

   The web form below will enable you to resolve individual handles and
   view their associated values. It uses a proxy server, which understands
   both the Handle System protocol and HTTP protocol.

   If you type a handle into the text box, and that handle has a URL
   associated with it as one of its values, the proxy server will instruct
   your browser to display the location of that URL.  If you select "Don't
   Redirect to URLs", the proxy will simply list the value. You may select
   other value types from the pick list, although most handles will not
   have all of the listed administrative values associated with them.

   The Handle System uses caching to speed handle resolution. If you check
   "Authoritative Query", the proxy will bypass the cache, go directly to
   the responsible handle server, and then refresh the cache with the data
   for that handle.

   Simply appending a handle to the URL http://hdl.handle.net/ and giving
   the string to a browser as a location will also resolve that handle,
   but using this form will enable  you to see all of the handles values.
