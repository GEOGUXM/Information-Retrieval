   The ABAG CALFED TASK FORCE

      The Bay-Delta watershed is comprised of a mixture of waters from
      creeks, rivers, the ocean and the bay.

      The ABAG-CALFED task force, too, is comprised of diverse elements -
      Directors from Bay Area Water Agencies, Local Government Elected
      Officials, and non-voting members from environmentally interested
      organizations from around the Bay.

      Begun in the Fall of 2000, the task force hopes to build areas of
      consensus among the diverse participants. We are working to:
        * Protect water resources in accordance with the CALFED Record of
          Decision and Principles of Implementation.
        * Link and improve water supply, quality, reliability, and
          environmental protection in the Bay and Delta.
