   Welcome to the official web site of the Presidential Management Intern
   (PMI) Program.
   The PMI web site has been developed as a means for communicating with
   the various audiences within the PMI community, such as Federal
   managers and selection officials, agency PMI coordinators, career
   development advisors and current and former Presidential Management
   Interns. The web site contains information on How to Apply to the PMI
   Program, Program Regulations, as well as information about various
   career developmental opportunities available to PMIs during their
   two-year internships. Visitors to the web site will be able to obtain
   the latest information about activities sponsored by the PMI Program
   Office including orientation and graduation training sessions and other
   activities of interest.
   We are interested in obtaining your comments about the utility and
   accessibility of our web site. If you have comments or suggestions that
   will help us improve the structure and the information contained on the
   web site, please leave your comments at our email address: pmi@opm.gov.
   On behalf of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management I thank you for
