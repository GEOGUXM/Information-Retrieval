   The GSFC Code 920.1 Calibration Facility (CF) maintains instruments and
   NIST-traceable calibrated sources to calibrate, monitor, and assess the
   performance of satellite-, aircraft-, and ground-based remote sensing
   instrumentation. CF instruments and sources span the spectrum from UV
   through Visible and into IR.

   CF instruments, sources, and expertise are available to US Government
   agencies, the international remote sensing community, and academic
   institutions.
