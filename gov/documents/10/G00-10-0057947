                                 What's New:

     January 29, 2002 - Notes from the Columbia River Regional Executive
     meeting held on December 6, 2001 are now available. The meeting
     notes (PDF, 9 pages, 68 kb) includes discussion on the roles of the
     Council on Environmental Quality's salmon policy group and of the
     Northwest Power Planning Council's provincial reviews, as well as
     the future role of the Regional Executives Forum.

     November 15, 2001 - Today, the Federal Action Agencies released the
     2002 1-Year Implementation Plan for the Federal Columbia River Power
     System (2002 1-Year Implementation Plan). The three Action Agencies
     are the Bonneville Power Administration, U.S. Army Corps of
     Engineers, and the Bureau of Reclamation. The 2002 1-Year
     Implementation Plan identifies and describes the specific measures
     that the Action Agencies will implement in fiscal year 2002 to carry
     out the strategies outlined in the Draft Endangered Species Act
     Implementation Plan for the Federal Columbia River Power System
     (released July 31, 2001). The 2002 1-Year Plan, like the 2002-2006
     Draft Five-Year Implementation Plan, addresses the actions required
     in the National Marine Fisheries (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
     Service (FWS) 2000 FCRPS Biological Opinions. The Action Agencies
     will use the discussions occurring on the 2002-2006 5-Year Plan to
     accommodate appropriate changes to this and subsequent 1-year plans.
     [Please note: The 2002 1-Year Implementation Plan is made up of two
     documents: a narrative and an appendix with tables of projects
     organized by H.]
