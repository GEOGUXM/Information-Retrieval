   Mission

   The Erie County Commission on the Status of Women works to assure that
   the women of Erie County have full participation on the issues that
   have an impact on their lives.

   Towards that end the Commission will work to ensure that:

    1. A proportionate number of women, including women of color, are
       appointed to public, private and not-for-profit boards
    2. Community leaders are educated on issues affecting women
    3. There is public awareness and an effective system of response for
       victims of domestic violence
    4. Women have access to pertinent health information
    5. The economic self-sufficiency of women is no less than that of men

   History

   The Commission was established by a unanimous vote of the Erie County
   Legislature in 1987 to remove gender based inequities for women. In
   1988, the Commission became a department of Erie County government.

   The Commission conducts policy studies; analyzes current legislation,
   programs and trends affecting women; develops collaborative programs
   with local and regional organizations and public officials; provides
   educational awareness; and recommends measures to coordinate,
   consolidate or expand the resources and services available to women in
   Erie County. Click here to see Recent Commission Reports.
