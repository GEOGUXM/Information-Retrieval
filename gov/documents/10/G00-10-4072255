   IMPI is an industrial-led effort to create a standard to enable
   interoperability of different implementations of the Message Passing
   Interface (MPI). The first steering committee meeting was held on March
   4, 1997. The first complete version the IMPI protocols was voted on and
   agreed to in January 2000 by the participating vendors.

   The complete IMPI protocol specification has been published in the
   May-June 2000 issue of the Journal of Research of NIST as an appendix
   to a short introductory article on IMPI (the introductory article was
   required in order to publish the IMPI spec. in this journal). The IMPI
   protocol specification is also available here in PostScript and gzipped
   PostScript form. You can view an HTML version of the standard on-line,
   or download this html version in a gzipped tar file.

   An errata is maintained for the IMPI specification (last updated June
   18, 2001).

   The first IMPI enabled version of MPI has been released:
   LAM 6.4, released November 1999, from the Laboratory for Scientific
       Computing at the University of Notre Dame supports IMPI.

   The University of Notre Dame is also providing a portable version of
   the IMPI server (impiexec -server).

   The IMPI Test Tool has been developed by the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology to provide IMPI developers a means to test
   their conformance to the IMPI standard.

   NIST is also facilitating the development of the IMPI standard by
   coordinating steering committee meetings. The IMPI team at NIST is:
     * Judy Devaney
     * Bill George
     * John Hagedorn
     * Pete Ketcham
