                          The Internet Traffic Archive

   The Internet Traffic Archive is a moderated repository to support
   widespread access to traces of Internet network traffic, sponsored by
   ACM SIGCOMM. The traces can be used to study network dynamics, usage
   characteristics, and growth patterns, as well as providing the grist
   for trace-driven simulations. The archive is also open to programs for
   reducing raw trace data to more manageable forms, for generating
   synthetic traces, and for analyzing traces.
   Traces contributed to the archive have no restrictions as to what use
   may be made of them (except for traffic analysis as noted below).
   Traces may however have restrictions on redistribution. Check the
   Restrictions information associated with the trace.
   Software contributed to the archive is in general copyrighted. Check
   the Restrictions information associated with the software for details.
   Traces contributed to the archive often will have been filtered to some
   degree to preserve the privacy of the network users whose traffic was
   traced, and to address network security concerns. The Privacy
   information associated with the trace details these changes. Archive
   users agree to not perform traffic analysis aimed at circumventing the
   degree of privacy present in a trace.
   Here's what's new in the archive.
   Here are the traces currently in the archive, last updated April 29,
   2000.
   Here is the software currently in the archive, last updated April 29,
   2000.
   There are two mailing lists associated with the archive, one for
   discussion of the archive contents, and the other for announcements of
   updates and changes.
   To contribute to the archive, please read about the moderation policy
   and submission guidelines.
   The archive is open to two types of traces: those which have been
   previously studied, and "raw", unstudied traces. The advantages of
   previously studied traces are that generally the measurement artifacts
   have been identified, and from the results of the studies you have some
   ideas about the saliant features of the traces. The advantage of raw
   traces is that they tend to be recent, which in the quickly-evolving
   world of the Internet can be vital. The discussion mailing list is
   mainly intended for discussing the raw traces, including coordinating
   efforts to analyze them (though there is no requirement to do so).

   Carl Malamud and the Internet Multicasting Service giving it its
   original home.
