   We've changed our Web address

   The domain name for the Department of Natural Resources and Parks is

   Please update your bookmarks and Website links.

   Our content is the same-- just the name has changed
   The page you're looking for is probably still available at our new site
   address. To get it, just do a search on our home page at
   http://dnr.metrokc.gov/ or edit the web address in your browser.

   We're sorry for the inconvenience
   Over the last two years, we updated our printed materials and requested
   link updates from other websites to minimize disruption as much as
   possible. However, we know we didn't catch everything and apologize for
   any inconvenience our customers and partners may experience due to this
   change.
