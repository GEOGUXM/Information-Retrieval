          Welcome to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court - Southern District of
   California. Our court serves San Diego and Imperial counties, but you
   don't have to come to San Diego for information you may need.  For the
   latest information, check our bulletin board or stop by the front
   counter to file new bankruptcy cases or pleadings.  It is all here,
   just as if you were at the the Jacob Weinberger U.S. Courthouse.  This
   site is best viewed with Netscape Navigator 3.0 or above.  It also
   makes extensive use of the Acrobat Reader and Quicktime video
   plug-ins.  Please help yourself to some free software.
