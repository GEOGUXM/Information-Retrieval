     * Pan-Galactic PDM (PGPDM)  Python Powered   wxPython Powered
       An open-source, open-architecture PDM system software package

     * Notes:

     * PGPDM v1.0 is scheduled for release February 1, 2002.
     * The PGPDM Client is undergoing some architecture changes for
       version 1.0, so the on-line demo is temporarily disabled. If you
       are interested in being a beta tester, contact Steve Waterbury.
     * The PGPDM Demo Script gives an idea of the use cases and
       functionality of the PGPDM Client.
