                               Mission Summary

   Throughout much of Washington, northern Oregon and southern British
   Columbia, the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center (NWAC) promotes
   public safety by helping reduce the impacts of snow, avalanches and
   adverse mountain weather on transportation, industry and recreation. To
   achieve this mission, the NWAC assists a variety of snow safety and
   snow management programs (federal, state and private) through providing
   and analyzing detailed and useful weather snow and avalanche data; and
   by producing and distributing a variety of mountain weather and
   avalanche forecast products. The NWAC also assists back country
   travelers by providing current information on snowpack structure and
   through forecasts of expected changes in related avalanche conditions.

                                   Funding

   The Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center is administered by the
   United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service (USFS), and
   jointly funded by the USFS, Washington State Department of
   Transportation (WSDOT), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration-National Weather Service (NOAA-NWS), National Park
   Service (NPS), British Columbia Ministry of Highways and Transportation
   (BCMOTH), Pacific Northwest Ski Area Association (PNSAA), Washington
   State Parks and Recreation Commission (WSPRC), Friends of the Avalanche
   Center (FOAC) and other private organizations. Without the combined
   effort and support of all of these cooperators, the NWAC would not
   exist.

   The non-profit organization--the Friends of the Avalanche Center-- has
   been developed by interested supporters of the NWAC.   Information on
   this support effort and additional avalanche information is available
   on the Friends of the Avalanche Center web site.
