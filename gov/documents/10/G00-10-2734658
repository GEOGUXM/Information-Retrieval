Introduction

   NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, founded in 1871 as the U.S.
   Commission on Fish and Fisheries, is the Nation's oldest Federal
   conservation agency. As such, it has been publishing the results of its
   research for 125 years, and the tradition of scientific publishing is
   continued today by the NMFS Scientific Publications Office (SPO) in
   Seattle, Washington.

   Formal NMFS publications include the Fishery Bulletin and its
   associated Technical Reports and the Marine Fisheries Review. In
   addition, the SPO provides technical and administrative editorial
   support to NMFS headquarters offices, which includes coordinating
   publication of several series of the NOAA Technical Memoranda NMFS,
   including Our Living Oceans, and other special publications.

Publication Series

Fishery Bulletin

   The quarterly Fishery Bulletin (FB) is the oldest and one of the finest
   fisheries journals in the world. It has been an official publication of
   the U.S. Government since 1881, under various titles, and is the U.S.
   counterpart to other highly regarded governmental fisheries science
   publications. It publishes original research or interpretative articles
   in all scientific fields that bear on marine fisheries and marine
   mammal science.

   Manuscripts submitted for publication in the Fishery Bulletin and
   Technical Reports undergo peer review by senior scientists within and
   outside the government. The NMFS Scientific Editor, a scientist
   affiliated with one of the NMFS Science Centers who serves for a
   three-year period, is responsible for conducting the peer reviews and
   for accepting or rejecting manuscripts.

   For more information on the Fishery Bulletin, including complete text
   for recent issues (in PDF format), please visit the Fishery Bulletin
   home page.

NOAA Technical Report NMFS

   The NOAA Technical Report NMFS (TR) series of the Fishery Bulletin
   provides a flexible outlet for publishing a variety of high quality
   manuscripts which, owing to length or other reasons, are inappropriate
   for the FB, such as keys, comprehensive lengthy manuscripts, FAO
   species synopses, Flora and Fauna subseries manuscripts, etc. The
   manuscripts published are equal in quality to Fishery Bulletin articles
   and have undergone the same rigorous peer- review process.

   The TR series is not used for annotated bibliographies, lengthy data
   sets, or computer programs. Such materials may be more appropriately
   published in the Technical Memorandum series or perhaps in microfiche
   or electronic form.

Marine Fisheries Review

   The quarterly journal, Marine Fisheries Review (MFR), has been an
   official publication of the U.S. government since 1939. It publishes
   review articles, research reports, significant progress reports,
   technical notes, and news articles on fisheries science, engineering
   and economics, commercial and recreational fisheries, marine mammal
   studies, aquaculture, and U.S. and foreign fisheries developments.
   Emphasis, however, is on indepth review articles and practical or
   applied aspects of marine fisheries rather than pure research.

   text for recent issues (in PDF format), please select from the

NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS

   The NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS series (TM) is published by NMFS
   Offices and Science Centers, and is used for timely documentation and
   communication of preliminary results, interim reports, or more
   localized or special purpose information that may not have received
   formal outside peer reviews or detailed editing. NMFS Offices and
   Science Centers are responsible for reviews and technical accuracy of
   TM's. The TM's are numbered publications and can be obtained from the
   issuing Office or Science Center or the National Technical Information
   Service (NTIS). The Publication & Reference Links page includes links
   to many of the listings of TM's issued by the NMFS Science Centers.
