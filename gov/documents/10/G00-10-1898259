   T-16 Nuclear Physics


     T-16 is the Nuclear Physics Group in the Theoretical Division of the
     Los Alamos National Laboratory. Our Group was formed by combining the
     previous Groups T-2 and T-5, and we now do a wide variety of both basic
     and applied research in nuclear physics and nuclear data.

     Please visit our Nuclear Information Service for access to evaluated
     nuclear data.

     T-16 will be an important player in the National Nuclear Physics Summer
     School, to be held in Santa Fe, July 28 through August 10, 2002.S

   News and Announcements


   22 Jan 2002: Phillip Page rejoins T-16. Formerly a post-doc with T-8
   and T-5/T-16, Phillip has rejoined us after a brief sojourn at Oak
   Ridge National Laboratory. He will be working to a large extent on
   applications of nuclear physics to areas of national security and
   environment.

   14 Dec 2001: Joe Carlson awarded the prestigious Fellows Prize. His
   research in Monte Carlo approaches for light nuclei has had a
   significant impact on the community. Chadwick says, "This prize is much
   deserved, and brings prestige to the group and division."

   01Nov 2001: Mark Paris, new post-doc. Mark joins us, coming from the
   University of Basel (where he worked with Ingo Sick) and the University
   of Illinois (where his thesis advisor was Vijay Pandharipande).

   20 Feb 2001: Mark Chadwick selected as the new T-16 Group Leader. In
   their announcement, Alan Bishop and Dan Strottman said, "This is a
   period of both great challenge and opportunity for T-16 as they remain
   a critical part of the Laboratory, national and internal programs in
   nuclear science. Mark has accepted the critical tasks of growing the
   basic research and the applied programs in the group and of building
   links with new programs in the Division and Laboratory; all of these
   aspects are essential for the continued success of the group. We look
   forward to working with Mark to ensure that success." Mark has been
   receiving a mixture of congratulations and condolences about his new
   assignment, but everyone is looking forward to exciting times under his
   leadership.
