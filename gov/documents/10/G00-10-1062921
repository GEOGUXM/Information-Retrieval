                              NEWS FOR YOU 2002

   Looking to get a head start on your taxes? The IRS offers a sneak peak
          at some of the changes underway with "News for You 2002."

      This practical guide provides new information that taxpayers, tax
   practitioners and businesses need for the 2002 tax-filing season - and
                                   beyond.

    Did you know the IRS will have new addresses for some individuals and
   businesses to send their tax returns? Did you know the IRS is creating
   a new nationwide toll-free hotline for tax practitioners? Did you know
     you might still be entitled to a tax break from the summer advance
          payment checks or from a new, expanded child tax credit?

   Details on these and other topics can be found in "News for You 2002,"
     a convenient place to find some of the latest changes. This section
   highlights a few of the many changes taking place as the IRS undertakes
      its largest reorganization in nearly a half century and works to
                       improve service for taxpayers.
