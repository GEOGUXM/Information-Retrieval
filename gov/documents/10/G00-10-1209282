Computer-Integrated Construction Group

   The Computer-Integrated Construction Group is part of the Building
   Environment Division. For more information, contact Dr. Kent Reed
   (Group Leader) or Robin Jeffries (secretary).

Overview

   Researchers in the Computer-Integrated Construction Group are working
   collaboratively with the U.S. construction and building industries to
   establish an exemplary computer-integrated construction environment,
   based on open standards for the representation, access, exchange, use,
   visualization, and archiving of information. With these standards
   implemented in software systems, industry will be able to achieve its
   goal of seamlessly circulating information throughout its life-cycle
   work processes, all taking place in a loosely coupled, distributed,
   heterogeneous environment.

   Current research is concentrated in three areas: the integration of
   project information, the integration and automation of activities on
   the construction site, and the electronic commerce of technical
   information between supplier and project. The output of this research
   is prototype standards and protocols, measurement technologies, and
   testing procedures. Experiments to evaluate and demonstrate these
   outputs are conducted in a testbed that is open to industry and
   academia.

   The near-term focus of the research has been in support of the heavy
   industrial construction sector, dealing with capital projects such as
   chemical process plants. To ensure that its research is addressing
   industrial needs, NIST participates in committees of the Construction
   Industry Institute, CIMsteel Integration Standards, and the
   International Alliance for Interoperability and in industrial consortia
   such as FIATECH, PlantSTEP and the pdXi (Process Data Exchange
   Institute) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. The focus
   is being broadened to other industry sectors as the research matures
   and industrial partnerships are established.

   NIST researchers are exploring current and emerging information
   technologies in this program, including traditional data-oriented and
   emerging object-oriented technologies, and new communication and
   collaboration technologies made possible by the Internet. A major theme
   of NIST research is the harmonization of different technologies to
   allow industry maximum flexibility in choosing technologies to meet its
   needs. The computer-integrated construction program draws on
   researchers throughout BFRL and works cooperatively with other NIST
   programs, including the Systems Integration for Manufacturing
   Applications program managed by the Manufacturing Engineering
   Laboratory.

  Visualization of Steel Product Models, Construction Project and Site
  Information, and Building Performance

   [Click for details, CIS2 to VRML mapping]   [Click for details, NIST
   ECS] The group is doing research on the visual representation and
   simulation of construction and building related models, activities, and
   processes. The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is used for the
   visual representation of those functions.

   The VRML-related projects include:

     * a mapping between VRML data structures and the CIMsteel Integration
       Standards (CIS2). The CIS2 to VRML translator is now available
       online.
     * The NIST Fire Research Facility Emissions Control System (ECS)
       showing a simulation of the construction process,
     * a user-controlled excavator, tower crane, and dumptruck, and
     * the Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed.

   A VRML browser detector has been developed to check if your web browser
   is properly configured to be able to view VRML files.

  Standards Activities

   eBusiness for Capital Facilities is a FIATECH project that seeks to
   optimize business processes and open information exchange for Capital
   Facilities stakeholders by the application of Internet and information
   technologies. This will be accomplished by delivering an industry
   framework, guidelines, and XML (extensible mark-up language)
   specifications that enable information sharing across eBusiness
   applications for architecture, engineering, procurement, construction,
   operations and maintenance processes for capital facilities. Initial
   work will focus on the transactions for configurable and engineered
   equipment.

   For more information, contact Mark Palmer.
   PlantSTEP is an industrial consortium of companies that own, design,
   build, operate and maintain process plants and companies that supply
   equipment, materials and information technology for the process and
   construction industries. The primary focus of PlantSTEP is to develop
   and support implementation of data exchange standards based on STEP.

   PIEBASE  (Process Industries Executive for Achieving Business Advantage
   Using Standards for Data Exchange)  is the global umbrella for process
   industry consortia and their member companies active in the development
   of STEP and other standards for industrial data for the process
   industries.

   For more information, contact Mark Palmer.
   The group also participates in the following committees:
     * CIMsteel Integration Standards (CIS2)
     * CIB Working Commission W78 - Information Technology in Construction
     * International Alliance for Interoperability

   For more information, contact Kent Reed.
