          Thank you for your interest in www.stw.ed.gov. Due to the sunset
   of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 in October 2001, as of
   January 3, 2002, a separate School-to-Work website will no longer be
   available. Relevant content will be integrated into websites maintained
   by the Department of Labors Employment and Training Administration and
   the Department of Educations Office of Vocational and Adult Education.

          You may visit these websites at www.doleta.gov or
   www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE for workforce and education information. These
   websites are the central locations for information relating to the
   activities of these offices, and materials and features from the former
   site will be incorporated into those sites where appropriate.

          For grant management information, school-to-work grantees should
   contact their assigned project officers. For answers to questions
   related to the management of Learning Center lines of credit,
   subcontracts, and other activities, grantees should contact the
   Learning Center at 1-800-251-7236. For general questions, contact Amy
   Bennett of the Office of Vocational and Adult Education at
   202/260-0558, or Chris Kulick of the Employment and Training
   Administration at 202/693-3937.
