   The Internet and the World Wide Web have become an integral component
   of the provision of NASA information to academia, industry, and the
   public-at-large, and as an enabling set of technologies for the
   internal NASA information technology environment. This document
   provides a set of "Web Best Practices" (WBP) that are intended to serve
   as a guideline to all NASA entities engaged in the development and
   maintenance of World Wide Web (WWW) resources. The guidelines defined
   in this document are applicable to all NASA Enterprises, Centers, and
   project and program offices and have been created under the auspices of
   the NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO).

   Due to evolving technology and changing government policy, this
   guidelines document will be revised approximately annually. The last
   review date is displayed on the cover of the document. Documents with
   review dates exceeding one year may contain obsolete or inaccurate
   information, and a later version should be downloaded from the NASA WWW
   Best Practice site.
