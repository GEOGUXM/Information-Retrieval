                    NASA Ames Space Physiology Laboratory

        The Space Physiology Laboratory at NASA Ames Research Center
                   investigates three inter-related areas:

   [orangeball.gif] Structural and functional adaptations to gravity
   [orangeball.gif] Acclimation to microgravity
   [orangeball.gif] Countermeasures to adverse effects of spaceflight

   In addition to these areas of interest, we are also committed to
   education and to transfer of NASA technology for Earth-bound
   applications. Most of our research focuses on the effects of gravity
   (and microgravity) on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems,
   with the overall goal of maximizing health, productivity and safety of
   humans in space.

   Lower Body Negative Pressure Exercise. A unique
   "artificial gravity" exercise concept to help prevent
   cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning
   during spaceflight.
