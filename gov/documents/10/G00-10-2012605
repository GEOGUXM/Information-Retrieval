   Welcome to the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension
   Service Online Directory of Professional Workers in Agriculture. This
   web site replaces the former CSRS's USDA 305 handbook of Professional
   Workers in Agriculture. The new directory is an evolving resource that
   will continue to grow in value through the synergy of the system.

   From here you can navigate to the Search area to retrieve information
   in the database of members, or if you are the primary contact person
   for your institution you may visit the Register area to update
   information. If your personal listing is in need of updating, please
   see the list of Primary Contacts for updating at each Institution. This
   is the person you will need to contact to have your record amended.

   In addition, there is a Links page, and a page to provide Feedback to
   the keepers of this site.

   Please Enjoy.
