   The California Deserts are vast, harsh yet fragile lands within a
   day's drive of 40 million people. Approximately 80 percent of the
   desert, or 25 million acres, is publicly owned and includes two
   national parks, one national preserve, six military bases, 72
   wilderness areas, 14 state parks and extensive holdings of public
   lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Conflicting demands
   for use of California desert lands make it imperative for
   governmental agencies to work cooperatively in support of agency
   missions, protection of desert resources, and public use. The DMG
   was established as the forum for government agencies to address and
   discuss issues of common concern. Through cooperative management
   each agency achieves greater operational efficiency, enhances
   resource protection, and the public is better served.

   Sponsored by the DMG, Department of Defense, National Park Service,
   Bureau of Land Management, the State of California and many other
   agencies involved in Desert Management Issues.
