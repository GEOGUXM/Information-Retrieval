           NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center - Huntsville,Alabama
           Spacecraft and School Educator Resource Center Network

   NASA has established an Educator Resource Center Network to disseminate
    agency-related information and materials to the nation's educational
      community. Each network provides expertise and facilities to help
     educators access and utilize instructional products that emphasize
      science, mathematics, and technology. These products are based on
      NASA's unique mission and are aligned with the national education
                 standards and appropriate state frameworks.

      The Marshall Space Flight Center Educator Resource Center Network
    consists of centers located in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa,
   Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee. Each Educator Resource Center (ERC)
       demonstrates and facilitates the use of education technologies;
   provides in-service and pre-service training utilizing NASA curriculum
       support products; and partners with local, state, and regional
   educational organizations to become part of the systemic initiatives in
                                 the state.
