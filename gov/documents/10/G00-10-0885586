Welcome to the Web Site of the Maine Wing, Civil Air Patrol!

   The Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is the civilian auxiliary of the United
   States Air Force. Founded in 1941, CAP originally assisted the War
   Department by defending the coastline of the United States during World
   War II. Two of those Coastal Patrol bases were located in Maine, Base
   19 in Portland and Base 20 in Trenton.

   These days, CAPs mission is to serve America by developing our Nations
   youth;  accomplishing local, state, and national missions; and
   educating our citizens to ensure air and space supremacy. We are all
   volunteers that wear the Air Force style uniform as we serve in CAP.

   We always welcome new members to our ranks.  You dont have to be a
   pilot or a military member to join us! Our cadet program  is for boys
   and girls between the ages of 12-18 and cadet membership does not
   require military service.  For those over the age of 18, please look
   into joining us as a Senior Member.

   Please look through our pages to learn more about us and what we do. We
   would like you to leave your comments on our site by using the
   guestbook link located at the bottom of each page. Thanks for stopping
   by Maine Wing!
