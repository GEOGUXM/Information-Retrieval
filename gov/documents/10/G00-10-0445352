                  Geostandards Newsletter Website has Moved

      For the past two years, the homepage for Geostandards Newsletter: The
      Journal of Geostandards and Geoanalysis, has resided on this Los Alamos
      National Laboratory server. Recently, this site has moved to a server at
      its editorial home at the Centre de Recherches Petrographiques et
      Geochimiques, Nancy, France. The new URL is
      http://www.crpg.cnrs-nancy.fr/Geostandards/ Please update your bookmarks.
