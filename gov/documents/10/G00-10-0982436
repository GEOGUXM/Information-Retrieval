     The JPL Digital Image Animation Laboratory is an advanced computer
     animation, and software engineering facility with broadcast quality
     video recording and editing capabilities. The DIAL was created and
     is continually developed by the Visualization and Earth Science
     Applications group, within the Space Science Date Systems section at
     JPL.

     The Image Analysis and Technology & Applications Development
     subgroups are responsible for DIAL animations and software
     development. The members of the Image Analyst subgroup process
     digital imagery and create scientific visualizations and animations.
     Analysts process data from robot spacecraft like Voyager, Magellan
     and Galileo and create planetary science animations as part of
     NASA's Solar System Visualization Project. They also process data
     from satellites and Space Shuttle instruments for the study of
     Earth's resources. Examples of their work include "LA, TheMovie",
     "Mars, The Movie", and segments of the IMAX films, "Blue Planet" and
     "Destiny in Space."

     The programmers in the Technology and Applications Development
     subgroup design and write visualization and analysis software. This
     software includes perspective rendering programs, video equipment
     control programs, and the ACTORS system.

     The VESA group members and others use the DIAL to accomplish a wide
     variety of tasks . These tasks include the production of scientific
     animations and the development of software tools for the
     visualization and analysis of scientific data.
