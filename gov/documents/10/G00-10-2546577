                            Why is the VDB important?

   The EOSDIS Core System (ECS) Verification Database (VDB) is a
   repository for the EOSDIS Core System (ECS) configuration controlled
   requirements as well as test and verification status of the ECS
   development program. The VDB provides specific reports on the ECS
   requirements and the testing and verification process.   How is the
   VDB's data organized?
   Data is accepted into the VDB only from authorized sources and is
   tightly controlled. The database is directly accessible only by the
   database administrators. Reports on this data are generally available
   from this web site, and are the VDB's principal product. These reports
   have beeen arranged by category and type. Many reports are available by
   development release.   How do I contact persons responsible for the
   VDB?
   Caution: The VDB is the only authorized source for ECS requirements
   data. Users should always consult the VDB on line to ensure that they
   have current and accurate requirements data. Data in the VDB is
   frequently updated, and the valid lifetime of a printed report is
   brief. Printed or downloaded reports must be discarded promptly.
   The VDB provides links to other ESDIS Project and EOS-related web
   sites. A listing of these links is provided in the gray bar at the
   left, and also on our links page, which additional includes a brief on
   each of these web site.
   Additional details regarding the VDB's data types are available from
   the database information page. The user can also email the VDB
   Administrator if there are specific questions that remain unanswered.

    The VDB is built and maintained by QSS Group, Inc. for the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administation (NASA) Goddard SpaceFlight Center
   (GSFC) under the Multidisciplinary Engineering Development Services
   (MEDS) Contract.
