   October is "National Disability Employment Awareness Month". This year
   the NIH has chosen the theme "Ability You Can Count On."

   We have crossed the threshold into the 21st century. Employers are
   continually being challenged in locating, employing and retaining
   employees with the skills and talents needed in today's economy. To
   remain competitive in today's marketplace, we must seek quality
   employees from non-traditional employee pools. Persons with
   disabilities are part of this non-traditional skilled labor pool who
   can get the work done in a cost effective, high quality manner. The
   skills and talents of 7.8 million working age workers with disabilities
   are ready to be tapped by NIH employers. They represent "ability you
   can count on!"
