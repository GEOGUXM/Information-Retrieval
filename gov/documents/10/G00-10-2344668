   ... a view from space

                    Lidar In-space Technology Experiment


   LITE is a three-wavelength backscatter lidar developed by NASA Langley
   Research Center to fly on the Space Shuttle. . [lite_in_space_a.gif]

   [shuttlelogo_2.gif] . LITE flew on Discovery in September 1994 as part
                         of the STS-64 mission.

   ... the goals of the mission
     * validate key lidar technologies for spaceborne applications
     * explore the applications of space lidar
     * gain operational experience to benefit the development of future
       systems on free-flying satellite platforms.

   ... the final results
   LITE was operated for 53 hours, resulting in over 40 GBytes of data
   covering 1.4 million kilometers of ground track.

   These data provide the FIRST highly detailed global view of the
   vertical structure of cloud and aerosol from the Earth's surface
   through the middle stratosphere.

   LITE provided views of multilayer cloud structures. . [p77a_146_9.gif]

   [p53c_115_9.gif] . LITE provided sensitive observations of the
                      distribution of desert dust, smoke, and other aerosols.

   LITE provided the first global observations of planetary boundary layer
   height. . [p61b_123_17.gif]

                        ... and there is so much more
