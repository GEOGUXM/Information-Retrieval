   Big changes are coming for the San Francisco Bay Region Project.
   Starting in October, the study of San Francisco Bay Area geology will
   become part of two new Projects. But SFGEO will remain THE site on the
   web for geologic maps, landslide studies, and geologic information
   about the area.

   The new 3-D Geologic Map and Visualization Project will take advantage
   of advances in computer technology to study and map geology throughout
   the thickness of the Earth's crust. We will use information from oil
   wells, and from small variations in the Earth's gravity and magnetic
   field, to "see" deep into the rock below us. Combined with ongoing
   studies of the Earth's surface, we will develop a 3-D picture that will
   enable us to better understand the regions' hazards and resources.

   The new Northern California Landslide Working Group will combine the
   skills of landslide experts here in Menlo Park to better understand the
   hazard posed by landslides. We will look at how landslides work, how
   they relate to the rocks that make up the Earth, and what triggers
   them. This investigation will provide a better picture of where and
   when landslides will occur and will help us avoid or prevent them. The
   first project for the Group will be a scenario-based hazard map of the
   Oakland -Berkeley area. The scenario-based map will attempt to show
   where landslides are likely to occur when a certain triggering event
   (or combination of events) happens, such as an earthquake, heavy rain,
   or long rainy season.

   Stay tuned to this website for more information about these two new
   projects. In addition, this site will continue to provide access to the
   latest USGS geologic maps, reports, photos, and field trips for the San
   Francisco Bay Area.
