   The NRCS is a federal agency that helps people conserve natural
   resources. For over 60 years, we have been the conservation experts,
   helping private landowners, communities, groups, land users, and others
   to conserve and solve problems relating to natural resources.

   We work with Nevada's Conservation Districts and other partners to
   provide conservation assistance and to keep the land healthy and
   productive for our future generations.
