   The MODIS Land 250m Project is supported by the NASA Earth Science
   Information Partners Program as a partial solution to the EOS
   programmatic restraint of 50% production volume in the first year from
   MODIS PI processing of Level 2 and 3 data. Currently, 250m production
   is only supported for 10% of the land surface.
