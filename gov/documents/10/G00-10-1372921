                  LIST OF EXCLUDED INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES

   Improvements to the LEIE
   Previously, when users matched on the name of an individual or
   business, positive verification involved user contact with the OIG to
   provide an SSN or EIN of the excluded individual or business.  We have
   changed the LEIE to eliminate this time consuming process.  These
   changes now enable users to make such verifications on-line (see
   instructions on Information Page).

   Summary:
   The HHS Office of Inspector General imposes exclusions on individuals
   and entities based on the authority contained in Sections 1128 and 1156
   of the Social Security Act. This List of Excluded Individuals/Entities
   is a listing of all parties excluded as of the date of publication.
   The effect of an exclusion is that no program payment will be made for
   any items or services, including administrative and management
   services, (other than an emergency item or service not provided in a
   hospital emergency room) furnished, ordered, or prescribed by an
   excluded individual or entity under the Medicare (title XVIII),
   Medicaid (title XIX), Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant
   (title V), Block Grants to States for Social Services (title XX) and
   State Children's Health Insurance (title XXI)  programs during the
   period of exclusion, except as provided in regulations found at 42 CFR
   1001.1901(c).  Program payment will not be made to any entity in which
   an excluded individual is serving as an employee, administrator,
   operator, or in any other capacity, for any services including
   administrative and management services furnished, ordered, or
   prescribed on or after the effective date of this exclusion.  In
   addition, no payment may be made to any business or facility, e.g., a
   hospital, that submits bills for payment of items or services provided
   by an excluded party.  Section 1128 exclusion actions with a sanction
   effective date after August 5, 1997 are also from all Federal health
   care programs.

   Search Exclusions Database:
   The search page of this site allows you to search by name, general,
   specialty, city, state, zip code or sanction type for any excluded
   individuals and entities.  For more detailed help on searching go to
   the Information page.
   Documentation:
   If you determine that you have a match and are seeking written
   documentation, please submit a written request, including a printout
   from the sanction list identifying the individual, to the address at
   the end of this message.  Please note that requests without a printout
   highlighting the individual from the list will be returned.  Please
   also be aware that in most instances, the only documentation available
   may be the exclusion notice, which informs the subject of the
   exclusion, its effect and the subject's appeal rights.  It does not
   contain specific details regarding the basis for the exclusion.  If the
   subject has also been reinstated, the notice informing the subject of
   that action may be available.  We suggest contacting the individual for
   further information regarding any action which may have been taken.
