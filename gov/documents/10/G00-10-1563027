                        ComEd to Begin Tree Trimming

Tree trimming by ComEd will begin at the end of November and will continue
through January in the Village. Qualified line-clearance workers employed by
Asplundh Tree Expert Co. will trim trees that interfere with electric wires
running from pole to pole. If left untrimmed, these trees can cause service
outages and safety hazards. If you have questions about the trimming contact
ComEd's Vegetation Management Department at 1-800-334-7661. Contact the
Village Arborist at 323-4733 if additional assistance is needed.

   [Farmhse.gif] HISTORY OF BURR RIDGE
     __________________________________________________________________

    The area which is now Burr Ridge was once the home of the Sioux,
    Pottawattamie, Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. After an 1835 treaty, most of
    the Indians were relocated west of the Mississippi. In the early 1950's the
    area was sparsely settled, and large tracts of land were devoted to farming.
    The gently rolling hills and wooded sections of the eastern portion of the
    area were, for the most part, divided into five acre tracts.
    On October 30, 1956, a one square mile area bounded by Old Route 66, County
    Line Road, 79th Street and the east line of the Denemark Farm was
    incorporated as the Village of Harvester. This area, known as Robert
    Bartlett's Hinsdale Countryside Estates, had once been a pig farm.
    The next areas which were developed included Burr Ridge Estates, at the
    southeast corner of Plainfield and County Line Roads, and Woodview Estates,
    south of 55th Street and east of what is now Suburban Hospital but
    previously was the Cook County T.B. Sanitarium. These areas and the land now
    occupied by The Heatherfields were once part of the Busby family farm.
    In August, 1961, the territory north of Route 66, including the 414 acre
    International Harvester research facility (now the J. I. Case facility and
    the Walsh, Higgins development), was annexed to the Village; and in August
    of the following year, the name of the community was changed to Burr Ridge
    to denote the stand of burr oak trees on a ridge along County Line Road near
    Plainfield Road. The burr oak leaf became the Village emblem.
    Shortly after the change in the Village's name, the 120 acre Four Pines Farm
    was annexed to the Village under the terms of the Village's first major
    annexation agreement. Milk from this farm had been processed and distributed
    at the Chicago Guernsey Dairy Center, now the site of Sedgley Estates. The
    annexation agreement provided for the development of Carriage Way and the
    Burr Ridge Industrial Park on Tower Drive.
    Over the years, development changed the look of the area. The Village
    experienced its first major expansion to the south with the annexation of
    what was known as Ruthe Farm and today is Braemoor, Lakewood, Parkview and
    the Braemoor condominiums. The Denemark Farm became Burr Ridge Industrial
    Commons; property owned by the Chicago Council of the Boy Scouts, which had
    originally been the hunting preserve of Chicago industrialist Luther Rogers,
    became The Burr Ridge Club, and the City of Chicago's prison facility (the
    Bridewell Farm) became Ambriance!, Burr Oaks Glen South, Chasemoor and Burr
    Ridge Corporate Park.
    Today, Burr Ridge encompasses approximately 7 square miles located
    approximately 19 miles southwest of the Loop. It is generally bounded on the
    east by Wolf Road, on the north by 55th Street, on the west by Madison
    Street (and Route 83 in the southern portion of the Village) and on the
    south by approximately 97th Street.
    Beginning with a population of less than 300 people living in approximately
    75 homes, the Village has grown to a current population of 10,408 based on
    the 2000.
