                               Shuttle Launch

   The LPS is an integrated network of computers, data links, displays,
   controls, hardware interface devices, and computer software required to
   control and monitor flight systems, ground support equipment (GSE), and
   facilities used in direct support of Shuttle vehicle activities.

   The system continually monitors the Shuttle and its ground equipment,
   including its environmental controls and the equipment that loads the
   propellants. Consoles with vehicle responsibilities communicate
   information directly to and from the Shuttle computer systems. Consoles
   with GSE responsibility communicate information to and from the
   Hardware Interface Modules (HIMs) which are connected to the numerous
   ground support systems. Each HIM is capable of interfacing to
   approximately 240 sensors or controls in a GSE system. Overall, some
   40,000 temperatures, pressures, flow rates, liquid levels, turbine
   speeds, voltages, currents, valves, switch positions, and many other
   parameters are being monitored.

   The above information was extracted from the Launch Processing System
   Description, NASA/KSC, 1984.
