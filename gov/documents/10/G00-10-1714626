                        The U.S. Geological Survey's
                          Western Region Open House

   The U.S. Geological Survey's showcase of science at its Western Region
   Center at 345 Middlefield Road in Menlo Park, California happens every
   three years. Visit this page for information on the next Western Region
   Open House in 2003.
     * Hours of the Open House are usually10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
     * There is no admission charge and no fee for parking. Although
       adjacent parking lots are expected to be adequate, local residents
       are encouraged to walk or bicycle to the event.
     * Because the USGS Center is less than one mile from the Menlo Park
       CalTrain depot, taking the train is also a viable alternative.
     * All exhibits will be wheelchair accessible, and a sign-language
       interpreter will be available to assist those who need that
       service.
     * Food service, featuring sandwiches, snack chips, ice cream and a
       large assortment of soft drinks will be available each day, or
       families may bring their own picnic lunch.
     * Each day there will be outdoor musical entertainment, from 11 a.m.
       to 3 p.m., near the picnic area.
     * For safety and sanitary reasons, pets will not be allowed, other
       than Certified Seeing-Eye or Assisted-Living Dogs.
