   Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET)

   NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field

   Technology for the most critical propulsion issues that impact local
   airport air quality and global climate change: reducing nitrogen oxides
   and improving performance.

              Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program Vision


       To develop and hand off revolutionary turbine engine propulsion
    technologies that will enable future generation vehicles over a wide
                           range of flight speeds.

   Two top level goals:
    1. Develop propulsion technologies to enable increases in efficiency
       and therefore fuel burn reductions of up to 15 % (equivalent
       reductions in CO2 ).
    2. Develop combustor technologies (configuration and materials) which
       will enable reductions in Landing/Takeoff NOx of 70% relative to
       1996 ICAO standards.

   The UEET Program seeks to significantly utilize the skills and
   expertise of NASA personnel as well as utilize NASA research facilities
   and work in close partnership with corporate and educational
   organizations. The UEET Program is proud to introduce our current
   corporate partners.

   "Technology advances have substantially reduced most emissions per
   passenger-km. However, there is potential for further improvements. Any
   technology change may involve a balance among a range of environmental
   impacts." "Summary to Policymakers:Aviation and the Global Atmosphere",
   International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, 1999.

   The UEET Program contains seven technology areas. Each technology area
   or project will work over a 5 year period to gather and design new
   technologies that will address the two top goals for the program.
