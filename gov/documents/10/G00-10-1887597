                           Moderization Blueprint

     TThe next editon of the Blueprint, Release 3.0, is currently under
   construction. When it is complete as a draft for comments, we'll post
   it here. In the meantime, the material in the curent Blueprint is valid
   and serves us as a guide and mile-marker for our progress.

     It seems like only yesterday that we released the first Modernization
   Blueprint on September 30, 1999.   It was a milestone in the
   modernization of Student Financial Assistance (SFA), the office of the
   U.S. Department of Education that administers student financial aid
   programs.   Many thanks to the people that provided us feedback and
   comments on our prior versions of the Blueprint.   The comments that we
   have collected can be seen in the PDF file, SFA Modernization Blueprint
   - Community Feedback.

     As always, we look forward to reading your comments on the Blueprint.
     Click on the "Feedback" action box, to the left, and you'll be linked
   into a message and database page direct to us.   We will review your
   comments and make changes to the Blueprint.

     You may also email Greg Woods, Chief Operating Officer for the Office
   of Student Financial Assistance Programs, with your comments.
