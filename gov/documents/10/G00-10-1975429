   [tc.gif] The Telework Collaborative is a partnership composed of five
   government entities from five states. Our collective energy is focused
   on educating and inspiring employers and managers to effectively and
   efficiently plan, implement, and manage telework as a win-win-win work
   opportunity for the employer, employee, and society. Our mission is to
   accelerate the acceptance and adoption of telework programs in public
   and private organizations by better understanding and addressing the
   needs of employers, managers, supervisors, co-workers and the
   teleworkforce. Our objectives are to:

     Research attitudes and perceptions of managers/supervisors to
   identify information and incentives that would encourage the acceptance
   of the telework option

     Identify and document results of successful organizational telework
   programs, together with the rationale for implementing those programs.

     Based on information discovered in the first two objectives, identify
   mechanism(s) designed to inform and to assist managers/supervisors in
   the public and private sectors with implementing telework programs.
