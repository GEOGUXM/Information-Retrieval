        The twin goals of this research group at the National Cancer
   Institute are to better understand the complex molecular pharmacology
   of cancer cells and to find new agents for treatment of cancer. The
   studies are 50% experimental, 50% bioinformatic.
   Experimental: Characterization of cancer cells at the DNA, mRNA,
   protein, functional, and pharmacological expression levels . Included
   are cell types used in the National Cancer Institute's drug discovery
   program. Central methods are those of molecular biology, genomics, and
   proteomics.
   Bioinformatics: Analysis and integration of large-scale databases on
   the molecular structures, potency patterns, and possible molecular
   targets of compounds tested in the NCI drug discovery program. Central
   methods include those of classical and computer-intensive statistics,
   data mining, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and Q-SAR
   analysis.

   wpeB.jpg (5471 bytes) Preview! Data from our molecular profiling
   studies of cancer cells will be made available at this site upon
   publication. New tools for analysis and visualization of the data will
   progressively be made available here as well. For a preview of one
   novel method of visualization, the color-coded "clustered image map"
   (CIM), click on the thumbnail image at the left. We introduced this
   technique in the early 1990's for visualization of the molecular and
   pharmacological profiles of cancer cells and drugs (see, e.g.
   Weinstein, et al., Science 275:343).
