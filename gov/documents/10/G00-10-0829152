                     Human Genome Sequencing Department

   The LBNL Human Genome Sequencing Department is now part of the Joint
   Genome Institute, which also involves the Human Genome centers at
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National
   Laboratory. Using the directed sequencing strategy pioneered at LBNL,
   we have sequenced 8 megabases (mostly 5q31) of human genomic sequence
   as of March 1, 1998. These sequences are available from our sequence
   archive, which is updated daily.

   The Drosophila Genome Center is now separate from the Human Genome
   Center.
