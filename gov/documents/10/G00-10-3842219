     The International Symposia on Discharge and Electrical Insulation in
     Vacuum (ISDEIV) is a non-profit, international organization whose
     purpose is to encourage the advancement of the science and
     application of electrical insulation and discharges in vacuum,
     primarily by conducting symposia for the exchange of scientific
     information.

     The Symposia are held biannually (even-numbered years).  The
     symposia are interdisciplinary meetings for the exchange of results,
     presentation of progress, and discussion of ideas and challenges for
     the future in the field of electrical discharges and insulation in
     vacuum. Both fundamental and applied aspects are covered. Symposia
     program consist of invited talks, invited oral contributions, and
     posters. Since 1996, minicourses in relevant fields have been
     offered in parallel to the regular Symposium schedule.
