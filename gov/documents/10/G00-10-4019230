   Rain is the way the atmosphere sweats: water vapor condenses into
   liquid drops and thereby releases heat into the ambient air. Through
   this latent heating, global rainfall produces about three times as much
   energy as the other major source of atmospheric heating, direct
   shortwave solar radiation.

   This latent heating produced by the ultimate condensation of water
   vapor is the dominant driver of global-scale motions in the troposphere
   (try the Q&A page for details about the role of rain in weather
   dynamics). Thus, to understand climate change in general, and the heat
   exchange between ocean, atmosphere, and land in particular, one must
   have accurate global measurements of rainfall. About two thirds of all
   rainfall takes place over the tropics, three quarters of which consist
   of oceans. Given the inaccessibility and vastness of the area in
   question, one must resort to remote sensing techniques.
   The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, a joint
   project between the United States (under the leadership of NASA's
   Goddard Space Flight Center, which hosts the main TRMM web site ) and
   Japan (under the leadership of the National Space Development Agency),
   and the first spacecraft designed to monitor rain over the tropics, was
   successfully launched from Tanegashima, Japan, on November 27, 1997, at
   13:27pm Los Angeles (California) time. It placed in low earth orbit the
   first precipitation radar (PR) to be flown in space, along with a
   9-channel SSM/I-like passive microwave imager (TMI), an AVHRR-like
   visible-infrared radiometer (VIRS), a lightning sensor and a cloud
   sensor.

   The PR measures the echo backscattered from rain: because the strength
   of the echo is roughly proportional to the square of the volume of
   falling water, the PR produces very accurate estimates of rain
   profiles. The TMI measures the microwave radiation emitted by Earth's
   surface and by cloud and rain drops. Because large ice particles (often
   present in upper cloud regions) tend to scatter this emitted radiation,
   the TMI uses its various channels along with cloud models to
   discriminate between these processes and quantify the rain and ice
   responsible for the observed microwave signatures.
   One of the main challenges that the TRMM science team has had to face
   is to develop algorithms that can translate the electromagnetic
   measurements obtained from the PR, TMI and VIRS instruments together
   into estimates of the instantaneous rain rate profiles through the
   underlying precipitation systems.
   The effort underway at JPL in support of TRMM is seven-fold:
    1. Development of the Day-1 combined PR-TMI retrieval algorithm (last
       update: April 6, 1998).
     Derivation (from ARMAR's TOGA-COARE measurements) of simulated TRMM
       PR data (last update: April 6, 1998).
     Analysis of Darwin and TOGA-COARE raindrop size distribution data for
       the TRMM retrieval algorithms (last update: December 10, 1996).
     Development of advanced stochastic radar- and combined- retrieval
       algorithms (last update: December 10, 1996).
     Study of the SIR-C/X-SAR Rain Experiment results, including some nice
       images (last update: December 15, 1996).
     Comparison of the methods to derive non-paramteric radar-rain
       relations, and how they affect rain-retrieval algorithms - this
       page also has a couple of nice images from Madagascar (last update:
       December 10, 1996).
     Adaptation of the Kozu/Iguchi approach to correct for partial beam
       filling (last update: June 24, 1997).
