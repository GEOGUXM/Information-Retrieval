             Developing International Partnerships to Understand

              Global Precipitation and Its Impact on Humankind


           Global Precipitation Measurement Means Improvements In:

     * Water Resource Management
     * Agriculture
     * Policy and Planning
     * Transportation
     * Forestry
     * Natural Hazards Assessment
     * Hydrology and Oceanography
     * Public Outreach
     * Education

   One of the Next Generation of Systematic Measurement Missions That Will
   Measure Global Precipitation, a Key Climate Factor, With Improved
   Temporal Resolution and Spatial Coverage.


   GPM will answer the following questions under NASA's Earth Science
   Enterprise major category of "How Does Precipitation Impact Our
   Changing Earth?"
     * How are global precipitation, evaporation, and cycling of water
       changing?
     * What are the effects of clouds and surface hydrologic processes on
       Earth's climate?
     * How are variations in local weather, precipitation, and water
       resources related global climate variation?
     * How can weather forecast duration and reliability be improved by
       new space-based observations, data assimilation, and modeling?
     * How well can transient climate variations be understood and
       predicted?
     * How well can long-term climactic trends be assessed or predicated?



   NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement mission is in the Formulation
   Phase.
   During this phase the following activities will be focused on:
     * Encourage participation via workshops, Announcement of
       Opportunities, and Colloquia
     * Definition of Mission Scope
     * Systematic Measurement Approach
     * Technology roadmaps and infusion approaches
     * Refine primary science requirements
     * Science studies in support of trades

     * Define impact of data gaps
     * Assess radiometer/radar approaches
