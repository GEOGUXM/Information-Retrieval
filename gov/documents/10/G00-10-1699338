   W elcome to the Center for Coastal Environmental Health and
   Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR). The CCEHBR is one of five centers of
   National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) under the National
   Ocean Service. The mission of the CCEHBR is to provide scientific
   information required to resolve coastal ecosystem health issues
   associated with the agency goals of the NOS. The center conducts
   interdisciplinary research to resolve issues related to coastal
   ecosystems health and environmental quality, including public health
   impacts. Chemical, biomolecular, microbiological, and histological
   methods are used in both laboratory and field studies to describe,
   evaluate, and predict the controlling factors and outcomes of natural
   and anthropogenic influences in marine and estuarine habitats. High
   priority issues addressed by CCEHBR include: harmful algal blooms and
   their consequences, characterization of marine mammal health, land use
   impacts on coastal ecology, forensics and genetic applications to
   support marine wildlife laws, diagnosis and mitigation of fish, oyster
   and shrimp diseases, and assessment of risk in these subject areas.
   T he CCEHBR employs chemists, biochemists, molecular biologists,
   fishery biologists, geneticists, toxicologists, microbiologists,
   chemical engineers, food technologists and others, who possess the
   advanced knowledge and scientific capabilities to deal with relevant
   fisheries management, seafood safety, habitat, utilization and
   protected species issues. Joint venture programs with industry,
   academic, and other institutions are commonly utilized.
