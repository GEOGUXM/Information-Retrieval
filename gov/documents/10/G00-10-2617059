Overview

   Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and its potential
   impact on future climate is an issue of global economic and political
   significance. The need to understand how carbon cycles through the
   Earth system is therefore critically important to our ability to
   predict any future global change. Recent policy debates have
   demonstrated the need for a comprehensive, unbiased scientific
   understanding of sources and sinks of carbon dioxide on continental and
   regional scales, and how sinks might change naturally over time or be
   enhanced by human activities. The National Research Council's report,
   "Global Environmental Change: Research Pathways for the Next Decade,"
   specifically emphasizes the need for a comprehensive carbon cycle
   research strategy.

   The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP; http://www.usgcrp.gov)
   has answered this call by establishing the Carbon Cycle Science
   Program. The new Program is poised to provide critical unbiased
   scientific information on the fate of carbon dioxide in the environment
   to contribute to the ongoing public dialogue. The Program will also
   provide the scientific foundation for estimating the capacity of the
   land and the ocean to sequester and store the considerable quantities
   of carbon dioxide anticipated from human activities in the future.

   Research will be coordinated and integrated to identify and quantify
   regional- to global-scale sources and sinks for carbon dioxide and
   other greenhouse gases and to understand how these sources and sinks
   will function in the future, providing essential information for future
   predictions of the state of the Earth system. An interagency working
   group has developed an implementation plan. A scientific working group
   was established in the spring of 1998 and has published a comprehensive
   science plan for integrated research. Implementation of the new program
   will require a significant investment of resources and a high level of
   interagency coordination and integration.
