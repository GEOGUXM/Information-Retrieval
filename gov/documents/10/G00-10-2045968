                            Science for Solutions

   NOAA's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research (CSCOR)/Coastal
   Ocean Program (COP), part of the National Centers for Coastal Ocean
   Science (NCCOS), provides scientific information to assist decision
   makers to meet the challenges of managing our Nation's coastal
   resources. CSCOR/COP targets critical issues which exist in the
   Nation's estuaries, coastal waters, and Great Lakes. CSCOR/COP
   translates its findings into accessible information for coastal
   managers, planners, lawmakers, and the public. Its aim is to create
   near-term and continuous improvements in environmental decisions
   affecting the coastal ocean and its resources.

     The Coastal Ocean Program provides a focal point through which the
     agency, together with other organizations with responsibilities for
     the coastal environment and its resources, can make significant
     strides toward finding the solutions that will protect coastal
     resources and ensure their availability and well-being for future
     generations.
