   The Space Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) is a long-running program to
   use amateur radio equipment on board NASA's Space Shuttle, the Russian
   MIR space station, and the International Space Station to involve
   students in exchanging questions and answers with astronauts on orbit.
   More than 200 schools have participated to date. It is also used to
   conduct communications experiments with amateur radio operators on the
   ground.
