   Introduction:
       The Galactic Emission Mapping Project plans to map the full sky at
   various radio and microwave wavelengths.  Mapping is planned or
   underway at 408MHz, 1465MHz, 2.3GHz, 5GHz, and 10GHz.  This information
   is useful in foreground mapping for CMB data analysis, as well as
   interesting in its own right.  This is not intended to be a detailed
   explanation of the GEM project.  For more information, please see:
   aether.lbl.gov/www/projects/gem/.
       Several UC Berkeley undergrads and summer visitors from other
   campuses are undertaking to build a 5GHz receiver for the GEM project,
   under the supervision of Dr. George Smoot at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.
