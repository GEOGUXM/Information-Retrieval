                    Welcome to Your New Home in Cyberspace!
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is a placeholder page installed by the Debian release of the
   Apache Web server package, because no home page was installed on this
   host. You may want to replace this as soon as possible with your own
   web pages, of course....

   Unless you changed its configuration, the server is configured as
   follows:
     * Configuration files can be found in /etc/apache.
     * The DocumentRoot, which is the directory under which all your HTML
       files should exist, is set to /var/www.
     * CGI scripts are looked for in /usr/lib/cgi-bin, which is where
       Debian packages will place their scripts.
     * Log files are placed in /var/log/apache, and will be rotated daily.
     * Files cached by the proxy server are stored in /var/cache/apache
       (but the proxy service is not enabled by default).
     * The default directory index is index.html, meaning that requests
       for a directory /foo/bar/ will give the contents of the file
       /var/www/foo/bar/index.html if it exists (assuming that /var/www is
       your DocumentRoot).
     * User directories are enabled, and user documents will be looked for
       in the public_html directory of the users' homes.

   All standard Apache modules are available with this release and can be
   chosen with the apacheconfig script. Installing a new module on your
   system is just a matter of compiling it (with the apache-dev package)
   and adding a line to your httpd.conf configuration file.

   More documentation on Apache can be found on:
     * The Apache documentation stored on your server.
     * The Apache project server.
     * The ApacheWeek server.
     * The NCSA server which documents the NCSA httpd from which the
       Apache server is derived.
     * The Debian Project Documentation which contains HOWTOs, FAQs, and
       software updates.

   You can also consult the list of World Wide Web Frequently Asked
   Questions for information.

   If you find a bug in this Apache package, or in Apache itself, please
   forward it to the maintainer of this package who will take appropriate
   action. Instructions on a formal way of doing that, and the list of
   known bugs of this package, can be found on the Debian bug tracking
   system.

   Thanks for using this package, and congratulations for your choice of a
   Debian system!
