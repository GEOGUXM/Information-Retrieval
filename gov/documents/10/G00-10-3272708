Right Pointer WHAT ARE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES?

   Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) advise the Department of Commerce
   on the technical parameters for export controls applicable to dual-use
   commodities and technology and on the administration of those controls.
   The TACs are composed of representatives from industry and Government
   representing diverse points of view on the concerns of the exporting
   community. Industry representatives are selected from firms producing a
   broad range of goods, technologies, and software presently controlled
   for national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short
   supply reasons or that are proposed for such controls, balanced to the
   extent possible among large and small firms.

Right Pointer HOW ARE MEMBERS CHOSEN?

   TAC members are appointed by the Secretary of Commerce and serve terms
   of not more than four consecutive years. The membership reflects the
   Department's commitment to attaining balance and diversity. TAC members
   must obtain secret-level clearances prior to appointment. These
   clearances are necessary so that members can be permitted access to
   relevant classified information needed in formulating recommendations
   to the Department of Commerce. Each TAC meets approximately 4 times per
   year. Members of the TACs will not be compensated for their services.
