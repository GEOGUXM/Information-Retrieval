   NOTICE! The PACER System will be OFFLINE for Communication Maintenance

   The United States District Court for the Western Pennsylvania District
   is currently a site providing Federal Court case information on the
   Internet. If you experience trouble accessing this site, traditional
   dial-up PACER is still available. Whichever way you access PACER, you
   will be required to use a login and password issued by the PACER
   Service Center. If you do not already have a PACER account, call (800)
   676-6856 or (210) 301-6440 to obtain a registration form. It takes
   about a week to receive an account from the PACER Service Center.

   There is a $0.07 per page charge for downloading case information on
   this system.

   The Judiciary is always open for suggestions for improvements from our
   electronic public access users. If you have comments or questions, send
   e-mail to the PACER Service Center at pacer@psc.uscourts.gov. Please
   include the name of the specific court you are referring to in your
   e-mail.
