   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an agency of the U.S. Department of
   the Interior, is the Nation's largest earth-science agency, and has the
   principal responsibility within the Federal government for providing
   hydrologic information and for appraising the quantity and quality of
   our Nation's water resources. The USGS is also the primary agency for
   geologic and biologic research and mapping of the Nation and its
   resources.
