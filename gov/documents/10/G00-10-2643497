   About NASA's Earth Observing System

   The Earth Observing System (EOS) is the centerpiece of NASA's Earth
   Science Enterprise (ESE). It consists of a science component and a data
   system supporting a coordinated series of polar-orbiting and low
   inclination satellites for long-term global observations of the land
   surface, biosphere, solid Earth, atmosphere, and oceans. By enabling
   improved understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, the EOS
   program has benefits for us all. The EOS Project Science Office
   (EOSPSO) is committed to helping bring program information and
   resources to program scientists and the general public alike.
   EOS Highlights
   updated November 7, 2001

   NASA/EOS IWG Meeting Information and Registration
   November 7- Information about the NASA/EOS IWG Meeting is available
   online. The meeting was held from October 30 to November 1, 2001, in
   San Antonio, Texas. Check out the meeting information page. The final
   IWG Meeting Agenda [PDF] is still available. Meeting minutes will be
   released soon.

   Global Deforestation Estimates Inaccurate
   May 30- Estimates of deforestation that are significantly better than
   those currently used by the United Nations are being created with data
   from NASA's Terra satellite. The new method for mapping tree cover was
   presented this week at the AGU meeting in Boston. More...

   New Maps Target Urban Sprawl
   May 30- New space-based maps of buildings and paved surfaces provide
   urban planners with insights into city growth and rainfall runoff
   impacts on water quality. The new maps based on Landsat 7 data were
   presented at the AGU meeting in Boston this week. More...

   Global Air Pollution Monitoring Begins
   May 30- The most complete view ever assembled of the world's air
   pollution has been produced by NASA's Terra spacecraft. For the first
   time, policymakers and scientists now have a way to identify the major
   sources of air pollution and can closely track where the pollution
   goes, anywhere on Earth. More...

   Wetter Upper Atmosphere May Slow Ozone Recovery
   April 17- Increasing water vapor in the stratosphere, which results
   partially from greenhouse gases, may delay ozone recovery and increase
   the rate of climate change. The new study by Drew Shindell of NASA's
   Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Geophysical Research Letters is
   the first to link greenhouse gases to increased ozone depletion over
   populated areas. More...
