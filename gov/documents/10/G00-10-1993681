   Weather and Aviation Safety
   Weather is recognized as a major contributing factor in aviation
   incidents and accidents.

   Presidential Challenge
   On February 12, 1997, President Clinton announced the National Aviation
   Safety Goal for an 80% reduction in the rate of fatal accidents within
   10 years and a 90% reduction in 20 years.

   NASA Response
   In order to meet the Safety Goal, government and industry experts
   determined that a significant effort in weather accident prevention was
   necessary, resulting in in a key element of the NASA Aviation Safety
   Program (AvSP). The weather team of experts ranked weather data
   dissemination as the most critical to reduce weather-related aviation
   accidents. As part of the AvSP, NASA Glenn Research Center is leading
   the WINCOMM (Weather Information Communications) element.

   The Role of WINCOMM
   In support of weather accident prevention (WxAP), WINCOMM is developing
   advanced communications and information technologies to enable high
   quality and timely dissemination of intuitive aviation weather
   information. These aeronautical communications technologies will
   benefit both the national and global aviation communities.
