   Contact the Senator

   Welcome

   Senator John Warner Welcome, you have reached my Senate office inside
   the World Wide Web. I hope that this web site will provide you with the
   information necessary to keep you up to date on my activities and
   services as a United States Senator. I work to serve the Commonwealth
   of Virginia as well as America. As always, I look forward to hearing
   from the people of Virginia about legislation or other matters that
   affect your families and communities. Please feel free to contact my
   office. You can reach me by mail at 225 Russell Senate Office Building,
   Washington, DC 20510 or call my office at 202-224-2023. You can also
   contact my office via email message.

   Legislative Priorites
     __________________________________________________________________

   Currently, I am focused on national defense, the economy, education,
   and healthcare issues, (among many others) that are of utmost
   importance to Virginia and the nation. As ranking member of the Senate
   Armed Services Committee, my top responsibility is to strengthen
   America's military and improve healthcare and the overall quality of
   life for the men, women, and families of the United States Armed
   Forces. In addition, as a key member of the U.S. Senate education
   committee I am working hard to improve our educational system at all
   levels. Reforming the federal role in healthcare requires the Congress
   to responsibly expand the number of Americans with healthcare, while
   working to increase the number of people who have prescription drug
   benefits. Of course, protecting and preserving the environment remains
   a top priority.

   Congress not in session.
