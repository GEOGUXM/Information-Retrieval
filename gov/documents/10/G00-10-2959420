   Welcome to the Community Health Status Indicators Web site. In response
   to requests for health assessment information at the local level, HRSA
   has funded a collaboration among the Association of State and
   Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the National Association of
   County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and the Public Health
   Foundation (PHF) to publish reports for all 3,082 U.S. counties.
