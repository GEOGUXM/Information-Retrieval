        Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology

   The Frequency Standards Laboratory houses the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration's (NASA) Lead Center for Frequency and Time. The
   Laboratory supplies NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) with the hardware,
   expertise and technology for state-of-the-art frequency standards,
   clocks, distribution networks, and time synchronization to enable deep
   space navigation and advanced radio science experiments.

   The Laboratory is home to two Groups in JPL's Section 335.  For more
   information see:
     * Quantum Sciences and Technology Group,

   and also:
     * Frequency and Timing Advanced Development Group.
