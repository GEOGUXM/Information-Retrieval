   IMAGE will use neutral atom, ultraviolet, and radio imaging techniques
   to:
     * Identify the dominant mechanisms for injecting plasma into the
       magnetosphere on substorm and magnetic storm time scales;
     * Determine the directly driven response of the magnetosphere to
       solar wind changes; and,
     * Discover how and where magnetospheric plasmas are energized,
       transported, and subsequently lost during substorms and magnetic
       storms.
