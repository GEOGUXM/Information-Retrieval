                        The IDL Astronomy User's Library

   The IDL Astronomy Users Library is a central repository for low-level
   astronomy software written in the commercial language IDL. The Library
   is not meant to be an integrated package, but rather is a collection of
   procedures from which users can pick and choose (and possibly modify)
   for their own use. Submitted procedures are given a cursory testing,
   but are basically stored in the Library as submitted.
   Instrument-specific software is generally not included in the IDL
   Astronomy Library, but can be found at the Links to Other Astronomy and
   IDL related sites.

   The entire contents of the Library can be downloaded in a tar file or
   in a .zip file from the the FTP site . Additional software, not
   included in the tar files, is available in a contrib directory.
   Individual procedures can be copied by browsing through a list of
   one-line descriptions. Changes to the contents of the Library are
   recorded in a news file.

   Documentation is available describing the various options for working
   with FITS data in IDL.

   The IDL Astronomy Library requires at least V5.1, and uses the square
   subscript notation introduced in IDL V5.0. However, a separate version
   of the Library that works with earlier versions of IDL is available at
   the FTP site

   The success of the IDL Astronomy User's Library depends on the
   willingness of users to give as well as take. Please inform Wayne
   Landsman of any possible contributions to the Library, programming bugs
   or documentation errors, or of relevant web sites.
