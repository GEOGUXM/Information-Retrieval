Objective:

   The primary objectives of the facility is to test theoretical results
   and to collect empirical data for the development of remote sensing
   techniques, in support of microwave remote sensor development and
   algorithms for air-sea interaction studies.

The Facility:

   The main wind-wave-current interaction test section is 60 feet (18.29
   meters) long, 4 feet (1.22 meters) high, and 3 feet (.91 meters) wide,
   filled to a water depth of 2.5 feet (.76 meters), with 1.5 feet (.45
   meters) remaining for air flow. The facility is capable of winds up to
   50 knots (about 25 meters/sec), along with water current in either
   direction of about .5 knot (51 centimeters/sec) generated by pumping
   100 gallons/sec through the facility's 16 inch pipes. Electronically
   controlled hydraulic units at both ends of the tank can generate any
   wave frequency or pattern up to 10 Hz. The computer control of wind,
   current, and hydraulic wave generating units can accurately repeat
   unsteady phenomena to allow its statistical study, as well as automate
   the facility operation. Support to the External Community Through
   Cooperative Investigations:

   These efforts have generated over 60 peer reviewed publications during
   the past 26 years, with over 100 citations during the past 5 years.

   Doctoral and post-doctoral research fellows from Harvard, University of
   Heidelberg, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and two from the Johns
   Hopkins University, have performed thesis work at the Facility.

   The Facility has also conducted outreach programs for local SHARP
   students, Earthwatch Foundation High Ability High School Students, the
   U.S. Coast Guard Academy Senior Science Students Program, Elderhostel,
   enrichment programs for science teachers, and summer mentoring programs
   for gifted science & engineering undergraduate students.

HHT / EMD: A New Approach to Nonlinear / Non-Stationary Time Series Analysis

   The Hilbert / Huang Transform (HHT) and the Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EMD) technique describe the new, robust approach to the
   analysis of nonlinear and/or non-stationary data that has been recently
   developed, patented, and published in:

   nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis, by Norden E. Huang,

   Long at the mail or e-mail address below. The software techniques are
   now covered by multiple U.S. Patents (both approved and pending)
   granted to NASA, and licensed for distribution and use through licensed

FEDS.98, The Flux Exchange Dynamics Experiment

   The NASA Air-Sea Interaction Research Facility and its manager Dr.
   Steven R. Long hosted a large joint experiment during the fall of 1998
   at the NASA GSFC / Wallops Flight Facility. Known as FEDS.98, the Flux
   Exchange Dynamics Study is a cooperative effort involving NASA Goddard
   Space Flight Center's Laboratory for Hydrospheric
   Processes/Observational Science Branch at Wallops Flight Facility, the
   University of Washington's (UW/APL) Applied Physics Laboratory, the
   University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (URI/GSO),
   Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), the University of Toronto,
   Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), as well as faculty and
   students from the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Johns Hopkins
   University, and Columbia University. After extensive planning, team
   visits to NASIRF, and a series of introductory experiments as tests of
   equipment and methods over almost a two year period, the culminating
   set of experiments were carried out during the weeks between the end of
   October and the middle of December 1998. The experiment was driven by
   the need to know 1.) the fluxes or movements of gases, such as CO2,
   through the ocean-atmosphere interface, which has relevance to the role
   played by the oceans in global warming, 2.) How fluxes of gases and
   heat through the interface depend upon the stability of the air
   boundary layer next to the sea surface. This has importance in NASA's
   earth observation and climate modeling efforts in specific, and in
   general for our planning efforts to outline a national response to
   climate change.
