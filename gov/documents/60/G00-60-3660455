     __________________________________________________________________

     The "What's New" section of the NHTSA home page now contains a list
     of the information added or revised on the web site as it occurs.
     Jobs, Events, and Press Releases are not included in this list. This
     replaces our previous format of monthly updates to "What's New."
     "What's Hot" continues to highlight those items that are in the news
     or are of particular significance and interest to the public.
