   In February 1996 the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation
   Council (EFSEC) received an application from the Olympic Pipe Line
   Company (OPL)  to construct and operate a 230-mile petroleum products
   pipeline in six Washington counties.

   The first phase of the Council's adjudication regarding the proposal
   began in April 1999. By letter dated June 25, 1999, OPL withdrew
   Application No. 96-1. EFSEC consequently ending review of the project.

   Project Review

   In February 1996 the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation
   Council (EFSEC) received an application from the Olympic Pipe Line
   Company to construct a 230-mile petroleum products pipeline from
   Thrasher's Corner in Snohomish County to Pasco (Map - 216k). EFSEC
   reviewed the application and in April 1996 submitted comments to the
   Olympic Pipe Line Company. Throughout 1997 Olympic Pipe Line Company
   submitted additional information to EFSEC.  EFSEC and the cooperating
   federal agencies issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in
   September 1998.  EFSEC began adjudicative hearings during the Spring of
   1999.  In June 1999 OPL withdrew the application and review of the
   project by EFSEC was terminated.

   Revised Application Submitted

   In May 1998 Olympic Pipeline Company submitted a revised application.
   The revised application adds additional technical information and data
   collected by the applicant during 1997 and 1998.  The pipeline
   alignment was modified in some areas, predominately east of Kittitas to
   the Columbia River.  The proposed route was moved north of I-90 (rather
   than along the border of the Yakima Firing Range) and several
   alternatives were proposed for crossing the Columbia River.  The
   revised Summary pdficonsmall.gif (153 bytes) outlines the proposed
   project.  The Table of Contents links to PDF files of the revised
   application.   It should be noted that most of the maps and figures are
   not available on this archive.

   Environmental Impact Statement

   Under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), EFSEC was required to
   prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to study  the purpose
   and need of the project, alternatives, and its impacts on the
   environment. Because the proposed route crossed federal lands and
   required federal permits, the EIS was prepared jointly with the lead
   federal agency, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), as required by the
   National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

   EFSEC and the cooperating federal agencies issued a draft EIS in
   September 1998. Comments on the draft EIS were due December 17, 1998.
   EFSEC and the cooperating federal agencies held public meetings along
   the pipeline route to receive oral or written comments from the public
   about the draft EIS. The cooperating EIS agencies planned to review any
   new information resulting from EFSEC's adjudicative hearings planned
   for the Spring of 1999. The SEPA/NEPA EIS process was terminated in
   June 1999 when OPL withdrew the Application.

   For more information on the EIS review process see the following pages:

   Adjudicative Proceeding

   In addition to preparing an EIS, the Council began conducting an
   Adjudicative Proceeding for this project in April 1999.   The Council
   scheduled formal adjudicative hearings similar to a trial, with
   testimony by expert witness and cross-examination of the witnesses.
   EFSEC has issued several Administrative Orders regarding adjudicative
   and procedural matters.

   For additional information and documents relating to the Adjudicative
   process and hearings, see the following pages:

       received by EFSEC, Pre-hearing Conference Orders, Council Orders,
       and Olympic Pipeline Company's Letter of Application Withdrawal.

       Testimony, Stipulations, Opening Statements.
