   653-5123 Awards for CDF Sacramento- January 22, 2002 was a day of
   accolades for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
   (CDF) as the department brought home the first place trophy in the
   Governor's Clarity Awards competition and CDF Assistant Chief Dale
   Eberhart won the National Safety Center's award for innovation in
   workplace safety training. The CDF brochure "Homeowner's Checklist:
   Make your Home Fire Safe" tied for first place with the entry from the
   Department of Industrial Relations. The checklist is an easy to follow
   guide for making a home "Fire Safe" inside and out. It was created by
   the CDF Public Education Unit and is distributed around the state as
   part of the department's Fire Safe California! program. Chief Eberhart
   was recognized for "individual accomplishment in promoting innovative
   ways to teach work place safety" for his creation of the CDF Distance
   Learning Program. This computer program provides a low cost and
   effective method for CDF to train its firefighters in the latest safety
   techniques. "This is a great example of the administration's efforts to
   make government accessible to the public," said CDF Director Andrea
   Tuttle. "We are honored to receive this recognition of our continuing
   efforts to help people keep their homes fire safe." The crystal and
   wood Clarity Award will be prominently placed in the Director's office
   at CDF Sacramento Headquarters. ###
