       Notice of Deposition must contain all the relevant case information
       from your Court including pertinent information the party being
       subpoenaed will need to know
       *Letters Rogatory and/or Commission to examine witnesses are also
       acceptable.*

       and will be assigned a miscellaneous case number. A copy should
       also be included for each party to be served.
     * A filing fee of $25 is required to file "Notice of Deposition".
       Check or money order should be payable to The District Court.
     * Subpoenas: Include two copies of the subpoena for each party to be
       served. One for the party being served and one to be returned to
       the court (or attorney) with a return of service. The Court will
       issue the subpoenas before they are served. Make enough copies of
       the subpoena necessary for your case.
     * If desired, select a constable or the Sheriff's office to serve
       your papers.(see listing) If we have this information at time of

       payment of the fee with the constable or Sheriff is required.

                      deposition with this procedure.**
