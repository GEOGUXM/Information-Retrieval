                            Copyright-An Overview

   Several of the Cooperative Agreement Teams have asked RSPAC questions
   about copyright. This overview describes some of the basic tenets of
   copyright law. It is not in any way a comprehensive summary of this
   area of law. It also describes what RSPAC can and cannot do to help
   with copyright issues, and lists other sources of information.

   The excerpts below are taken from "Intellectual Property and the
   National Information Infrastructure, the Report of the Working Group on
   Intellectual Property Rights," a US Government publication. This
   document provides extensive background on copyright law which you may
   want review in its entirety. It is available at
   http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/.

                               Executive Summary

   Copyright law is alive and well on the Internet. For example, computer
   software, graphics, and HTML pages can all be copyrighted, and if you
   take them, you might be guilty of copyright infringement. Each
   Cooperative Agreement Team also has an individual agreement with NASA,
   and possibly individual agreements between the Team members, which can
   all bear on copyright issues. The best source of guidance for specific
   copyright questions is the legal staff of your own organization, who
   can be made aware of all your facts and advise you on your own
   individual situation. TRW is not counsel to your Teams and therefore
   cannot provide legal advice.

                               What is Copyright?

   Copyright exists in "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible
   medium of expression." (p. 24)

   "The Copyright Act specifically excludes from protectible subject
   matter any `idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation,
   concept, principle or discovery' even if it meets the criteria for
   protection." (p. 24)

   Categories of copyright-protectible works:
    1. literary works (This includes, among other things, computer
       programs and databases. Computer programs are defined as a "set of
       statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
       computer in order to bring about a certain result." [p. 38])
    2. musical works, including any accompanying words
    3. dramatic works, including any accompanying music
    4. pantomimes and choreographic works
    5. pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
    6. motion pictures and other audiovisual works
    7. sound recordings
    8. architectural works (p. 37)

   There are "three basic requirements for copyright protection --
   originality, creativity and fixation." (p. 24)

   Originality means the work "must be one of independent creation --
   i.e., not copied from another. There is no requirement that the work be
   novel, ...unique or ingenious." (p. 25)

   Creativity means the work must have a "modicum of creativity. The level
   required is exceedingly low; `even a slight amount will suffice.'" (p.
   25)

   Fixation means it "is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to
   be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of
   more than transitory duration." (p. 25) Fixation includes, among other
   things, "floppy disks, compact discs (CDs), CD-ROMs, optical disks,
   compact discs-interactive (CD-Is), digital tape, and other digital
   storage devices" and even RAM "has been found to be sufficient
   fixation." (pp. 27, 29)

   Copyright "protection literally begins when, for instance, the ink
   dries on the paper. There are no prerequisites, such as registration or
   affixation of a copyright notice, for obtaining or enjoying copyright
   protection." (p. 25) "Copyright protection generally is not extended
   under the Copyright Act to works of the US Government." (p. 36) "There
   are limited exceptions to this non-copyrightability provision." (p. 36)
   The relationship between the rights of the US Government and the rights
   of a contractor/grant recipient/cooperative agreement participant are
   dependent on the particular contract/grant/agreement.

                  What are some of a copyright owner's rights?

   "The copyright owner's exclusive rights include:
    1. to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;
    2. to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;
    3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
       public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease,
       or lending;
    4. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
       works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works,
       to perform the copyrighted work publicly; and
    5. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic
       works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works,
       including the individual images of a motion picture or other
       audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly." (pp.
       66-67)

   The copyright owner also has the right to authorize and prevent others
   from exercising any of the exclusive rights above. (p. 48)

   There are time periods associated with these rights. (p. 62)

         Are there limitations on a copyright owner's exclusive rights?

   There are also limitations on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.
   These limitations include (but are not limited to) fair use, library
   exemptions, first sale doctrine, and educational use exemptions.

   Fair use may be claimed as "an affirmative defense to an action for
   copyright infringement...for purposes such as criticism, comment, news
   reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
   scholarship or research... In determining whether the use made of a
   work in any particular case is a fair use, the factors to be considered
   shall include -
    1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
       of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
    2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
    3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
       the copyrighted work as a whole; and
    4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
       copyrighted work." (pp. 77-78)

   Fair use determinations are best left to experienced legal counsel.

                        What is copyright infringement?

   "Anyone who, without the authorization of the copyright owner,
   exercises any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner, as granted
   and limited by the Copyright Act, is an infringer of copyright." (p.
   106)

   Different levels of copyright liability include direct, contributory,
   and vicarious. Liabilities may include but are not limited to, direct
   performance of the infringement, contributing to the infringing
   activity, and supervisory role "connection to the direct infringer."
   (pp. 115-117)

   It is also not a defense to claim ignorance. "Copyright infringement is
   determined without regard to the intent or state of mind of the
   infringer; 'innocent' infringement is infringement nonetheless." (p.
   106.)

                  How can I tell if something is copyrighted?

   At first glance, you probably can't. Copyrighted material created after
   1989 is no longer required to have a Â© symbol or any other notice to be
   copyrighted. In addition, registration with the Copyright Office is not
   "a prerequisite to the grant of exclusive rights. It is, however,
   generally a prerequisite to the enforcement of those rights in court."
   (p. 64)

   In general, the best way to discover the copyright of a work is to do
   research. You can consult with your attorney. You may also start with
   where you found the work in the first place - the publisher or
   Webmaster. You can also investigate the Copyright Clearance Center
   online (http://www.copyright.com/) or search the Copyright Office's
   records (http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/rb.html).

                   How can RSPAC help with copyright issues?

   RSPAC's support is limited, because we cannot provide specific legal
   Advice, nor are we familiar with the details of each individual
   cooperative agreement and the facts of each situation.

                       Where can I get more information?

   The best source of information is your organization's own legal
   department. In general, they are paid to be helpful and look out for
   your interests and those of your organization.

   There is a also great deal of copyright and other legal information on
   the Internet. Each party must independently determine the usefulness of
   any of these resources. TRW is not connected with any of these sites.
   Some starters include:

   Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure, the
   Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights
   (http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/). This is an excellent treatment of
   copyright law, intellectual property, and how they relate to the NII.
   It includes recommended changes to the current laws. It is also very
   long (250+ pages).

   Information Policy Committee of the IITF
   (gopher://ntiant1.ntia.doc.gov/11s/iitf/infopol). Here you can find
   other information about the Intellectual Property working group and the
   Privacy working group, both under the Information Policy Committee.

   The US Copyright Office Home Page (http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/).
   This is the official source of information, and includes things like
   copyright basics, copyright registration, and how to search the
   Copyright Office's records.

   WWW Multimedia Law (http://www.batnet.com/oikoumene/). This is a large
   and useful site with pointers to most legal items of interest. It
   covers many areas of law beyond multimedia.

   The Legal List (http://www.lcp.com/The-Legal-List/TLL-home.html). This
   is a large list of all things legal that you can find on the Internet
   and other online services, including listserves, BBSs, and Usenet
   groups.

   CyberLaw^TM and CyberLex^TM (http://www.cyberlaw.com/). At this site
   you can sign up for an e-mail service that will send you monthly
   summaries of legal issues concerning computer technology and the
   computer industry.
