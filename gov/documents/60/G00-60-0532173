         The Role of DOE in the National Nanotechnology Initiative:

   "The DOE has a stunning portfolio of research and scientific user
   facilities devoted to visualizing, characterizing, and controlling the
   nanoworld - from atoms and molecules to bulk materials - which makes
   the Department's research capabilities unique in the world. The DOE is
   currently making a broad range of contributions in these areas. For
   example, the enhanced properties of nanocrystals for novel catalysts,
   tailored light emission and propagation, nanocomposites and
   supercapacitors are all being explored. Nanocrystals and layered
   structures offer unique opportunities for tailoring the optical,
   magnetic, electronic, mechanical and chemical properties of materials,
   and DOE researchers are have synthesized layered structures for
   electronics, novel magnets, and surfaces with tailored hardness.
   Specific examples of past accomplishments at DOE include:
     * Addition of aluminum oxide nanoparticles that converts aluminum
       metal into a material with wear resistance equal to that of the
       best bearing steel
     * Novel optical properties of semiconducting nanocrystals that are
       used to label and track molecular processes in living cells
     * Nanoscale layered materials that can yield a four-fold increase in
       the performance of permanent magnets
     * Layered quantum well structures to produce highly efficient,
       low-power light sources and photovoltaic cells
     * Novel chemical properties of nanocrystals that show promise as
       photocatalysts to speed the breakdown of toxic wastes
     * Meso-porous inorganic hosts with self-assembled organic monolayers
       that are used to trap and remove heavy metals from the environment

   The DOE also maintains a large array of major national user facilities
   that are ideally suited to nanoscience discovery and to developing a
   fundamental understanding of nanoscale processes. Large computational
   facilities at DOE will also be key contributors in nanoscience
   discovery, modeling and understanding.

   National Nanotechnology Initiative Research at the DOE:

   Major new efforts in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology at
   the Department of Energy will take advantage of opportunities afforded
   by recent advances. These efforts will be part of the Basic Energy
   Sciences (BES) program and have the following broad goals:
   (1) to attain a fundamental scientific understanding of nanoscale
   phenomena, particularly collective phenomena;
   (2) to achieve the ability to design and synthesize materials at the
   atomic level to produce materials with desired properties and
   functions;
   (3) to attain a fundamental understanding of the processes by which
   living organisms create materials and functional complexes to serve as
   a guide and a benchmark by which to measure our progress in synthetic
   design and synthesis; and
   (4) to develop experimental characterization tools and
   theory/modeling/simulation tools necessary to drive the nanoscale
   revolution.

   The principal missions of DOE in science, energy, defense, and
   environment will benefit greatly from developments in these areas. For
   example, nanoscale synthesis and assembly methods will result in
   significant improvements in solar energy conversion; more
   energy-efficient lighting; stronger, lighter materials that will
   improve efficiency in transportation; greatly improved chemical and
   biological sensing; use of low-energy chemical pathways to break down
   toxic substances for environmental remediation and restoration; and
   better sensors and controls to increase efficiency in manufacturing."
