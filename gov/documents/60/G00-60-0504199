   The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory National
   Security Division is dedicated to the delivery of science and
   engineered solutions that counter threats to the security of our nation
   - its people, infrastructure, and environment.

   Our mission is driven by policies that reflect the increasingly complex
   global environment since the Cold War. Although the threat of global
   conflict is reduced, regional instabilities fuel the potential for
   nuclear proliferation and terrorist deployment of weapons of mass
   destruction.

   Theft or diversion of nuclear weapons or materials is a
   well-established threat to national security. Greater technical
   sophistication of terrorists provides a mounting threat to the U.S.
   population and infrastructure. As a result, the Department of Energy
   and other branches of the federal government are increasing their focus
   on threat mitigation.

   The National Security Division of the INEEL is well positioned to
   address the needs of the Department of Energy and other federal
   agencies. The Division focuses its considerable scientific and
   engineering expertise and experience on four problem areas:
     * Nonproliferation and Demilitarization
     * Counter-Terrorism and Law Enforcement
     * Integrated Defense Systems
     * Environmental Security

   Additionally, National Security experts solve national and
   international programmatic challenges though cutting-edge deployment of
   INEEL-developed information technologies in the areas of:
     * Advanced Information Systems
     * Software and Electronics Research and Development
