   Our newest team members Eric Boerner (Website Admin) and Michael Kurth
   (Server Administrator) begin construction of a new website. The new
   site will take advantage of the latest technology giving you faster
   data, easier navigation, and a much cleaner look.

   The MDEP Program has moved its office location from Ft. Irwin Ca. to
   Barstow Ca. We have aquired a new T1 connection (1.54 Mbps) during the
   move. This will allow us to serve our clients data for the Mojave
   EcoRegion 10 to 20 times faster than before. The move has also changed
   the way we do some of our business. Please take note of these changes.
