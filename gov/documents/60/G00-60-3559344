      Recovering money for government

      Recoup improper charges from your telecommunications providers,
      accounts payable, utilities, freight and real estate leases, and more.
      FAST's Audit Recovery Services takes the time and expense out of the
      auditing process.

      With FAST, there's absolutely no risk, no hassle, no charge, and no
      audit-time headaches. Our Audit Recovery Services team contracts with
      several major, highly reputable auditing firms. These firms receive as
      compensation for their services a small portion of any funds recovered,
      while your agency receives the remaining recovered funds. And because
      our Audit Recovery Services team works with these firms on your behalf,
      we, not you, manage the contract and resolve all issues related to your
      audit. Your agency's personnel remain free to proceed with business as
      usual.

      FAST's Audit Recovery Service is also a useful tool for updating
      accounts, so that future overcharges are avoided.

      A FAST audit lets your agency recoup monies lost to:
        * Overcharged monthly fees
        * Taxes
        * Accounting errors
        * Duplicate payments
        * Incorrect tariff charges unapplied payments
        * Incorrect equipment charges
        * Unposted credits
        * Failure to provide volume discounts

      (The Audit Recovery Program also has fee-for-service options for
      special projects such as "Closeout of Federal Contract Files.")

      A simple Interagency Agreement begins the process.
      When you work with FAST, you bypass the costly and time-consuming
      competitive bidding process. You complete a simple Interagency
      Agreement, and our Audit Recovery Services team takes over from there.
      We make arrangements with a leading accounting firm to conduct all
      aspects of your audit, so your staff does not spend their valuable time
      on audit-related activities.

      Contact us today and see how we can help you recover any overcharges.
