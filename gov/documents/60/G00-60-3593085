      In the box next to 'Search for', please enter a keyword or phrase you
      want to find. The word you use should be specific. If you use child,
      children, family, or families, your search results will include nearly
      all of our materials. You can narrow your results by selecting the
      'Case sensitive' or 'Partial match' boxes. You can also limit the
      number of files returned by limiting the number of days in which files
      have been changed. You can limit the maximum number of files returned
      or maximum number of matches per file returned. Once you are satisfied
      with your selections, click the 'Submit' button.

      Follow these tips to get better search results.

      Word or words to search for:
      Type in the keyword or phrases you want to find.

        * Use a semi-colon (;) to find two or more keywords or phrases. For
          example, welfare; child support gives you documents where both
          welfare and child support are mentioned.
        * Use a semi-colon and tilde (;~) to exclude words from your search.
          For example, child support; ~paternity gives you results about
          child support that do not address paternity.

   Case sensitive:
   Check the 'Case sensitive' box if you want specific words only in
       upper, lower, or title case. For example, entering Temporary
       Assistance with the 'Case sensitive' box checked would give you
       items that describe the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
       program, but not documents about temporary assistance in general.

   Partial match:
   If you want to find different letter combinations, type the first few
       characters of a word in the 'Search for' box, then check the
       'Partial match' box. For example, wel with the partial match box
       checked would give you documents including well, welfare, and
       wellness.

   Return only files changed within the last:
   If youre looking for the most recently updated file, specify the number
       of days you want to cover in your search.

   Maximum number of files returned:
   This lets you limit the number of documents to be returned in your
       search result from 1 to 1,000.

   Maximum number of matches per file returned:
   This option allows you to select how many times a term or word within a
       single file or document is to be included in your search.
