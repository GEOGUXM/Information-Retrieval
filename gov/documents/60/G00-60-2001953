   Mission
   The mission of the Damage Assessment and Restoration Program (DARP) is
   to restore coastal and marine resources that have been injured by
   releases of oil or hazardous substances and to obtain compensation for
   the public's lost use and enjoyment of these resources.

   A Brief History
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established
   the Damage Assessment and Restoration Program in 1990 to fulfill
   natural resource trustee responsibilities assigned in the Clean Water
   Act (CWA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
   Liability Act (CERCLA, also referred to as Superfund Act), the Oil
   Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), and the National Marine Sanctuaries Act
   (NMSA) and other federal laws. NOAA's unique interdisciplinary approach
   to natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) and restoration was shaped
   by over a decade of assessing injured coastal and marine resources,
   including those resources affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
   March 1989.

   Activities
   NOAA's damage assessment and restoration activities address injuries
   resulting from three types of incidents:
     * long-term releases of hazardous substances and oil spills;
     * catastrophic spills -- primarily oil; and
     * physical injury to National Marine Sanctuary resources (e.g., ship
       groundings on coral reefs)

   To deal with this array of circumstances, NOAA has assembled a
   multi-disciplinary team of natural scientists, resource economists and
   lawyers qualified to:
     * evaluate toxic releases;
     * assess and quantify injuries;
     * recover damages through negotiation or litigation;
     * develop and evaluate restoration alternatives; and
     * implement successful restoration strategies.

   DARP plans and implements all restoration projects that result from
   damage assessments, develops restoration alternatives as part of the
   damage assessment process and evaluates the effectiveness of
   restoration projects through monitoring. Since the creation of the
   program, more than two dozen natural resource damage assessment cases
   have been settled and restoration is underway. NOAA's experience to
   date demonstrates the benefits of DARP, including: holding the polluter
   responsible for harmful actions; leveraging taxpayer dollars for
   environmental restoration; advancing the state of the art and
   integration of environmental science, economics and law; and restoring
   injured coastal and marine resources.

NOAA's Natural Resource Trustee Role

   Stewardship of the Nation's natural resources is shared among several
   Federal agencies, states and tribal trustees.

   NOAA's trust resources include:
     * sediment and water quality
     * anadromous species (fish, like salmon, that spawn in freshwater and
       then migrate
       to the sea);
     * commercial and recreational fishery resources;
     * endangered and threatened marine species and their habitats (e.g.,
       sea turtles);
     * marine mammals (e.g., whales, dolphins and seals);
     * marshes, mangroves, sea grass beds, coral reefs, and other coastal
       habitats; and
     * all resources associated with National Marine Sanctuaries and
       National Estuarine Research Reserves (e.g., coral reefs and sea
       grasses).

   NOAA provides an integrated approach to natural resource damage
   assessment and restoration. Where possible, NOAA negotiates cooperative
   settlements with the parties responsible for the injury, minimizing
   litigation. By working together with responsible parties and
   co-trustees to collect data, conduct assessments and carry out
   restoration actions, NOAA works to restore a clean and healthy
   environment as quickly and effectively as possible.
