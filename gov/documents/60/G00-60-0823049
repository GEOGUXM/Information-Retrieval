                     Special Report: Your Insured Money

   Seventy years ago, if a bank failed, you could have lost everything.
   Today, deposits in a single institution are insured by the government
   for up to $100,000or more, in fact, if the money is divided among
   different categories of accounts. But qualifying for this extra
   coverage can be complicated. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   (FDIC) wants consumers to read the fine print, especially if they have
   more than $100,000 on deposit in one bank. For details, check out the
   FDIC booklet Special Report: Are You Sure You're Fully Insured?

   To get your free booklet, and a free catalog listing more than 200
   valuable consumer publications, just fill in your name and address on
   our special order form or call toll free 1-888-8-PUEBLO, (that's

   FRAUD ON THE INTERNET

   The Internet has made life easier for everyone Â– including crooks. Now

       U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to learn where fraudulent
       investment opportunities are most likely to pop up, how you can get
