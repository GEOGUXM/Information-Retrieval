   The mission of the FBI Las Vegas Division's Community Outreach Program
   is to provide a comprehensive effort with local community coalitions
   and to address multiple problems, including crime, drugs, gangs, and
   violence in support of our investigative mission.

   The Las Vegas Division's Adopt-A-School/Junior Special Agent Program,
   called the Law Enforcement Club (LEC), has just entered its third year
   at Theron Swainston Middle School.  Thirty-seven 7th-grade students
   were selected to participate in 17 Sessions beginning in October. At
   each session, FBI employees demonstrate procedures such as evidence
   identification, collection, and maintenance; fingerprinting; hostage
   negotiations; computer crime, and polygraphing.

   Through a point system, students have the opportunity to earn FBI
   "badges," notebooks, pens, backpacks, and caps.

   LEC program Swainston students who participated in prior LEC programs
   have formed an Alumni LEC. LEC students participate with FBI employees
   in many community activities, including the Dr. Martin Luther King Day,
   Jr. Parade in January, Instructors' Aides in LEC Sessions, and joining
   division employees at community events and programs. Students are shown
   making a banner for the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Parade.

    We are proud to actively participate in community events such as Las
   Vegas Boys and Girls Clubs activities, the Annual African-American
   Student Conference, Leadership Las Vegas Youth, Dr. Martin Luther King,
   Jr. parade, and Expanding Your Horizons for Girls in Science and Math.
   The Las Vegas Division's Community Outreach Coordinator serves on local
   boards, councils and community coalitions to include the Clark County
   School District's School-Community Safety Committee, the
   Partnership/Focus Program and the Mentoring Coalition; the BEST
   Coalition, Seniors and Law Enforcement Together (SALT) and the Z Square
   Committee.
