                 Selected Environmental Laws / Update / Tip


   Selected
   Environmental
   Laws The Selected List of Environmental Laws is taken from the text of
   the U.S. Code. Several of the most frequently accessed environmental
   laws are listed alphabetically by popular title. The text of each law
   is available for searching under the database name "Selected
   Environmental Laws". The laws contained in this database are listed
   below:


   Clean Air Act Clean Water Act Comprehensive Environmental Response,
   Compensation, and Liability Act Coastal Zone Management Act
   Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act Endangered Species
   Act Federal Facilities Compliance Act Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
   and Rodenticide Act
   Marine Mammal Protection Act Marine Protection, Research, and
   Sanctuaries Act National Environmental Policy Act Noise Control Act
   Oil Pollution Act Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Safe Drinking
   Water Act Toxic Substances Control Act


   Update The U.S. Code information located in EnviroText, including the
          Environmental Laws database, is updated as new compilations become
          available from the Law Revision Counsel.
            __________________________________________________________________

   Tip    Searches in the Environmental Laws database can be defined by (1)
          citation, and (2) subject. For example, if you performed the search
          watershed monitoring, you would retrieve any entries that contained
          either "watershed" or "monitoring", or both. As illustrated in this
          example, it is not necessary to include words such as AND, OR or NOT
          because they will be deleted by the filtering process of the search
          engine. Additionally, quotations may be used if you are interested in
          retrieving a specific phrase (i.e., "42 USC 9601").
