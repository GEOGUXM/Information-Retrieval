   1997-98 El Niño Coastal Monitoring Sites During late January and early
   February of 1998, the California Coast was hit by a series of powerful
   El Niño winter storms. At least 27 counties in California were declared
   National Disaster Areas, with hundreds of millions of dollars in
   property losses. Large waves, which coincided with high tides and
   elevated sea levels, produced severe beach erosion.

   USGS researchers and students from University of California at Santa
   Cruz have been conducting beach surveys and monitoring changes in
   coastal morphology since early October 1997. Up to 4 meters of vertical
   beach loss was measured on several Monterey Bay beaches between October
   and mid-February and many beaches were completely submerged during high
   tides. Historical structures that had been buried since 1983, such as
   wharf pilings, old seawalls, and trolley car trestles, became emergent
   on several Monterey Bay beaches.

   Coastal protection structures emplaced following the 1982-83 El Niño
   winter were mostly successful in mitigating coastal property loss due
   to wave attack and inundation. Most property damage was the result of
   the high rainfall amounts which caused flooding and landslides.
