   Dignitaries from seven African nations and United States politicians
   and business leaders met this past month in Indianapolis, Indiana to
   promote global economic development in Africa and to strengthen
   long-term relationships between Africa and the United States. The
   symposium offered seminars related to doing business in the Continent
   of Africa. Topics included an overview of US/Africa trade policies,
   initiatives and concerns; business opportunities available; and
   networking.

   The Symposium included information panels describing the various
   regions in the continent. The purpose of the exhibit, created by
   community volunteers, was to describe the variety of cultures
   throughout the continent.

   Exhibitors at the Symposium shared information that would be helpful
   for investors. The Langley booth featured information on the Surface
   Solar Energy Data Set. This data is used for more efficient
   construction of solar energy systems.

   The meetings culminated with a dinner for the participants. The keynote

   The FIRE Arctic Cloud Science Team met in Boulder, Colorado to complete
   final planning for the upcoming FIRE Arctic Cloud Experiment (FIRE ACE)
   to be executed this spring and summer in Alaska. FIRE ACE is one of two
   components in the FIRE III experiment. The other is the Tropical Cirrus
   Cloud Experiment.

   The scientific objectives of FIRE ACE will be to document, understand,
   and predict the Arctic cloud-radiation feedbacks. The absence (or
   presence) of Arctic clouds has dramatic effects on the surface albedo,
   absorption of solar radiation, energy input into the ocean, and amount
   of sea ice at high latitudes. FIRE ACE will provide in-situ
   observations of cloud microphysics, radiation and turbulent fluxes
   using low-flying aircraft. High-flying aircraft will deliver active and
   passive radiometric measurements.

   A meeting of the Langley DAAC User Working Group (UWG) was held Sept.
   11-12, 1997 at NASA Langley Research Center. The agenda included a
   review of the development of the Langley TRMM Information System
   (LaTIS), which will support data processing and archive for the Clouds
   and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument onboard the
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. A discussion of data access
   methods was held, and a demonstration of the currently available
   options and options under development. Members of the UWG were pleased
   with the progression to WWW-based systems; but also pointed out that
   the next hurdle may be in data use (particularly for data in HDF
   format).

   Additional discussions were held on the status of the ECS system being
   developed for EOS-wide use, on the nomination of possible future
   datasets, and on whether to archive data now currently held at the
   National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). The status of the DAAC was
   reviewed, including the volume of holdings and the volume distributed.
   Outreach activities were reviewed, including the DAAC newsletter, a set
   of trading cards being developed for middle school students, a User
   Services CD-ROM; and an update on the S'COOL project.

   The DAAC work plan was also discussed, and the status of the NRC
   recertification effort and the Cooperative Agreement Notice for

   Langley Research Center, NASA's first research center celebrated it's
   80th anniversary in July with an open house. The public were treated to
   exhibits and demonstrations from all areas of Langley's endeavors:
   aeronautics, atmospheric sciences and space technology. More than
   16,000 people, the largest crowd ever, attended the event.

   The Langley DAAC set up and manned an exhibit booth as part of the open
   house. The exhibit was co-located with the Atmospheric Sciences
   Division to combine information about data access with displays and
   talks featuring the various science missions centered at Langley. One
   of the DAAC's "educators in residence" for the summer developed a
   puzzle handout combining satellite information with a
   latitude/longitude exercise.
   August 8

   Langley DAAC staff attended the American Library Association conference
   in San Francisco to support the EOSDIS exhibit booth. Over 22,000
   librarians from public, academic, corporate and government libraries
   were in attendance. There was a great deal of interest in the available
   data. Informational fliers for CD-ROMs, educational products, and
   EOSDIS URLs were especially popular.

   The NASA Langley Office of Education hosted a meeting for the
   facilities' Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) enterprise members. The
   purpose of the meeting was to discuss MTPE - related outreach efforts
   at Langley. Nora Normandy from MTPE Headquarters was present at the
   meeting. Ms. Normandy spoke of the need for 'Earth System Science'
   awareness and teacher training.

   A lively discussion took place during the meeting. Members of the
   audience cautioned that both scientists and educators needed to be
   involved in the creation of educational materials. Nora welcomed their
   input and suggested ways of becoming involved.

   Some members of the audience cautioned about too much reliance on the
   Internet, since many schools around the nation were still not
   connected. The feeling was that NASA should not rely so heavily on this
   means of reaching out to the educational community.

   Projects in progress at both the DAAC and the Atmospheric Science
   Division geared towards the educational community were discussed. These
   included the Student Cloud Online Observations (S'COOL) project, a
   joint effort between the CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy
   System) project folks and the DAAC, and DAAC trading cards. Nora
   reminded the audience that funds were available for many educationally
   related projects.
   July 11

   EOSDIS Langley DAAC staff attended the semi-annual User Services
   Working Group (USWG) meeting in Asheville NC, June 3-5. Primary focus
   of the meeting was given to integrated outreach efforts, policy issues,
   and user issues.

   Several conferences throughout the year are supported by the group as a
   whole. One discussion at the meeting focused on the submission of data
   images for display on the USWG booth used at these conferences.
   Information was also presented about the proposed schedule of
   conferences for the USWG to support. Voting on the final conference
   list will be held in July.

   The principal project/policy issue discussed was determining metrics
   for user satisfaction. The group suggested that the Earth Science Data
   and Information System (ESDIS) project office needed to recommend user
   satisfaction categories.

   The Langley DAAC recently participated in supporting the EOSDIS booth
   at the joint conference of the American Society for Photogrammetry and
   Remote Sensing (ASPRS) and the American Congress on Surveying and
   Mapping (ACSM) in Seattle, Washington. The Geospatial Information Age
   conference offered a diversified forum for the exchange of ideas
   relating to new and innovative technological advances in geographic
   information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and remote
   sensing. An estimated 3000 attendees were at the conference,
   representing a broad spectrum of disciplines from surveyors and
   scientists to educators.

   The EOSDIS booth offered attendees a variety of free literature and
   information concerning data available from the DAACs. The attendees
   showed a special interest concerning data available on CD-ROM.

   Staff members from the NASA Langley DAAC were on hand to support the
   EOSDIS booth at this year's meeting of the National Science Teachers
   Association convention. Over 12,000 conventioneers and more than 1,000
   exhibitors attended the meeting held February 2-7 in New Orleans. This
   conference was a `first' for the EOSDIS staff. It was part of an effort
   to further outreach to the educational community.

   Response to the EOSDIS presence was overwhelming. Many attendees were
   impressed with the availability of free information for explaining
   global climate change to their students.

   A new flier, describing educational outreach materials available at
   each of the DAACs, was produced for the conference. Each item in the
   flier was coded so that the user could readily see in what form the
   material was available: CD-ROMs, printed material (booklets,
   pamphlets), videocassettes or interactive activities. Most items also
   included information for grade level appropriateness.
   April 30

   The semi-annual meeting of the Langley DAAC User Working Group (UWG)
   was held March 13th and 14th. The UWG is chartered by the Earth
   Observing System (EOS) Program through the EOS Data and Information
   System (EOSDIS) Project and the Langley DAAC. The principle purposes of
   the UWG are to firmly establish science user involvement in the
   planning, development, and operations of the Langley DAAC and to
   represent the science user community in reviewing and guiding the DAAC
   development.

   The topics discussed at the meeting included the new contingency system
   being developed in support of the TRMM launch, future launch plans, and
   the current metadata model. DAAC statistics and outreach efforts,
   recertification issues, and the status of current Cooperative Agreement
   Notice (CAN) proposals were also discussed.

   The next UWG meeting will be in September 1997.

   For the 7th year in a row, Langley National Engineers Week volunteers
   reached out to make a world of difference in the lives and education of
   elementary students, grades 3-5, in the Hampton Roads area. Over 10,500
   elementary school students in 102 schools from 12 school divisions were
   visited by the 139 civil service, contractor, grantee, and retiree
   volunteers during the months of February and March. Among those were
   several members of the Langley DAAC staff.

   The Office of Education, which coordinated the National Engineers Week
   efforts, also spearheaded efforts to reach students in the region not
   close enough to the Hampton Roads area of Virginia for staff visits. In
   one of these 'distance learning efforts,' Connect, three researcher-led
   lessons provided students in Southeastern Virginia and Northeastern
   North Carolina with an opportunity to take a 'virtual tour' of Langley
   and see researchers and engineers in action; to see the connection
   between school lessons and workplace application; and to engage in a
   real-time challenge as part of the program's design.

   A second video production, Right Angle on Tall showed students how to
   use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine the height of the Washington
   Monument so that it can be repaired for a kite festival set to take
   place within 24 hours. Information about kites and aeronautics was
   provided to the Mission Accomplish Crew by NASA engineer and master
   kite builder and flyer Charles Dunton who also used the Langley 75th
   Anniversary kite to help the crew meet their challenge.

   The Langley Research Center Atmospheric Sciences Division (ASD) in
   cooperation with the Langley Distributed Active Archive Center Science,
   User and Data Support (SUDS) group have devised a method to allow
   schools to assist in ground truthing for the Clouds and the Earth's
   Radiant Energy System (CERES) experiment. Ground truthing is a method
   of using land based observations to validate satellite data.

   Participating classrooms will be asked to make basic weather
   observations in conjunction with satellite overpasses of their
   location. Observations are then either entered in an online form,
   emailed or sent via post to the DAAC for entry into an online database.
   Satellite observations for matching times will also be entered so that
   the students may compare the results, as can the CERES project
   scientists.

   The trial period for the experiment will be during calendar year 1997.
   Thus far, four classes in the southeastern Virginia area and one in
   Montana have requested to take part in the trial period. It is hoped,
   by early 1998, when 'real' observations will be needed, that the
   experiment will be able to be extended around the world.

   Those interested in participating should send mail to SUDS, including
   the following information:
     * Name of teacher
     * Name of school
     * Grade level
     * Email address (if available)
     * Whether or not the class has Web access
     * Location (city, state and country, as well as latitude and
       longitude, if known)

   Participants will receive instructional materials, satellite overpass
   times, and information necessary for reporting results.
   January 17

   To give focus to the effort to develop outreach materials and ideas for
   schools and for the general public, two Information Exchange Workshops
   were held, one December 3rd, one December 11th. A total of 26 district
   science advisors and teachers attended. They were treated to
   introductions to Mission to Planet Earth, the EOSDIS project, the
   Atmospheric Science Division(ASD), and the DAAC. A tour of the DAAC
   facility was provided. The attendees were also shown educational web
   pages, still in the developmental phase, created by ASD. The
   culmination was a brainstorming session, which provided much needed
   feedback and direction towards our goal of providing beeter outreach to
   the educational community.
   January 17

   Two members of the Langley User Services staff attended the Fall
   American Geophysical Union (AGU) Conference, held in San Francisco,
   Calif. The meeting provided an opportunity for the staff members to
   better understand the user community and its needs.

   An added bonus was the Southern Oxidant Study (SOS) special session
   held during the conference. SOS is part of the North American Research
   Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO), a project supported by the
   Langley Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).

   The AGU is a nonprofit scientific organization established in 1919 by
   the National Research Council. For more than 50 years, it operated as
   an unincorporated affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences. In
   1972, AGU was incorporated in the District of Columbia and membership
   was opened to scientists and students worldwide.

   AGU's mission is:
     * to promote the scientific study of Earth and its environment in
       space and to disseminate the results to the public,
     * to promote cooperation among scientific organizations involved in
       geophysics and related disciplines,
     * to initiate and participate in geophysical research programs,
     * to advance the various geophysical disciplines through scientific
       discussion, publication, and dissemination of information.

   from NASA Tech Briefs

   LinkWinds, a visual data exploration system for examination of
   geophysical and climatological data retrieved from satellite remote
   sensing, rapidly and interactively investigates large multivariate and
   multidisciplinary data sets to detect trends, correlations and
   anomalies. The software grew out of JPL research to apply computer
   graphics to access, display, explore and analyze science data. It
   applies a unique data-linking paradigm, resulting in a system that
   functions like a graphical spreadsheet. It provides an intuitive user
   interface, and consists of an expanding suite of non-domain-specific
   applications.

   LinkWinds accepts a variety of scientific data formats, including:
     * Raw binary data (1, 2, 4 or 8 byte) with separately defined
       metadata.
     * HDF - The Hierarchical Data Format provided by the NCSA, including
       8 and 24 bit raster, scientific floating point, and all multi-file
       formats.
     * CDF - The Common Data Format of Goddard Space Flight Center.
     * NetCDF - Network Common Data Form from NCAR.

   Version 2.2b2 has now been released and is available for beta testing.
   It has been implemented on SGI, Sun, HP and Linux-based Pentium
   platforms.

In conjunction with the NASA Langley booth, the Langley DAAC provided staffing
and materials for the Virginia State Fair.

The general public thinks of the Space Shuttle and the astronauts when they
think of NASA. The State Fair provided an avenue for informing the public of the
existence of other areas of NASA research. The DAAC display included a model of
the ERBE instrument, a video describing the projects at Langley's Atmospheric
Sciences Division, posters informing the public of the type of data available at
the DAAC, Mission to Planet Earth posters and various handouts. The display also
provided an avenue for the introduction of the CD-ROM for K-12 developed by a
team from Norfolk State University.

The Fair, in terms of people contacted, was a success for the DAAC. More than
200,000 people were estimated to have visited the NASA booth. The State Fair
staff did a spot check and found that many people stayed at the NASA exhibits
for over 20 minutes. The average fair goer stays at an exhibit under 2 minutes.

October 3

Both the ERBE and FIRE videocassettes, long available at no charge to our North
American users, are now available in PAL format for our European users as well.
These items, as well as our data CD-ROMS, may be ordered from our Web pages.

   A new tool for viewing HDF images is now available to be downloaded
   from the Langley DAAC homepage. The browser will allow persons on SGI,
   SUN, and HP workstations to view the images provided through the
   Langley ordering system.

   Any number of images may be viewed at once, limited only by the memory
   available. This means that a user may view images from multiple files
   at once, or multiple images from a single file.

   The software has been tarred and compressed for ease in transfer via
   FTP.

   The NASA Langley DAAC User Working Group met for two days during
   August. Consisting of members from the DAAC's scientific user
   community, the UWG provides guidance and direction for the DAAC.

   The major thrust of the meeting was focused on which data should be
   stored at the DAAC. This was broken down into several areas:
    1. What calibration and validation data needs to be stored?
    2. Is there a way to include a digital signature to ensure the source
       of the data?
    3. How does one encourage an investigator to archive the necessary
       data at the DAAC?
    4. Which new data sets should be requested for archival?
    5. How can the DAAC stay informed of new field campaigns before the
       event, to encourage archival of the data?

   The latter items prompted discussions of ancient records that still
   existed long after the collector of the information is deceased. Also
   brought forward was the point that there is no written plan for
   long-term archival of meteorological data in the United States.

   One member of the group spoke of the increase in the number of amateur
   scientists, akin to the 18th century of Darwin's time, that seemed to
   be appearing. The Forestry Service and the National Biological Survey
   was enjoying the increase in the number of retirees willing to take
   upon themselves the task of creating wildlife surveys. The UWG broached
   the subject that possibly the same types of labor could be used in
   their own fields as well.

   The meeting adjourned, with a long list of action items for the members
   and for the DAAC.

   Dr. Jeremiah F. Creedon has been named Director of NASA's Langley
   Research Center, Hampton, VA, where he began working 33 years ago as an
   engineer. The appointment, effective August 5, was announced by NASA
   Administrator Daniel S. Goldin in Washington, DC.

   "NASA is fortunate to have a man of Dr. Creedon's caliber to take the
   helm of the Langley Research Center," Goldin said. "I am confident Dr.
   Creedon's extensive experience and first-hand knowledge of aeronautics
   research will serve him well in this new position," he added.

   Dr. Creedon succeeds Paul F. Holloway, who after 36 years at Langley,
   announced July 2 that he would step down as Center Director as soon as
   a replacement was found. Holloway will work with Creedon in a
   transition role.

   "I'm honored to have been selected to this position," said Creedon,
   "and I will do the best that I can. Thanks to my predecessor's
   outstanding contributions, the Center is in an excellent position for
   the future. I'm sure the people at Langley will maintain and even
   improve their contributions to the nation."

   Dr. Creedon, 56, is the seventh Director of Langley since the Center
   was established in 1917 as the nation's first civilian aeronautical
   laboratory. Langley has approximately 4,500 civil service and
   contractor employees and a $633.8 million fiscal 1996 budget.

   Prior to being named Center Director, Dr. Creedon was Director of the
   Airframe Systems Program Office. Until February 1996, he was Director
   of the Aeronautics Program Group, a position he had held since February
   1994.

   On July 1, 1996, the existing 804 area code will be split into two
   parts. Bell Atlantic customers in the Norfolk area, including NASA
   Langley, will get the new 757 area code.

   July marks the beginning of the permissive dialing period. During the
   permissive dialing period, callers may dial either the new 757 area
   code or the old 804 area code, and calls will properly complete.
   Mandatory dialing begins on February 1, 1997. At that time all calls to
   the new area code must be dialed with the 757 area code. All misdialed
   calls (those dialed with the old area code instead of the new area
   code) will be intercepted by a Bell Atlantic recording telling the
   caller to remake their call using the new 757 area code.

   The NASA Marshall Distributed Active is transferring responsibility of
   many of its data sets to other DAACs within the Earth Observing System
   Data and Information System. This orderly transition began in April
   1996 and will continue through March 1997. After March 1997, the
   Marshall Space Flight Center DAAC will be closed.

   The transition of the following data sets from the Marshall DAAC to the
   Langley DAAC has successfully been completed. They are now available to
   be ordered through the Langley DAAC on-line system.

   The NASA Space Grant/Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
   Research (EPSCoR) Conference was recently held in Williamsburg,
   Virginia. This was the fourth Space Grant Consortium national meeting,
   but the first to combine with EPSCoR, and with the NASA/University
   Joint Venture (JOVE) Retreat.

   The NASA Space Grant College and Fellowship Program was established "to
   ensure U.S. strength in space-related research and education, and
   capitalize on the multiple opportunities afforded by the space
   environment." The was accomplished by
     * Establishing a national network of universities interested in space
       and aeronautics
     * Encouraging cooperative programs among universities, industry and
       government
     * Enabling the development of interdisciplinary education
     * Recruiting and training the next generation, especially the
       underrepresented
     * Developing science and math educaiton from elementary through
       university levels.

   The keynote speaker for the conference was NASA Administrator, Dan
   Goldin. Dr. Goldin spoke of the need to look forward in the development
   of technology.
   May 10

   Paula Detweiler and Anne Racel of the Langley DAAC attended the first
   IEEE Metadata Conference, held in Silver Springs Maryland. The
   objectives of the conference were to provide a forum to address
   metadata issues faced by private companies and government agencies
   worldwide, bring these difference communities together for a technical
   interchange of ideas on common technologies related to metadata, hear
   various perspectives from users and producers of metadata and to
   facilitate the development and usage of metadata. The conference
   consisted of three days of presentations related to these issues, plus
   a special session on the Earth Observing System project.

   Several different varieties and flavors of data and data holdings were
   shown and how metadata was stored, extracted and used presented. Two of
   the more difficult to deal with included the metadata stored on one
   system and the data stored on varied other systems and non-digitized
   data, both photos and text.

   Anne Racel of the Langley DAAC User Services Staff recently attended
   the International Symposium on Remote Sensing held in Vancouver, B.C.
   Attendees to the symposium were quite a mixed group: from college
   students (most of whom were there as volunteers) to directors of remote
   sensing facilities and government officials. They came from such
   diverse locations as Lebanon, Western Europe and Japan, as well as the
   United States and Canada.

   The Earth Observation System Distributed Information System (EOSDIS)
   was well represented at the conference. Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE),
   the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network
   (CIESIN) and EOSDIS/User Services Working Group each displayed booths.
   In addition, a paper session was devoted to EOSDIS, its future and
   projects using EOSDIS data.

   Question: What do you do when your FTP server hardware starts giving
   you problems, just before Congress and the President decide to give you
   not one, but two 'extended leaves' just before the worst blizzard in
   about 50 years hits?

   Answer: The best you can!

   According to National Weather Service, almost a foot of snow was
   received from Saturday, January 6th through Monday, January 8th. But
   between the two major snowfalls was a period of melting and freezing.
   By Monday, a thin layer of snow was covering a thick layer of ice,
   forcing the closure of NASA Langley Research Center Monday, January 8th
   and early Tuesday, the 9th.

   For three weeks previous to the storm, NASA Langley, as well as the
   other NASA centers, was closed due to the federal budget impasse. Only
   essential personnel, primarily barebones security and maintenance
   workers, were allowed on site. During that time, the Langley DAAC chose
   to shut down its computer systems to avoid any hardware problems that
   might occur when none of the DAAC staff would have access to repair
   them.

   The hardware problems that were feared were those dealing with the DADS
   jukebox used to stage FTP orders for clients. For two months, the
   system had been experiencing difficulties relating to the 'picker,' the
   device that actually moves the cartridges to allow access to the data,
   similar in nature to a '45's or CD jukebox. The DAAC systems
   administration personnel have been in the process of migrating the data
   - changing the software and hardware being used - during this period.
   Ideally, the hardware would be put out of commission for the time it
   took for the migration to occur. But that would mean no access to data
   for clients who had already been put out by the other forced shutdowns
   of the system. Therefore, as a temporary measure, the migration had
   been occuring while the system was up.

   As of this moment, the DAAC is open and functional. Our hardware system
   for orders is working. And as far as humanly possible, the Langley DAAC
   staff will work to keep things that way.
