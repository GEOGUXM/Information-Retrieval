               Nonindigenous Annelid Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Annelids (Phylum Annelida) are segmented worms that inhabit marine and
   freshwater environments, in addition to terrestrial environments.
   Annelids include three different classes: polychaets, oligochaetes, and
   hirudinea (leeches). The most common method of introduction is from
   commercial oyster plantings. However, some are also introduced by way
   of ship fouling. The most likely potential impact is changing the
   benthic community structure of an introduction site. Some species bore
   into oyster shells or snail shells occupied by hermit crabs. Polydora
   ligni, a mud worm (pic 39k), was introduced to the west coast in
   commercial oyster plantings. At times they become so abundant that they
   bury the oyst ers in several inches of mud tubes.
   We welcome any contributions or comments you may have.
