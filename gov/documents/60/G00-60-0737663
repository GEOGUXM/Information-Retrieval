   CSI logo

   The Board is sponsoring a project with the Construction Specifications
   Institute (CSI) to develop recommendations on construction tolerances
   and measurement protocols for surface flatness, slope, vibration, and
   rollability of exterior walkways, including ramps.  As part of this
   project, a technical assistance bulletin is being developed to provide
   guidance on these types of construction tolerances for use with the
   Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).  A
   draft bulletin is available for public review and input on the
   contractor's website.  All members of the public, including people with
   disabilities and design and construction professionals, are encouraged
   to review this document and to provide feedback.
