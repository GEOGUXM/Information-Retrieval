   Dick Lugar is an unwavering advocate of U.S. leadership in the world, a
   strong national security, free-trade and economic growth. This fifth
   generation Hoosier is the longest serving U.S. Senator in Indiana
   history. He is the Republican leader of the Agriculture, Nutrition and
   Forestry Committee, and a senior member on the Foreign Relations and
   Intelligence Committees. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976 and
   in 2000 won his third consecutive victory by a two-thirds majority. He
   holds all Indiana statewide election records.

   Lugar manages his family's 604-acre Marion County corn, soybean and
   tree farm. Before entering public life, he ran with his brother Tom,
   the family's food machinery manufacturing business in Indianapolis.

   As the two-term mayor of Indianapolis (1968-75), he envisioned the
   unification of the city and surrounding Marion County into one
   government. Unigov, as Lugar's plan was called, set the city on path of
   uninterrupted economic growth.

   Richard Lugar has been instrumental in Senate ratification of treaties
   that reduce the world's use, production and stockpiling of nuclear,
   chemical and biological weapons. In 1991, he forged a bipartisan
   partnership with then-Senate Armed Services Chairman, Sam Nunn (D-Ga.),
   to destroy these weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet
   Union. To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated more than 5,500
   nuclear warheads that were once aimed at the United States.

   As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Lugar built bipartisan
   support for 1996 federal farm program reforms, ending 1930s era federal
   production controls. He has promoted broader risk management options
   for farmers, research advancements, increased export opportunities and
   higher net farm income. Lugar initiated a biofuels research program to
   help decrease U.S. dependency on foreign oil. He also led initiatives
   to streamline the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reform the food stamp
   program and preserve the federal school lunch program.

   Lugar has supported increasing exports, cutting taxes, eliminating
   wasteful government spending, and reducing bureaucratic red tape for
   American businesses. He has introduced legislation urging abolition of
   the income tax, capital gains, and estate and gift taxes and has
   supported efforts to allow full deductibility of health insurance for
   the self-employed.

   His common sense Hoosier values have been recognized many times
   including such awards as Guardian of Small Business, the Spirit of
   Enterprise, Watchdog of the Treasury, and 34 honorary doctorate
   degrees. He was the fourth person ever named Outstanding Legislator by
   the American Political Science Association.

   Richard Lugar, and his wife Charlene, were married September 8, 1956,
   and have four sons and seven grandchildren.
