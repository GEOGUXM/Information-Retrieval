                                Intended Use
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Purpose
   The Office of the Governor recognizes that "external content" - content
   that is provided by entities that are not part of government - may be
   included in the publicly accessible Web site operated by the Governor's
   Office at WWW.GOVERNOR.WA.GOV. The Governor's Office does not intend
   that its Web site be an open public forum, and external content on
   pages operated by us will be permitted at the sole discretion of the
   Governor.

   Applicability
   This policy applies only to pages that are developed and maintained by
   the Office of the Governor. This policy is not intended, and shall not
   be construed, to prohibit external content that is:
     * Required or authorized by law;
     * Constitutes official government business;
     * Furthers the specific purpose of a government organization's web
       page; or
     * On web pages not operated by the Office of the Governor.

   It may be in the public interest to include:
     * Links to resources that are provided by others on Web sites outside
       of the Governor's Office control; and
     * Public acknowledgement of sponsors or other contributors of
       resources to allow the Governor's Office to expand on-line
       information and services.

   External content therefore includes, but is not limited to, links and
   acknowledgements on pages operated by the Office of the Governor.

   Content Guidelines
   In exercising its discretion to allow external content on its Web site,
   the Governor's Office will be guided by the purpose of the Web site,
   which is as follows:

   The Office of the Governor's Web site is intended to support, as
   efficiently, conveniently, and cost effectively as possible, and in a
   manner of presentation befitting government, the following uses by
   citizens, businesses and public employees:
     * Location of and access to useful public information provided by
       public agencies or non-profit, non-partisan organizations
     * Location of Web sites provided by public agencies or non-profit,
       non-partisan organizations
     * Location of public services
     * Delivery of public services via the Internet

   The Office of the Governor, at its sole discretion, will determine
   whether external content meets these purposes. Generally, external
   content that does not suit these purposes includes, but is not limited
   to, content that contains, suggests, or infers any of the following:
    1. Advocacy of or opposition to any politically, environmentally, or
       socially controversial subjects, issues, or candidates.
    2. Disparaging or promoting any person or class of people.
    3. External content not suitable for readers or viewers of all ages,
       or links to or other promotion of businesses whose products or
       services are not suitable for persons of all ages.
    4. Promoting or inciting illegal, violent, or socially undesirable
       conduct.
    5. Promotion or availability of alcohol or tobacco products.
    6. Promotion or availability of illegal drugs.
    7. Promotion or availability of adult or sexually oriented
       entertainment or materials.
    8. Promotion, opposition, or availability of weapons.
    9. Promotion, opposition, or availability of gambling.
   10. Claims of efficacy, suitability, desirability, or other
       non-objective statements about businesses, products, or services.
   11. Content that infringes on any trademark, copyright, or patent
       rights of another.
   12. Claims or representations in violation of advertising or consumer
       protection laws.
   13. Content that a reasonable citizen may not consider appropriate to
       maintain the dignity and decorum of the Office of the Governor.

   Removal of Content
   The Office of the Governor reserves the right, at its sole discretion,
   to withdraw external content that otherwise meets its guidelines. This
   discretion may be exercised if the Office of the Governor becomes
   aware, receives claims or allegations, or has reason to inquire
   whether, the content refers or links the viewer to content not on our
   Web site that is either in violation of any of the above listed
   guidelines, except No. 10, or would be reasonably likely to offend a
   reasonable citizen. Withdrawal of content on these bases will be
   permitted whether or not the Office of the Governor is legally
   obligated to act upon any information of which it is aware.
