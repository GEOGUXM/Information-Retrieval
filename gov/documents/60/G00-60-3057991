Mission:

   The mission of the Student Association is to represent students at Los
   Alamos National Laboratory, to improve the quality of life and
   education for all people entering Laboratory student programs.

   Why should you get involved?

   The Laboratory has dedicated a significant amount of resources to
   student programs and it is important that you as a student have input
   into where these resources are allocated. The Student Association gives
   you the opportunity to get involved and lets your voice be heard
   through representation on the Student Programs Advisory Committee
   (SPAC).

   SA is also a great way to meet people around the lab and to understand
   what other divisions are doing. You will be able to plan student
   events, serve on committees, and gain significant experience.

About this web site

   This web site serves many needs. Students interested in learning about
   working at LANL can find resources here to guide them through the
   hiring process. Newly hired students can find information and practical
   guidance regarding living in LA and northern New Mexico. Current
   employees and members of the Students' Association will find
   information about SA events and how to participate in the SA. All
   visitors are invited to check out the calendar of events and the
   student forum (coming soon).
