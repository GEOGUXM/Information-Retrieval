                                 Open Skies


  Open Skies is a term used to refer to the most liberal type of air
  transportation agreement between two countries. The U.S. Model Open
 Skies agreement includes provisions for open entry on all routes, and
                   unlimited capacity and frequency.

This type of agreement maximizes potential competition and facilitates
 new services through cooperative arrangements among the participating
                         countries' airlines.

 The Departments of Transportation and State are responsible for Open
                Skies agreements with other countries.
