     Working Meetings on VA Cost Studies

          HERC was created to respond to recommendations made at a meeting
          on VA economic research. That meeting was organized by the HSR&D
          Management Decision Resource Center in February, 1998, and was
          attended by VA economists, health services researchers,
          clinicians, and managers. A consensus on the state of the art
          for VA cost analysis and recommendations for VA data policy, and
          research infrastructure were important to the development of the
          HERC strategic plan. A PDF Version of this Cost Meeting Summary
          is also available.

          As a follow-up to the 1998 cost meeting, a meeting of VA
          economists was held at the 1999 HSR&D Annual Meeting to continue
          the discussion on costs.

   Special Supplement on VA Cost Methods
          "Developments in Cost Methodology: Lessons from VA Research" is
          a special Supplement to the April issue of the journal Medical
          Care that includes 9 papers that describe the state of the art
          for researchers seeking to conduct economic research in VA.
