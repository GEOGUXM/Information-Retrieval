   Organization Chart: Aircraft Ice Protection

                           Aircraft Ice Protection

   As one of the three major programs for NASA's Aircraft Icing Project,
   the Aircraft Ice Protection program element focuses on two main areas.
   The first is the development of remote sensing technologies to meaure
   nearby icing conditions, improve current forecast capabilities, and
   develop systems to transfer and display information to flight crews,
   flight controllers, and dispatchers. Second is the development of
   systems to monitor and assess aircraft performance, notify the cockpit
   crew about the state of the aircraft, and/or automatically alter the
   aircraft controlling systems to prevent stall or loss of control in the
   icing environment.
   The Aircraft Ice Protection element of the program has been subdivided
   into three main areas of investigation:

   1. Icing Avoidance:

    Goal: To provide flight crews with icing weather conditions
   information for avoidance or exit options.
    Approach: To develop technologies fro the sensing and communication
   of the icing environment to provide the required information to flight
   crews, controllers, and dispatchers for improved decision making.

   2. Icing Tolerant Aircraft:

    Goal: To improve the ability of aircraft to operate safely in icing
   conditions.
    Approach: To develop technologies that will improve
   protection/detection capability, identify the state of the aircraft in
   the local icing environment, operate the ice protection equipment, and
   prevent uncontrolled aircraft responses to aircraft ice contamination.

   3. Icing Atmospheric Characterization:

    Goal: To develop instrumentation and meaurement techniques and
   characterize atmospheric icing conditions to improve simulation
   capability, provide icing weather validation databases, and increase
   knowledge of icing physics.
    Approach: To conduct research flights in icing with flying laboratory
   and develop cloud physics instrumentation and analysis methods.
