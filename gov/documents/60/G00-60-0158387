Summary

   Files stored in the Andrew File System (AFS) are distributed across one
   or more AFS servers but remain accessible to all AFS client machines.
   The principal benefits of AFS for NERSC users are:
    1. Access to files across multiple platforms and machines.
    2. Daily file backup.
    3. Use of familiar UNIX file manipulation commands.

   The NERSC Cray systems do not have "native" AFS implementations. The
   AFS file system (/afs) is available on the Crays as an NFS mounted
   filesystem. There are no AFS commands available on the Crays. Users
   must connect to the NFS-AFS gateway machine, dano.nersc.gov, and use
   the menu to enable access.

Using AFS at NERSC

     * Your AFS Username and Password
     * Authentication
     * Your AFS File Space
     * Backup Copies of Your AFS Files
     * AFS File Quotas
     * AFS Project Directories
     * Using Your AFS File Space
     * AFS Utilities
     * Summary of Steps to Get Started

Your AFS Username and Password

   Your AFS username is your NERSC Cray username. Your AFS password is the
   password sent to you when you requested AFS access. You can change your
   AFS password by using ssh to connect to dano.nersc.gov and making the
   appropriate selection from the menu.

Authentication

   You must be authenticated by AFS before accessing protected AFS files.

   On non-NERSC machines running AFS, execute:

   klog username@nersc.gov

   where username is your NERSC username (e.g. u1234). You will be
   prompted for your NERSC AFS password.

   If you can not find the klog utility on your AFS-enabled workstation,
   contact your local system administrator for details.

   On NERSC's Cray machines you must authenticate by using ssh to connect
   to dano.nersc.gov, (use your AFS username and password) and following
   the menu instructions. Choose
1)  enable attached hosts        (knfs)

   to authenticate yourself to be able to use the NFS/AFS gateway on the
   NERSC production machines.

   Once you are authenticated, the current session possesses an AFS token
   which enables subordinate processes to access AFS files without
   reauthenticating. At NERSC, AFS tokens expire after 30 days. Once the
   token expires, the owner must re-authenticate.

Your AFS File Space

   All AFS user files are located in the directory tree /afs. The
   immediate subdirectories of /afs are called cell names. NERSC's cell
   name is nersc.gov. Each NERSC AFS user is given a directory with a
   pathname of the form

   /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyyy

   where xxx is the account group (i.e., ccc), and yyyyyy is the user's
   NERSC CRAY username. For example, if your NERSC CRAY username were
   u1234, the path of your AFS directory would be
   /afs/nersc.gov/u/ccc/u1234.

   The structure of a NERSC user's AFS directory is as follows:
     * Home Directory: /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyyy
          + Backup Directory: OldFiles
          + Public Directory: Public
          + System-Specific Area: .systype
               o hp700_ux90
               o sun4m_53
               o ...
     * /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyyy serves as a common home directory for
       logins from any AFS client machine. By default, any user at any AFS
       site may list the contents of this directory.
     * OldFiles contains online backups; see the section Backup Copies of
       Your AFS Files for details.
     * Public is meant for files that you wish to make available to
       anyone. By default, any user at any AFS site may read the files in
       your Public directory.
     * System-specific directories within the /.systype directory contain
       files, such as login procedures (i.e., dot files), which are keyed
       to specific systems. Symbolic links point the main login procedures
       in /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyyy to the correct system-specific files
       inside the subdirectories of /.systype. .systype contains a
       subdirectory for each system type that you use. You will have the
       following .systype subdirectories by default:
          + hp700_ux90 for HPUX systems
          + sun4m_53 for Solaris systems
     * You may also have others, such as:
          + sun4c_411 for Sunos systems
          + rs_aix32 for AIX systems

Backup Copies of Your AFS Files

   Each NERSC AFS user has a backup directory:

   /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyyy/OldFiles

   A backup copy of your AFS files, as of midnight of the previous night,
   is always available here, with read-only access. To recover a file,
   copy it from OldFiles directory.

AFS File Quotas

   As a NERSC AFS user, you have a quota of 100 megabytes in your AFS file
   space. From a workstation with native AFS invoke:

   fs listquota directory

   to check your usage against the quota. For example, user u1234, in
   account group ccc can see check her AFS quota by using:

   fs listquota /afs/nersc.gov/u/ccc/u1234

AFS Project Directories

   Groups of NERSC CRAY users collaborating on a project may wish to place
   their shared files in AFS. Special AFS directories, separate from the
   users' own AFS directories, can be created for this purpose. Please
   send electronic mail to consult@nersc.gov to request a project
   directory.

Using Your AFS File Space

   To avoid filling your AFS space with transient files, you should work
   in /tmp or in your work directory, rather than in your AFS file space.
   It is not appropriate to compile, run, or debug applications within
   your AFS file space. Instead, store your source files, makefiles, and
   input files in AFS and modify your makefiles to write the executables
   to /tmp or to your work directory.

   The NFS/AFS gateway enables access to AFS files from the NERSC Crays,
   but access times can be very slow. File caches are likely to be
   inconsistent on the time scale of minutes. Users will experience
   problems if they change an AFS file from the Cray and try to read it on
   a workstation before the file cache has had time to synchronize.

AFS Utilities

   Native AFS implementation have numerous utilities for working with AFS
   files (setting permissions or ACLs, determining quotas, defining
   groups, etc.). None of these utilities are available on the NERSC
   Crays. Therefore, use of AFS only makes sense for those users who have
   access to workstations that have native AFS implementations.

Summary of Steps to Get Started

   Contact the NERSC Support Office (1-800-66-NERSC, menu option 2) to
   request an AFS account.

   Enable AFS access by connecting to dano.nersc.gov. After you login to
   dano, follow the instructions in the menu to enable AFS access.

   The pathname of your AFS directory is:

   /afs/nersc.gov/u/xxx/yyyyy

   where xxx is your group (e.g., ccc) and yyyyy is your login (e.g.,
   u1234). You will see the following subdirectories:

        OldFiles
                (Backup copies of your files.)

        Public
                (Any user at any AFS site has read and lookup rights to
                all files stored here.)

        .systype
                (Login procedures unique for different systems; contains
                machine-specific subdirectories.)

   You can create other directories in your AFS file space. The UNIX file
   manipulation commands will work as usual.
