   [streptococcus.gif] Our laboratory investigates the molecular biology
   of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We determined the genetic basis of several
   biochemical pathways, some of them for the first time in any organism.
   These systems include maltosaccharide utilization, DNA restriction
   modification systems DpnI and DpnII, folate biosynthesis, and DNA
   mismatch repair. The mechanism of bacterial transformation in S.
   pneumoniae was elucidated in considerable detail, and served as a
   prototype for other naturally transformable species.

   We demonstrated the role of nucleases and single-stranded DNA in
   transformation. Various modes of genetic recombination, including
   chromosomal transformation, plasmid transformation, plasmid transfer,
   chromosomal facilitation of plasmid transfer, and circular integration
   were analyzed in S. pneumoniae, and procedures for gene cloning in this
   species were elaborated. The broad-host-range plasmids pLS1 and pMV158,
   which can replicate in both gram-positive and gram-negative hosts, were
   characterized. Current efforts are devoted to analyzing the signals for
   gene expression in transcription and translation, and to determining
   the mechanism of strand targeting in DNA mismatch repair.

   [2DPMx100.jpg] In collaboration with crystallographers in the
   Department, we are determining the structure of a DNA methyltransferase
   and a restriction endonuclease of the DpnII system.
