         Research goals in this area include
           * Identify reactions and catalysts for synthesizing chemical products
             at greater than 90% yields without forming toxic by-products
           * Develop high-activity catalysts for direct decomposition of NO to
             N2 and O2
           * Develop active, low-temperature catalysts for controlling volatile
             organic compounds and methane combustion
           * Develop catalysts for efficient hydrogenolysis of chlorinated
             hydrocarbons to RH and HCl
           * Develop catalysts for selective removal of sulfur from feedstreams
             and converting SOx to valuable products
           * Develop catalysts for producing chemical products at lower
             temperatures and pressures than currently needed

         Current projects include
           * Photocatalytic Cell Killing and Oxidation of Whole Cells in Contact
             with Illuminated Titanium Dioxide Surfaces
