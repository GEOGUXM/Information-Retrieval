   Elder Justice
   gold bar with blue star

   The Department of Justice is working to protect the growing number of
   older Americans. In the last two years, those efforts were stepped up
   through the Department's Nursing Home Initiative and its Elder Justice
   efforts. These activities have focused on enhancing enforcement,
   training, coordination, outreach, attention to medical forensic elder
   issues, and boosting the use of reliable criminal background checks for
   direct care workers. The Department's Elder Justice activities include:

   Stepped Up Civil and Criminal Enforcement in Cases Impacting Older
   People
     * failure of care prosecutions against institutions whose wrongdoing
       results in serious harm or death of residents and false statements
       to the government
     * creation of State Working Groups to enhance coordination of
       federal, state, and local entities on these issues
     * health care fraud cases against those who deplete public programs
       designed to benefit older people, with recoveries of more than $1.7
       billion between October, 1999 and January 1, 2001
     * consumer fraud prosecutions of telemarketing, Internet, credit card
       and advance-fee fraud, and the creation of Elder Fraud Protection
       Teams in five cities
     * civil rights enforcement to redress discrimination against older
       people resulting from predatory lending and violations of the Equal
       Credit Opportunity Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
       Fair Housing Act, and the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons
       Act

   Grants, Technical Assistance and Other Efforts
   The Office of Justice Programs has provided support to a broad range of
   state and local efforts aimed at reducing and preventing victimization
   of older people, including:
     * domestic violence and sexual assault against older women

       notes that our knowledge of elder abuse and neglect in 2000 is
       about where child abuse was 30 years ago, and calls for more
       research, training, coordination, and funding.
     * Promising Practices to Prevent Elder Victimization. This report
       describes the proceedings of a national symposium sponsored by the
       Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services that featured
       promising multidisciplinary approaches to redress all types of
       elder victimization.
