Brief History

   In 1963 Senator Milton Young of North Dakota submitted to Congress a
   report prepared by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture about the need for an expanded national
   research program in human nutrition. To accomplish this expanded
   program, it was proposed that three regional research laboratories be
   established near medical schools, one each in the North Central,
   Southeast and Southwest United States. The Grand Forks Human Nutrition
   Research Center was the only laboratory established under the original
   concept of the report. Planning for the facility began in 1966;
   construction began in 1969 on land provided by the State of North
   Dakota. The building located next to the campus of the University of
   North Dakota was completed in September 1970 and dedicated with a
   symposium "Newer Trace Elements in Nutrition." At this time, the
   facility was officially a field station of the Vitamins and Minerals
   Laboratory of the ARS Human Nutrtition Division in Beltsville, MD. In
   1972, the facility became the Human Nutrition Research Laboratory of
   the ARS North Central Region. In 1976, the laboratory began operating a
   clinical nutrition research program in addition to the basic aminal
   research program. In 1977, the laboratory was designated the Grand
   Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC). The GFHNRC is one of
   the six human nutrition research centers operated by ARS; the others
   are located in Beltsville, MD (Beltsville Human Nutrition Research
   Center); Houston, TX (Children's Nutrition Research Center); Boston, MA
   (Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts); San Francisco, CA
   (Western Human Nutrition Research Center); and Little Rock, AR
   (Arkansas Children's Nutrition Research Center).

   Between the years of 1972 and 1984, the facility was expanded from
   20,000 to 80,000 square feet. The original building had no animal
   facilities, five research laboratories, no area for community-based
   human studies, and an austere 8-bed metabolic ward. It now contains a
   vivarium with 16 separate rooms for small animals, a laboratory for
   each of 13 senior scientists, a 14-bed metabolic ward for long-term,
   live-in human volunteer studies, a specific area for community-based
   human studies, and a mobile laboratory.
