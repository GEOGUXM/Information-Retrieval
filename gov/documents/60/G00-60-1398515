   Modeling Earth's Core Geodynamo

   Simulated earth-like magnetic field Three-dimensional numerical models
   of the earth's geodynamo - the convection currents in the fluid outer
   core - will provide insight into the structure and evolution of the
   earth's magnetic field. Our first such model produced a simulated
   earth-like magnetic field that we extended over a simulated
   evolutionary period of 200,000 years. A snapshot of that simulation is
   shown here. The outward-curving lines are magnetic lines drawn out to
   two earth radii. The complicated field at the center occurs in the
   planet's outer core, where the magnetic field is generated. This
   simulation was the first to produce results dynamically consistent with
   field measurements and seismic analyses.
