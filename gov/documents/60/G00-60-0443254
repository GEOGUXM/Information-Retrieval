   Welcome to Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board
   AIM Logo HFP Logo MRMIP Logo

      The MRMIB was created in 1990 with a broad mandate to advise the
      Governor and the Legislature on strategies for reducing the number of
      uninsured persons in the state. The Board is comprised of volunteer
      members appointed by the Governor and the Legislature. Members serve
      four year terms. The MRMIB is dedicated to improving the health of
      Californians by increasing access to affordable, comprehensive, quality
      health care coverage. The MRMIB meets in public session, usually on the
      third Wednesday of each month.
      The MRMIB administers three health care programs. They are:

        * The Access for Infants and Mothers (AIM) program provides low cost
          health insurance coverage to uninsured, low income pregnant women
          and their infants. AIM is part of California's efforts to increase
          health coverage of pregnant women and their infants. The average
          subscriber is a married woman, living in a household with a family
          income between 200-300% of the federal poverty level. A pregnant
          woman and her infant(s) enrolled in AIM receive their care from one
          of nine health plans participating in the program. The pregnant
          woman participates in the cost of her health care services through
          a low cost subscriber contribution. The State of California
          supplements the subscriber contribution to cover the full cost of
          care. AIM is funded from tobacco tax funds. For an application:
          Call toll free 1-800-433-2611.
        * The Healthy Families Program (HFP) provides low cost health, dental
          and vision coverage to uninsured children in low wage families.
          Families participating in the program choose their health, dental
          and vision plan. Families pay premiums of $4-$9 per child per month
          (maximum of $27 per family) to participate in the program. The
          State and Federal government provide funding to the HFP for an
          application: call toll free 1 888-747-1222.
        * The Major Risk Medical Insurance Program (MRMIP) provides health
          insurance for Californians who are unable to obtain coverage in the
          individual health insurance market. The majority of subscribers are
          women between the ages of 40-59 who are enrolled in the program
          because they have been rejected for coverage by an insurance
          carrier or health plan due to a pre-existing condition. MRMIP has
          served over 72,000 persons since it opened in 1991. Services in the
          program are delivered through contracts with 6 health insurance
          plans. Californians qualifying for the program participate in the
          payment for the cost of their coverage by paying premiums. The
          State of California supplements those premiums to cover the full
          cost of care. MRMIP is funded from tobacco tax funds. For an
          application: call toll free 1 800-289-6574.

        * Pacific Health Advantage (The Health Insurance Plan of California)
          In addition to the above three programs, the Board established, in
          1993, the State of California's Health Insurance Plan of California
          (The HIPC). The HIPC is the nation's pre-eminent small employer
          purchasing pool. The HIPC was successfully managed by the Board
          until July 1, 1999, when the Board transferred management , on
          behalf of the State, to a nonprofit agency, the Pacific Business
          Group on Health. The HIPC now has a new name, Pacific Health
          Advantage (PacAdvantage). Through PacAdvantage, small businesses
          can get affordable health, dental, and vision coverage by buying
          insurance together as one big group. This gives small employers
          (with 2-50 employees) real purchasing clout, and gives their
          employees a broad choice of health, dental and vision plans. To
          find out more about PacAdvantage, click on the logo below, or call
          toll free 1-877-4-PAC-ADV (1-877-472-2238).
