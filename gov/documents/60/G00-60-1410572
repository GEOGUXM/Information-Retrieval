New Announcement:

    WARNING: Attitude Uncertainty in Public TOOs from 2000, September 6 through
    13 (mission days 2440-2447)

   During this period, a problem with the onboard star trackers resulted
   in significant (and not yet well modeled) satellite pointing errors of
   up to one degree. Data from public TOOs performed during this period
   have been made immediately public, despite the fact that all attitude
   information is uncertain. GOs analyzing affected obsids might
   erroneously conclude that their source is up to a factor of five
   fainter than it actually is, due to the pointing offset at the time of
   the observation. Be EXTREMELY cautious before drawing any scientific
   conclusions from the affected observations.

   The following public TOO obsids are affected:

Announcement:

    The SOF has switched to automatically making FITS files with all data modes
    for every observation. Thus it is no longer necessary to request GO mode
    data because it will be included in the FITS files with the Standard mode
    data. Also, when it becomes available, production data will be used to
    create a second, possibly better copy of the FITS data. This production data
    will also be on the ftp server in the directory pub/FITS/production .

Overview:

     * As a convenience to guest observers, the RXTE SOF is providing a
       FITS package of all data products made from the realtime and
       production data. Note that this is a change from the past in which
       only standard mode products were provided by default.
     * This data is proprietary, please do not attempt to download and
       decrypt any data not owned by you.
     * The realtime FITS creation is run throughout the day. Data that is
       complete at the time the process runs is made into FITS via XFF,
       then encrypted using PGP, and put on the anonymous ftp server.
       Realtime FITS packages of GO data will only remain on this server
       for 7 days. The realtime FITS files may be deleted after the
       production version arrives.
     * The production FITS creation is run twice per day, once in the
       morning and once in the afternoon. Production FITS files will be
       kept for about 20 days.
     * Public-owned observations are available, the encryption key is
       'publictoo'.
     * This service is completely independent of the RXTE GOF; PIs will
       continue to get their data from the GOF in the usual way.
     * Please contact the SOF(xtesof@xtesof.nascom.nasa.gov) with
       questions about getting data through this service, and contact the
       GOF at xtehelp@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov with questions about reducing
       data.
     __________________________________________________________________

Specifics:

     * XFF is run as follows on the realtime data:
xff -r -f $obsid -l $obsid/$obsid.log -s $stmet -t $endmet -n 0
     -a 1 14 15 16 17 20 21 24 55 59 63 70 74 79 80 86 90 91 92 93 94
     82 84 85 88 200 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 251 252 253 254
       NOTE: apids 16, 17, 20, and 24 were added on 2/5/97.
       where
          + $obsid is the observation id, e.g. 10101-01-01-00,
          + $stmet is the starting MET of the observation (includes the
            slew to the target)
          + $endmet is the ending MET of the observation,
          + the numbers after '-a' are the apids that are processed: 14,
            15, 16, 17, 20, 24, and 237 - 254 contain spacecraft
            orientation information. 70 and 74 contain PCA standard 1 and
            2. 82 and 88 contain HEXTE Archive (standard) modes for
            clusters A and B. Finally, 90 - 94 contain PCA housekeeping
            data.
     * PGP is a popular encryption package, and is used here to protect
       the privacy of your data. In this case, it is not run in public-key
       mode, due to the impossibility of getting all the PI/Co-I's public
       keys in advance of their observation. Instead, it is run in its
       conventional encryption mode: 'pgp -c filename'. If PGP version
       2.6.2 is not installed on your system (just type 'pgp' to find
       out), you must install it in order to decrypt your data. US
       citizens in the United States, or Canadian citizens in Canada may
       download PGP from the MIT distribution site. Others may download
       the international version from the International PGP page. The two
       versions are completely compatible.
       NOTE: Some countries prohibit or regulate the use of cryptography,
       so please check your country's policies before attempting to
       download or use PGP!

How to access your data:

     * Either :
          + point your browser to ftp://xtesof.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/FITS/
            for realtime data or to
            ftp://xtesof.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/FITS/production/ for
            production data,
          + save your data to a file on your computer (netscape users do
            this by holding the right mouse button while pointing to the
            dataset, and selecting 'save link as'.).
       Or
          + ftp to xtesof.nascom.nasa.gov, login as 'anonymous', give your
            email address as your password.

          + cd pub/FITS/ (or cd pub/FITS/production)
          + binary
          + get obsid.tar.pgp
          + quit
     * To decrypt your data, type:

       pgp obsid.tar.pgp You will be prompted for the pass phrase, which
       is simply the 'access key' which was sent to you in your schedule
       notification email. You can have the access key redelivered to you
       via this form.
     * Un-tar the data:

       tar -xvf obsid.tar Now you have a directory which has the same
       structure as the production data the RXTE GOF will be sending you.
     * Files with the '.gz' extension have been gzipped for conservation
       of disk space, you will need to 'gunzip' them for analysis.
     * See the RXTE GOF guide to data analysis and processing, especially
       the recipe Working with Realtime Data.
