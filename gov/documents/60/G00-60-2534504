   Optimal planning and development in energy and environmental policy
   requires estimates and predictions of the costs and benefits of
   different policy and investment options.  In the area of U.S. Appliance
   Energy Efficiency Standards, the Energy Analysis Program of Lawrence
   Berkeley National Laboratories is the leader in policy impact analysis.
   In addition to the particular applications to appliance efficiency
   standards, there is a general interest in the understanding economic
   interactions and systems since these interactions directly affect
   living standards, human rights and personal and economic freedoms.  We
   therefore discuss and develop on this site a set of theoretical,
   modeling and software frameworks for making economic and policy
   decisions and evaluations.  By improving the overall  technology of
   economic simulation, we not only improve policy analysis for energy
   efficiency standards, but also policy analysis for energy and
   environmental policy in general.

   The focus of this research is to develop inexpensive yet effective
   methods for economic evaluation, resource and money flows, energy
   savings forecasts, and resource cost estimation.  The presumption of
   this research is that the economics of energy use and development are
   not optimized from a long term perspective.  Opportunities for savings,
   development, and long term cost avoidance are not being taken because
   of lack of information, predictive ability, and analytical resources.
   The problem of information scarcity may be particularly acute in
   developing countries where the cost of highly skilled technical labor
   is 20 to 100 times the average local labor cost because the technical
   labor resources are generally imported from developed countries.
   Development of simple analytical tools that can be distributed freely
   over the Internet  may drastically decrease the cost of environmental
   and energy analysis products and allow for greater economic efficiency
   in developing country energy and resource development.  By contributing
   to developing country energy and environmental utilization efficiency,
   we contribute to the health of the global environment as a whole.

   The U.S. and Africa  have been selected as the initial test cases for
   this research. The U.S. has been chosen as that area where a tremendous
   amount of data and resources exist for forecasts and analyses.  Because
   of the data-rich environment, studies using U.S. case material allow
   for the detailed theoretical validation of methodologies.  Meanwhile
   Africa as that continent with the fewest information resources, and a
   rapidly growing population of over 800 million, has the greatest need
   for inexpensive analysis methods that can be used with a minimum of
   data.  These two study areas represent the extremes in terms of both
   institutional resources and needs.
