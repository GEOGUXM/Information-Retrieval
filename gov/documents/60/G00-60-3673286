   Environmental Geology and Risk Analysis (EES-9)
   Group Leader: Frank Perry | Group Members
   Description
   EES-9 includes 35 support, student, and technical staff, with expertise
   in the geosciences, environmental engineering, toxicology, chemistry,
   quality and data assurance, information management, probabilistic risk
   analysis, and the use of both formal and informal decision tools. EES-9
   leadership in environmental programs is based on our ability to
   integrate multidisciplinary expertise. We apply our expertise and
   capabilities primarily to problems related to environmental and
   geologic hazards. To be successful, we must integrate our
   decision-making and decision-support capabilities that impact human
   health and safety within the framework of regulatory policy.

   A Major Thrust: Optimizing and integrating scientific and modeling data
   used as input to risk and decision tools, which are designed to solve
   decision objectives in a cost-effective manner. Problems dealing with
   complex, human-impacted natural environmental systems involve
   significant technical and programmatic uncertainties that are best
   addressed through thoughtful application of new and evolving
   probabilistic risk and decision analysis tools. We will continue to
   pursue and improve these capabilities.

   Projects and Programs
     * Environmental Restoration (ER) Project - EES-9 staff members lead
       four ER Project focus areas.
       (1) Analysis and Assessment formulates and implements the two
       components of ER project integrated technical strategy: (a)
       characterization and assessment of the nature, extent, and
       migration pathways of potentially interacting contamination within
       watersheds (or aggregates therein) and (b) integrated risk-based
       corrective-action decisions, taking into account all appropriate
       risks, using strict data-quality and data-management procedures.
       (2) Canyons evaluates the present-day human health and ecological
       risks from Laboratory-derived contaminants in the Laboratory's
       canyons system and assesses future impacts of the transport of
       these contaminants through the canyons to areas outside the
       Laboratory. Field studies are a large part of their work.
       (3) Material Disposal Areas (MDAs) characterizes each MDA and
       designs corrective actions so that the Laboratory can close the MDA
       in accordance with applicable regulations. Ensuring that MDAs do
       not pose a future hazard to humans or the environment is an
       important aspect of this work. Field studies around the MDAs are
       underway.
       (4) Information Management is developing an integrated system to
       capture, store, and retrieve scientific, engineering, and business
       information for the ER Project.
     * Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) - Surface processes and volcanism
       For many years, our staff served as principal investigators for
       volcanism and surface processes (erosion) as hazards to the
       potential Yucca Mountain repository. Our group includes the two
       lead authors for scientific reports on surface processes and
       volcanic hazards. YMP has recently changed its emphasis from
       characterizing the potential repository site to preparing a series
       of scientific reports describing our present knowledge of the site
       and surrounding region. EES-9 has led the effort to ensure that
       these documents are integrated and regulatory compliant. We are
       also responsible for YMP quality assurance (QA). Much of our QA
       activity centers on establishing "traceability"-reviewing and
       verifying the entire research process from initial experiments and
       to the paper describing final results.
     * Nevada Test Site (NTS) Environmental Management Program - lead
       scientific advisor
       A member of our staff is the lead scientific advisor to the DOE's
       NTS Environmental Management Program in Las Vegas. He assesses the
       performance of classified transuranic waste, now buried in
       deep-disposal boreholes, and low-level waste, disposed of in
       alluvium at NTS. He is also studying migration of radionuclides
       from the underground test areas at NTS and on Amchitka Island in
       the Aleutians.
     * Seismic Hazards Program
       We lead the program to evaluate possible seismic hazards to the
       Laboratory's nuclear facilities. The program includes paleoseismic
       and structural geology studies, a felt-earthquake response team,
       and community outreach. We also contributed to the Laboratory's
       recovery efforts from the Cerro Grande fire by studying the impact
       of topography on the potential for flooding and contaminant
       transport.
     * Japanese Magmatic Hazards Project
       Since 1998, we have been conducting volcanic risk studies for the
       Japanese geologic repository program, in collaboration with the
       Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute. By studying an analog
       composite volcano, Summer Coon, in Colorado, we have developed a
       conceptual model and Monte Carlo techniques to calculate the hazard
       of a large radial-dike system disrupting a Japanese geologic
       repository.

   Vision for the Future
   In the future, EES-9 will apply and build our capabilities by
   participating in
     * environmental remediation, both within the DOE complex and
       internationally;
     * repository science in international settings;
     * environmental and geologic hazards in regional settings (semi-arid
       and international border regions); and
     * environmental and geologic hazards in urban settings (urban
       security).

   Using our expertise in leading and integrating large, complex programs,
   we hope to team with our division colleagues to address global warming,
   increased pressure on the environment and natural resources, and
   increased risk from natural hazards that attend the growth of human
   population and infrastructure.
