   Profile data are presented here to aid research on the chemical
   structure of laminar, hydrocarbon diffusion flames - both for
   comparisons with other experimental results, as well as for evaluating
   the predictions of flame models. Specifically, measurements made at
   NIST during the period 1984-1998 of species concentrations (mole
   fraction), temperatures (K), and velocities (cm/s) are included for two
   diffusion flame systems. These files can be downloaded as desired. Note
   that some of the files contain more than 10 columns of data and thus
   are best viewed using a spreadsheet (such as EXCEL), rather than with a
   word processor.
