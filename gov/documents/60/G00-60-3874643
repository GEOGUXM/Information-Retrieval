                              Facts and Figures

   The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) tradition of commitment to the
   community through the selfless efforts of Federal employees has its
   roots in the many charitable campaigns of the early 1960s. Seeing a
   need to bring the diversity of fund raising efforts under one umbrella,
   Federal employees created the CFC Â– one campaign, once a year.

   By allowing employees to select from a single guide, and make their
   contributions through payroll deductions, the CFC opened wide the door
   to more opportunities for generous giving to literally hundreds of
   worthy causes. An Executive Order made the CFC a reality and turned an
   innovative idea into a uniquely effective way for Federal employees to
   help those in need across our community and throughout the world.

   The Federal employees are some of the most philanthropic members of our
   community. The Central and Northern New Mexico Federal employees raised
   $1,080,677 in the 1998 campaign. This has been the most donations
   recorded by the local federal campaign. The campaign has had an
   increase of 13% over the past 5 years. The United Way of Central New
   Mexico has been has been the Principle Combined Fund Organization for
   the CFC for the last 15 years.
