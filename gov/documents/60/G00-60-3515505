   Photochemistry/Photobiology

   Scientists in the Photochemisrty/Photobiology Workgroup use a variety
   of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence,
   phosphorescence, electron spin resonance, laser and conventional flash
   photolysis) to study the photosensitization (phototoxicity and/or
   photoallergy)that occurs as a result of the absorption of ultraviolet
   and/or visible radiation by chemical agents in exposed tissues such as
   the skin and eyes. The photosensitizing chemical may be endogenous
   (protoporphyrin in erythropoietic protoporphyria), a topical agent
   (halogenated salicylanilides in soaps), an environmental chemical
   (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in coal tar), or a therapeutic agent
   (hematoporphyrin derivative in photodynamic therapy). Some of the
   chemicals under recent study include anthralin (an anti-psoriatic
   agent), curcumin (a topical antiseptic drug), azathioprine (an
   anti-cancer drug), fluoroquinolone antibiotics, titanium dioxide (a
   common ingredient of sunscreens and cosmetics) and kynurenines (the
   principal chromophores in the human lens absorbing above 300 nm). In
   addition to providing information on the mechanisms involved in
   photosensitization these studies also make it possible to design
   rational intervention procedures. Such intervention may become even
   more important in the future as the decrease in stratospheric ozone
   causes an increase in the UVB (280-315 nm) radiation reaching the
   earth's surface.
