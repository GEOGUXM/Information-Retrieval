   [WLpic.gif] Fish and wildlife that inhabit the Columbia River and
   Hanford Site are monitored for radioactive contaminants for several
   reasons. Wildlife has access to areas of the site that contain
   radioactive or chemical contamination, and fish can be exposed to
   contamination entering the river along the shoreline. Fish and some
   wildlife species exposed to Hanford contaminants might be harvested for
   food and may potentially contribute to offsite public exposure. In
   addition, detection of contaminants in wildlife may indicate that
   wildlife are entering contaminated areas or that materials are moving
   out of contaminated areas.

   Samples are collected at various locations annually, generally during
   the hunting or fishing seasons. Bone and muscle samples are analyzed to
   evaluate radiation levels.

   Detailed information on fish and wildlife surveillance is available in
   the Hanford Site 2000 Environmental Report, Section 4.5.
