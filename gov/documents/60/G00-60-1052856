     * On April 27th 1999, the Main Injector achieved its final
       commissioning of 2e13 protons per pulse at 120 GeV Slow Extracted.
       The beam was extracted to the P1/P2 Line.

     * On Jan 9th 1999, 8 GeV proton was successfully extracted from Main
       Injector into P150 beam line. At present work continues to tune the
       beam line to transmit beam to pbar.

     * On Jan 6th 1999 Fermilab Main Injector achieved >1e13 protons/6
       batch intensity @150 GeV. The Main Injector Commissioning goal is
       to achieve >1e13 protons/6 batch intensity @150 GeV. We have
       achieved this commissioning goal.

     * On Dec 24th 1998 Fermilab Main Injector achieved 2.2e12
       protons/batch intensity @ 120 GeV. The overall efficiency achived
       was ~75% at this intensity. This satisfied one of the Main Injector
       commissioning goal:
          + 2e12 protons for antiproton production per cycle.

     * On Nov 27th 1998, Fermilab Main Injector accelerated high intensity
       proton per batch to 120 GeV. Protons were accelerated to 120 GeV
       with a transmission efficiency of ~85% to 120 GeV. This satisfied
       one of the Main Injector commissioning goal.
          + 120 GeV Protons Energy for antiproton production.

     * On Nov 28th 1998, We successfully ramped the Main Injector to 150
       GeV with beam. The overall efficiency was ~85% at 150 GeV. This
       satisfied two Main Injector commissioning goals.
          + 150 GeV Proton Energy for injection into Tevatron.
          + 75% proton transmission efficiency at 150 GeV.

     * On Nov 27th 1998, We successfully ramped the Main Injector with
       beam at a repitation rate of 2.5 Sec. This satisfied the
       commissioning goal
          + 2.5 sec Cycle Time to 120 GeV.

     * On Nov 28th 1998, We sucessfully tried Multibatch(6 batches)
       transfer from Booster to Main Injector. This was performed to test
       the hardware and software for multibatch transfer. The
       commissioning goal is to achieve a total of 1.0e13 proton in Main
       Injector (2.0e13 total in Tevatron, 2 Main Injector Cycles) at 150
       GeV for Fixed Target Physics operation.
