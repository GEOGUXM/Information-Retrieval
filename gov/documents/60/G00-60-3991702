   Quigg, "Memos for the Next Millennium" 20 The SSC Was the Right Answer
   Central problem in particle physics: understand the mechanism of
   electroweak symmetry breaking. Explore the 1-TeV scale Search for the
   Higgs boson 40-TeV pp collider with 1033 cm-2 s-1 would have been the
   ideal instrument. Still the best practical idea we've had . . . . . .
   but it's not going to happen. Complicates the task of developing a new
   vision Luckily, LHC is a very capable machine. Our challenge: * Develop
   better practical ideas * Look to physics beyond EWSB * Imagine ways to
   pursue LEP2  Tevatron  LHC discoveries Users99 C. Quigg, "Memos for the
   Next Millennium" 21 e+e- linear collider A lovely idea! Fermilab
   accelerator links to SLAC & DESY Possible goals: * multi-TeV to
   complement LHC studies of EWSB * detailed studies of top or Higgs or
   SUSY; threshold scans of any new channel Traditional advantages: *
   Point particle means full Ecm is available * No background from the
   underlying event Traditional challenges: * Hard to reach very high
   energies * Small cross sections demand high luminosity Users99 C.

   Quigg, "Memos for the Next Millennium" 23 Gilman subpanel
   recommendation: The Subpanel recommends that SLAC continue R&D with
   Japan's KEK toward a common design for an electron-positron linear
   collider with a luminosity of at least 1034 cm-2 s-1 and an initial
   capability of 1 TeV in the center of mass, extendible to 1.5 TeV. The
   Subpanel recommends that SLAC be authorized to produce a Conceptual
   Design Report for this machine in close collaboration with KEK. This is
   not a recommendation to proceed with construction. A decision on
   whether to construct a linear collider should only follow the
   recommendation of a future subpanel convened after the CDR is complete.
   The decision will depend on what is known about the technology of
   linear colliders and other potential facilities, costs, international
   support, and advances in our physics understanding. My belief: The US
   (and worldwide) HEP community will decide within five years whether to
   proceed with a linear collider-on its own, and not in competition with
   any other machine. This decision must be based on an informed
   assessment of the scientific opportunities, technical risk, and cost.
   Building an inadequate machine "because we need a project" would be
   calamitous. Users99 C. Quigg, "Memos for the Next Millennium" 24 We
   Cannot Stand Apart * Only informed opinions will carry any weight. * We
   have the standing to check claims about physics and accelerator
   science. Example: How long does it take to carry out the physics menu
   of a 500-GeV linear collider? * The entire community must define the
   Right Linear Collider: E, L, and technology. * Much physics is in
   common with the physics of a muon collider. (Profit from LC studies,
   learn what it takes to compete.) * Fermilab is a possible site for a
   linear collider at the energy frontier.

   Gilman subpanel recommendation: The Subpanel recommends that an
   expanded program of R&D be carried out on a muon collider, involving
   both simulation and experiments. This R&D program should have central
   project management, involve both laboratory and university groups, and
   have the aim of resolving the question of whether this machine is
   feasible to build and operate for exploring the high-energy frontier.
   The scale and progress of this R&D program should be subject to
   additional review in about two years. European interest: * Report to
   ECFA, "Prospective Study of Muon Storage Rings in Europe" *
   CERNSPSC/98-30, "Physics Opportunities at a CERN-based Neutrino
   Factory" My belief: The muon collider path needs a plausible first step
   that is rich in physics. If a neutrino source can be built by the time
   the LHC turns on, it could offer a diverse program of experiments,
   including a broad assault on neutrino mass and mixing-without
   committing us to the muon collider as our machine on the energy
   frontier. Users99 C. Quigg, "Memos for the Next Millennium" 34 Beyond
