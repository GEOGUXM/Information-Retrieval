   The basic idea of colliding protons (p) and antiprotons (pbar) in
   Fermilab was proposed in 1976 by D. Cline, P. McIntyre, and C. Rubbia
   using its existing accelerator. With the invention of beam cooling
   techniques (S. Van der Meer et al., Physics Report 58 (1980) 73), it
   became possible to make colliding beams of protons and antiprotons.
   Such a development led to build the first p-pbar collider at a
   center-of-mass energy (E[cm]) of 0.63 TeV at CERN and to discover the
   weak (W and Z) bosons in 1983. The weak bosons are one of four (strong,
   electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational) force carriers, which is
   predicted by the Standard Model ("periodic table" of elementary
   particles in GIF or PDF or PostScript), the theory of elementary
   particles and forces that determine the fundamental nature of matter
   and energy.

   With the development of superconducting accelerator magnets, it became
   possible to extend the energy reach in collisions upto 2 TeV at
   Fermilab. The Fermilab Tevatron collider is currently the world's
   highest energy accelerator, colliding antiprotons with protons at E[cm]
   = 1.8 TeV. The first collisions were produced and 23 of them were
   detected in October of 1985. The Tevatron performance has evolved to
   reach the instantaneous luminosity of 2 x 10^31 cm^-1s^-1 (or a
   collision rate of 1 MHz) with production of approximately 1000 pairs of
   top (t) and antitop (tbar) quarks, leading to the discovery of the top
   quark by the CDF and DZero collaborations in 1995. The top quark, as
   the partner of the bottom quark that was discovered at Fermilab in
   1977, has been a "missing link" and is required if the Standard Model
   is correct. The Tevatron is being upgraded to provide 2 TeV collisions
   with a peak luminosity of 2 x 10^32 cm^-1s^-1 (or 10 MHz) for Run II
   (2001-2003) to increase the discovery potential of the Higgs boson
   (required by the Standard Model) and Supersymmetry.
