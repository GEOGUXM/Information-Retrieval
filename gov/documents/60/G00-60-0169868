   OEHHA is developing risk assessment guidance for comprehensively
   characterizing human health risks. Multimedia risk assessment
   integrates environmental fate and transport with exposure assessment in
   order to generate a comprehensive characterization of the human health
   risks from exposure to one or more contaminants through all relevant
   media (e.g., air, groundwater, surface water, soil, food chain).
