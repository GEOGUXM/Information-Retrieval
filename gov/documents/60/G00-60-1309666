   The Mars Exploration Program

   Sun Behing the Limb of Mars Since our first close-up picture of Mars in
   1965, spacecraft voyages to the Red Planet have revealed a world
   strangely familiar, yet different enough to challenge our perceptions
   of what makes a planet work. Every time we feel close to understanding
   Mars, new discoveries send us straight back to the drawing board to
   revise existing theories.

   You'd think Mars would be easier to understand. Like Earth, Mars has
   polar ice caps and clouds in its atmosphere, seasonal weather patterns,
   volcanoes, canyons and other recognizable features. However, conditions
   on Mars vary wildly from what we know on our own planet.

   Rocky Terrain and Pink Sky at Pathfinder Landing Site Over the past
   three decades, spacecraft have shown us that Mars is rocky, cold, and
   sterile beneath its hazy, pink sky. We've discovered that today's
   Martian wasteland hints at a formerly volatile world where volcanoes
   once raged, meteors plowed deep craters, and flash floods rushed over
   the land. And Mars continues to throw out new enticements with each
   landing or orbital pass made by our spacecraft.

   The Defining Question for Mars Exploration:
   Life on Mars?

   Among our discoveries about Mars, one stands out above all others: the
   possible presence of liquid water on Mars, either in its ancient past
   or preserved in the subsurface today. Water is key because almost
   everywhere we find water on Earth, we find life. If Mars once had
   liquid water, or still does today, it's compelling to ask whether any
   microscopic life forms could have developed on its surface. Is there
   any evidence of life in the planet's past? If so, could any of these
   tiny living creatures still exist today? Imagine how exciting it would
   be to answer, "Yes!!"

   Features in Martian Meteorite Resembling Structures Sometimes
   Associated with Microbes Even if Mars is devoid of past or present
   life, however, there's still much excitement on the horizon. We
   ourselves might become the "life on Mars" should humans choose to
   travel there one day. Meanwhile, we still have a lot to learn about
   this amazing planet and its extreme environments.

   Our Exploration Strategy: Follow the Water!

   To discover the possibilities for life on Mars--past, present or our
   own in the future--the Mars Program has developed an exploration
   strategy known as "Follow the Water."

   Following the water begins with an understanding of the current
   environment on Mars. We want to explore observed features like dry
   riverbeds, ice in the polar caps and rock types that only form when
   water is present. We want to look for hot springs, hydrothermal vents
   or subsurface water reserves. We want to understand if ancient Mars
   once held a vast ocean in the northern hemisphere as some scientists
   believe and how Mars may have transitioned from a more watery
   environment to the dry and dusty climate it has today. Searching for
   these answers means delving into the planet's geologic and climate
   history to find out how, when and why Mars underwent dramatic changes
   to become the forbidding, yet promising, planet we observe today.

   Future Missions

   Artists Concept of a Future Outpost on Mars To pursue these goals, all
   of our future missions will be driven by rigorous scientific questions
   that will continuously evolve as we make new discoveries.

   Brand new technologies will enable us to explore Mars in ways we never
   have before, resulting in higher-resolution images, precision landings,
   longer-ranging surface mobility and even the return of Martian soil and
   rock samples for studies in laboratories here on Earth.
