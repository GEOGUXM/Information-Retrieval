      Expert word processing and page layout produce documents that won't
      cause formatting or conversion problems now or when it's time to revise
      them.

      We specialize in complex, multichapter documents and are very
      experienced in handling technical material that contains formulas,
      equations, and complex tables. We will key in the text from rough copy,
      transcribe it from audio tape, scan it, or start with your software
      files in any format. All work is subjected to rigorous quality checks
      to assure its accuracy. We'll deliver your job in the form you request:
      as printed pages, overhead transparencies, slides, or computer files.
      We can also store completed documents on our server for future
      revision.
