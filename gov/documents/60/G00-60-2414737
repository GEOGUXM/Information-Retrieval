   Washington State Transportation Improvement Board

   Date: January 29, 2002
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   Contact: Stevan Gorcester, TIB director, 360-705-7301

   Transportation Improvement Board announces 2002 grants: $38 million for
   63 projects

   OLYMPIA - The Washington State Transportation Improvement Board (TIB)
   awarded $38 million in grants to 63 projects proposed by cities and
   counties across the state. The board, created by the state legislature
   in 1988, is composed of 21 members drawn from elected and appointed
   officials of cities, counties, transit agencies, state government, and
   private interests. The competitive grant programs administered by the
   TIB are funded by 3 cents of the state's existing gasoline tax.

   "While our Legislative leaders in Olympia are doing their best to come
   up with funding solutions to our region's traffic problems, we must
   atone to make the best use of existing dollars," said TIB Chair Rob
   McKenna. "This year's TIB program is once again doing a top notch job
   of distributing money across the state and this region. As has been the
   case in the past, the Puget Sound region has fared well."

   In the Arterial Improvement Program (AIP), $30 million has been
   programmed for 27 local agency projects. When combined with $17 million
   in local funds, the improvements are valued at over $47 million. These
   projects address safety, congestion, and pavement condition on the
   local arterial network in the urban areas and in those rural cities
   with populations of 5,000 and over.

   20 local agency projects. When combined with $3 million in local funds,
   the improvements are valued at $9 million. SCP projects address safety,
   congestion, and pavement condition on the local arterial network in the
   small cities across the state with a population under 5,000.

   In the Small City/Pedestrian Safety and Mobility Program (SC/PSMP),
   $1.4 million has been programmed for 16 local agency projects with a
   total value of nearly $2 million. SC/PSMP projects address pedestrian
   safety and walking route connectivity on the local street network in
   those small cities across the state with a population under 5,000.
