   "Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know
   where we can find information upon it."

   Organics Aid Planetary Aggregation (return to top)

   Organic compounds in the dust swirling in the young solar system may
   have led the dust to clump into planetesimals much earlier than
   astronomers thought. Akira Kouchi of Hokkaido University in Japan and
   colleagues simulated collisions between such dust particles and found
   that they stuck together surprisingly readily. According to the team,
   the result could help to explain why there is less matter in the
   asteroid belt than existing models of the solar system predict.

   Event Horizon Dawns on Desktop (return to top)

   An event horizon is dawning in laboratories. Using frozen light,
   physicists hope to mimic this peculiar cosmic phenomenon and glimpse
   something like the belches of a black hole.

   Martian Rocks Bonanza (return to top)

   Scientists have found five new Martian meteorites. The new rocks, which
   were blasted off the Red Planet in the distant past only to land on
   Earth at a later date, were recovered by expeditions to Antarctica and
   the hot deserts of Oman and the Sahara. They bring the number of known
   stones from Mars to just 24.

   Wealth Spawns Corruption (return to top)

   Physicists are explaining how politics can create the super-rich.

   Laser Tweezers Get a Grip on DNA (return to top)

   Ultra-precise laser tweezers have enabled scientists to handle
   individual strands of DNA with unprecedented dexterity. The technique
   devised by Ken Hirano of the University of Tokushima in Japan and
   colleagues can grip the molecule at a chosen point along its length,
   manipulate it, and then release it. Among other things, the tool could
   insert single DNA molecules into cells, a process central to gene
   therapy.

   Microsoft Looks Beyond the Desktop (return to top)

   Microsoft is due to launch a key toolkit for .Net in February that it
   hopes will start to extend the company's reach far beyond its
   traditional stronghold of desktop computers. But as .Net becomes more
   concrete, it will throw Microsoft into fierce competition with some of
   its bitterest rivals, as well as pit it against an array of new
   opponents.

   Surrounded by Sound (return to top)

   Ingenious software makes ordinary stereo speakers come alive.

   Anti-Anthrax Weapon Revealed (return to top)

   Ozone generators could be used to kill anthrax spores cheeply and
   effectively, says O3zone, a US company based in Idaho, but not everyone
   is convinced.
