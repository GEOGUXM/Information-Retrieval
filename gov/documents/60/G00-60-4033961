                 Polar Orbiting Satellite Sounding Evaluator

   The Polar Orbiting Satellite Sounding Evaluator (Posse) system is a
   collection of programs that provides users with the ability to view and
   evaluate polar satellite data. The Posse system is currently set up to
   allow access to data produced by the ATOVS Processing System.

   Please note that the Posse system is a work in progress. The downside
   of this is that you may occasionally run into problems. On the other
   hand, because Posse is still being developed, we are more than happy to
   listen to comments from users about problems that are encountered as
   well as suggestions about how to improve it.

   NOTE: It is highly recommended that users only view data which are
   designated as "operational". Data designated as "test" are not
   operational and may not be suitable for operational weather forecast
   applications. Test data are primarily intended for internal use by
   NESDIS in support of operational improvement and new satellite system
   implementation activities.

   From here, you can get to the following Posse pages:


   Posse Applet The Posse Applet is the main program for Posse. If you
   want to start running Posse, this is where you should go. Currently,
   the applet can show images from ATOVS NOAA-15 and RTOVS NOAA-14
   soundings systems.. ATOVS has two satellite systems referred to as A1
   and A2. A1 is the operational and A2 is the test system.
   POSSE Status Find out the latest on the development of the POSSE system
   POSSE User's Guide This page contains the User's Guide for the applet.
   A brief overview is provided along with a step-by-step walkthrough of
   the applet's features. Please note that this is a rough draft. A final
   version will be available once the first version of POSSE is finalized
   Posse FAQ If you have any questions about Posse, check this page for
   frequently asked questions.

   The NOAA/NESDIS Soundings Development Team would like to express our
   gratitude to the Forecast Research Division of NOAA's Forecast Systems
   Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. The Skew-T Log-P diagram used by POSSE
   uses selected code from an applet they created which displays various
   soundings and profiles. Without the use of this code, the addition of
   the Skew-T to POSSE would have taken several weeks, if not longer.
   Instead, it was added in just a few days.

   If you have any questions or comments about Posse, please contact Hank
   Drahos.
