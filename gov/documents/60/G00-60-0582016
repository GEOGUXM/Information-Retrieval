                               CVS Repository

   This is a WWW interface for CVS Repositories. You can browse the file
   hierarchy by picking directories (which have slashes after them, e.g.,
   src/). If you pick a file, you will see the revision history for that
   file. Selecting a revision number will download that revision of the
   file. There is a link at each revision to display diffs between that
   revision and the previous one, and a form at the bottom of the page
   that allows you to display diffs between arbitrary revisions.

   This script has been written by Bill Fenner <fenner@freebsd.org> and
   improved by Henner Zeller <zeller@think.de>, Henrik Nordström
   <hno@hem.passagen.se>, and Ken Coar <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>; it is covered
   by the BSD-Licence.

   If you would like to use this CGI script on your own web server and CVS
   tree, see Zeller's CVSweb distribution site. Bill's original script can
   be found here.

   Please send any suggestions, comments, etc. to Bill Fenner or,
   regarding the modifications, to Henner Zeller, Henrik Nordström, or Ken
   Coar.
