                      Volcanic Hazards

                  Volcanic Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i

   Lava fountain and lava flows on Pu`u `O`o, Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i
   Lava flows are the primary hazard People watching lava pour into sea,
   Kilauea Volcano, Hawai`i
   Lava entering sea can be dangerous

   Ever since lava first erupted above sea level over 500,000 years ago to
   begin building the Island of Hawai`i, countless eruptions from its five
   volcanoes have built the "Big Island" to a towering height of more than
   4,000 m (13,000 ft). Its two most active volcanoes -- Mauna Loa and
   Kilauea -- erupt lava frequently enough to pose a serious hazard to
   property on many parts of the island. About 40 percent of Mauna Loa has
   been covered by lava in the past 1,000 years and over 90 percent of
   Kilauea's surface is covered by lava less than 1,100 years old. As land
   development expands toward areas of relatively high hazard, the threat
   to life and property on Hawai`i will increase accordingly.

Types of Volcano Hazards at Hawaiian volcanoes

          The following hazards are described in the USGS publication,
          Volcanic and Seismic Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i, revised
          and reprinted in 1997:

          + lava flows
          + tephra (airborne lava fragments)
          + volcanic gases
          + explosive eruptions
          + ground cracks and settling

When lava meets the sea

          New land the size of several football fields can collapse into
          the ocean with little or no warning, and the intensity of
          lava-seawater explosions can change suddenly. Find out how new
          land is created when lava enters the sea and how to identify
          areas near lava-entry points that are safe for viewing.

          + Explosions at lava entry points
          + Waves send scalding water onto new land

Lava-flow hazard zones on the Island of Hawai`i

          Hazard zones from lava flows are based chiefly on the location
          and frequency of historic and prehistoric eruptions and the
          topography of the volcanoes. Scientists have prepared a map that
          divides the five volcanoes of the Island of Hawai`i into zones
          that are ranked from 1 through 9 based on the relative
          likelihood of coverage by lava flows.

Hazards Posed by Volcanoes

          Illustrations, descriptions, and animation of hazards posed by
          volcanoes worldwide, including tephra, lahars, lava flows,
          pyroclastic flows, landslides, and volcanic gas.
