     As a result of the NRC study "Computing and Communications in the
     Extreme", the HPCC Office identified several areas of crisis
     planning, mitigation, response, and recovery which would benefit
     from the application of advanced information technologies.

     NOAA is now developing new capabilities in several areas focused on
     nomadic networking and presentation of timely information whenever
     needed, and wherever needed.

     The first result was the development, testing, and subsequent
     deployment of LAN-on-demand capabilities for NOAA's hazardous
     materials response teams which provides the capability to deploy to
     remote locations and setup a wireless LAN to support emergency
     response activities.

     More work is going on in the areas of mobile wireless, information
     on demand (for chemical releases) and rapid, integrated
     environmental data (multi-source wind information during hurricanes,
     jointly funded by FEMA).


                             Technical Approach

     * Explore the limits of current wireless technologies
     * Integrate multiple data sources to provide products to emergency
       managers and researchers
     * Automate and accelerate legacy processes to provide better
       information faster


                               Recent Results

     * Developed, tested and installed LAN-on-demand for Hazmat teams
     * Integrated 12 source data bases of hazardous chemical information
       through Java-based interface transforming a once- every-two-years
       process into a situation-driven on-demand update


                                 What's Next

     * Provide wind data from multiple sources to researchers and to FEMA
       in near real time
     * Develop a collaborative environment for use of chemical data during
       release incidents
