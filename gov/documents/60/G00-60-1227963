   SeaWinds Casts a Closer Eye on Tropical Cyclones
   In a new NASA-funded study, researchers have dramatically improved the
   warning time for tropical cyclone development in the Atlantic and
   Eastern Pacific hurricane basins using satellite data to access a
   combination of the spin of the atmosphere and wind speed data. With
   this new method, potential tropical cyclones can be detected more than
   40 hours earlier than with traditional methods, giving more time for
   warnings and preparation. Full Story   A thumbnail of a chart detection

   Climate Change May Bring More Winter Floods, and a Drier Growing Season
   in California
   A new study finds that climate warming over the next century will bring
   potential flooding in winter, as a result of increased streamflow
   throughout California. The study also finds less water would be
   available during the summer months. Full Story   A thumbnail of a map

   Study Links El Ni√±o To Deadly South American Disease
   In a groundbreaking collaborative study, NASA climatologists and U.S.
   military health specialists may have discovered a way to predict
   outbreaks of a deadly South American disease by observing sea surface
   temperature. Full Story   A thumbnail of an image showing a lesion on
