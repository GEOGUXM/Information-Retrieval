     [acs1.jpg] NIST Named National Historic Chemical Landmark

     NIST joined the ranks of some illustrious organizations on December 5th
     when it was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the
     American Chemical Society (ACS) and the Chemical Society of Washington
     (CSW) in ceremonies held in Gaithersburgs Green Auditorium. The ACS,
     the worlds largest scientific society, has named nearly 40 illustrious
     places, discoveries, and achievements as national historic chemical
     landmarks. Among them: the Chandler Chemistry Laboratory at Lehigh
     University in Bethlehem, Pa. (the first in the United States built
     specifically to train industrial chemists); the University of
     California, Berkeleys Gilman Hall (site of the identification of
     plutonium); and New Yorks Rockefeller University (home to five Nobel
     laureates in chemistry for breakthrough work on proteins and nucleic
     acids). The landmark designation awarded NIST by the ACS is an
     outstanding tribute that caps NISTs exciting centennial year. NIST was
     cited as having made broad-based and comprehensive contributions to
     chemical science and technology and to the economic strength and
     competitiveness of the United States. ACS added that NIST continues
     to demonstrate that the intelligent application of research in physical
     sciences to a wide range of societal changes contributes to a higher
     quality of life for everyone. The ACS National Historic Chemical
     Landmarks Program recognizes the nations scientific and technical
     heritage and encourages the preservation of historically important
     achievements and artifacts in chemistry, chemical engineering, and the
     chemical process industries.
