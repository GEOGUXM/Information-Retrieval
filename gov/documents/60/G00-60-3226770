OVERVIEW

   The Middle School students at the WSSB, which includes grades 6, 7 & 8,
   spend a good portion of their day in Room 3, their Homeroom.  There
   they learn teach them Organizational Skills, Social Skills, Computer
   Sk="Arial"> ills, Language Arts, U.S. History and Compensatory Skills
   such as Braille from their primary teachers, Shelly Brown & Robb Peck.

   They also have courses from other instructors in Fitness, Music,
   Science, Math and Reading Skills.  Additionally, as the need arises
   students in the middle school will have "pull-out" course work from
   specialist in such classes as Daily Living Skills, Adaptive Technology,
   Orientation & Mobility,  and Speech Therapy.

   Compensatory Skills are those skills necessary our students to
   'compensate' for their vision loss:  Braille instruction, large print
   use, audio book use, magnification, voice output on computer, etc.
   Many students at our school get intense,  individual instruction in
   these and others,  but the skills are worked on in class as well.

Homeroom

   While most people probably know about Language Arts and U.S. History,
   the other classes are ones that are not part of a typical curriculum.
   These classes, teaching skills in organization, social behavior and the
   changes of adolescence, can be as or more important than reading,
   writing and math to kids this age.

   Organizational Skills - Mrs. Brown
   Using an assignment folder to keep track of homework and a locker to
   organize their books and work, students are taught a variety of skills
   to help them become more organized and self-sufficient.

   Social Skills - Mr. Peck
   Using the Lion-Quest, Skills for Adolescence curriculum, students
   discuss the changes theyre experiencing during this important time in
   their life.  Theyll learn how to strengthen their self-confidence,
   manage their emotions, and communicate better with friends and family
   members.  Theres plenty of practice in decision making and problem
   solving, too.  Theyll learn ways being healthy and drug-free will help
   them become the person they were meant to be and ways to stay drug-free

   and thinking about ways to make the most of themselves.

GRADING POLICIES

   There are two different grading procedures for Middle School students,
   depending on grade.  6th grader students will be graded on a
   unsatisfactory / satisfactory / excellent (u/s/e) scale.  7th & 8th
   grade students will be graded on a percentage scale with a letter grade
   attached. (7th & 8th grade students can be placed on the u/s/e scale at
   parent & advocate choice.)  Papers written for Middle School classes
   will be graded on a scoring rubric, which details exactly what is and
