   The Majesty of African Motherhood
   A comprehensive exhibit of mother and child sculptures from Africa is
   on display in the West Gallery. The sculptures, which originate from
   West and Central Africa, are from the private collections of David
   Lawrence and Herman Bigham. Each piece depicts a traditional example of
   the views of motherhood, femininity, nurturing and nourishing.
   Lawrence, a New York native, is an accomplished artist in his own right
   who has committed himself to enhancing awareness of the impact of
   African aesthetics on western art and design.
   Bigham, a life long Philadelphian, travels frequently to Africa in
   search of new art. He then uses his collection to produce educational
   and cultural workshops to build awareness of the history, traditions
   and sensibilities of Africa through the art of the continent.

   The exhiblt will be on display through April 30, 2002

   Julian Francis Abele Student Design Competition
   Julian Francis Abele Student Design Competition
   Julian Francis Abele, the African American architect who designed
   Central Library did not receive the recognition he deserved 75 years
   ago. Now, his vision inspires young people with dreams of entering the
   world of architecture and design.
   The Free Library, in partnership with the Philadelphia Chapter of the
   National Organization of Minority Architects (PhilaNOMA), the American
   Institute of Architects-Philadelphia Chapter, and p_FAD, is sponsoring
   this competition to foster the creative spirit and commemorate the 75th
   Anniversary of Abeles wonderful creation, Central Library.
   High school students will set about to build the Library of the
   Future, thus building dreams not only of design, but also of powerful
   community resources. All students will be mentored by professional
   architects. Winners will be announced at the Gala 75th Anniversary
   Celebration the weekend of May 31st.
   The competition is presented by Hillier Architects and the University
   of Pennsylvania Department of Architecture, with additional support
   from Ballinger, Cope Linder Architects and Philip E. Franks and
   Associates, Architects.
