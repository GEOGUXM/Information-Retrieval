                         Financial Analysis Project
   Horizontal Line

                          Updated: October 03, 2001

     What is this project?

     Voluntarily filing your detailed transactions with SAO right after
     year end so that SAO auditors can use that data for audits.

     SAO will be able to do central analytical procedures for all the
     entities that file.

     SAO auditors can use the data to plan before they come on site.

     SAO auditors will not have to ask for reports and data from the
     entities (SAO auditors will have data to do their own reports).

     Opportunities

     Reduce audit planning time by making it quicker to analyze 100% of
     transactions

     Ability to more easily train new auditors

     Less travel in the planning phase, resulting in reduced travel costs
     to the entities and less road time for SAO auditors (one of the
     downsides of SAO auditors' jobs is how much they travel)

     Benefits for the Entities

     Better audits. Audits will take less time planning and require less
     interruptions to the auditee (e.g. the auditee will not have to sit
     and copy the transaction files SAO auditors need when they arrive on
     site). This will allow entity staff to be more productive and have
     use of their computer more while SAO auditors are on-site.

     Off-site data backup.

     Potential for reduced travel costs since much of the planning can be
     done off-site.

     Potential for slower rate increases in the future since we will be
     more efficient in our audits.

     The ability to file your annual report over the internet also.

     Less turnover in SAO auditors which will result in more experienced
     staff and therefore more efficient and less disruptive audits.

     Benefits for SAO

     Reduction in hours spent planning.

     Increase the usage of computers and reap the benefits in speed.

     Easier and quicker training of new auditors.

     Potential for less travel for auditors.

     Less turnover and stress to our auditors.

     Prototype scope

     Budget backup right now

     In the future, payroll, utility

     File all three backups so that we can move quickly and seamlessly to
     phase 2 and 3.

     ASP is the first in a long list of vendors and central systems we
     will be approaching. Next will be schools (9 ESDs), possibly DISCUS
     with OAC, Edens, Springbrook ..)
