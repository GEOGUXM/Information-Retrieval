   Welcome to the NASA Langley Satellite Page. This page was developed to
     support the Interhemispheric differences in cirrus properties from
    anthropogenic emissions (INCA) field campaign in Punta Arenas, Chile
    (Spring 2000) and in Prestwick, Scotland (Fall 2000). Near real-time
     Meteosat-7, GOES-8 and AVHRR (NOAA-14 & -15) satellite imagery and
    products, satellite orbital predictions, and weather products will be
   available on this page. It is not intended for "operational" use. This
    work is being directed by Patrick Minnis  of the Atmospheric Sciences
     Division  at the NASA Langley Research Center   located in Hampton,
                                  Virginia.
     Note: Data acquisition for Punta Arenas was turned off on April 16,
                                    2000
