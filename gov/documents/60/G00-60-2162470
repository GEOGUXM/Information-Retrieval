  How to Search the NINDS Website

   If you know a phrase to search on, type in the phrase(s) into the box
   and click "Go".
   The search engine will search the database and return a list of
   results.
   You may use "AND", "OR", "NOT" in between multiple words to customize
   your search.

   For example:
     * Tumor AND brain will return all the documents that have both of
       these words in their content.
     * Tumor AND NOT brain will return all documents that have the word
       tumor but not the word brain.
     * Tumor OR cancer will return any document that contains the term
       tumor or the word cancer.

  General Search Tips

     * Use "AND", "OR", and "NOT" to get better results.
     * Note that search engine is not case sensitive. For example "AND"
       and "and" work the same.
