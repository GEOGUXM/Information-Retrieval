             The deployment and retrieval of a satellite designed to study
             Earth's middle atmosphere along with a test of potential
             International Space Station hardware will highlight NASA's sixth
             Shuttle mission of 1997. The prime payload for the flight, the
             Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the
             Atmosphere-Shuttle Pallet Satellite-2 (CRISTA-SPAS-2) is making
             its second flight on the Space Shuttle (previous flight STS-66
             in 1994) and is the fourth mission in a cooperative venture
             between the German Space Agency (DARA) and NASA.

             During the flight, Davis will use Discovery's robot arm to
             deploy the CRISTA-SPAS payload for about 9 days of free-flight.
             CRISTA-SPAS consists of three telescopes and four spectrometers
             that will measure trace gases and dynamics of the Earth's middle
             atmosphere. Davis also will operate the robot arm for
             CRISTA-SPAS retrieval. The Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) on
             which the scientific instruments are mounted is a self-contained
             platform that provides power, command, control and communication
             with Discovery during free-flight.

             Two other instruments mounted on the SPAS also will study the
             Earth's atmosphere. The Middle Atmosphere High Resolution
             Spectrograph Instrument (MAHRSI) will measure hydroxyl and
             nitric oxide by sensing UV radiation emitted and scattered by
             the atmosphere, while the Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM)
             is a passive carrier for state-of-the-art optical surfaces to
             study the impact of the atomic oxygen and the space environment
             on materials and services.

             The crew also will support the Manipulator Flight Demonstration
             (MFD) experiment being sponsored by NASDA, the Japanese Space
             Agency. MFD consists of three separate experiments located on a
             support truss in the payload bay. The primary objective is to
             demonstrate the newly designed dexterous robot arm in the space
             environment, before installing on the Japanese Experiment Module
             (JEM) of the International Space Station.

             Several Hitchhiker payloads, including the Technology
             Applications and Science Payload (TAS-01), the International
             Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (SEH), and the Ultraviolet
             Spectrograph Telescope for Astronomical Research (UVSTAR) will
             be housed in Discovery's payload bay, operating independently of
             crew support during the flight.

             The Microgravity Vibration Isolation Mount (MIM) experiment will
             be operated by Canadian Space Agency astronaut Bjarni
             Tryggvason. The MIM experiment is a small double-locker size
             device designed to isolate International Space Station payloads
             and experiments from disturbances created by thruster firings or
             crew activity. MIM will be operated for 30 hours with real-time
             data transmission to investigators on the ground. (Reference
             NASA Press Release 96-224)

             Another experiment onboard STS-85 is the Southwest Ultraviolet
             Imaging System (SWUIS-01) from the Southwest Research Institute
             (SwRI) along with scientific collaborators from JPL, APL, and
             the University of Maryland. SWUIS (pronounced, "swiss") is a
             wide-field UV imager to which will be used to observe comet
             Hale-Bopp. It is based around an 18-cm Maksutov UV telescope and
             a UV-sensitive, Xybion image-intensified CCD camera that frames
             at video rates (30 Hz). Each SWUIS observation period will last
             approximately 3 hours, and should garner 10^5 images in up to 7
             filter bandpasses. SWUIS will be operated from a 2-axis mount
             inside the Shuttle mid-deck cockpit, and looks out of the
             Shuttle through a quartz window. SWUIS can be pointed anywhere
             in a 4.5 deg cone around the centerline of the comet. Mission
             specialists will set up and operate the instrument.

   Launch:

             Launch August 7, 1997 10:41:00.069 am EDT. Launch window is 1
             hour, 39 minutes (1 Launch COLA due to Mir overhead between
             10:53am - 10:55am).

             On Thursday, 8/7/97 at 6:00am, the countdown was at a two hour
             planned hold at the T-minus 3 hour mark. Weather forcasters
             predicted a 60% chance of favorable weather. Discovery was fully
             fueled and a go was given to wake the flight crew. Crew
             breakfast began at 6:18am, followed by a weather briefing,
             suitup at 6:46am and then departure for Pad 39A at 7:26am EDT.
             The coundown came out of the hold at 7:21am EDT. By 8:30am EDT,
             the crew were all strapped into their launch seats and
             communication checks were performed. The hatch was closed by
             9:18am EDT and leak checks complete by 9:30am EDT. At 9:28 am
             EDT, RSO reported a no go due to ground fog leading to a
             visability of less than 5 miles but predicted that the fog would
             burn off as the sun rises. (Reference KSC Weather History
             08/07/1997 0900). The countdown clock picked up at 9:38am at the
             T-minus 44 minute mark. The white room crew reported to OTC that
             the white room was secure. At 10:03am EDT, the count entered the
             automatic hold at the T-minus 20 minute mark. At 10:09am EDT,
             SRO reported to NTD that Range Safety cleared the Launch Commit
             Criteria (LCC) Violation and gave a go to launch. The countdown
             picked up at 10:11am EDT and held at the planned hold at the
             T-minus 9 minute mark. At 10:28am EDT, the NASA Test Director
             (NTD) conducted a final poll of the launch team in the firing
             room and the Launch Director Jim Harrington conducted a final
             poll of the mission management team. There were no constraints
             to launch and the count came out of the T-minus 9 minute mark at
             10:32am EDT. Liftoff occured at 10:41am EDT.

             On Tuesday, 8/5/97, The orbiter's mid-body umbilical unit was
             demated and retracted into the Fixed Service Structure.
             Preparations were underway to retract the Rotating Service
             Structure to the launch position at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.
             Loading of the external tank with cryogenic propellants began at
             about 1:50 a.m. on Thursday 8/7/97. The STS-85 crew arrived at
             KSC's Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at about 5 p.m. 8/5/97 and
             took opportunities to complete a few familiarization activities.
             Commander Curtis Brown and Pilot Kent Rominger practiced SLF
             approaches in the Shuttle Training Aircraft this morning as
             well. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 8/06/1997)

             Discovery's aft compartment close-outs concluded on Saturday
             8/2/97 with installation of the aft access doors. External tank
             purge activities were also completed on Saturday. The launch
             countdown for STS-85 began 8/4/97 at 3 p.m. Loading of cryogenic
             fuels into the power reactant storage distribution system began
             at 7:30 a.m. 8/5/97. Testing of Discovery's pyrotechnic
             initiator controllers began at 4 p.m. on Tuesday. Servicing of
             the CRISTA-SPAS payload continued and final payload bay door
             closure was 5 a.m. 8/5/97. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             8/05/1997)

             On Wednesday, 7/30/97, Space suit installation and check-out
             were complete. Discovery's aft compartment close-outs continue
             through the weekend. Ordnance installation was delayed due to
             work on the orbiter's connections to a ground coolant unit. The
             connections are being replaced to ensure that no further freon
             leakage occurs. Replacement of Mass Memory Unit No. 1 is in work
             and reload is also slated. Because of the damaged oxidizer drain
             line found on Columbia, inspections of Discovery's oxidizer
             drain line are being performed as well. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 7/30/1997)

             On Tuesday, 7/22/97, the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test
             (TCDT) began in the Launch Control Center and at Pad 39A. The
             payload Interface Verification Test (IVT) was successfully
             concluded and preparations were underway for servicing the
             CRISTA-SPAS with cryogenic helium next week. Preparations
             continue for loading hypergolic propellants aboard the Space
             Shuttle on Thursday. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/22/1997)

             The Shuttle helium signature test was successfully concluded
             over the weekend and the payload interface verification testing
             was performed on monday, 7/21/97. Preparations continue for
             loading hypergolic propellants on Thursday. The astronauts
             arrived at KSC Sunday evening for the Terminal Countdown
             Demonstration Test (TCDT) starting 8 a.m. EST Tuesday 7/22/97
             and concluding 11 a.m. Wednesday. The crew will be on the flight
             deck for the last three hours of the test as is customary. The
             TCDT is an electrical test of the Space Shuttle vehicle and a
             procedural exercise for the launch team and astronauts.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/21/1997)

             On Friday, 7/18/97, the payload Interface Verification Test
             (IVT) and the Shuttle helium signature test were conducted and
             preparations continued for loading of hypergolic propellants.
             The crew is scheduled to arrive at KSC Sunday evening for the
             Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT) July 22-23.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/18/1997)

             In the VAB, orbiter/external tank interface leak checks
             concluded on Friday, 7/11/97. Functional testing of the liquid
             oxygen 17-inch disconnect were completed and the Shuttle
             Interface Test wrapped up. Discovery is slated to roll out to
             Pad 39A on Monday, 7/14/97 beginning at about 2 a.m. At pad 39A,
             the CRISTA-SPAS payload was moved to the payload ground handling
             mechanism. It will be installed into the orbiter. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 7/11/1997)
             On 6/25/97, potable water servicing was complete and a 24-hour
             decay check was in work. Tile replacement work continued on
             Discovery's forward reaction control system. Close-outs of
             Discovery's aft compartment continues through Thursday and
             preparations were underway for payload bay door closure. In the
             Vehicle Assembly Building, ordnance installation on the solid
             rocket booster holddown posts was in work. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 6/25/1997)

             On 6/10/97, heat shield installation continues through Tuesday
             and mid-body close-outs continue on schedule. Repair work on the
             lower portion of Discovery's rudder speed brake are continuing
             through Tuesday. Tile inspections resulted in the removal of 7
             suspect tiles on the FRCS. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             6/10/1997)

             On 3/25/97, Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) No. 1 and 3 have
             been removed and Engine No. 2 will be removed. The forward
             Reaction Control System (RCS) functional checks continue today.
             Work to remove and replace fuel cell No. 2 will begin 3/27/97.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 3/25/1997)

             On 3/5/97, deservicing of Discovery's hypergolic system began.
             This hazardous operation to remove residuals from the Reaction
             Control System (RCS) keeps the bay closed to non-essential
             personnel and other work through most of the day. An orbiter
             navigational aid activation test is scheduled for 3/6/97 and
             hydraulic system inspections will begin. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 3/05/1997)

             The launch was originally scheduled for July 17, 1997 at 10:06am
             but was slipped to early August so that Columbia could refly the
             STS-83 MSL-1 mission that was cut short due to a fuel cell
             problem.

             Wheel Stop at EDT 7:09:07 (MET 11days 20hr 28min 07sec).

             At 5:44 a.m. EDT, commander Curtis L. Brown, Jr was given the go
             to take Discovery out of orbit with a 2 minute 14 second deorbit
             burn of its twin Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines. The
             burn occured on orbit 189 at 6:08am EDT while Discovery was over
             the Pacific Ocean. Entry Interface occured at 6:37am. KSC's 1st
             opportunity landing track took Discovery over the Yucatan
             peninsula and then over the Gulf of Mexico. At 7:00am EDT, with
             8 minutes to touchdown, Discovery was 135nm from the Shuttle
             Landing Facility, traveling at an altitude of 18000ft and
             3,300mph. At 5 min to touchdown, Discovery was at 58,000ft and
             10nm west of KSC. Sonic booms were heard at KSC at 7:06am, 3 min
             from touchdown while Discoverey was being flown around the final
             Heading Alignment Circle (HAC) at 38,000ft and dropping below
             500mph. At 2 minutes to touchdown, Discovery was southeast of
             the SLF, traveling 230mph setting up on final approach to Runway
             33. At 1 minute 20 seconds to touchdown, Discovery was at
             13,000ft. At 300ft, Pilot Kent Rominger dropped the landing gear
             and Commander Brown pitched the nose up. Touchdown occured at
             8/19/97 at 7:07a.m. EDT.

             Discovery's mission was scheduled to end Monday August 18, 1997
             with landing scheduled at the Kennedy Space Center.in Florida at
             about 6:14 a.m. central time but the landing attempt for was
             waived off due to low fog in the area of the Shuttle Landing
             Facility. Forecasters had predicted favorable weather for
             landing and . Flight controllers only targeted a single Florida
             landing opportunity on Monday and did not consider opportunities
             for landing at Edwards Air Force Base, CA.
