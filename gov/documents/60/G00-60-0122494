   Hydrographic survey data collected by the National Ocean Service (NOS)
   contain measurements of water depths in the coastal waters of the U.S.
   In order for these depths to be used in the making of the nautical
   charts, the measured depth value must be corrected to determine depth
   relative to Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), which is the datum for NOS
   charts. The departure of the instantaneous water level from MLLW is
   called Schematic of important depths and elevations the tide correction
   and is due to variations in the phase of the astronomic tide, the
   difference between the long-term Mean Sea Level (MSL) and MLLW, and to
   other, non-tidal effects caused primarily by winds and river flows.
   The schematic to the right shows the elevations and depths that are
   important in hydrographic surveying. The instantaneous Sea Surface
   differs from the MSL by the sum of the astronomic tide (A) and the
   residual or non-tidal water level (R). The MSL lies above the MLLW by
   the spatially-varying offset (O). S is the raw depth measurement, or
   sounding, and the tide correction is C. The depth displayed on a NOS
   chart is D. Recently, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been used
   to make hydrographic surveying more accurate. Elevations measured using
   GPS are commonly referenced to one of several possible ellipsoids. The
   ellipsoidally-referenced sea surface is E, and the
   ellipsoidally-referenced MSL is M.
   Today, discrete tide zoning is the method NOS uses to obtain the tide
   correction. For any location (x, y) and time (t) in a tide zone (k),
   the tide correction (C) is estimated by shifting the water level
   measured at one tide station (L[n]) by a time increment unique to that
   zone (T[k]) and multiplying the result by a factor unique to that zone
   (f[k]). In equation form, this is:

                  C(x,y,t)=f[sub'k']L[sub'n'](t-T[sub'k'])

   NOS oceanographers create the polygon-shaped tide zones and determine
   f[k] and T[k] values for each one from the analysis of historical tide
   data (preliminary set of tide zones for San Francisco Bay).

   However, discrete tide zoning has several known inaccuracies. Tide
   zoning rests on the simplifying assumption that the water level in each
   zone has a fixed relationship to the measured water level at a single,
   nearby gauge. In reality, the shape of the measured water level curve
   varies throughout coastal waters in a complex way. Also, zoning
   produces a discontinuity in the tide correction when a ship crosses
   from one zone to the next. Therefore, a new method of estimating tide
   corrections is being developed. This method does not depend on discrete
   tide zones, but instead generates a unique value of the correction for
   the exact time and location of the sounding; it can be thought of as
   continuous tide zoning. The new method separates the astronomic tide
   and the residual (or non-tidal) component and treats them differently.
   First, the method spatially interpolates each tidal constituent's
   amplitude and phase throughout the region and makes a tidal prediction.
   This predicted tide is then added to the residual component and the
   offset, which are computed by spatially interpolating the values at the
   shore. The new method is called Tidal Constituent And Residual
   Interpolation (TCARI).

   The theory behind TCARI is as follows. In general, the tide correction
   (C) at any point in the hydrographic survey area can be expressed as
   the sum of the astronomic tide (A), the residual (or non-tidal) water
   level (R), and the offset of MSL from MLLW (O), or:

                                   C=A+R+O

   At a water level gauge, the value of each of the three components can
   be determined from measurements; A and O can be obtained by the
   analysis of historical water level data, and R must be determined from
   the observations at the time of the hydrographic survey. However, at
   any point located some distance away from any of the gauges, the value
   of each component is usually not known. Using TCARI, an estimate can be
   made by spatial interpolation. That is, by summing the weighted value
   of the component at each of the nearby water level gauges. For example,
   the residual water level is determined by summing the weighted value of
   the residual (R[n]) at each gauge:

      R(x,y)=Sigma[sup'N sub'r'' sub'n=1']W[sup'r'sub'n'](x,y)R[sub'n']

   Here W^r is the weighting function and N[r] is the number of stations
   where the residual water level is measured. Therefore, a set of
   weighting functions is needed, one weighting function for each water
   level station. And because there is often a different group of water
   level stations supplying data for each component of C, a different set
   of weighting functions is needed for each component. Therefore, a
   preliminary expression for C is:

                        C(x,y,t)=Sigma[sup'N sub'a''
         sub'n=1']W[sup'a'sub'n'](x,y)A[sub'n']+Sigma[sup'N sub'r''
         sub'n=1']W[sup'r'sub'n'](x,y)R[sub'n']+Sigma[sup'N sub'o''
                   sub'n=1']W[sup'o'sub'n'](x,y)O[sub'n']

   A further refinement is to interpolate not the total astronomical tide,
   but the harmonic constants of each tidal constituent. Given an
   amplitude (a) and phase or epoch (f), the total astronomic tide can be
   expressed as:

                          A[sub'n']=Sigma[sup'Imax'
           sub'i=1']alpha[sub'ni']cos(omega[sub'i']t-phi[sub'ni']

   where i denotes the number of the tidal constituent, Imax is the total
   number of constituents, and w the angular speed of the constituent (in
   degrees per hour). Therefore, the final resulting equation is:

           C(x,y,t)=Sigma[sup'Imax' sub'i=1']([Sigma[sup'N sub'a''
   sub'n=1']W[sup'a'sub'n'](x,y)alpha[sub'ni']]cos{omega[sub'i']t-[Sigma[s
    up'N sub'a'' sub'n=1']W[sup'a'sub'n'](x,y)phi[sub'ni']]})+Sigma[sup'N
     sub'r'' sub'n=1']W[sup'r'sub'n'](x,y)R[sub'n']+Sigma[sup'N sub'o''
                   sub'n=1']W[sup'o'sub'n'](x,y)O[sub'n']

   The above equation for the tide correction can be applied to any
   location within the hydrographic survey region, provided there are
   adequate historical measurements of the water levels to determine the
   harmonic constants (a, f) and the offsets (O), and contemporary
   measurements to determine the residual (R) during the time of the
   survey.

   The TCARI method is applied by creating a grid for the coastal region
   of interest and then generating the weighting functions for each set of
   components. As an example, a plot of the instantaneous astronomic tide
   in Galveston Bay, as determined by summing the spatially-interpolated
   harmonic constants, is shown in the figure to the right. The grid
   consists of squares, one-third of a nautical mile on a side. The
   astronomic tide is shown relative to MSL.

   The TCARI method was tested for accuracy using post-processed kinematic
   GPS measurements of water levels collected by NOS in San Francisco Bay,
   California, and Galveston Bay, Texas. In each estuary, the water levels
   were measured by a small craft on several traverses of a fixed course
   and then referenced to the ellipsoid. The measurements themselves had
   root mean square (RMS) errors estimated to be 7 cm for San Francisco
   Bay and 9 cm for Galveston Bay. The results indicate that TCARI was
   more accurate tide zoning; RMS errors were lower than zoning by 1 cm in
   San Francisco Bay and 2 cm in Galveston Bay. However, both methods had
   RMS errors approximately equal to those of the measurements.

   The weighting functions are computed as follows. Each function is
   assumed to obey the two-dimensional Laplace's Equation:

                     LaPlace operator times W[sub'n']=0

   with 'internal boundary conditions' at the water level gauges set by:

                          W[sub'j']=delta[sub'jn']

   That is, W = 1 at gauge 'n' and W = 0 at all other gauges. There will
   be one function W(x, y) for each gauge used for each component. At land
   boundaries, the slope of W in the normal direction is proportional to
   the slope of W in the adjacent region.

   There are other applications for TCARI. One is to estimate the
   ellipsoidally-referenced sea level (E) by substituting an
   ellipsoidally-referenced Mean Sea Level (M) for the offset O in the
   final equation for C. This sea level can be used for comparisons with
   Real-Time Kinematic GPS measurements of the sea surface. A second
   application is to use the weighting functions to generate spatial
   distributions of the differences between tidal datums (for example, the
   Mean High Water minus Mean Low Water, which equals the mean tide
   range). Such spatially-varying tidal datum planes are useful in
   re-referencing NOS chart depths to other datums such as the North
   American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
