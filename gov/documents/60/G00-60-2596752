      The options provided on this page will assist you in getting
      information about fire activity within the State. Fires occur
      throughout the State within CDF jurisdiction on a daily basis during
      fire season. However, the majority of these fires are contained early
      in the firefight and information concerning these fires will not be
      posted on this website. If you would like to obtain information on CDF
      fire activity in your area, please contact the CDF Unit that falls
      within your county as listed in CDF Contacts.

      The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) will
      work to provide information at this site on those major incidents that
      involve large acreages or threaten structures. The CDF Current Major
      Incidents pages will provide general information such as fire location,
      acres burned, number of personnel on the fire line, number of
      structures threatened, etc.) For information you do not find on this
      website concerning these major incidents, refer to our Fire Information
      Phone Numbers page and use the contact numbers listed there.

      The CDF 2001 Fire Statistics page is updated weekly during fire season
      and provides the total number of fires responded to by CDF, acres
      burned, a five-year average, and a comparison with last fire season.
      See 2001 Fire Season Ends.

      Links to other agencies with wildland fire fighting jurisdiction in
      California are provided on the Fire Information (Other Agencies) page.
      You may also check the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) website.
      NIFC gathers daily information on all major fire activity in the United
      States.
