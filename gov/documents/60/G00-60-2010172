   describes and analyzes the trends, key issues, and events in
   telecommunications, Internet and e-commerce adoption in Latin America,
   highlighting Argentina and Brazil, to create a framework from which
   U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can make educated

   The work was actively supported by the International Trade

   interviews is supplemented with data from market research firms and an
   extensive review of available literature. This effort was carried out
   as part of the U.S. Department of Commerce Market Development
   Cooperator Program (MDCP), under grants awarded to the Virginia
   Economic Development Partnership (VEDP), the New Jersey Institute of

   competitive matching grants program that builds public/private
   partnerships by providing federal assistance to nonprofit export
   multipliers such as states, trade associations, and chambers of
   commerce that are particularly effective in reaching SMEs. These awards
   help the start-up costs of export marketing ventures, with the
   Department of Commerce playing an enabling role. These MDCP awards

   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Although the Latin American market for
   telecommunications and IT products and services, including Internet and
   electronic commerce (e-commerce) technologies, is less developed than
   some other regions, it is growing rapidly. Despite some challenges, the
   opportunities for U.S. firms are broad and varied. Argentina and Brazil
   offer U.S.-based telecommunications and IT small- and medium- sized
   enterprises (SMEs) excellent market opportunities. After experiencing a
   financial crisis and economic recession late in 1998 and throughout
   much of 1999, the Latin American economies have begun to recover.
   Positive economic growth is projected for 2000. Latin American firms
   and governments are increasing their IT investments, and consumers are
   beginning to have greater disposable income to spend on more advanced
   telecommunications technologies, Internet access, and e-commerce.
   Increased competition in telecommunications services in many countries
   is driving investment in leading-edge telecommunications technologies,
   lowering telecommunications costs for consumers, and facilitating more
   Internet and e-commerce use. This is largely due to recent or pending
   privatization and liberalization of telecommunications services
   markets. Investment in telecommunications infrastructure and related
   software has exploded. The wireless telecommunications segment is
   growing strongly, as countries look to more advanced wireless
   technologies to increase teledensity rapidly. There is growing
   recognition in Latin America of the importance of IT, particularly the
   Internet and e-commerce, to improve productivity and international
   competitiveness. Governments in some countries, including Argentina and
   Brazil, are developing or implementing programs to help firms, schools,
   government agencies, and other organizations increase their IT
   investments. Many firms are eager to learn about the benefits that
   e-commerce can bring them and to purchase the technologies and services
   necessary for an on-line presence. Relatively common use of the
   Internet in Latin America began only about one year ago and remains
   extremely low compared to the United States. Nonetheless, Latin America
   is the fastest growing Internet market in the world. Brazil has been
   the region's Internet "early adopter", although other Latin American
   countries, including Argentina, are catching up quickly. However,
   faster Internet adoption in the region is hindered by various factors,
   including low teledensity rates, lack of broadband technologies, high
   PC prices, and local telephone charges. Many industry participants and
   observers eagerly anticipate the wide rollout of Wireless Application
   Protocol (WAP)-enabled handheld devices, and believe this technology
   will become a popular means of Internet access there. Brazil, Mexico,
   and Argentina could provide the greatest opportunities for e-commerce
   in Latin America, given their relatively large markets. Despite recent
   media hype, business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce is most markedly
   occurring only in Brazil. Hindrances to widespread B2C use are
   countries' low Internet penetration rates, cultural factors that keep
   people from purchasing on- 2 Office of Computers and Business
   Equipment/ Office of Telecommunications, USDOC, June 2000 line,
   underdeveloped delivery systems, low credit card use, and low
   disposable income. B2C will continue to grow, but will take longer to
   gain a foothold than in the United States. Change will occur more
   rapidly in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, for which the region
   is better suited. In fact, although B2B e-commerce is still in its
   infancy in Latin America, its uptake is rapid. Internet start-ups are
   emerging in Latin America, particularly in Argentina and Brazil.
   However, Latin American Internet start-ups are hindered by a lack of
   access to funding, to technologies necessary to execute ideas, and to
   trained and knowledgeable workers versed in the new Internet
   technologies. As a result, many Latin American Internet start-ups seek
   U.S. partners. Greater competition in Argentina's and Brazil's
   telecommunications sectors and demand for new related technologies
   means huge market opportunities in these telecommunications equipment
   and services markets. Wireless technologies are particularly popular,
   especially those which support high-speed interactive data services in
   addition to voice. There is a large and growing market for U.S.
   Internet and electronic commerce technologies and services in both
   countries as well. Low PC penetration and teledensity rates, however,
   indicate that Internet access via other means will likely be common,
   implying a demand for mobile data services, cable television, wireless
   local loop (WLL), local multipoint distribution services (LMDS),
   multichannel multipoint distribution services (MMDS), and other
   Internet access technologies. As more and more organizations implement
   Internet and e-commerce strategies, there is a need for web site
   designers, and also for systems integrators to install, program, and
   connect servers to legacy infrastructures and to integrate web sites
   and back offices. Despite the opportunities, the Latin American market
   poses many challenges to U.S. firms. The region has low average annual
   wages, an unequal distribution of income, and an uneven IT
   infrastructure. As economies just begin to recover from the financial
   crisis and economic recession, organizations as well as consumers have
   tight budgets to spend on new technologies. Market intricacies and
   differences in Internet and e-commerce adoption trends mean that some
   U.S. technologies may not succeed or might need to be modified
   accordingly. Less expensive or less cutting-edge technologies may also
   be appropriate. Market entry strategies must also be adapted to the
   local markets and may differ depending on which country is first
   targeted, due to business and cultural differences. Industry experts
   interviewed in Argentina and Brazil stress that for smaller U.S. firms
   who want to do business in these countries, some form of local
   representation is essential. Options include setting up a local office;
   partnering with a large, established IT or telecommunications firm,
   systems integrator, or consultant already active locally; partnering
   with a like-minded Latin American IT SME with complementary skills and
   technologies; or using agents or distributors. Regardless of market
   entry strategy, a variety of organizations, both public and private,
   are eager to help U.S. IT and telecommunications SMEs find partners or
   representatives in Latin America. 3 Office of Computers and Business

   U.S. IT firms in Latin America is the lack of sufficient protection for
   intellectual property rights (IPR). Although many countries may have
   strong IPR laws on the books, enforcement can be spotty or inadequate.
   Despite these challenges, demand for U.S. telecommunications and IT
   technologies in the Latin American markets over the next several years
   should continue to be quite strong and the market opportunities broad
   and varied for U.S. firms. 8Nonetheless, there is one positive benefit
   of MERCOSUR for U.S. exporters; in some cases, countries' tariffs will
   be lower under the CET than pre-MERCOSUR. For example, Brazil generally
   has had to lower its tariffs to reach the CET. 7 Office of Computers
