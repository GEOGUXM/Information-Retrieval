                               Armey's Axioms
       _______________________________________________________________

             The market is rational and the government is dumb.

     There is more wisdom in millions of individuals making decisions in
     their own self-interest than there is in even the most enlightened
     bureaucrat (or congressman!) making decisions on their behalf.

     The politics of greed always comes wrapped in the language of love.

     While liberals have been extraordinarily successful at convincing
     the public of their higher motives, these higher motives are usually
     used to conceal their own greed -- for political power, social
     prestige, or just plain money.

         There is nothing more arrogant than a self-righteous income
                               redistributor.

     The arrogance of liberals as they pursue their supposed higher
     goods, particularly when they imagine themselves working for the
     poor and the downtrodden, clouds their clear-thinking and often
     makes them immune to common sense.

    To diagnose our problems, we must understand the full anatomy of the
      political economy -- especially the invisible foot of government.

     While the concept of the invisible hand of the marketplace is
     well-understood (if too often ignored), we also need to recognize
     and accept the visible foot of the market, which plays a necessary
     role in eliminating inefficient industries. Even more important, we
     must understand that there is an invisible foot of the government
     too, which generally does unnecessary damage even as the visible
     hand of the government seems to do good.

     No one spends someone else's money as wisely as he spends his own.

     A key reason the market system works: When people spend their own
     money, they care much more deeply about its efficient and productive
     use than any politicians who seeks to tax it away and spend it
     themselves.

    Never believe it when someone says, "I'm from the government and I'm
      here to help. (A corollary is: Never trust anyone from Austin or
                                  Boston.)

     Free people do not give up their freedom easily, and governments
     know that. That's why governments have become so skillful in using
     pretensions of altruism when they try to take a measure of our
     freedom away from us. We must always be on guard. (A corollary is,
     "A gentleman protects a lady from everyone but himself.")

   You can't put your finger on a problem when you've got it to the wind.

     Risk-evasive "yes men," forever seeking consensus, will achieve
     nothing but their own mediocrity. Anyone worth his salt must consult
     current opinion, but obey only his convictions.

   You don't have to belong to one of the six talking professions to cause
                           mischief, but it helps.

     There is indeed a "New Class" of opinion leaders distinguished by
     their ability to manipulate words. They can be grouped into the six
     talking professions -- politicians, educators, journalists, lawyers
     (!), theologians, and entertainers. All have their place, but they
     also happen to be: Sheltered from the real world, rarely exposed to
     the consequences of their ideas, and intent on concerning themselves
     with other people's business. Thus, they're in a position to cause
     great mischief -- and do.

               Compassion without understanding can be cruel.

     Those who seek to use their power and influence for high social
     goods can inadvertently cause great harm if they do not understand
     how the world works. A parent who spoils a child, a social engineer
     who ruins an inner city, a politician who protects an outmoded
     industry -- all prove the point.

    A bad idea can only survive if it need not stand the test of reality.

     One of the many good things abut the market economy is that it
     drives out bad ideas in the form of products and services people
     refuse to buy. By contrast, such institutions as the education
     establishment and the government do not subject bad ideas to any
     reality test. Naturally, they become veritable fountains of them.

     According to the Armey Curve, governments can eventually become so
   large that they imperil the very ends they were created to secure. Ours
                      has long since passed that point.

     Admittedly, the government is necessary -- but only to a point. We
     can plot the size and effectiveness of the government on a graph.
     First, there is an upward slope, as government is not large enough
     to secure our liberties. But then there is a peak followed by a
     plunge, in which the government becomes so large that it actually
     endangers the liberties it was instituted to protect. We're on that
     downhill slope now.

               If you love peace more than freedom, you lose.

     Without actually saying so, the government seeks to expropriate our
     freedom in return for greater security -- from the hazards of the
     marketplace, the perplexity of making our own decisions, even the
     tribulations of life itself. It's a Faustian bargain. If you take
     it, you lose.

   Liberals don't see anything good happen unless the government does it.

     The free market system is the greatest anti-poverty machine that man
     has ever developed, but you'd never know it by listening to the
     liberals. If the government doesn't accomplish something itself, as
     far as they're concerned, it doesn't happen.
