   Hubble Space Telescope Acronyms List pdf

   ACS — Advanced Camera for Surveys
   This will consist of three electronic cameras and a complement of
   filters and dispersers that detect light from the ultraviolet at 1200
   angstroms to the near infrared at 10,000 angstroms, with 10 times the
   efficiency of current instruments; to be installed during SM3B in 2002.

   This kit will fix door latches in the aft shroud area of the telescope
   that have been damaged by extreme temperature changes and high torques.

   BAPS — Berthing and Positioning System
   This is the unit that holds and maneuvers HST while it is berthed to
   the orbiter. The BAPS can orient the telescope at a variety of angles
   and can rotate the HST a full 360 degrees to bring any part of HST
   within the reach of the astronauts and the RMS, or robot arm.

   BPS — BAPS Support Post
   This post is installed to keep the BAPS immobile during activities
   which generate high torques on the HST, for example reboost.

   C-5

   Fourth Generation Spectrometer. COS is an ultraviolet spectrograph
   optimized for observing faint point sources with moderate spectral
   resolution.

   COSTAR — Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial
   Second Generation Corrective Optics. COSTAR is not an actual
   instrument. It consists of mirrors which refocus the abberated light
   from the HST optical system for first generation instruments. Only FOC
   utilizes its services today.

   DF-224
   Onboard Digital Fixed Point 2's complement 24-bit word Rockwell
   computer module. This was originally the main computer which controls
   the attitude (orientation) of the Hubble Space Telescope. It has since
   been repaced by a new computer based on the Intel 80486 microchip.

   ESA — European Space Agency

   EVA — Extravehicular activity
   outside the spacecraft; activity in space conducted by suited
   astronauts. This is also known as a spacewalk.

   FGS — Fine Guidance Sensor
   Science/Guidance instruments. The FGS's are used in a "dual-purpose"
   mode serving to lock on to "guide stars" which help the telescope
   obtain the exceedingly accurate pointing necessary for observation of
   astronomical targets. These instruments can also be used to obtain
   highly accurate measurements of stellar positions.

   FOC — Faint Object Camera
   First Generation Imaging camera. FOC is used to image very small field
   of view, very faint targets. Last first generation instrument on HST.

   FOS — Faint Object Spectrograph
   First Generation Spectrometer. FOS was used to obtain spectra of very
   faint or far away sources. FOS also had a polarimeter for the study of
   the polarized light from these sources.

   FSS — Flight Support System (Structure)
   This is the name for the structure which holds HST and provides power
   and computer interfaces while it is berthed to an Orbiter during
   servicing.

   GHRS — Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph
   First Generation Spectrograph. GHRS was used to obtain high resolution
   spectra of bright targets.

   GSFC — Goddard Space Flight Center
   Greenbelt, Maryland. The HST Project is run from here.

   HOST mission — Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test (1998)
   This mission tested several pieces of equipment in preparation for SM3A
   and SM3B.

   HST — Hubble Space Telescope

   KSC — Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, FL
   KSC is responsible for launches.

   MLI — Multi-layer insulation
   This is the highly reflective material which is attached to spacecraft
   to act as a thermal barrier. It consists of many sheets of 25 µm thick
   polyester or polyamide layers sewn together. It is often silver or gold
   in color.

   NASA — National Aeronautics and Space Administration

   NCS — NICMOS Cooling System
   This mechanical cooler was tested during the HOST mission and will be
   installed during SM3B will allow NICMOS to resume science operations.

   NICMOS — Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer
   Second Generation Imager/Spectrograph. NICMOS is HST's only NIR
   instrument.

   NIR — Near Infrared
   Near Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but many celestial
   objects shine brightly with this light. Typically associated with heat,
   NIR images show the presence of molecules and complex compounds.

   NOBL — New Outer Blanket Layer
   The NOBL are stainless steel panels covered with a protective thermal
   coating. These panels fit over existing, degraded insulation on
   Hubble's exterior surface, to control Hubble's internal temperature. In
   1997, astronauts on Servicing Mission 2 discovered damaged areas of
   insulation and performed temporary repairs. The NOBL will be
   permanently mounted.

   OCE-EK — Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit

   ORU/ORI — Orbital Replacement Unit / Orbital Replacement Instrument
   Since HST was designed to be serviced on-orbit, many of the systems,
   and all of the instruments were designed and built as replaceable
   units.

   ORUC — Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier
   Special boxes which isolate the delicate instruments and other ORUs
   from the forces and vibrations of launch and ascent to orbit.

   RSU — Rate Sensor Unit
   Hubble houses three RSU's and each RSU contains two gyroscopes. The
   gyroscopes are part of Hubble's pointing system. The gyroscopes work by
   comparing Hubble's motion relative to the axis of the spinning masses
   inside the gyroscopes. In the absence of external forces, these axes
   remain stable relative to the fixed stars in the sky. By keeping Hubble
   fixed relative to these axes, Hubble stays stable relative to the
   stars.

   SM1 — HST Servicing Mission 1, (December 1993)

   SM2 — HST Servicing Mission 2, (February 1997)

   SM3A — HST Servicing Mission 3A, (December 1999)

   SM3B — HST Servicing Mission 3B, (planned for February 2001)

   SSAT — S-band Single-Access Transmitter
   This replacement transmitter uses radio waves to send data to the
   ground. The older unit it replaces will be returned to Earth and
   refurbished for a later flight.

   SSDIF — Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility
   This building is located at GSFC. The SSDIF is a 7,989 m^2 (86,000
   ft^2) facility designed to provide support for the integration and
   testing of spacecraft hardware. It is unique in the fact that it
   contains a 36,816m^3 (1.3M ft^3) horizontal, unidirectional flow
   cleanroom. Additional features include: Automated Data Processing Area,
   Shipping/Receiving Area, Flight Hardware Storage Area, and Precision
   Cleaning facilities.

   SSR — Solid State Recorder
   Hubble's original data recorders were mechanical, reel-to-reel tape
   recorders with many moving parts that wear out over time. The digital
   SSR has no moving parts or tape to break, so it is much more robust.
   This next-generation recorder is faster and more reliable, and it can
   store 10 times as much data as a mechanical recorder.

   SSRF — Shell/Shield Repair Fabric
   Sheets of flexible, aluminized Teflon® fabric that fit over the
   original multi-layer insulation on Hubble's forward shell and light
   shield to add thermal protection. In 1997, astronauts on Servicing
   Mission 2 discovered damaged areas of insulation and performed
   temporary repairs. The SSRF will be permanently mounted over these
   temporary coverings.

   STIS — Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
   Second Generation Imager/Spectrograph. STIS is used to obtain high
   resolution spectra of resolved objects. The special ability of STIS is
   to simultaneously obtain spectra from many different points along the
   target.

   STOCC — Space Telescope Operations Control Center
   Located at Goddard Space Flight Center, the STOCC is where all
   commanding to the HST originates from.

   STS — Space Transportation System
   This is the formal name of the Space Shuttle Program.

   STScI — Space Telescope Science Institute
   This institute, located at Johns Hopkins University, is the home of the
   HST Scientists. The STScI is responsible for allocating observing time
   and for calibration, data storage, retrieval, and distribution of
   science data. STScI also provides software tools for manipulating the
   data.
