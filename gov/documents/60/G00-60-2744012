   Respondents - SDO-2-02 - Final Order to Cease and Desist.

   The Securities Division entered into a Final Order to Cease and Desist
   against Respondents Mr. Plant and Lawrence R. McCarthy.  The Division
   alleges that in connection with their offer of a franchise to a
   Washington resident via their website, http://www.mrplant.com/,
   Respondents violated the Franchise Act.  Respondents failed to request
   a hearing in the matter, and therefore the Final Order adopts the
   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of law set forth in the Summary
   Order.  Respondents were ordered to cease and desist from violations of
   the registration and anti-fraud sections of the Franchise Act.

   Financial Institutions, issued an ENTRY OF FINDINGS OF FACT AND
   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND FINAL ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST against two
   Florida companies and two Nevada limited liability companies (LLCs) for
   violations of the State securities registration and fraud laws. The
   Department originally issued a statement of charges against the
   Respondents and former insurance agent Richard Foster in January 1999.
   In the statement of charges, the Department alleged that the companies
   had sold investments in LLCs that would be purchasing viatical
   settlement to at least two Washington residents. Viatical settlements
   are contracts in which a terminally ill person sells the expected death
   benefits from an insurance policy in exchange for cash that can be used
   during the insured's lifetime. The Respondents were charged with
   offering and selling the investments without registering the offer with
   the State Securities Division and for failing to disclose all of the
   material facts of the investment. Viatical Funding, Inc.'s sales agent
   Richard Foster did not request a hearing and a Final Order was issued
   by the Securities Division against him in May 1999. The Office of
   Administrative Hearings conducted the hearing requested by the
   Respondents. In the Department's Final Order, Bley ordered the
   Respondents to cease and desist from violations of the state's
   registration and fraud laws.

   On April 30, 2001, the Securities Division issued a Summary Cease and
   Desist Order against the owners of a Florida-based recycling company
   that allegedly used telemarketing to offer and sell its unregistered

   On October 17, the Securities Division issued three related cease and
   desist orders against Florida telemarketing firms that had been preying

   units in limited liability companies offering check cashing services,
   and investment contracts in account receivables (the customer checks
   cashed at those check cashing stores).  In addition to operating its
   own boiler rooms, Republic hired at least two independent sales offices
   (ISOs) to market their securities.  Salespeople from Corporate Asset
   Group were offering and selling the membership units, while Ould
   Investment Group offered the account receivable contracts.  The sales
   pitch failed to mention that Republic and its president, Billups, had
   been subject to cease and desist orders from other states, and that the
   check cashing industry faces significant risks.  The Order against
   Republic seeks injunctive relief, restitution to injured investors, and
   a $50,000 fine.  The Orders against Corporate Asset Group and Ould
   Investment Group seek injunctive relief and fines of $10,000.
