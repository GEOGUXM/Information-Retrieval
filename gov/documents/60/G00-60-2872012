     Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was founded in September 1952 as
     a second nuclear weapons design laboratory to promote innovation in the
     design of our nation's nuclear stockpile through creative science and
     engineering. During the next five decades, Livermore was also to become
     one of the world's premier scientific centers, where cutting-edge
     science and engineering in the interest of national security is used to
     break new ground in other areas of national importance, including
     energy, biomedicine, and environmental science.

     This Web site describes the accomplishments of the Laboratory and its
     key people over it's 50-year history and presents information about the
     events the Laboratory is hosting to celebrate it's anniversary.
