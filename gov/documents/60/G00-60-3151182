                               Come Visit Us!

   Ready to leave cyberspace? Then come visit us! The area around the St.
   Lawrence-FDR project is unofficially known as the United States' Fourth
   Coast for its miles of waterfront.

   The St. Lawrence Seaway, with its Eisenhower and Snell locks, is right
   next door to us. The Thousand Islands and the cities of Montreal,
   Quebec, and Ottawa, Ontario, are just a short drive away.

   Your first stop on any trip to the North Country should be the St.
   Lawrence-FDR project's Visitors Center. Admission is free and the
   center recently underwent a $1.5 million renovation and includes an
   array of new, interactive exhibits. For education and group tours
   arranged by reservation, contact: Bill Siddon (315) 764-0226, x304 or
   e-mail siddon.b@nypa.gov . Please note:  The Visitors Center is
   currently closed.  We expect to reopen in the Sping.

   Interested in electricity?
   We have hands-on displays and computer games that make you part of the
   action. Get a behind-the-scenes look at the power project's control
   room, or watch a film that explains the construction and operation of
   one of North America's largest power producers.

   Fascinated by history?
   The St. Lawrence River Valley has a rich heritage that is detailed in
   some of our displays. A hand-carved wooden relief map traces the paths
   of French explorer Jacques Cartier's St. Lawrence voyages of 1534 and
   1535. Nearby are two murals painted by American artist Thomas Hart
   Benton, which depict incidents reported by Cartier in his journals.

   Excited about the environment?
   You will be once you step onto our observation deck, 116 feet above the
   St. Lawrence River. Set your sights on the Adirondack Mountains, 30
   miles to the south, or wave hello to our friends in Canada, just across
   the river. Everywhere you look, you'll see nature at its finest, any
   season of the year.
