Background

   This page includes background information on the Ocean Exploration
   Directive and position papers for the 2002 Ocean Exploration
   Initiative.
     __________________________________________________________________

          Welcome Speech (12 kb, PDF) from the Secretary of Commerce, Norm
          Mineta, to the Ocean Exploration Panel.

          Memo to the Panel (32 kb, PDF) Ocean Exploration Panel Chair,
          Marcia McNutt of MBARI, has written a memo to all panel members
          regarding the Directive from President William Jefferson
          Clinton.

          Ocean Exploration Directive (8 kb, PDF) The Clinton
          Administration has announced steps to immediately develop a
          long-term exporation strategy to represent the start of a new
          era of ocean exploration. This Ocean Exploration directive has
          requested a panel convene, comprised of leading ocean explorers,
          educators, and scientists who will provide recommendations for a
          national oceans exploration strategy.

          The Oceans Act of 1999 (32 kb, PDF) The Oceans Act of 1999 is a
          bill to establish a National Ocean Council, a Commission on
          Ocean Policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on
          Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

          The Oceans Act of 2000 (32 kb, PDF) The purpose of this act is
          to establish a commission to make recommendations for a
          coordinated and comprehensive national ocean policy.

          Greenwood Bill (8 kb, PDF) A bill to direct the Secretary of
          Commerce to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to
          establish the Coordinated Oceanographic Program Advisory Panel
          to report to the Congress on the feasibility and social value of
          a coordinated oceanography program.

    2002 Ocean Exploration Initiative Position Papers

          2002 Ocean Exploration and Research Initiative (96 kb, PDF)
          Summary descriptions of all 2002 ocean exploration initiatives.

          Water Masses and Ocean Fronts (16 kb, PDF) This document focuses
          on the exploration and study of ocean frontier areas, including
          water masses (e.g., upwellings, eddies, convergences), ocean
          fronts (e.g., Gulf Stream wall) and boundary layers, and the
          living resources associated with them.

          Submarine Volcanoes (8 kb, PDF)This document focuses on the
          exploration, mapping, and study of ocean frontier areas, such as
          submarine volcanoes.

          Deep Ocean Trenches (8 kb, PDF) This document focuses on the
          exploration, mapping, and study of ocean frontier areas, such as
          deep ocean trenches.

          Hydrocarbon Seeps and Hydrate Beds (8 kb, PDF) This document
          focuses on exploration and study of the earth's molten interior
          which, lets out streams of magna, chemicals or boiling water. In
          many more places on the ocean floor, cold seeps ooze, bubble and
          vent a variety of materials such as methane gas, ice crystals
          imbued with natural gas, and crude oil.

          Seamounts (8 kb, PDF) There is still the general impression that
          most of the deep sea is featureless and barren. Among the most
          impressive exceptions to this notion are seamounts, large
          submarine mountains rising to more than 1,000 m above the
          surrounding deep-sea floor.

          Polar Environments (16 kb, PDF) The goal is to gain better
          definition of the abiotic and biotic resources of the polar seas
          and of the controlling physical and biogeochemical processes
          affecting those resources.

          Submerged Heritage Resources (24 kb, PDF) The maritime
          historical record of the United States is largely underwater and
          awaiting discovery and documentation. As undersea exploration
          technology has developed, a recovery range has similarly evolved
          to the point where virtually anything sunk or lost at sea can
          now be found and explored, regardless of depth.

          Deep Coral Communities, Reefs and Live Bottom (20 kb, PDF) This
          document focuses on the exploration and study of ocean frontier
          areas, including deep coral communities, reefs and benthic live
          bottom areas.

          Ocean Data (12 kb, PDF) NESDIS proposes to capture and integrate
          multiple, large data streams from the ocean floor into NOAA's
          data systems and archives to facilitate access to and re-use of
          the data for ocean research and exploration.

          Submarine Canyons (8 kb, PDF) This document focuses on the
          exploration, mapping, and study of ocean frontier areas, such as
          submarine canyons.

          Marine Biotechnology (12 kb, PDF) The biotechnology revolution
          has impacted diverse fields of science and many sectors of the
          economy. In the environmental arena, application of molecular
          technologies has brought new ways to identify and mitigate
          ecological stresses and may hold the keys to remediation.

          Sound in the Sea (12 kb, PDF) The major objectives of this
          program are to 1) create a global network for monitoring marine
          sound of natural and human origin, and 2) determine the effects
          of this noise on marine mammals and turtles.

          2002 Ocean Exploration Work Plan (8 kb, PDF) This work plan
          describes the strategy and program/tasks of the 2002 Ocean
          Exploration Initiative.

          Ocean Exploration Educational Program Plan (8 kb, PDF) This
          document provides the objectives of the Ocean Exploration
          Initiative educational programs.
