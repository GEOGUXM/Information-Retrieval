   NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP ON SAC

   Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council News
   NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP ON THE SANCTUARY ADVISORY
   COUNCIL

   Thank you for your interest in serving as a representative on the
   Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council. Please find an
   application form, the Advisory Council Charter, and general information
   about the Sanctuary. We are currently recruiting primary and
   alternative representatives for the following four seats, of which one
   is currently vacant and three will expire in April of 2002:
   Conservation, Education, Diving, and Tourism.

   The Sanctuary Advisory Council was established by the Secretary of
   Commerce to:
     * help strengthen and provide support for the growth of the
       Sanctuary;
     * assist in the protection of Sanctuary resources by helping identify
       needed research to rebuild or protect Sanctuary resources; and
     * assist in building community support through problem solving,
       consensus building, new constituency development, increasing
       opportunities for revenue enhancement; and increasing understanding
       about the Sanctuary.

   Since its establishment in March 1994, the Council has played a vital
   role in the decisions affecting the Sanctuary along the central
   California Coast.

   The Councils twenty voting members represent a variety of local user
   groups, the general public, and eight state and federal governmental
   jurisdictions. In addition, the respective managers for the California
   National Marine Sanctuaries (Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary,
   Cordell Bank/Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, and the
   Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary) and the Elkhorn Slough National
   Estuarine Research Reserve sit as non-voting members. Members are
   appointed competitively by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration and serve three-year terms. The terms for the seats will
   expire on February 1, 2005.

   SAC representatives are expected to attend full Council meetings held
   every other month in full-day open sessions located at various
   locations along the Sanctuarys 300-mile shoreline. SAC members are
   also required to attend a one-day retreat to help set annual
   priorities. Individual members may also participate in working groups,
   subcommittees, or special taskforces. The SAC has identified the
   following issue as the main priority for the next two years:
     * Management plan review process for the Sanctuary.

   Prior to applying for membership, please review the following:
    1. Advisory Council Membership Expectations
    2. Description and Requirements for Open Seats
    3. Advisory Council Charter

   To apply, please print and fully complete (including all nine
   questions) an application form. Click here to access and print the SAC

   2002 to:
