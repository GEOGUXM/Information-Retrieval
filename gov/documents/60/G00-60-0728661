   Welcome to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Image Library. This
   Library was created to help the science, engineering, and education
   communities as well as the general public, obtain quality images for
   use in print and electronic media. The images in the library represent
   some of the areas of science the Foundation supports. Whenever
   possible, we have tried to include images of actual NSF-supported
   research.
   Many of the images in the collection do not belong to NSF and some have
   restrictions regarding their use. To learn more about these
   restrictions and about NSF guidelines for use of images in the library,
   you are urged to read the section Conditions.
   For general information about the content of the library or how to
   obtain an image, see How to Use the NSF Image Library. General
   inquiries, comments, or suggestions can be directed to
   OLPA-Images@nsf.gov.
   We hope you find the library useful. NSF will continue to add to the
   collection as we obtain new material.
