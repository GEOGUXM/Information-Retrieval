   F. Tepes A. Berger, J. Rathke (AES) Foreword A study of Next Step
   Options (NSO) for the US DOE Fusion Sciences Program has been organized
   as a national, integrated design activity, led by the Princeton Plasma
   Physics Laboratory for the Virtual Laboratory for Technology. The
   effort has focused on the Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE), a
   tokamak designed for burning plasma research. Engineering reports were
   prepared for the FY99 and FY00 activities and may be found on the
   website at http://fire.pppl.gov. This document is the FY00 Engineering
   Report. Engineering analyses performed in FY00 demonstrated that the
   design proposed for FIRE has operational capabilities well beyond the
   basic goals adopted at the beginning of the study in FY99.
   Consequently, the physics requirements were refined in March,'00 to
   exploit these capabilities and expand the breadth and depth of the FIRE
   physics mission. The original goal of FIRE was to be capable of 10s
   pulses at 10T and Ip=6.44 MA to permit the study of burning plasmas
   (i.e., self heating, fast particle stability, etc.). The design has
   evolved such that it is capable of 18s pulses, which improves the
   experimental flexibility and data yield in a pulse, in addition to
   permitting the demonstration of "quasi steady state" plasma burns (ie,
   burn >>15 E, 2-3 He ) and ~ 1.5 skin. In addition to operating in high
   field, burning plasma modes, FIRE could operate in a "TPX-like mode" at
   4T with pulse lengths of ~200 s and Ip=5 MA, as well as in an advanced
   tokamak, burning plasma mode at 8T with pulse lengths of ~46 s and Ip=5
   MA. A draft cost estimate was completed and indicated that a total
   project cost goal for FIRE in the range of $1B is reasonable. Work is
   continuing to refine the FIRE cost estimate and an update of the cost
   estimate will be available early in FY 2001. The FIRE web site
   (http://FIRE.pppl.gov) was initiated in July, '99 and was expanded
   during FY '00. It has proven to be an excellent method for providing
   information to project participants and others interested in FIRE. It
   contains information on fusion program news, FIRE physics and
   engineering, international collaborations, FIRE reports, Snowmass and
   NSO-PAC meetings, as well as general fusion information. It has had
   more than 11,000 visitors from all areas of the world. The FIRE web
   site has been chosen as a selection for the Scout Report for Science
   and Engineering, the premier biweekly collection of useful Internet
   sites for researchers, educators, and students in the life sciences,
   physical sciences, and engineering. FIRE has a very proactive outreach
   program, with one of its major goals to solicit comments and
   suggestions from the fusion community. Presentations have been made and

   experimental device is shown in Fig. 4.0-1 (a) and (b). The main design
   features include: * High plasma triangularity (0.4 95) is provided for
   improved performance. * Double null gaseous divertors. Gaseous
   divertors have been shown to be effective in radiating most of the
   power going to the divertor regions throughout the first wall rather
   than depositing it in a localized toroidal stripe in the divertor. They
   are also easier to engineer. (a) Cross-Sectional View of FIRE Through

   components and fewer pieces. * A double walled vacuum vessel with
   integral shielding. . This design approach provides improved vessel
   structural stiffness and makes double use of the cooling jacket as
   nuclear shielding. Locating shielding between the walls reduces nuclear
   heating in the TF coils and the dose level external to the vessel. The
   reduced nuclear heating permits longer flat top times and higher
   current densities than would otherwise be possible. This "close in"
   shielding arrangement reduces the dose outside the vessel and
   activation of nitrogen that is in the thermal shield. (b) Cross Section

   The design of the baffle and outboard divertor was revised by
   integrating the two components into a single module. This was done to
   increase the baffle heat load capacity by providing coolant to the
   baffle, a component not actively cooled in the earlier design. The
   reconfigured baffle-outboard divertor module can be extracted through
   the horizontal ports in a maintenance scheme that provides for
   component rotation and a vertical lift. 4.3 Machine Assembly Fig. 4.3-1
   45-degree Octants Assembly The assembly sequence is illustrated in Fig.
   4.3-1. FIRE is assembled from (8) 45-degree sectors consisting of two
   TF coils and a 45-degree vacuum vessel octant. A vacuum vessel octant
   is rotated into the bore of two TF coils at assembly. Sixteen large,
   "straight-in" view ports are equally distributed along the vacuum
   vessel mid-plane. Sixteen upper and lower auxiliary ports are provided,
   angled in a position to allow diagnostic view of the divertor region.
   Small circular ports are also located at the top and bottom of the
   vacuum vessel, passing through the region between the TF coil winding.

   Central Solenoid (CS) is an OFHC copper coil. It is a free-standing
   coil in the baseline design. A bucked and wedged arrangement is being
   considered as an alternate. The CS is a pancake wound coil with turns
   that are water jet cut from plate. Radial coolant grooves are used
   between double pancake assemblies. The central solenoid is segmented
   into 5 coils with a large mid section coil, CS1, and two smaller coils
   on either end of the stack. Coil current densities vary among the coils
   in the CS assembly, and thus the coil segments experience different
   Lorentz forces, temperatures, and radial strains. Radial grooved plates
   at the interfaces between coil Figure 5.2  1 segments maintain
   concentricity. Typical CS Stress Results from the Global Model The CS
