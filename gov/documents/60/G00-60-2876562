                    Conditions on Outside Practice of Law
                 for Non-Office of General Counsel Attorneys

   [grad_blu.gif]

   Outside legal practice for attorneys who are not from the Office of
   General Counsel cannot involve compensated or uncompensated
   representational services before any Federal department, agency, or
   court on any matter in which the United States is a party or for which
   the U.S. has a direct and substantial interest. For example, providing
   tax advice or preparing a tax return is not considered representational
   services.  However, if the IRS decides to audit that return, the
   attorney is prohibited from representing the client in the IRS audit.

   The attorney cannot receive compensation as a result of any one else's
   representation of a client in a matter before a Federal agency or court
   (e.g., law partner).  The attorney may be prohibited from establishing
   an attorney-client relationship in an outside professional practice
   with a current or recent former employee, if it results in questions
   regarding the attorney's impartiality.

   The attorney agrees that client support, including telephone calls,
   will not be provided during working hours at NIH and that arrangements
   have been made for coverage of emergencies and other activities with
   clients while the employee is on duty.

   The attorney cannot receive a fee for consulting with another attorney
   if that attorney's client is a current or recent former NIH employee.

   The attorney cannot represent a client in matters in which the current
   or former employee participated personally and substantially while a
   government employee.

   NOTE:  The attorney may represent his or her parents, spouse, child, or
   any person for whom, or any estate for which, he or she is serving as
   guardian, executor, administrator, trustee or other personal fiduciary
   if the attorney obtains additional approval by the Government official
   responsible for his or her appointment.

   The attorney should also consult the rules of the state in which he/she
   is licensed to practice.

   For additional information, contact your Deputy Ethics Counselor or
   your ICD's Ethics Coordinator.
