                               Flare Characteristics

      Solar flares are tremendous explosions on the surface of the Sun. In a
      matter of just a few minutes they heat material to many millions of
      degrees and release as much energy as a billion megatons of TNT. They
      occur near sunspots, usually along the dividing line (neutral line)
      between areas of oppositely directed magnetic fields.

      Flares release energy in many forms - electro-magnetic (Gamma rays and
      X-rays), energetic particles (protons and electrons), and mass flows.
      Flares are characterized by their brightness in X-rays (X-Ray flux).
      The biggest flares are X-Class flares. M-Class flares have a tenth the
      energy and C-Class flares have a tenth of the X-ray flux seen in
      M-Class flares. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA) monitors the X-Ray flux from the Sun with detectors on some of
      its satellites. Observations for the last few days are available at
      NOAA's website for Today's Space Weather.

                                Flare Observations

      Solar flares are often observed using filters to isolate the light
      emitted by hydrogen atoms in the red region of the solar spectrum (the
      H-alpha spectral line). Most solar observatories have H-alpha
      telescopes and some observatories monitor the Sun for solar flares by
      capturing images of the Sun every few seconds. The images at the left
      are from the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The image at the upper left
      shows material erupting from a flare near the limb of the Sun on
      October 10th, 1971. The 4.2MB mpeg movie of this flare shows how
      material is blasted off of the Sun within just a few minutes. The image
      at the lower left shows a powerful flare observed on the disk of the
      Sun on August 7th, 1972. This is an example of a "two-ribbon" flare in
      which the flaring region appear as two bright lines threading through
      the area between sunspots within a sunspot group. (See the 2.2MB mpeg
      movie.) This particular flare, the "seahorse flare," produced radiation
      levels that would have been harmful to astronauts if a moon mission had
      been in progress at the time.

                             Flares and Magnetic Shear

      The key to understanding and predicting solar flares is the structure
      of the magnetic field around sunspots. If this structure becomes
      twisted and sheared then magnetic field lines can cross and reconnect
      with the explosive release of energy. In the image to the left the blue
      lines represent the neutral lines between areas of oppositely directed
      magnetic fields. Normally the magnetic field would loop directly across
      these lines from positive (outward pointing magnetic field) to negative
      (inward pointing magnetic field ) regions. The small line segments show
      the strength and direction of the magnetic field measured with the MSFC
      Vector Magnetograph. These lines and line segments overlie an image of
      a group of sunspots with a flaring region. The flare (the bright area)
      lies along a section of a neutral line where the magnetic field is
      twisted (or sheared) to point along the neutral line instead of across
      it. We have found that this shear is a key ingredient in the production
      of solar flares.
