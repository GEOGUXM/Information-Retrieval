             New Session Begins for LLNLs Saturday Science Lectures

      LIVERMORE, Calif.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will launch
      its sixth season of Science on Saturday on Feb. 2, with a talk on
      "Pillars of the Eagle Nebula  Can We Make Celestial Objects Using
      Lasers?" The lecture will begin at 9:30 a.m. at Lawrence Livermore
      National Lab in the Bldg. 123 auditorium.
      Lab physicists Bruce Remington and Jave Kane, along with science
      teacher Sarah Palmer of the Tri-Valley Regional Occupational Program,
      will discuss the dramatic pillars of the Eagle Nebula  one of the
      clouds of dust and gas in the galaxy out of which stars and planets
      form  and will demonstrate how lasers are used in the laboratory to
      produce miniature pillars.
      Science on Saturday is a five-week series of free 90-minute talks
      geared toward middle and senior high school students. The series, which
      began in 1996, has proven to be tremendously popular, drawing more than
      300 people from throughout the Bay Area to each lecture.
      This years series features Lab researchers talking about their
      cutting-edge science that is at the forefront of public interest, noted
      Don Correll, director of the Labs Science and Technology Education
      Program.
      "Were fortunate to have top-notch scientists working at the Laboratory
      who are doing work that people are very interested in," Correll said.
      "This years lectures focus on cutting-edge research students would see
      in the science supplements of their daily newspapers. The curiosity has
      always been there, but the challenge has been how to communicate
      science research in an interesting way. We think weve got a successful
      approach with this lecture series."
      This years speakers represent a wide range of disciplines, including
      astrophysics, biotechnology, engineering and planetary physics.
      The series is co-sponsored by the Laboratory and the Livermore chapter
      of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society.
      The free lectures, which cover topics from new technologies for
      treating strokes to state-of-the-art robotics, will be offered every
      Saturday, Feb. 2 through March 2, from 9:30-11:15 a.m. All of the talks
      will be in the Bldg. 123 auditorium and are open to students, their
      parents or guardians, and teachers. Registration is at the door and
      seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority
      given to students. Please note that all Science on Saturday visitors
      will need to enter the Laboratory through the southwest entrance on
      East Avenue where they will be given an identification badge.
