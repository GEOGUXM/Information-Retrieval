              The Space Physics (SEC) Data Availability Catalog
     __________________________________________________________________

   At the invitation of the NASA HQ's Office of Space Science, the
   NASA/GSFC Space Physics Data Facility and National Space Science Data
   Center have undertaken a joint effort to define and build a catalog of
   "Data Availability for Current Space Physics Missions, Programs and
   Campaigns." This catalog is an attempt to summarize the kinds and
   extent of data now being made available in current space physics
   (Sun-Earth-Connections theme, including heliospheric) flight programs.
   This catalog and associated reports will then serve as a focused
   information source for NASA HQs management interests in data
   availability and data archiving by missions. As a secondary purpose,
   the catalog can also be used as an alternative way for the NASA science
   community to locate data of interest from current missions.

   In January 2002, a renewed call to populate this catalog has been
   issued by the co-Chairs (Dave Sibeck and Terry Kucera) of the Living
   with a Star (LWS) Data System Planning Team. As a "Dear Colleague"
   letter, the text of this call is

     "Until the launch of Solar Dynamics Observatory and Geospace
     missions, the Living with a Star (LWS) Theory, Modelling, and Data
     Analysis (TMDA) Program will depend heavily upon the correlative
     analysis of existing ISTP data and future observations of Polar,
     Wind and Geotail. But with the recent demise of ISTP as a program,
     there are concerns that some of the ISTP mission data relevant to
     LWS objectives may not be readily accessible to the broad LWS
     science community or could even fall into danger of actual loss.

     To gather some preliminary information relevant to these concerns,
     as Co-Chairs of the LWS Data System Planning Team, we are asking you
     to check whether the information about you and data sets from your
     instruments recorded on http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/SPD.html is
     up-to-date and complete. If not, could you please update the
     information as necessary?

     We would also be interested in any plans to place data sets relevant
     to LWS objectives on-line or transfer them to a designated archival
     center in the near-Future. If funding is a problem, please tell us
     and we will approach the LWS project for assistance on your behalf.

     Finally, we will be approaching LWS project management with a plan
     to implement a community-based steering group for the LWS data
     system. Would you be interested in participating?"

         * About the Space Physics Data Availability Catalog (SPDAC)

   The Space Physics Data Availability Catalog (SPDAC) interface starts
   with a Mission Overview Matrix where the mission names (and subsequent
   investigation names) link to the next level of SPDAC information.
   Appropriate updates (to edit existing information or to add entries)
   are possible at each level. Please note that updates submitted are
   manually reviewed and, while immediately acknowledged, will not be
   immediately reflected in the displayed catalog. Users may also send
   update information directly to mailto:spdac_mail@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov if
   they have any difficulty with the forms.
