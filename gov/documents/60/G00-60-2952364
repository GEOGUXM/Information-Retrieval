   Professional biographical information:

Dr. Charles L. Wilson is a plant pathologist that has done research on the biolo
gical
control of plant diseases and weeds for over 40 years. He is presently doing res
earch on
the control of fruit diseases with microbial bio-control agents and natural fung
icides. Dr.
Wilson is a fellow of the American Phytopatological Society and Washington Acade
my

Description of research projects:

Research utilizing antagonistic yeasts in combination with natural compounds to
control
postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables.

Technology has been developed and patented that utilizes a combination of an
antagonistic yeast and chitosan to control postharvest diseases of fruits and ve
getables.
This “bioactive coating” has been tested successfully in large-scale packinghous
e
experiments on apple and citrus in West Virginia, Florida, and California. Micro
 Flo
Company [Subsidiary of BASF] has entered into a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement [CRADA] with ARS to commercialize this technology.

Use of natural fungicides to control fruit pathogens

Natural plant- and animal-derived materials are being screened for fungicidal ac
tivity
against a wide range of fruit pathogens. Promising compounds are being tested ag
ainst
fruit and soil-borne plant pathogen. Investigations are also underway to apply n
atural
anti-microbial compounds in packaging for fruit to reduce decay and extend the s
helf-life
of the commodity. Natural fungicides are also being tested for their activity ag
ainst the
apple scab fungus, Venturia inaequalis.
