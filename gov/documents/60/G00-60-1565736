     The Enable project is a DOE Research Project to build an adaptive
     monitoring infrastructure, a monitor data publishing mechanism, and
     monitor data analysis tools. We are developing a "Grid" service that
     will provide both of these capabilities. The overall goal of this
     work is to  provide manageability, reliability, and adaptability for
     high performance applications running over wide-area networks. The
     PIs are Brian Tierney (LBNL) and Joseph Evans (KU)

     A main component of Enable project is the Enable network advice
     server. An Enable server can installed on any data source host
     (e.g.: a FTP server), and configured to monitor the network paths
     from that host to a set of client hosts (or to scan FTP logs for a
     list of client hosts to monitor). The Enable server monitors
     throughput and delay values, and can be queried by client
     applications to get the optimal TCP buffer size to use for a given
     path.
