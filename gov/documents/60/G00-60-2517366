   Announcing Poison Help, the poison emergency help line
     * If you have a poisoning emergency, call
       1-800-222-1222.
     * If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call 911.

   Whats the problem?
   Millions of people are exposed to poisons each year in the United
   States.  In 2000, poison control centers reported approximately 2.2
   million poison exposures, 920 of which resulted in death. Nearly all
   poison exposures (more than 90%) happen in the home and involve common
   household items such as cleaning products, detergents, medicines,
   vitamins, cosmetics, and plants.

   Whos at risk?
   Of the more than 2 million poison exposures reported in 2000, 52.7%
   occurred among children younger that six years.

   Adolescents are also at risk for poisonings, both unintentional and
   intentional: approximately half of all poisonings among teens are
   classified as suicide attempts.

   Can it be Prevented?
   Children can be protected if all potentially toxic substances (e.g.,
   medicines, cleaning products, pesticides, and automotive chemicals) are
   stored in child-resistant containers, locked out of childrens reach.
   The national toll-free number for the poison center, 1-800-222-1222
   should be posted on or near the telephone.

   Parents and guardians must take every precaution possible it only takes
   seconds for a poisoning to happen.  Supervision is extremely important-
   particularly when children are visiting friends or family who may not
   have a child-safe home.

   Getting expert advice by calling the poison center immediately after a
   poison exposure is the best way to prevent serious effects from a
   poisoning.

   Poison Centers, please contact the American Association of Poison
