                    ***** Revision Notice 08/27/00 *****
   ***** Magnetic Fields Now Available ***** A new release date of
   MCLIB/MC_Run (23 July 2000, ftp://strider.lansce.lanl.gov/pub/NISP/) is
   now available. Magnetic induction regions (which overlap and coexist
   with material regions) have been implemented. When polarized neutrons
   are transported in field regions their precession is computed. The list
   of new field types and additional minor bug fixes and cosmetic changes
   is found in ftp://strider.lansce.lanl.gov/pub/NISP/Revision_Notes.txt.
   Note that the calling sequences of OPERATE and user-defined types 75-79
   have changed to include a magnetic-field flag.

   Many of the new features are not yet installed in the MC_Web interface;
   this will be an ongoing process. We need help in developing
   polarization devices! To assist in this, any element in MC_Web that
   normally contains a "material" from the pull-down menu may now be
   defined with a "General_Region" which allows the user to enter
   explicitly the parameters to be sent to MC_Run. This will allow use of
   class 70 (user defined) regions and also class 60 (magnetic field)
   regions. For more instructions and help, contact PASeeger@aol.com. The
   previous version of MCLIB/MC_Run remains available in folder
   ftp://strider.lansce.lanl.gov/pub/NISP/version990923/.

             Please report any difficulties to PASeeger@aol.com!
