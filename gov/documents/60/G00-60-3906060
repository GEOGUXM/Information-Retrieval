   The Detroit Division recently completed its first successful FBI
   Citizens' Academy which is a facet of the Community Outreach Program.
   The Academy lasted six weeks from May - June 2001 and was compromised
   of 20 individuals consisting of business, community and civic leaders.
   The purpose of the Citizens' Academy was to strengthen existing
   relationships between the FBI and the community leader by exposing them
   to what life is like in today's FBI.  The format included presentation
   from various FBI supervisors regarding  investigative responsibilities
   as well as hands-on experiences including the collection of evidence
   and firearms training.
