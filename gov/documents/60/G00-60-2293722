                               Pay and Records

   Pay Tables and References

   Your federal job classification and your location determine what salary
   pay table is used for setting your pay. Pay and locality tables
   include:

     * General Schedule  (including Special Rates, SES, Senior Level, and
       Law Enforcement)
     * Federal Wage System  Pay Tables
     * DOC Demo  (Standard or Specialty Tables)
     * NIST Demo Pay

   DOC has developed on-line Pay Manuals covering General Pay and Premium
   Pay. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offers information on the
   Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For determining proper credit during
   official travel, employees, supervisors, and timekeepers are encouraged
   to review information on Overtime Pay for Travel.  To understand the
   pay cap restrictions for Premium Pay, see the information in Biweekly
   Earnings Limitation.

   If your job classification, type of appointment, and work schedule
   makes you eligible for within-grade increases ("WGIs" -- also known as
   "step increases"), you will receive periodic pay increases if your work
   is at an acceptable level of competence. Here are the required Waiting
   Periods for Within-Grade Increases.

   Pay Cycles and Calendars

   If you are a Department of Commerce (DOC) employee, your federal
   paycheck is issued from a Department of Treasury distribution center
   every two weeks. These two week cycles are called "pay periods"; they
   begin every other Sunday. The official payday for DOC employees is the
   second Thursday after the end of the pay period, however, electronic
   direct deposit of paychecks usually are posted to employee accounts
   several days earlier. Here are Official Federal Holidays and Pay Period
   Dates.

   Your Payroll/Personnel Data

   Your payroll/personnel data is maintained by your servicing DOC Human
   Resources office using the National Finance Center (NFC) located in New
   Orleans, LA. Like many other federal agencies, DOC contracts
   payroll/personnel services from NFC. Contact your servicing Personnel
   Assistant or Human Resources Advisor with any questions about your
   payroll/personnel information.

   Each pay period, NFC mails an "Earnings and Leave Statement" to each
   serviced employees' residence address. This statement documents your
   earnings and all of the various deductions taken for taxes, benefits
   such as retirement and life insurance, leave accruals and usage, etc..
   It is very important that you review the statement to ensure proper
   deductions are being made and that leave balances match your certified
   Time and Attendance report. Be sure to double-check deductions when
   making a change in benefits such as your health coverage, life
   insurance, or TSP allocations. You should immediately report any
   underpayments or overpayments to your servicing Personnel Assistant. In
   most instances, you will be liable for repayment of any overpayments to
   you.

   If you want on-line access to your personnel/payroll information, you
   can sign up for NFC's Employee Personal Page.

   Your Personnel Actions

   Your servicing HR office will provide you with a copy of each personnel
   action, the SF-50B, Notification of Personnel Action, that is processed
   which applies to you. These actions chronicle your federal service and
   are very important documents. You should keep them in a file in a safe
   place. Your servicing HR office maintains these records as well as all
   the other offical documents reflecting your employment status,
   benefits, qualifications, and employment history. The records are
   maintained in an Official Personnel Folder (OPF).

   Changing Your Pay & Benefits Data -- Use Employee Express!

   In 1995, the processing of certain actions affecting employee pay and
   benefits was automated by a system called Employee Express. It takes HR
   out of the loop (except in limited circumstances) and gives employees
   control of changing their own personal data for:

     - Federal and State Tax Withholdings
     - Direct Deposit of Net Pay and Allotments
     - Residence Address changes
     - Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and Health Benefit Open Season Changes
     - Health Benefit enrollment cancellations
     - Health Benefit changes from Family to Self-Only coverage
     - Cancellation of TSP Participation
     - U.S. Savings Bonds

   Using a touch-tone phone, your Social Security Number, and a Personal
   Identification Number (PIN), call:

   From Work: (478) 757-3083   From Home: (800) 827-6281   TTY/TDD: (478)
   757-3117

   OR You can access Employee Express online. You must use a browser
   supporting SSL protocol with 128-bit strong encryption and JavaScript
   enabled in order to make changes online. The same PIN used for phone
   access is used for the making changes on the website.

   If you do not know your PIN, call the Help Desk at (478) 757-3030. The
   Help Desk is staffed between the hours of 7 AM and 7 PM EST. At other
   times, you can leave a message and someone will return the call.  You
   should receive a new PIN mailed to your home address within 10 calendar
   days.

   NOTE: Don't confuse the Account Access feature of the TSP website with
   the TSP changes made using Employee Express. The TSP Account Access
   feature is used to query your TSP account balance, request an interfund
   transfer, find out the amount available for a TSP loan (and current
   loan interest rate), and check the status of a loan or withdrawal.
   Different PIN, different website, different Help Desk!

   Automated Employment or Salary Verification

   DOC's HR offices no longer process employment or salary verification
   requests (except for employees duty stationed overseas or for
   hearing-impaired employees). Employees are to use a national automated
   voice system called The Work Number for Everyone.

   Name Change or Change in Marital Status

   If you have a Name Change or a Change in your Marital Status, here's an
   important checklist to ensure you cover all the bases.

   Financial Disclosure

   Some employees whose position meets the Office of Government Ethics
   (OGE) definition of a Financial Disclosure filer are required to
   complete a Confidential Disclosure Report annually and submit it to the
   DOC Office of General Counsel.

   U.S. Savings Bonds

   Here's the Treasury site if you're interested in investing in U.S.
   Savings Bonds.

   W-2s, Wage and Tax Statements

   Each year by the end of January, NFC mails out W-2s, Wage and Tax
   Statements. If you do not get your form by then, call your servicing
   Personnel Assistant. If you need further tax information, forms or
   publications, including how to determine your W-4 Withholding
   Allowance, visit the IRS website.
