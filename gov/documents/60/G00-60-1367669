                          WELCOME TO MY HOME PAGE.

   I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley in the Department of Geology and
   Geophysics. I am currently doing research on my thesis project,
   tentatively titled Determining Cratering Rates on the Moon Using Lunar
   Spherules. Lunar spherules are small glass beads that are formed in
   impacts on the lunar surface. By dating a spherule we are dating the
   age of the impact that formed it. My thesis advisor, Rich Muller, and I
   have put up a home page that details my project and some of the other
   projects that we are working on, including Rich's new theory about the
   cause of the ice ages and the search for Nemesis.

   More about me: While most of my time is spent being a graduate student
   and doing thesis work, I do, occasionally, get a chance to do other fun
      things... I probably spend most of my spare time playing ultimate
                       frisbee and listening to music.

             Schools at which I have spent far too much time...
     * Williams College. Particularly the geology and astronomy
       departments.
     * UC Berkeley
     * Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Ok, so LBL isn't a school
       technically, but I have spent too much time here as a student.
