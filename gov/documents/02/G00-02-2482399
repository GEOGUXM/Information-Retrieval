   The Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) is a
   collaborative project to install 250 permanent, continuously recording
   Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in and around the Los Angeles
   basin to provide accurate deformation information that will improve our
   estimates of earthquake hazards. Major participants in SCIGN include
   NASA/JPL, The United States Geological Survey (USGS), and The
   University of California San Diego, operating under the umbrella of the
   Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). Chief sponsors of the
   SCIGN network are the W. M. Keck Foundation, The National Science
   Foundation, NASA, and the USGS. Currently, SCIGN is in the process of
   identifying and selecting candidate sites for installation based on the
   DOTS3 map. [dots3.3.sm.jpg]

Current Status of SCIGN

   Information is available on the site status, data quality (engineering
   data) from analyses at JPL using GIPSY, and time series of station
   coordinates.

  Status

   Each station is assigned a composite score based on data quantity,
   quality, and latency. Select documentation for detailed information on
   how these are computed. Green indicates a composite score of 8 or more,
   and red 5 or less. Sites with intermediate values are indicated with
   yellow. (Blue indicates that, although data were available at one or
   more Global Data Centers, they were not successfully processed at JPL
   in time for the report.) The score reflects a moving 7-day average.

  Engineering

   Plots and statistics are available for the time series of station
   performance for each day analyzed by the JPL quick look process. These
   statistics include for daily mean values for the phase residuals (mm),
   pseudorange residuals (cm), clock (ns), number of epochs processed,
   number of phase breaks detected, the number of days processed, and days
   since the last day processed. Tables are available for the global
   network and for SCIGN.

  Time Series

   Given 24 hours of GPS data the latitude, longitude, and height of each
   receiver can be computed to within a few mm. Time series graphically
   illustrate the evolution of receiver positions from day to day. A
   global reference frame called ITRF96 is used for all time series. Each
   plot includes the estimated positions with error bars, the best fit
   line, and the residual scatter which is an indication of the daily
   measurement precision. The motion of each site is due to a combination
   of inter-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic effects. Time series are
   also available for all global network site s.

   presents background text and activities related to plate tectonics,
   earthquakes, GPS, and space technology at work. Real SCIGN data is used
   in the activities.
