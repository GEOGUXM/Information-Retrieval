     In the 1840s, Kelso, Washington was founded along the banks of the
     Cowlitz River by a surveyor named Peter Crawford who named the town
   after his Scottish home. Kelso has a unique historical past -- a story
     of struggle against competition in businesses and professions, its
    disasters and its faith in itself to overcome all odds and to expand,
     grow and progress in every way possible. The complete and colorful
     history of Kelso is recorded in detail in a book by local resident
   Camilla Summers, now deceased. Her book, About Kelso, takes the reader
    from the time before Peter Crawford platted his farm into the city he
     named Kelso in 1884, through to the effects of the Mount St. Helens
                              eruption in 1980.

     The city of Kelso is the county seat of Cowlitz County, located in
      southwestern Washington. Kelso is located on Interstate 5, at the
    confluence of the Cowlitz, Coweeman and Columbia Rivers. Kelso is 48
   miles north of Portland, Oregon and 125 miles south of Seattle,and only
                     80 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.

   Whether you already live in our community, are anticipating starting a
     new business, or looking for a location to build, Kelso has it all.
