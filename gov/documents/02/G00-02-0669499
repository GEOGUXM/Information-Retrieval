Education

   BA Physics, UC Berkeley (1985)
   PhD Astrophysics, CU Boulder (1990)

Interests

   Innovative applications of the Internet for accessing geospatial
   information, educational and scientific uses of the World Wide Web, and
   interoperability standards for distributed computing systems.

Current Projects

  Web Mapping

   The Web Map Service implementation specification is an OpenGIS
   Consortium standard for publishing and retrieving geographic maps over
   the internet. I am the editor of WMS version 1.1.0, and also write WMS
   client and server software.

  Geospatial Applications and Interoperability

   Geospatial Applications and Interoperability is a working group of the
   US Federal Geographic Data Committee. The goal of the GAI is to promote
   information technology standards and specific application projects that
   enable people to gain knowledge or make decisions through access to
   geographic information. I am the NASA representative to the GAI WG.

Past Projects

  Digital Earth

   Digital Earth was a precursor to the GAI working group.

  GLOBE Visualizations

   The GLOBE Visualization server generates visualizations on demand based
   on data from the GLOBE Program, a worldwide network of students,
   teachers, and scientists working together to study and understand the
   global environment. I was webmaster of this server from 1995-1998.

  Visualization of Remote Sensing Data

   Visualization of Remote Sensing Data (VRSD) is a showcase for
   high-impact satellite imagery of hurricanes and other natural
   phenomena. I was webmaster of this server from 1994-1998.

  Earth in VRML

   I have done some work on using VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)
   to visualize earth science data. My goal is to create compelling 3D
   representations which faithfully represent the data and which
   communicate understanding about complex natural systems to scientists
   and to society at large. This project has been put on hold.
