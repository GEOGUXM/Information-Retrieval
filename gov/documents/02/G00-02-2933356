   The Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) is a widely used resource on
   the results of chronic, long-term animal cancer tests. It provides a
   single, standardized and easily accessible database that includes
   sufficient information on each experiment to permit investigations into
   many research areas of carcinogenesis. Both qualitative and
   quantitative information on positive and negative experiments are
   reported, including all bioassays from the National Cancer
   Institute/National Toxicology Program (NCI/NTP) and experimental
   results from the general literature that meet a set of inclusion
   criteria. Analyses of 5152 experiments on 1298 chemicals are presented.
   For each experiment, information is included on the species, strain,
   and sex of test animal; features of experimental protocol such as route
   of administration, duration of dosing, dose level(s) in mg/kg body
   weight/day, and duration of experiment; histopathology and tumor
   incidence; carcinogenic potency (TD[50]) and its statistical
   significance; shape of the dose-response curve; author's opinion as to
   carcinogenicity; and literature citation.

   This Web site contains several formats for accessing the CPDB, and
   therefore for obtaining information on the results of animal cancer
   tests.

   Additional summary tables by target tissue and chemical name, and a
   list of our publications, including some with full text are also on
   this Web site. See the boxes below.

   Database formats on this Web site:
    1. A plot, or graphic display, of the CPDB summarizes the data in an
       easily readable format that has been used in publications of the
       CPDB.
    2. NEW: A tab-separated version of the same data, that can be easily
       read into databases or spreadsheets.
    3. NEW: A dataset of supplementary information for experiments in the
       general literature. This supplementary dataset is in tab-separated
       format and can be used in conjunction with the CPDB to extract
       survival information and dosing schedules for the general
       literature.
