   USDA Agricultural Research Service Agency-wide Web Site Search Engine
     __________________________________________________________________

   This server (Search) indexes all supported ARS web sites, thereby
   enabling a one-stop search-all tool. See the catalogs page for details
   on each catalog.
   Current Features include:
     * A search engine which indexes all agency-maintained web sites,
       regardless of Domain Name or host
     * Incremental index updates performed on a weekly basis (or as
       prescribed by Area office).
     * Ability to search the index on specific Areas (catalogs).
     * Ability to create a custom search form (for use within area sites,
       presumably) which would search for content based on a specific url
       base (eg, http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/graphics/photos)
     * Thesaurus-enhanced searches (as on nps.ars.usda.gov).

   Sites which use this engine as their own:
   The following have implemented this search engine as part of their own
   sites to specifically search on their content only. Check 'em out!
     * ARS Home Page
     * ARS Information Staff
     * ARS Beltsville Area
     * ARS Sugarbeet Research Unit
     * ARS NPS

   Tips!

     Search defaults to string matches.

     Use 'and', 'or' and 'and not' where appropriate for boolean searches.
