   It's your business, it's your community
   When the California legislature adopted welfare reform, they knew the
   success of placing an estimated 600,000 welfare recipients would depend
   on the employer community.

   Welfare reform is not about charity . . .
   it's about eliminating poverty as a way of life.

   It's about filling your entry level jobs with a committed, motivated
   workforce.

   It's about working together with local service providers who can match
   the right candidate to meet your job needs.

   And it's about innovative local partnerships that are stepping forward
   to work with you, and help your new employee be successful in your
   business.

   The Employment Development Department has developed this web site to
   help assist the employers of California actively participate in the
   success of welfare reform. We hope you will join us and other
   California employers, who have pledged to hire welfare recipients and
   help them become independent, contributing members of your community.
