   Cuong Nhu was founded in 1965 by Grand Master Ngo Dong in Vietnam.
   Cuong Nhu combines the hard-style blocks, punches, and kicks of
   Japanese Shotokan karate with the softer, more circular movements of
   arts such as Judo, Aikido, Wing Chun, Tai Chi Chuan, and Vovinam (a
   Vietnamese art). A few of the elements of Boxing can also be found in
   Cuong Nhu. It is this blending of hard and soft styles from which Cuong
   Nhu derives its name, which is Vietnamese for Hard (Cuong) - Soft
   (Nhu).

   In 1971, Grand Master Dong came to the United States to pursue a Ph.D.
   in entomology at the University of Florida. In September 1971, he
   opened the first Cuong Nhu Karate club in the United States. Within two
   years, this club grew into the largest intramural club on campus, with
   over two hundred students participating. Many of those early students
   went on to establish their own Cuong Nhu schools after leaving the
   University of Florida, thus spreading the style all over the United
   States and around the world.

   Am Duong (Yin-Yang in Vietnamese) club was formed in 1987 at the
   NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. Beginners classes are held on Mondays
   and Thursdays. Intermediate and advanced students work out on Mondays,
   Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Am Duong dojo (training place) is located in
   Building 26, Room 205. Practice sessions are from 5:15 pm to 7:00 pm.
   Twice a year, Am Duong club starts a new beginners class.

   In addition to learning empty-hand techniques, students train with
   weapons such as Tambo (short stick) and Bo (long stick).
