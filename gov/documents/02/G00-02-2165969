   JPL and the Arroyo Seco
   We are NASA and ISO 9001 certified

   Bldgs. 144 & 150 on a cool morning ABOUT US
   Section 351 personnel operate and maintain the Environmental Test
   Laboratory (ETL) in Buildings 144 & 306, and Space/Solar Simulator
   Facilities in Buildings 150 & 248. The ETL provides all JPL projects
   and external customers with complete facilities for thermal,
   thermal-vacuum, solar-thermal-vacuum, vibration, mechanical shock and
   acoustic testing for all types of space flight hardware. Expertise
   includes the preparation of detailed test procedures and test reports,
   test operations, instrumentation and data acquisition and test method
   consultation.  We are certified to perform flight hardware environment
   testing.
   THERMAL VACUUM TESTING
   The ETL has numerous horizontal thermal vacuum chambers ranging in size
   from 3 ft. by 3 ft. up to 10 ft. by 10 ft. in diameter. These chambers
   are capable of providing an outer space environment of better than 1 x
   10^-6 Torr at minus 185° C. The ETL also has several vacuum bake-out
   chambers which are capable of attaining high vacuum conditions at
   temperatures of over plus 100° C. The facility has staff experts in the
   fields of helium leak checking, molecular contamination monitoring,
   cryogenics and high vacuum technology. The ETL uses state-of-the-art
   helium cryo and turbo-molecular pumping systems to provide an ultra
   clean vacuum environment for sensitive optical space flight
   instruments.
   VIBRATION and ACOUSTIC TESTING

   FORCE LIMITED VIBRATION TESTS ARE OUR SPECIALTY!
   The ETL has vibration test systems for simulating space flight launch
   environments. The vibration systems range in size from 17,500 to 57,000
   rms pounds of force (Jan. 2002). These vibration systems use modern
   computer control systems that feature real-time data capture and
   over-test protection systems. Our lab has been instrumental in the
   development of "force limited" vibration tests which have now become
   common in the NASA community.  The vibration systems are also capable
   of producing mechanical shock pulse environments.  The ETL maintains a
   large stock of vibration test fixtures to accommodate most
   requirements. The acoustic test facility is a 10,900 cubic foot chamber
   capable of noise levels up to 150 dB to simulate a space launch
   environment.  The large vibration system and the acoustic chamber are
   located in a Class 10,000 clean room .
   SPACE SIMULATION TESTING
   The ETL operates and maintains the 25 ft. by 85 ft. (vertical) and 10
   ft. by 35 ft. (vertical) Space/Solar Simulator Facilities. These two
   large thermal vacuum chambers are capable of providing an outer space
   environment of better than 1 x 10^-6 Torr at minus 185° C. In addition
   to outer space environments, both chambers are capable of simulating a
   Martian surface environment for testing Mars Landers and Rovers. The 25
   ft. Space Simulator has the capability of producing solar radiation
   levels greater than ten solar constants. Both Space Simulation chambers
   are located adjacent to Class 10,000 clean rooms that provide ample
   areas for pre and post test system integration operations.

   Notice to our Dynamics Customers:
   On-Lab dynamics testing is suspended while our lab undergoes a major
   re-model and will restart in February, 2002.  We are scheduling testing
   for our customers at outside facilities during our upgrade. Our vacuum
   areas will remain open.
