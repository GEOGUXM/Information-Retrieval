   The International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG) was
   established in April 1995 at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany. As
   established in their charter, this working group includes
   representatives from many major space agencies around the world and is
   charged with developing an international strategy for the exploration
   of the Moon. One of the first tasks of ILEWG was to establish a
   communication mechanism, and this Web page is the first step in that
   direction. On this page can be found the full charter of ILEWG and the
   Beatenberg Declaration, which was issued at an international meeting in
   Beatenberg, Switzerland in 1994. A list of meetings related to
   exploration of the Moon is included and will be updated periodically.
   As this ILEWG internet network grows, provision will be added for
   adding technical and informational reports from all space agencies and
   from other interested parties. A database of interested parties and
   their specialties is posted in the Lunar Explorers Register. This page
   includes directions for subscribing to the ILEWG list server. Links to
   Web pages for space agencies all over the world are also included. Our
   goal is to become an information exchange center for potential and real
   future lunar robotic and human missions, as well as for new scientific
   and resource information about the Moon.

   This Web page is sponsored by the Mission from Planet Earth Study
   Office at NASA Headquarters, Washington DC. It is maintained by the
   Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, Texas.
