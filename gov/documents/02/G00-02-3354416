   "The Art in Embassies Program turns artists into ambassadors for
   America"

                 "There are many ways to conduct diplomacy.
    The Art in Embassies Program is a special way. Works of American art,
   on display around the world, share our beloved country, our values, our
    history, our culture, our deep belief in freedom of expression and in
      the creative power of the individual. Each work of art becomes a
   diplomatic instrument, each artist an ambassador. It is an outstanding
                                  program."

                                                           Colin L. Powell
