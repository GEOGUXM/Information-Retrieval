   caption The Forecast Research Division is home to most of the research
   in FSL on short-range forecasting and small-scale weather phenomena.
   The division emphasizes the assimilation of diverse meteorological
   observations for analyzing current atmospheric conditions and the
   subsequent generation of short-range numerical forecasts. Produced in
   real time at frequent intervals on national and local scales, these
   analyses and forecasts are valuable to commercial aviation, local
   forecasters, and emergency preparedness agencies. They also have
   supported or will support several large meteorological field
   experiments. Concurrent with the assimilation and modeling research is
   the study of small-scale phenomena such as clear-air turbulence and
   thunderstorms.
