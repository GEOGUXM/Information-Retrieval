                National Archives and Records Administration

   The ARDOR prototype project makes selected Federal agency records
   management schedules and manuals available online. We expect the system
   to be useful to our staff, Federal records managers, and other
   interested parties as we work to implement the goals outlined in the
   NARA Strategic Plan.

   As a prototype, ARDOR has significant limitations. It does not cover
   all Federal agencies, or necessarily cover all records for the agencies
   that are included. We work with agencies to keep the system as exact
   and current as possible, but the infrastructure needed to assure
   complete accuracy does not yet exist. ARDOR is strictly a reference
   tool and does not serve as a definitive source for records disposition
   matters. Please consult with official agency records schedules for any
   and all authoritative information.

   You can locate individual schedules and manuals in ARDOR by clicking on
   the name of an agency listed below. In some cases, ARDOR contains the
   schedules or manuals themselves; in cases, however, ARDOR provides a
   link to external web sites for agencies that have posted this
   information. ARDOR is evolving into an information "pointer" or central
   location service as individual agencies continue to make their
   schedules and manuals available on the web.
