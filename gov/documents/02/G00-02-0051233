     T-1 staff members model thermodynamic and mechanical behavior of
     materials with emphasis on the theoretical study of the static and
     the dynamic properties in supporting the nuclear and conventional
     defense communities, the civilian research communities and
     commercial applications. Semiconductor modeling and interactions
     with the semiconductor industry are of growing importance as well as
     increased emphasis on composites, ceramics, and intermetallics. T-1
     maintains the SESAME Equation-of-State and Material Properties
     Library.
