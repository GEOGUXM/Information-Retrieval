     June 9, 2000
     at noon on Friday, June 30, 2000. We have made this difficult
     decision after lengthy consideration of the role the SCRC plays in
     NIH's intramural science program and our need to allocate limited
     resources in a way that best serves this research community.

     Current SCRC staff members will be assigned to other parts of CIT's
     Division of Computational Bioscience (DCB). Collaborative projects
     involving SCRC staff members will continue after the closing of the
     user facility. In the future, our external review committee will
     review these projects like all other DCB activities to determine the
     appropriateness and level of allocated project resources.

     With the closing of the SCRC facility, there will no longer be user
     access to SCRC workstations, printers, scanners or file servers
     after June 30. Anyone who has files stored on our Macintosh and PC
     servers (Workspace and Workspace-2) or on our Silicon Graphics
     workstations (Grapejuice and Manta) should make plans to retrieve
     those files prior to that date.

     I would like to thank the SCRC staff for their dedication and
     outstanding work in providing this valuable resource for NIH over
     the years.

     Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this action.
