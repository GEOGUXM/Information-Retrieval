                              Education at LANL

      Los Alamos National Laboratory has many groups with programs that
   support education from K-12 through graduate school. We try to list all
         Laboratory programs that might deal with education issues.

                          Programs & Organizations

     * Our Science Education Program Office (STB-EPO) coordinates and is
       the point of contact for more than twenty-five education programs
       for all levels of education, from elementary to university and
       postgraduate.
     * The University of California Coordination Team (STB-UC) seeks to
       foster enhanced collaborations with the faculty and staff of the
       nine UC campuses and the other two UC-managed laboratories
       (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore
       National Laboratory).
     * The Bradbury Science Museum conducts education programs for schools
       and the general public.
     * Special Employment Programs and Services (HR-staffing) has several
       special employment programs for students, teachers, and faculty.
       These range from high school student and teacher summer employment
       to undergraduate, graduate, faculty and post-doctorate programs.
