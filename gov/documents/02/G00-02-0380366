                            Our Mission Statement

   The mission of the NOAA Satellite Active Archive (SAA) is to provide
   electronic distribution of data and derived data products from U.S.
   polar-orbiting environmental satellites (POES). The SAA is an
   operational component of the Information Processing Division of the
   NOAA Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD). The
   SAA provides no data distribution other than in electronic form. POES
   data on magnetic tape or cartridge is provided through arrangement with
   NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). OSDPD and NCDC are line
   organizations of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
   Information Service (NESDIS).
   Currently there are no fees associated with the SAA's on-line services.
   We ask only that you cite "the NOAA Satellite Active Archive" as the
   data source in all publications, articles, papers, etc. for which our
   data sets have contributed value.
