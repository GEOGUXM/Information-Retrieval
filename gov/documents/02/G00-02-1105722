   The Simulated Satellite (SimSat) project is an education and outreach
   activity being developed by Mr. Patrick Kilroy, an engineer at the NASA
   Goddard Space Flight Center. A SimSat "spacecraft" uses a small
   high-altitude weather balloon platform to fly experiments designed and
   built by students to near-space altitudes.

   Launch and mission control are school based.

   Experiment, housekeeping, and location telemetry are broadcast real
   time from the capsule. The payload is tracked by groups of students and
   radio amateur enthusiasts as the balloon is carried by upper-level
   winds. Effort is placed on recovery of the payload.

   The project simulates many of the challenges inherent in working with
   satellites, such as the integration & test regiments, operational
   practices, and remote observing. SimSat offers a unique hands-on
   experience for high school students in physics, electronics, technical
   education, aerospace and other science-based classes. The series of
   flights is a vehicle for teaching and learning technology.

  Why?

   Because SimSat is fun!

   "Kids love to build things: SimSat builds the requisite systems for
   balloon-powered satellites to reach altitudes of 100,000 feet. Kids
   love to fly things: SimSat kids will fly their own high altitude
   research balloon onto the threshold of space. Kids love the unknown:
   SimSat takes them there in real time." - Dr. Bob Besse, Director, 21st
   Century Schools, City of Baltimore.

   We want to spark the student's interest in science, math, technology
   and the U.S. space program in a rich and wholesome way. In doing so,
   many of us are donating our time and talents as a public service to our
   local community, to share the thrill of good science and the spinoffs
   of the Amateur Radio hobby with middle school and high school students.
   The students learn valuable lessons about the design of experiments,
   satellite flight preparation, telemetry, GPS, computers, recovery
   techniques and much more.

  Who?

   If you are interested in learning the ropes of flying a simulated
   satellite that uses something very similar to a radiosonde then this
   project is for you!

   Engineers, apply within. Teachers too! Students! Organizers! Parents!
   Ham radio operators! Financial sponsors! Computer programmers! Builders
   and tinkerers! There's a role for each of you.

  How?

   Many volunteers bring substantial talents to the table during flight
   preparation and flight operations. Teachers contribute a wide range of
   experience, from using examples of SimSat data in the classroom to
   coordinating a project as an extracurricular activity. Students
   participate in experiment development, flight operations, publicity,
   post-flight data interpretation and more. Telemetry capture and
   tracking are done by students with ham radio mentors.

   Student newspaper writers, photographers and videographers are always
   in demand.

   Sponsors are sought to help fund pieces of flight hardware for school
   experiments and ground station components.

   A satellite ground station is set up permanently at each participating
   school using some very cool technology that kids can handle. The
   equipment is relatively low in cost and maintenance. Simply remarkable!
   Some example ground station blueprints are offered below.

   Don't miss reading the answers to the SimSat Frequently Asked Questions
   (FAQ). See below. You'll be in the know, and you can tell other schools
   and hams about SimSat as well.

  Standard Services

   The current or planned SimSat standard services are (1) room for a
   student experiment on the flight platform, (2) real-time flight
   telemetry, broadcasting temperatures, tracking data, and experiment
   data, (3) live television video downlink, (4) an optional flight
   communications repeater or transponder, (5) numerous Internet products
   and (6) key roles for individuals in the flight operations.

  What's Up?

   A lot of opportunities are opening. You can participate in SimSat
   school partnerships, public exhibits and presentations, and flight day
   preparation to name a few. The best way to keep abreast of the latest
   developments is to subscribe to the SimSat e-mail list. It's free!

   IMPORTANT. There is a need for one or two Amateur Radio operators to
   partner with each SimSat school. A SimSat capsule in flight "talks" to
   students by wireless means, and the way to do it at the lowest cost --
   and the most fun -- is by using Amateur Radio. Therefore, the Amateur
   Radio operator is a "spark plug" who makes a lot of the good stuff
   happen!

   This partnering is a wonderful activity for Amateur Radio clubs that
   list "help for newcomers" as one of their services. For schools looking
   for such a club, please go to the first link under Amateur Radio on the
   SimSat Related Stuff page or contact the American Radio Relay League,
   Newington, CT.

   This program is in a development stage. Blueprints are being drafted.
   Hardware is under construction. FAA coordination is happening. A
   handbook is being written; a SimSat CD is being produced. Seeds are
   being planted to allow this to "scale" to schools in the NASA Goddard
   northeast USA region and beyond.

  Schedule

   The first of two engineering test flights is to be scheduled. Get the
   latest schedule from the SimSat e-mail list, or go to the SimSat Flight
   News Bulletins through the link given below.

   Amateur Radio operators and students are invited to copy the telemetry
   from home or classroom. The telemetry format will follow that of the
   MIM module. (See "MIM" link on the SimSat Related Stuff page.) The
   radio frequency of the telemetry channel will be announced before the
   flight. Watch events unfold on the SimSat e-mail list.
