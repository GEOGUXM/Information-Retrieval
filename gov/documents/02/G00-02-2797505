                Blue Ball On July 2, 2001, BALCA issued a decision in
                Martin Kaplan, 2000-INA-23 (BALCA July 2, 2001) (en banc),
                holding that cooking specialization requirements for
                domestic cooks are unduly restrictive within the meaning
                of 20 C.F.R. § 656.21(b)(2), and therefore must be
                justified by business necessity. [more...]
                Blue Ball In M.N. Auto Electric Corp., 2000-INA-165 (BALCA
                Aug. 8, 2001) (en banc), the Board held that the standard
                for documenting good faith efforts to contact U.S.
                applicants is reasonable efforts to contact the U.S.
                applicants, and not proof of actual contact. Accordingly,
                the Board held that a CO cannot require an employer to use
                certified mail, return receipt requested, when contacting
                applicants by mail. [more...]

   OALJ Archive
   The OALJ Archive is a repository of electronic slip opinions. Access to
   the OALJ Archive is provided in three ways:

   (1) FULL-TEXT SEARCH
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Availability: most ALJ decisions issued from the fall of 1996 to date]
   [Black Lung Archive_________] ____________________ Search

   Note: Word processing documents returned through a full-text search
   loose some of the formatting of the original document. To obtain the
   original word processing format, you must use directory browsing or a
   DMS search.

   (2) DMS SEARCH
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Availability: Search results will soon link directly to electronic
   slip opinions issued on or after November 1, 2000; however, at present
   not all data has been linked to the system. DMS search may also be
   helpful for finding older decisions if you do not know the ALJ case
   number; however, links to older decisions are indirect. If you
   experience problems using DMS Search, you may need to upgrade to a
   newer version of your web browser (e.g., 5.x or Netscape 6)]

   Users unfamiliar with this system are encouraged to use the main DMS
   Search Page, where help is provided. Experienced users may use the
   search fields below.

   Additional information: Electronic slip opinions do not constitute an
   official, reported decision. At present, only ALJ decisions are
   included in this archive. For reported ALJ, ARB, and Secretary of Labor
   decisions in electronic format, refer to the materials in the OALJ Law
   Library above. Opinions issued in longshore cases are withheld from the
   OALJ web site for 30-days to permit District Director to effect service
   of the decisions (see 20 C.F.R.§ 702.349). In case of discrepancies
   between the print and electronic slip opinions, the print version
   controls.
