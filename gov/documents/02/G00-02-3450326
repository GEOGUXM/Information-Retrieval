   Welcome to Invasivespecies.gov!

   Invasivespecies.gov is the gateway to Federal efforts concerning
   invasive species. On this site you can learn about the impacts of
   invasive species and the Federal government's response, as well as read
   select species profiles and find links to agencies and organizations
   dealing with invasive species issues. Invasivespecies.gov is also the
   website for the National Invasive Species Council, which coordinates
   Federal responses to the problem.

   What is an Invasive Species?

   An "invasive species" is defined as a species that is 1) non-native (or
   alien) to the ecosystem under consideration and 2) whose introduction
   causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to
   human health. (Executive Order 13112).

   Invasive species can be plants, animals, and other organisms (e.g.,
   microbes). Human actions are the primary means of invasive species
   introductions.
