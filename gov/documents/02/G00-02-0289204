              Welcome to the NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility

     White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) is a preeminent resource for
     testing and evaluating potentially hazardous materials, space flight
     components, and rocket propulsion systems. These services are
     available to NASA, the Department of Defense, other federal
     agencies, universities, and commercial industry.

             Rocket Propulsion
             The primary mission of WSTF is to support NASA's Space Shuttle and
             Space Station Programs. We support these and other Government and
             commercial efforts. As the official Johnson Space Center (JSC)
             Propulsion Systems Development Facility, our rocket propulsion
             program is a leader in propulsion systems testing, with unique test
             expertise in hypergolic propellant handling and training, and is the
             Shuttle Fleet Leader for testing orbital maneuvering and reaction
             control subsystems.

     Chemical and Physical Properties of Materials
     Our engineers, chemists, and scientists in WSTF state-of-the-art
     laboratories conduct testing of hazardous materials and propellants,
     air quality, aerospace hardware and ground support equipment, and
     all materials used in space flight. We routinely perform Standard
     Testing for ASTM and NASA, as well as ignition and flammability
     testing. We continually seek to better understand and improve
     materials, components, and systems, and to ensure safety during
     manned space flights.

              Hazards Assessment
              Hazards assessment is a large part of what we do for NASA, the
              Department of Defense, aerospace, and other areas of industry. Our
              laboratory facilities conduct hazardous fluid assessment,
              hypervelocity tests, and explosive hazard assessment. The High
              Energy Blast Facility performs explosive testing with solid,
              cryogenic, hypergolic propellants, and other high explosives.

     Oxygen Systems
     Oxygen compatibility is a critical issue in space, aircraft,
     medical, and industrial applications. At WSTF, we investigate the
     effects of increased oxygen concentration on the ignition and
     burning of materials and components used in these applications.
     Hazards analyses are performed on materials, components, and
     systems; and failure analyses determine the cause of fires. Training
     courses about design and operation of safe oxygen systems are
     provided by WSTF personnel under the auspices of ASTM.

     Space Flight Hardware
     The Propulsion Component Test Facility at WSTF is an Orbiter and
     International Space Station Depot Repair Facility. We perform flight
     hardware assembly, repair, and acceptance testing for private
     aerospace manufacturers, as well. We refurbish hypergolic propellant
     components for the Space Shuttle, handle advanced pyrovalve testing
     at two of our laboratory facilities, and perform failure
     investigations.

  Launch and Landing Support
  White Sands Space Harbor (WSSH) is the primary training area for
  Space Shuttle pilots flying practice approaches and landings in the
  shuttle-training aircraft and T-38 aircraft. Our runways,
  navigational aids, runway lighting, and control facilities
  continuously stand ready as a backup Shuttle landing site.
