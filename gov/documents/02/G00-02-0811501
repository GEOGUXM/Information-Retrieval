    The Ocean is vital to life on earth. From the life-giving rain that
    nourishes crops, to life-saving medicines; from the fish that come
    from the ocean floor, to the goods that are transported on the sea's
    surface - the ocean plays a role in your life in some way every day.

    In recognition of the importance of the marine environment, the
    United Nations has declared 1998 the International Year of the Ocean
    (YOTO). This designation provides individual organizations and
    governments with an important opportunity to raise public awareness
    and understanding of the ocean and related issues.

    The United States is participating in YOTO activities through the
    Ocean Principals Group, an informal group of federal agencies with
    ocean interests.
