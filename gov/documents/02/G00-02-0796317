   Technical Activities

   During FY01, the Ceramics Division conducted research in advanced
   engine materials, combinatorial methods, data evaluation and delivery,
   materials for magnetic data storage, materials for microelectronics,
   materials for wireless communications, powder measurements, X-ray
   characterization, and other areas. To learn more about these research
   activities, please see the Ceramics Division Annual Report Ceramics

   Report
      NIST SP 960-3 The "NIST Recommended Practice Guide on the Use of
      Nomenclature in Dispersion Science & Technology" (NIST SP 960-3)
        This 64-page document deals with the terminology of dispersed
   particulate systems, along with their associated properties, components
   and measurements. Prepared as a desk-reference for researchers, process
        engineers, technicians and students, it covers topics such as
      agglomeration, colloidal stability, interfacial & electrokinetic
                          properties, and rheology.

    The "NIST Recommended Practice Guide Particle Size Characterization"
                               (NIST SP 960-1)
     The uniqueness of this 165-page document lies in its integration of
   critical aspects of particle size characterization. Designed primarily
    for non-expert users in the ceramics community, it addresses sieving,
     laser light scattering, gravitational sedimentation and microscopy
                                 techniques.

    MatML Workshop Report NISTIR 6785, MatML - Materials Markup Language
   Workshop Report is now available. This international workshop was held
    at NIST during 26-27 June 2001 to address the technical and strategic
   future of MatML, which is an application of XML for materials property
    data. More information may be found at the MatML site, including the
