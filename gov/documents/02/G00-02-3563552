   Our Mission
   The Office of Inspector General serves the American Worker and Taxpayer
   by conducting audits, investigations, and evaluations that result in
   improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of
   Departmental programs and operations. We detect and prevent fraud and
   abuse in DOL programs and labor racketeering in the American workplace.
   We provide advice to the Secretary and the Congress on how to attain
   the highest possible program performance.

   OIG's Vision Statement
   To be widely recognized in the Department and the Congress for
   providing timely, quality, and useful information, recommendations, and
   technical assistance that improve key programs and operations of the
   Department of Labor. To make a significant and positive impact on the
   Government's effort to control the influence of organized crime and
   reduce labor racketeering in the workplace.
   From a management perspective, to create and foster an organizational
   culture of employee respect, acceptance and inclusion in which OIG
   employees believe they are valued, believe their ideas have merit, and
   know their talents are fully utilized.
