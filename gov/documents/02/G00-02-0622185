   Air Traffic Control

   Dr. Heinz Erzberger

   The Center-TRACON Automation System, or CTAS, is a set of tools
   designed to help air traffic controllers manage the increasingly
   complex air traffic flows at large airports. The tools in CTAS benefit
   air traffic controllers by reducing stress and workload, and benefit
   air travelers by reducing delays and increasing safety.

   CTAS is more than a set of tools. By combining the skill of controllers
   with computer generated advisories, the CTAS environment inaugurates a
   new approach to air traffic control, referred to as human-centered
   automation. In human-centered automation, controllers increase both
   their effectiveness to manage complex traffic situations and their
   awareness of the evolving traffic situation, while retaining their
   traditional responsibilities for control and safety.

   CTAS was conceived and is being prototyped at the NASA Ames Research
   Center. In 1991 it was chosen by the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA) as the future automation system for the terminal area. In a
   unique design process, scientists, engineers, and controllers combined
   their talents to create the algorithms, software and human interfaces
   in CTAS, fashioning them into tools that controllers can use
   effectively to solve complex traffic problems.

   What are the fundamental technical innovations that make CTAS work?
   First and foremost is a technique for computing and predicting aircraft
   trajectories with high accuracy in real time. In CTAS, this technique
   is embodied in a large and complex software algorithm referred to as
   the trajectory synthesizer. Second is an algorithm for scheduling
   aircraft to land at runways with the least possible delay. Third are
   methods for communicating between CTAS and controllers through special
   graphical interfaces. These three innovations--together with radar
   tracks and weather data--are brought together in a complex real time
   software system that generates CTAS information.

   The development of CTAS should not be confused with FAA's ongoing
   effort to replace the obsolete and failure-prone infrastructure of the
   current air traffic control system. While that effort is independent of
   the CTAS development, the new infrastructure, especially color display
   consoles for controllers, will be highly beneficial for implementing
   advanced CTAS tools still in laboratory development.

   CTAS is a work in progress. NASA and FAA are installing prototype CTAS
   tools in several stages at air traffic control facilities serving the
   Denver and Dallas/Fort Worth airports. At these sites, CTAS tools are
   being evaluated by controllers who are using them in the management of
   arrival traffic. All three major tool sets in CTAS, which are the
   Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), Descent Advisor (DA), and Final
   Approach Spacing Tool (FAST), have undergone initial field evaluation
   at these airports. However, much additional field testing, as well as
   laboratory development, must still be done before the full potential of
   CTAS is realized.

   This CTAS Home Page will keep you informed with up-to-date information
   on news items, progress reports, and technical developments concerning
   CTAS research and technology.
