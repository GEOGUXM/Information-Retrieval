   The InterPlanetary Network Progress Report, published by the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory, reports principally on activities of the
   InterPlanetary Network and Information Systems Directorate (IPN-ISD) in
   planning, research, technology development, implementation, and
   operations in the areas of network, communications, navigation,
   information systems, Deep Space Network (DSN) science, mission support,
   communication standards, protocols, and spectrum engineering. Tasks
   funded by the JPL Director's Research Discretionary Fund and the
   Caltech President's Fund that involve the IPN-ISD are also included.
