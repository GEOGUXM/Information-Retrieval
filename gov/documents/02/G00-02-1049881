     The Bethesda 2001 Workshop, held April 30 - May 2, 2001, reviewed
   issues regarding terminology and reporting of cervical cytology. Over
   400 cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, clinicians, and patient
   advocates participated. Forty-five professional societies, including
   over 20 countries, sent representatives. Nine forum group sessions
   covered topics including: specimen adequacy, non-neoplastic changes,
   ASCUS, AGUS, ancillary testing, endometrial cells, SIL, automated
   computer review, and recommendations. The meeting was characterized by
   energetic exchange of opinions and productive discussions.
   The nine forum groups have now revised their recommendations based on
   the Workshop discussions. Post-Workshop Recommendations may be
   downloaded. A table of FINAL Bethesda 2001 Terminology reflects these
   recommendations.
   The final round of dicussions on the Bethesda Bulletin Board is now
   closed. However you can still view past dicussion threads by visiting
   the BULLETIN BOARD ARCHIVES.
