   [bullet.gif]  kinky superconductors

   [vibration-thumb.jpg]

   Researchers working at the Advanced Light Source have discovered, in
   three different families of high-temperature superconductors, "kinks"
   in the energy spectrum of low-energy electrons  the signature of
   coupling between electrons and phonons. Electron-phonon coupling
   accounts for low-temperature superconductivity in metals and alloys,
   but most scientists did not expect to find it in high-temperature,
   copper-oxide superconductors.

   [bullet.gif] comparative genomics at the JGI: an interview

   [urochordata-thumb.gif]

   Mice, puffer fish, sea squirts: what do these creatures have to do with
   humans? To find out why scientists are comparing their genomes  and
   those of many other creatures  Science Beat interviewed Trevor
   Hawkins, director of the Joint Genome Institute; Paul Richardson, JGI's
   head of functional genomics; and Dan Rokhsar, JGI's head of
   computational genomics.

   [bullet.gif] challenging the standard model of physics

   [z-decay-thumb.jpg]
   Z particles carry the weak nuclear force, and the measurement of their
   decay spells trouble for the theory that has successfully explained
   fundamental physics since the 1970s. A Berkeley Lab theorist argues
   that whether scientists accept the measurement as valid or dismiss it
   as an anomaly, the Standard Model loses. [pixel.gif]

   Researchers have found the strongest evidence to date that atomic
   nuclei undergo "phase transitions," changing from a liquid to a vapor
   state.

   The architecture of a water channel protein reveals how it can quickly
   transport water through the cell membrane while blocking everything
   else.

   Two proteins that construct "silent" regions of chromosomes also help
   build the special structures cell need for accurate chromosome copying
   during cell division.
