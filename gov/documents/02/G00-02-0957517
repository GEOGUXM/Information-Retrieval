   Several quantitative products are routinely generated from polar
   satellites.

   The NOAA (civilian) satellites provide measurements from the RTOVS,
   onboard NOAA-11 and NOAA-14, which is comprised of the HIRS/2, MSU and
   SSU sounder instruments. The new Sounding system, ATOVS, uses NOAA-15
   radiance data from the new instruments, HIRS/3 and AMSU-A.

   The DMSP (Defense) satellites provide measurements from the SSM/T1,
   onboard the F13 satellite, and the SSM/T2 onboard the F14 satellite
   only.

                          Who we are and what we do

   A brief overview of FPDT is available

   FPDT supports implementation of all soundings systems for several
   satellites, including RTOVS (NOAA), DMSP and GOES for operations in the
   Product Systems Branch of the Information Products Division

   To learn about some of the science behind the data from the
   polar-orbiting satellites, check out the POES Status Report
