                               Best Practices:
     Strategies for Recruiting, Hiring, and Retaining Hispanic and Other
                            Minority Populations

   The concept of equal treatment and nondiscrimination under the law
   applies not only to PSC employees and the employees of the Department
   of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and applicants for employment, but
   also to the population we serve as employees of the Department and to
   the people with whom we do business.
   The structure of our OEEO is typical of most federal EEO offices in
   that it consists of 3 basic programs. These are:
     *      The affirmative employment program
     *      The special emphasis/diversity programs
     *      The discrimination complaints program

   The affirmative employment program encourages and assists the agency in
   voluntarily taking affirmative steps to correct the effects of past
   discrimination and preventing present and future discrimination without
   resorting to litigation or other formal governmental action. This
   program also deals with the DHHS and PSC goal of having a fully
   representative workforce which includes members of all racial and
   ethnic groups as well as people with disabilities.
   The special emphasis/diversity programs are designed to deal with the
   special needs of particular groups and to foster a working environment
   in which employees treat each other with respect and dignity and value
   the differences in backgrounds that each employee brings to the
   workplace. These programs may include the Hispanic Employment Program,
   the Federal Women's Program, and the People with Disabilities Program.
   Also included, but more informally organized are programs that deal
   with the concerns of African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific
   Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.
   The discrimination complaints program seeks to identify and eliminate
   discriminatory policies and practices from the workforce based on race,
   national origin, color, sex, age, religion, disability, sexual
   orientation and/or reprisal. This program promotes the early resolution
   of complaints of discrimination, and provides for the prompt, fair and
   impartial processing of discrimination complains.
   The common thread joining these programs is that they focus on the
   human resources of the PSC. These programs strive to eradicate every
   form of prejudice and discrimination in the work place as well as to
   afford equal treatment and opportunities for employees and applicants
   to enable them to develop successful careers with the Federal
   Government.

   PSC EEO VISION:
   The vision of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO) is to
   achieve a workplace free from discrimination and harassment where every
   employee is valued for his/her unique contribution towards achieving
   the PSC's goals.
   PSC EEO MISSION:
   The mission of the OEEO is to:
     * Promote and ensure equal opportunity for all employees and foster
       an agency culture and environment free from discrimination.
     * Work in partnership with management and employees to create and
       implement innovative and effective affirmative employment programs
       and dispute resolution processes.
     * Ensure full utilization of a diverse workforce in carrying out the
       PSC business plan and provide quality and timely services to its
       customers.
