                                NASA aircraft

   The Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL3) is a remote sensing instrument
   carried onboard several different types of aircraft usually a NOAA Twin
   Otter or NASA P-3B or C-130 aircraft. The AOL platform incorporates
   several sensors including dual wavelength active laser fluorosensor,
   several passive down and up looking spectrometers, and a thermal
   infrared temperature sensor.

   The Airborne Topographic Mapper is a scanning laser altimeter which has
   flown on the NASA P-3B aircraft and on several Twin Otters. The ATM
   platform incorporates the laser altimeter, GPS data, and inertial
   navigation packages.

   Airborne Oceanographic Lidar

          The NASA AOL3 conducts oceanographic research on a worldwide
          scale. The AOL is usually installed onboard a twin engine Otter
          aircraft, but it has also flown onboard the NASA P-3 and NASA
          C-130 aircraft The AOL3 conducts ocean color studies over a
          number of different coastal and oceanic regions.

   Airborne Topographic Mapper

          The ATM continues to support several earth science applications.
          It has been measuring changes in the arctic annually since 1991.
          Studies of coastal morphology in the U.S. are continuing with
          our partners at NOAA and USGS.
