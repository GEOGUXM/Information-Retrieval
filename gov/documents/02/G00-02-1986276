   Between January 1, 2000 and July 2, 2001 this NDEAA webhub had
   1,000,007 (crossed the one million) total hits with 87,082 unique hits
   and till Sept. 3, 2001 it crossed the one hundred thousand (100,006)
   unique hits.

   The NDE and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) Technologies activity was
   established at JPL in May 1991 by Dr. Yoseph Bar-Cohen. The NDEAA lab
   is involved with innovation and technology transfer to space, medical
   and other fields. NDEAA is one of two major R&D thrusts of the JPL's
   Mechanical and Robotics Technologies Group (Dr. Paul S. Schenker,
   Supervisor), with diverse ties to multiple NASA centers and interagency
   programs. The NDEAA lab staff are Dr. Xiaoqi Bao, Dr. Zensheu Chang,
   Dr. Benjamin Dolgin, Dr. Shyh-Shiuh Lih (part time with NDEAA), and Dr.
   Stewart Sherrit.
