   The U.S. electric power system is in the midst of a fundamental
   transition from a centrally planned and utility-controlled structure to
   one that will depend on competitive market forces for investment,
   operations, and reliability management. Electric system operators are
   being challenged to maintain reliability levels needed for the digital
   economy in the face of changing industry structure and evolving market
   rules. The economic growth of the Nation is tied ever closer to the
   availability of reliable electric service. New technologies are needed
   to prevent major grid outages as experienced in the Western grid on
   August 10, 1996, which left 12 million customers without electricity
   for up to 8 hours and cost an estimated $2 billion.

   The Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS)
   was formed in 1999 to research, develop, and disseminate new methods,
   tools, and technologies to protect and enhance the reliability of the
   U.S. electric power system in the transition to a competitive
   electricity market structure.

   CERTS is conducting public-interest electricity reliability research in
   four areas:
     * Real-Time Grid Operations and Reliability Management
     * Reliability and Markets
     * Distributed Energy Resources Integration
     * Reliability Technology Issues and Needs Assessment
