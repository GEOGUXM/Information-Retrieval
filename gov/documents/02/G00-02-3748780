                      Geographic Names Information System
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), developed by the USGS
   in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN), contains
   information about almost 2 million physical and cultural geographic
   features in the United States. The Federally recognized name of each
   feature described in the data base is identified, and references are
   made to a feature's location by State, county, and geographic
   coordinates. The GNIS is our Nation's official repository of domestic
   geographic names information. Information about foreign geographic
   feature names can be obtained from the GEOnet Names Server, developed
   and maintained by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency.

   The Antarctica Geographic Names Data Base contains geographic names in
   Antarctica which are approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names for
   use by the Federal Government.
