                                 What's New

   The Request for Proposal was released to the vendor community on
   November 2, 1999.
   The project is currently in the procurement process. Below are the four
   phases of the process:
     * Conceptual Proposal Submittal/Discussions
       During this phase, the supplier provides a general concept of the
       proposed solution in sufficient detail for the State to determine
       if the supplier understands the business needs of the State and the
       requirements as defined in the RFP.
     * Draft Proposal Submittal/Discussions
       The objective of the Draft Proposal is to provide the State with a
       complete proposal (except for cost data) prior to Final Proposal
       submission. It allows the State and the vendor to interact so that
       the vendor can receive critical feedback necessary in developing
       the best Final Proposal possible.
     * Demonstrations
       After Draft Proposal discussions, participating vendors present
       script-based software product demonstrations. The scripts, created
       by the business team, are a series of events that emulate real
       business conditions.
     * Final Proposal/Cost Submittal
       The purpose of the Final Proposal is to provide the State with a
       complete proposal, including cost data, for a complete solution.

   The project is still on target for a December, 2000 contract award.
