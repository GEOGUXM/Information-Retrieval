   15 June 2001: Magnetospheric Constellation Mission STDT Report Released
   A report on the Magnetospheric Constellation: Dynamic Response and
   Coupling Observatory (DRACO) has been in preparation for the past two
   years, and is now complete and available online. Either hard copy or
   electronic versions can be requested at the link above. The hard copy
   version comes with a short introductory movie on CD-ROM, and an
   animated card that illustrates one possible form of magnetotail
   dynamics that requires a constellation approach for definitive study. A
   much more revealing movie of this simulated magnetotail behavior can be
   downloaded from the report site. MC-DRACO is an approved mission of the
   Solar Terrestrial Probes Program of the NASA Sun Earth Connections
   Theme, and has been studied and defined by a NASA-appointed Science and
   Technology Definition Team, as identified in the report.

   April 2001: IMAGE Mission Featured in Scientific American
   The Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)
   mission (see link at left) is the subject of a feature article in the
   April 01 Scientific American. A paper by PI Jim Burch describes space
   storms and the pioneering new observations of space weather made by
   IMAGE. Please visit the IMAGE site for more information about this
   exciting mission.

   26 January 2001: IMAGE Mission Featured in Science
   The Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)
   mission (see link at left) is a cover story in Science magazine this
   month. A paper by PI Jim Burch et al. chronicles the pioneering new
   observations of space weather made by IMAGE. Never before have we been
   able to see the plasma clouds swirling around the earth as they form
   and dissipate during geospace storms. This first publication on IMAGE
   results features images of the cold plasmas in scattered extreme
   ultraviolet sunlight, and the hot plasmas of the ring current in
   energetic neutral atom glow, as shown in the linked image. On the left
   is a blue EUV image showing formation of a spiral plasma tail on the
   left side of the plasmasphere, around the Earth. The plasmasphere
   temperature is around 5000째C or 9000째F. On the right is an image of the
   "ring" of hot plasma just outside the plasmasphere, carrying electrical
   current around the Earth. The temperature of the ring current is about
   1 Billion 째C or 1.8 Billion 째F. Of course, these images don't do
   justice to the dynamic behavior of these two important plasma regions
   near the Earth. Please visit the IMAGE site for more information about
   this exciting mission.
