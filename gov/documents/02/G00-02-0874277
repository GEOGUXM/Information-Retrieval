                       Property Tax Information System

   Information from the City of Chattanooga's property tax database is now
   available online, via the World Wide Web. Though this information has
   always been a matter of public record, it has not in the past been
   readily accessible. The City of Chattanooga is pleased to now be able
   to present this information to our citizens in this manner. Most
   questions can be answered by looking at our Property Tax Frequently
   Asked Questions. For more information call 423-757-5191
