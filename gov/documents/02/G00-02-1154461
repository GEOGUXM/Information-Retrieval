   As we enter this new legislative session, I remain as committed as ever
   before to work to deliver for South Dakota. My first legislative
   priority is to pass an economic recovery plan and get the American
   economy moving. Too many South Dakotans and people all across America
   are hurting for there to be any more delay. There has been far too much
   bickering on this issue, as both sides have priorities on which they do
   not want to compromise. But I think it is time for compromise and time
   for action, so this week I proposed a plan on which both sides should
   agree.

   I propose that we break the impasse on economic recovery legislation by
   adopting a non-partisan, common-sense approach: lets immediately pass
   what we agree on, and keep working to find common ground in the areas
   where we still disagree.
