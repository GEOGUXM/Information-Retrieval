   Computer Forensics Guidance
   Introduction
   NIST's Information Technology Laboratory has two ongoing research projects in
   computer forensics: the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) project
   and the Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project. Funded through NIST's
   Office of Law
   Enforcement Standards (OLES) by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the
   Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Defense Computer
   Forensics Laboratory (DCFL), the Department of Justice's Technical Support
   Working Group (TSWG), and NIST, these projects are designed to provide
   research into the efficient and effective use of information technology
   applied to computer forensics.
   The NSRL provides a set of reference data that can........

                                    CSD News:
        * January 28, 2002 -- The NIST draft publication of the System
          Administration Guidance for Windows 2000 Professional is now
          available for public comment. The document is intended to assist
          the users and system administrators of Windows 2000 Professional
          systems in configuring their hosts by providing configuration
          templates and security checklists. The document introduces secure
          configuration recommendations for setting up some popular Windows
          applications, such as Symantec Norton AntiVirus, Network Associates
          McAfee, and F-Secure Anti-Virus virus scanners, Microsoft IE and
          Netscape Communicator web browsers, Microsoft Outlook and Eudora
          e-mail clients, and Microsoft Office 2000 Professional productivity
          software. Comments and questions are requested by March 1, 2002 and
          may be addressed to itsec@nist.gov.
        * January 15, 2002 -- The draft NIST recommendation Use of the CVE
          Vulnerability Naming Scheme Within its Acquired Products and
          Information Technology Security Procedures advises agencies on the
          use of the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability
          naming scheme. It recommends that agencies give substantial
          consideration to buying products and services compatible with the
          CVE naming scheme. The recommendation also advises agencies to
          periodically monitor their systems for vulnerabilities listed in
          the CVE vulnerability naming scheme. Agencies are also advised to
          use the CVE naming scheme in their communications and descriptions
          of vulnerabilities. You are invited to submit any comments you may
          have to both Peter Mell and Timothy Grance at peter.mell@nist.gov
          and timothy.grance@nist.gov by February 18, 2002.
        * January 15, 2002 -- The draft NIST Special Publication 800-34,
          "Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems" is
          available for public comment. The document provides instructions,
          recommendations, and considerations for government IT contingency
          planning. The information presented in this document addresses
          seven IT platform types and defines a seven-step contingency
          process that an agency may apply to develop and maintain a viable
          contingency planning program for their IT systems. The seven steps
          are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system
          development life cycle. Please provide any comments to Marianne
          Swanson at marianne.swanson@nist.gov by February 15, 2002.

        * January 4, 2002 -- NIST is pleased to announce Special Publication
          800-41, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy. This document
          contains an overview of recent developments in firewall technology,
          and guidance on configuring firewall environments. It discusses
          firewall access control, active content filtering, DMZs, and
          co-location with VPNs, web and email servers, and intrusion
          detection. It contains guidance on developing firewall policy and
          recommendations for administering firewalls. Lastly, it contains
          several appendices with links to other firewall-related resources
          and recommendations for configuring and operating firewalls.

        * December 14, 2001 -- NIST has recently developed the draft NIST
          Special Publication Security for Telecommuting and Broadband
          Communications. This document is intended to assist those
          responsible users, system administrators, and management for
          telecommuting security, by providing introductory information about
          broadband communication security and policy, security of home
          office systems, and considerations for system administrators in the
          central office. It addresses concepts relating to the selection,
          deployment, and management of broadband communications for a
          telecommuting user. We would greatly appreciate receiving any
          comments you may have! Please provide them directly to Rick Kuhn by
          January 18, 2002.
        * December 14, 2001 -- The draft Guide for Interconnecting
          Information Systems is available for public comment. The document
          provides guidance for planning, establishing, maintaining, and
          terminating interconnections between information systems that are
          owned and operated by different organizations. We seek your
          comments and suggestions. We especially seek your comments on the
          steps for planning and establishing an interconnection, based on
          readers' experiences. Furthermore, we are interested in receiving
          comments on the memorandum of understanding/agreement development
          guide contained in the document. Please address your comments to
          Timothy Grance and Joan Hash by January 18, 2002.
