   The May 22-23 California-Baja California Border Region Tour is full!
   The fall tour will be announced soon.

   The mission of the California-Baja California Border Environmental
   Program is to work towards a better environment within our shared
   border by identifying and resolving unique environmental and natural
   resource challenges and the resulting public health issues.

   This mission will be achieved through the use of science and
   technology, uniform enforcement of environmental laws and regulations,
   and the cooperation and active participation of the various California
   Border Indian Tribal Nations, academia, industry, nongovernmental
   organizations, and the public.
