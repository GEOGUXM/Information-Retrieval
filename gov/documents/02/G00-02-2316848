                   Welcome to the Optometry Practice Home Page!

      Indian Health Service (IHS) optometrists practice in a
      multi-disciplinary environment where they are able to practice full
      scope optometric care. Optometrists are credentialed at a level
      commensurate with their training and experience, and are normally a
      full voting member of the medical staff. Emphasis is on primary care,
      diagnosis and treatment of ocular disease, and population based public
      health programs. In some locations, where resources allow, contact lens
      and low vision services are provided.

      As part of the health care team in a hospital or clinic setting,
      optometrists have access to the entire patient record including
      laboratory results, immunization status, past medical history, current
      findings and medications, etc., and are able to fully assess the
      relationship between the patients' general health status and their
      ocular conditions. Consultation with physicians, pharmacists,
      nutritionists, and other disciplines are a routine part of IHS
      optometric practice. In-house laboratory, radiological, and pharmacy
      services are available for the optometrists use.

      The unique cultural experience of working with various Indian Tribes in
      some of the most scenic geographical locations in the nation, combined
      with the ability to practice in a professional setting provide an
      exciting and challenging experience.
