                    Software Assurance Technology Center

   The Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) was established in 1992
   in the Systems Reliability and Safety Office at NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center (GSFC). The SATC was founded to become a NASA center of
   excellence in software assurance, dedicated to making measurable
   improvement in the quality and reliability of software developed for
   GSFC and NASA. Funding for the SATC comes from the NASA Software IV&V
   Facility in Fairmont, WV for technical and research tasks, and from
   NASA software development projects for direct technical support.

   The SATC has programs in the primary technical areas shown on the left.
