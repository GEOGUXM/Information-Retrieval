      Welcome to the home page for photoemission and infrared spectroscopy at
      Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The Electron Spectroscopy Group in
      Department of Physics is composed of two main areas: photoemission and
      infrared physics.  Both of these programs are oriented around the
      transport properties of "bad metals", and in particular the
      high-temperature cuprate superconductors, as well as other transition
      metal oxides. The  experiments on the infrared optical properties of
      solids are conducted on a Bruker IFS113v Fourier transform infrared
      (FTIR) interferometer in the Department of Physics and on a Bruker
      IFS66v/S FTIR instrument at the U10A beamline at the National
      Synchrotron Light Source, where various probes have been built to
      measure the transmission or the absolute reflectance of solids or thin
      films.  In addition, a Bruker IFS113v is used as an "off-line"
      instrument to bench-test optics and to perform routine spectroscopy.
