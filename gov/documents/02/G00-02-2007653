   MiniMax: A Test/Experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron.
     __________________________________________________________________

   MiniMax is an experiment to search for disoriented chiral condensates
   (DCCs) in proton/anti-proton collisions of 1.8TeV in the far forward
   region. It is a small collider experiment situated at the C0
   interaction region of the Tevatron and has been designed to measure the
   ratio of charged to neutral pions produced at pseudo-rapidities near
   4.1. The distribution of this ratio is expected to be very different
   for the generic binomial and DCC particle production models. The DCC
   model has been used to describe Centauro events seen in high energy
   cosmic ray experiments.
