   Economy) is a bipartisan, independent body whose function is to promote
   efficiency, effectiveness and economy in state programs.
   As the state's independent external auditor, the California State
   Auditor provides independent, nonpartisan, accurate, and timely
   assessments of California government's financial and operational
   activities in compliance with generally accepted government auditing
   standards.
