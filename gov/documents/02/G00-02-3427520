   * Review Draft Directives using RevCom 3.0
   (for directives posted on RevCom prior to January 7, 2002)
   * Review Draft Directives using RevCom 4.0
   (for directives posted on RevCom after
   January 7, 2002)

   What is RevCom?
   The Review and Comment (RevCom) System is the Department of Energy
   (DOE) coordination system for the development of administrative
   directives. Employees of DOE and DOE prime contractors may use the
   system to comment on draft directives.
   The system makes it easy for everyone affected by a DOE Directive to
   voice their opinion. It is a solution that preserves your unique
   organization identity and enables you to create and interact with - not
   just observe - information.
   The system was released for the first time for use in January 2000.
   Since then the organizational structure, and other needed improvements
   to the system prompted the latest release of RevCom 4.0. The earlier
   release (RevCom 3.0) will be phased out as draft directive documents
   get published on the directives web site.

   RevCom Notice
   It is DOE policy to maintain RevCom as a system that is open for public
   inspection. EMPLOYEES WHO USE THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE COMMENTS SHOULD BE
   AWARE THAT THEIR COMMENTS ARE ACCESSIBLE (READ ONLY) TO ANY MEMBER OF
   THE PUBLIC WHO LOGS INTO REVCOM.
   How does it work?
   When a DOE directive writer creates the draft of a new or modified
   directive it is posted to RevCom. An email notice goes to everyone
   registered in the system. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) then enter
   their comments on the draft on-line and send them to the appropriate
   DOE Directives Point of Contact (DPC) in headquarters, field, and site
   levels. The directive writer then responds to comments, and once the
   issues have been resolved, publishes the final directive.

   message to dmteam@hq.doe.gov.
