Our Mission:

   The SEWPSC conducts user/consumer-focused evaluation of GOTS, COTS and
   open-source information system security products in an integrated
   laboratory test environment to provide comparative product analysis as
   a service to NASA/SEWPSC customers.

Our Goal:

   Provide a service that helps federal government consumers select the
   most appropriate IT security products that best meet the range of their
   requirements and constraints.
