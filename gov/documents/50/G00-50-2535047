   Views of Kodiak Star at the Alaska Kodiak Island Launch Complex located
       approximately 41 miles south of the city of Kodiak. Kodiak Star
     launched 9/29/01 at 10:40pm EDT (2:40 GMT 9/30/01) aboard a 3 stage
     Lockheed-Martin Athena-I rocket. The launch attempt of 9/21/01 was
     posponed due to weather concerns. The launch attempt of 9/22/01 was
       scrubbed due to a downrange tracking problem and weather at the
       downrange tracking sites foiled a launch attempt on 9/23/01. On
   9/24/01, a solar flare sent a stream of charged particles that exceeded
   limits set for the Athena's guidance system. The launch was rescheduled
                         to no earlier than 9/29/01.

      Kodiak Star is the first launch from the Kodiak Launch Complex on
    Kodiak Island in Alaska. The mission will carry four satellites into
     Earth orbit, the NASA sponsored Starshine 3 and three Department of
   Defense Space Test Program (STP) payloads PICOSat, PCSat, and Sapphire.
     The STP satellites will be placed into a 497 mile (800km) orbit and
    Starshine-3 will be released at an altitude of 310 miles (500km) and
                           67-degree inclination.

   Starshine-3 is built by the Rocky Mountain NASA Space Grant Consortium
   and the Naval Research Laboratory. It weighs 220 pounds and consists of
    1500 aluminum mirrors that are one inch in diameter polished by over
       40,000 students in 22 countries. Starshine-3 data will provide
   scientists with knowledge about how the Earth's upper atmosphere reacts
     to fluctuations in the sun's ultraviolet radiation during a sunspot
                                   cycle.

    PICOSat is built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. in Guildford, UK
       and will carry a Polymer Battery Experiment (PBEX), Ionosphere
   Occultation Experiment (IOX), Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomagraphy
                  (CERTO) and Ultra-Quiet Platform (OPPEX).

      The Prototype Communications Satellite (PCSat) is the first in an
     intended line of experimental satellites designed, constructed and
    tested by midshipmen of the US Naval Academy. PCSat is to serve as a
    positition status reporting and message communications satellite and
    will augment the existing Amateur Radio Automatic Position Reporting
                          System (APRS) satellite.

      The Sapphire satellite was built by the Space Systems Development
      Laboratory of Stanford University . Sapphire will carry a Beacon
       Monitoring Experiment, a Tunneling Horizon Detector and a voice
   synthesizer microchip that will speak to listerners over amateur radio
                                frequencies.
