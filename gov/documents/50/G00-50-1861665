     * DWOPER - An enhanced version of the dynamic wave model has been
       calibrated for the lower Columbia River. This model provides
       forecasts at several points along the Columbia, Willamette, Lewis,
       and Cowlitz Rivers. DWOPER provides vital navigational information
       about rivers stages, taking into account releases from Bonneville
       Reservoir and ocean tides. Completion date: fall 1998.

     * NWSRFS - The NWRFC is converting short-range realtime forecasting
       models from the Streamflow Synthesis and Reservoir Regulation
       (SSARR) models to the National Weather Service River Forecast
       System (NWSRFS). This effort will take advantage of current and
       future updates in technology the National Weather Service is
       making. NWSRFS will provide continuous year-round streamflow
       forecast and long-range probabilistic streamflow predictions. We
       have current calibrated all of Western Washington and Oregon and
       have begun to move into the upward reaches of the Columbia River.
       Completion date: of calibrations is expected to take 3-4 years.

     * ESP - Extended Streamflow Predictions forecasts are being
       implemented throughout Western Washington and Oregon. These are
       probabilistic predictions based on conditions of soil moisture,
       snow packs conditions, and historical precipitation and temperature
       patterns. Completion date: available now but limited to user
       requirements.

     * Consumptive Use Model - An agricultural withdrawal model. The
       NWSRFS is system of hydrologic models. Models simulate snow
       accumulation and ablation, soil moisture, reservoir operations,
       river reach routing, etc. Before streamflow model calibration can
       continue in the Snake and Yakima River systems, we must be able to
       simulate the impacts and seasonal effects agriculture has on
       streamflow. A Master's project has produced a simple approach to
       defining the irrigation process while integrating the model into
       the NWSRFS. Completion date: Version 1.0 is included in the latest
       release of the NWSRFS.

     * ASWS - The NWRFC is implementing an advanced statistical water
       supply forecast system. This system consists of many components
       designed to improve the regressional statistical water supply
       forecasts. We have improved on data collection, estimation, quality
       control, and statistical analysis. Updates to the equations are
       planned to utilize the most recent streamflow extremes. Completion
       date: fall 1999

     * Canadian PRISM Maps - Monthly 1961-90 normal precipitation maps are
       being developed for the Columbia River system in Canada. Oregon
       State University has been developing methods to generate monthly
       normal precipitation and temperature maps for the United States.
       The NWRFC has contracted this group to extend these techniques into
       Canada. These data support calibrations, water balance studies,
       data quality control, and other water management data analysis
       procedures Completion date: completed.. another program has started
       to look at all of British Columbia

                   Demonstrations of Forecast Technologies

     * SW Oregon - apply ESP technology in the Rogue, Coquille, and Umpqua
       River basins. Provide the Corps of Engineers with long-range
       streamflow predictions.

     * Nooksack River Flood Management System - apply NWSRFS short-, and
       long-range forecast technologies to provide support in flood
       management decisions.

     * Green River - provide ESP traces for the Corps of Engineers STELLA
       reservoir regulation simulation model on the Green River in
       Washington.

     * Willamette River Basin - the NWS and Corps of Engineers will use
       the Willamette river basin as a test site for development and
       implementation of ESP technologies to replace current SSARR
       snowpack depletion streamflow models in the Columbia River.

     * Agency Hydrologic Briefing - provide Columbia and Willamette River
       regulators with daily hydrometeorological briefings.
