      Federal advisory committees are established to provide consensus advice
      and include private sector participation that affords an expertise not
      available within the Department or other Federal agencies.  This advice
      can be for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations on issues or
      policies that are withing the scope of the interest of the agency.  The
      committees are established either legislatively or by Executive Order
      (called statutory committees), or by the Department (called discretionary
      committees).  There are presently 60 advisory committees in the Department
      of Commerce and they are established and operated in accordance with the
      requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).  All the
      information collected, including the committee charters, can be searched
