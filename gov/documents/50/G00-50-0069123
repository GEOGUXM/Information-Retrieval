   This OML modifies Section 3.2 of WSOM Chapter E-11. The second
   paragraph of Section 3.2 shall be deleted. The section therefore reads
   as follows:

   3.2 Extension to 24-Hour Operation. Criteria for extension to 24-hour
   operations cannot be specified to cover all possible cases. Final
   decision regarding extension to 24-hour operations shall be made by the
   HIC or, in his/her absence, the DOH or designated RFC forecast shift
   leader. Regional Headquarters may establish guidelines on such
   extensions to meet local requirements.
