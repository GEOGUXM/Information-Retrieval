              Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)

                   Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Project

                           January Total Net Flux
   Shortwave and longwave surface radiative fluxes will be computed on a 1
      degree equal-angle grid with detailed and parameterized radiative
     transfer models using meteorological data (clouds, temperature and
    humidity profiles, ozone, etc). The input data will be obtained from
     satellite sources, namely International Satellite Cloud Climatology
    Project (ISCCP) DX and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), and
    from the Goddard GEOS-1 reanalysis product. ISCCP-DX provides top of
      atmosphere (TOA) narrowband radiances and cloud information. ERBE
       provides TOA broadband clear-sky albedos. Surface temperature,
    temperature profiles, total water vapor burden and profiles of water
                    vapor are being obtained from GEOS-1.
     Monthly and daily average shortwave and longwave surface radiative
    fluxes will be available for the period July 1983 through June 1995.
     More information regarding this dataset (data accessibility, sample
            graphics, model documentation, etc.) is given below.
