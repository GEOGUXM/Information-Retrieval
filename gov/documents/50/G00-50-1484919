   Panel Members
     __________________________________________________________________

   The panel members consist of the Goddard Senior Fellows (GSF) and
   Adjunct Members.

   The Goddard Senior Fellows Program recognizes Goddard's most
   distinguished research workers for their outstanding accomplishments
   and contributions to the Nation's Space program. This designation
   represents the highest level of achievement for scientists and
   engineers in the research and development portion of NASA's dual career
   ladder. The Goddard Fellows are a special resource serving as Center
   consultants in their research or engineering specialties, collectively
   giving advice to Senior Center Management on issues related to research
   policy, and improving the research and development environment at
   Goddard.

   Adjunct members are added to the panel to cover subject areas where the
   GSF lacks his/her expertise.
