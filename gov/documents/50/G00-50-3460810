   The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) is a nationwide effort
   to improve the utilization of geospatial data within the United States.
   The Center fully supports this effort for the benefit of local and
   state coastal resource managers. Center projects in this theme area
   assist coastal managers in a variety of data-related tasks, including
   data acquisition, processing, storage, distribution, ease of use, and
   inclusion in the decision-making process.
     * GOAL 1
       The coastal management community understands and embraces the
       vision, concepts, and benefits of the NSDI.
     * GOAL 2
       Geospatial coastal and marine framework data are readily available
       for use by the coastal management community.
     * GOAL 3
       Innovative practices and technologies that facilitate the
       discovery, collection, description, access, and preservation of
       geospatial data are widely available to the coastal zone management
       community.
     * GOAL 4
       Foster, develop, and implement geospatial data applications in
       response to the needs of the coastal and marine communities.
