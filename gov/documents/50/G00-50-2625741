     About the Program

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Toxic Substances Hydrology (Toxics)
   Program was initiated in 1982. The goal of the Program is to provide
   scientific information on the behavior of toxic substances in the
   Nation's hydrologic environments. Contamination of surface water,
   ground water, soil, sediment, and the atmosphere by toxic substances is
   among the most significant issues facing the Nation. Contaminants such
   as excessive nutrients, organic chemicals, metals, and pathogens enter
   the environment, often inadvertently, via industrial, agricultural,
   mining, or other human activities. The extent of their migration and
   their persistence often are difficult to ascertain. Estimates of the
   costs and time frames for cleanup of contamination and protection of
   human and environmental health can best be described as astounding,
   despite continual efforts by governments and industries worldwide to
   improve environmental technologies.

   The Toxics Program conducts: (1) intensive field investigations of
   representative cases of subsurface contamination at local releases; and
   (2) watershed- and regional-scale investigations of contamination
   affecting aquatic ecosystems from nonpoint and distributed point
   sources. These investigations occur over a wide range of scales -- from
   intense point sources, such as leaks or discharges from industrial
   facilities; to multiple, closely spaced releases, such as domestic
   septic systems; to relatively uniform releases that occur over broad
   areas with similar land-use practices, such as agricultural and
   residential land uses. Common to the investigations at all these scales
   are the objectives to:
     * Measure the contaminants and their transformation products in
       environmental samples at levels low enough to characterize
       environmental processing;
     * Characterize the physical processes and properties that affect
       their propagation in the environment;
     * Define the chemical and microbial processes that transform,
       degrade, or otherwise affect the contaminant's transport;
     * Describe the influence of contaminants on organisms, ecosystems,
       the food chain, and human health;
     * Understand the ultimate fate of contaminants in hydrologic systems
       and the potential long-term implications for human and
       environmental health; and
     * Develop simulation models to assess potential exposure and design
       waste-disposal facilities, monitoring networks, and remediation.

   Scientists with a broad range of expertise, including ecologists,
   geologists, chemists, hydrologists, geochemists, biologists, and
   digital data-collection experts from across the USGS participate in
   Program activities. In addition, many scientists from universities,
   other Federal agencies, and industry are taking advantage of research
   opportunities afforded by the Program and its field sites, and are
   active members of the research teams. Each project is steered by a core
   group of scientists from the research team. This core group, led by the
   project coordinator(s), guides the development of a research plan that
   integrates the multi-disciplinary activities at the site.

   The Toxics Program is coordinated with the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department
   of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission, and other U.S. Department of the Interior agencies to
   ensure that current and future research priorities are being addressed.
   The Program complements the water-quality monitoring and assessment
   programs of USGS and others by identifying new issues and emerging
   contaminants, and developing the knowledge and methods needed to direct
   their future activities. Collaboration and information sharing occurs
   with numerous state and local governments, and non-governmental
   entities.

   The long-term cooperation and assistance offered by the Federal, State,
   and local agencies, and by private entities that administer or own the
   Program's research sites has been essential to the success of the
   Toxics Program. Their continued support is greatly appreciated.
