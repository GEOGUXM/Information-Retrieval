   * Applying for Tissue from the Resource

   The CBCTR application process is simple and straightforward. The
   process is outlined below:
    1. You submit a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the resource. This letter is
       to tell us about your research plan so that we can determine
       whether the CBCTR is the most appropriate resource and whether the
       required specimens are available.
    2. The CBCTR Research Evaluation Panel (REP) will review your LOI as
       rapidly as possible. If they have any questions about your letter
       we will contact you directly (via e-mail or telephone) to discuss
       their concerns.
    3. Once your LOI is approved, you will be asked to submit a more
       detailed research plan with the CBCTR application form. A REP
       member will be assigned to guide you through the application
       process.
    4. The REP will review your application and work with you to resolve
       any remaining scientific issues. They will then make a
       recommendation to the CBCTR Coordinating Committee, which makes the
       final decision on providing the specimens and data. If the CBCTR
       cannot meet your needs, we will attempt to identify an appropriate
       resource with the required specimens and data.

   * Applying for Tissue Microarrays from the Resource

   The CBCTR application process for progression tissue microarray slides
   is simple and straightforward. The process is outlined below:

    1. You submit a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the resource. This letter is
       to tell us about your research plan to help us determine whether
       progression array slides are appropriate to answer the question you
       are posing.
    2. The CBCTR Research Evaluation Panel (REP) will review your LOI as
       rapidly as possible. If they have any questions about your letter
       we will contact you directly (via e-mail or telephone) to discuss
       their concerns.
    3. Once your LOI is reviewed, you will be informed of the outcome and
       if approved, when you can expect to receive the slides you
       requested. No further application will be required.
