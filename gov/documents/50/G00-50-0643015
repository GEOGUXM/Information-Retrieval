   The Local Analysis and Prediction System is running at the Air Force
   Weather Agency, generating products in several global theaters labeled
   here as t1 through t6. The products can be sporadic since the system is
   still experimental. Presently, AFWA is running LAPS in t1 (Alaska), t2
   (extended CONUS), t3 (Europe), t4 (SW Asia), t5 (Central America and
   Northwest South America), and t6 (East Asia).

THEATER PRODUCTS:

     * t1
     * t2
     * t3
     * t4
     * t5
     * t6
