   Both the State Museum and State Archives and Records Administration
   offer direct services to teachers by providing professional development
   workshops as well as experiences for students that relate to curriculum
   content.

   By administering funding for School Library Systems, the Library
   Development unit seeks to strengthen to capacities of school libraries
   to support teaching and learning.
   The State Library's Talking Book and Braille Library School Services
   serves 1,570 buildings in upstate New York and over 15,000 students who
   are reading or learning disabled, blind, visually impaired, or
   physically handicapped.  These students are provided with library books
   on tape and in braille, including books the students need to read for
   class assignments, as well as books for recreational reading.  They
   also receive special cassette players to play the books.
   Through Educational Television and Public Broadcasting, the Office of
   Cultural Education supports the education mission of the State's public
   broadcasting stations through the distribution of operational aid and
   the strengthening of collaborative partnerships..
   The Friends of the New York State Newspaper Project are now offering a
   new teaching unit entitled "The Great Railroad Strike of 1877: An
   Instructional Packet for Teachers and Students of Labor History in New
   York State and the United States of America".  This 92-page loose-leaf
   book is available free to New York State Teachers while others may
   purchase it for small fee.

   In partnership with the New York State Council on the Arts and the New
   York State Alliance for Arts Education, the Office of Cultural
   Education guides the Empire State Partnership Project, which supports
   sustained, standards-based collaborations between school and cultural
   and arts institutions.
   To encourage community libraries, museums, archives, and other cultural
   and arts agencies to form long-term partnerships with their
   neighborhood schools, the Office of Cultural Education provides a Guide
   to Cultural and Arts Partnerships with New York State's Schools.
