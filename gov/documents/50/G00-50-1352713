   BNL's Quality Assurance Program

   The primary role of the QA Program, in support of ISMS, is to:
   integrate quality methodology throughout BNL's Management Systems; to
   support effective planning, performing, controlling, assessing, and
   improvement of work processes; and  the quality of products and
   services at BNL.

   By design, BNL's Management Systems are integrated and provide mutual
   support to each other to meet applicable requirements. The ISMS
   utilizes the same Management Systems employed by the Quality Management
   System  to meet their applicable requirements, and relies on the QMS to
   manage Quality requirements.

   The QAP:
     * Addresses both DOE O 414.1 (The Order) And 10 CFR830.120 (The Rule)
     * Both Consist of 10 Criteria:

   1-Program (Graded Approach)          6-Design
