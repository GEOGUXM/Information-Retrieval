                     ___________________________________

   On 17 September 1998 we convened a meeting to report on the status of
   the IR beamlines at the ALS and improve the communication with users
   about the work which is being done on the IR/UV/VIS beamline complex of
   1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3.

   At this meeting were three handouts, which are available on this web
   site as: IR News #1, IR News #3, and IR News #4.

   Zahid began the meeting by mentioning the fact that communication
   problems may exist between the beamline scientists and the users of the
   beamlines. He called the meeting to help with these problems, and would
   like the attendees to advise the ALS on whether some kind of more
   regular process should be set up for both users and beamline scientists
   to communicate. Should we have a newsletter? meetings? If so, then how
   frequently?

   He introduced Wayne McKinney and Mike Martin, the beamline scientists
   working on these beamlines. Wayne reviewed when first light occurred,
   claimed that Mid-IR microscopy was already a success, and 5 ns timing
   had been demonstrated. Mike then showed measurements of the diffraction
   limited spot size in the microscope, an excellent result in
   bioremediation by the group of Hoi-Ying Holman, and the first fast
   timing data.

   Next, Wayne introduced the vibration problems occurring from the
   beginning, and Mike then cataloged the efforts to date on the problem.
   Briefly, the noise on the FTIR spectrum started out at roughly 100
   times that achieved in the best IR surface science at NSLS. It is
   caused by two factors: forced oscillations of the ALS floor and shield
   walls caused mainly by the 20 HP RF cooling water pumps, and motion of
   the ALS beam. The mechanical noise is mainly in the region from 20 to
   300 Hz, and the beam motion is mainly in the 2 to 8 kHz and 20 kHz
   regions.

   Mike showed the methodical series of measurements which were performed,
   including accelerometer spectra, and spectra of the signal directly
   from the IR detector. Prof. Haller commented and made suggestions about
   the analysis of this data. Prof. Frei asked about the mounting of the
   interferometer, whether the beam actually moved, and whether acoustic
   noise was important.

   Mike then listed the several changes accomplished together with a
   committee of ALS and Engineering staff to reduce the low frequency
   components by an order of magnitude. (See IR News #3.) This included
   smaller impellers on the large pumps, new chiller for mirror cooling,
   bolting the front end to the lower concrete slab, and a new support for
   the pipe from the front end to the shield wall. He also recounted the
   detective work with the accelerator group to find and identify the
   localized high frequency noise in the FTIR spectrum. (See IR News #4.)
   A new master 500 MHz oscillator caused this noise. Sidebands were
   causing longitudinal motion of electron bunches in the ring, even
   though these frequencies were damped. The ALS has purchased a new
   master oscillator, and Mike showed the essential elimination of this
   noise. There was further discussion about the high frequency noise
   being really on the electron beam initiated by Prof. Haller.

   Wayne then outlined the status of the connection of the surface science
   chamber of the Phil Ross Group. Light is expected on the sample in this
   chamber in October. Who worked on this project and the funding sources
   were briefly covered. The reasons for the purchase of the vacuum FTIR
   step-scan instrument from Bruker were recounted, and the successful
   application for LDRD funding in the collaboration of Mike with Joe
   Orenstein.

   Next, he outlined the connection of the UV/VIS Photoluminescence
   experiment of the Haller Group to the ALS. The basis of this experiment
   is that for relatively small $$ it is possible to obtain UV/Vis
   radiation starting at about 6 eV from the switchyard of the IR
   beamline. Instead of AU coatings on the first two optics, they were
   coated with Al which preserves the UV/VIS light. Wayne had added a port
   for this radiation to the original design, even though it was outside
   the scope of the commission given by the ALS.

   The transport of the UV light to the experiment has proven to be
   problematic. When first light was sent to 1.4.1 there was essentially
   no light in the 2000A to 3000A region. Wayne outlined what steps have
   been taken to correct this problem. First, two new Suprasil windows
   were ordered and installed to make sure that an inadvertent glass
   window had not been used. This did not correct the problem. The outside
   of the window and the first three mirrors after the fused silica window
   were observed to contaminate and absorb the UV. An experiment in
   collaboration with the users showed that good UV was exiting the
   window, with the proper spectrum. The contamination was investigated
   with IR without identification. The chamber has been cleaned and leak
   checked with no positive result.

   Since Wei Shan had seen some light below 2000A, we investigated the
   possibility that ozone might be forming in the air between the
   switchyard and the experimental area. Nitrogen purge of an installed
   covering pipe also did not solve the problem.

   Prof. Haller suggested that we get the contamination identified by
   building 62. Howard Padmore suggested ways of analysis at the ALS.
   Various suggestions were made, most of which had already be tried or
   were planned. Baking and RGA analysis fall into the latter category.

   Zahid then asked about the frequency and what type of communication
   would be most beneficial to the users. He apologized for the short
   notice for this meeting. Howard suggested a bimonthly email. Prof.
   Haller remarked that things happen at a glacial time scale at the ALS,
   and that he couldn't get grant $$ with this kind of progress. Howard
   pointed out the manpower shortage, and Ben Feinberg added that this
   problem was being taken up at the highest levels in Engineering. Howard
   pointed out that the ALS had acted with extreme dispatch in getting Bob
   Glaeser going at the micro X-ray and IR beamlines. Prof. Glaeser
   confirmed this, and added that a feature should be added to allow one
   to unsubscribe from the notices or email. Prof. Haller stated that it
   had been a year since his initial UV proposal and the experiment is
   still not operating. Howard responded that we are actually very fast
   compared to other facilities, but acknowledged that Prof. Haller and
   others are used to a different time scale in their own labs.

   The meeting concluded with the assumption that the IR beamline
   scientists will regularly email users with updates, and that users can
   then offer suggestions and comments as any problems arise. The detailed
   IR News sheets are very informative, but so detailed that they might
   better be placed on a web server, only come out a few times a year and
   only be mentioned in the emails; as suggested by Howard earlier in the
   meeting. The next IR informational meeting will be called in the future
   when necessary.
