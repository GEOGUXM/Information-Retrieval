                                Transportation Trainers and Educators

   Never before has the transportation community seen such rapid and
   radical changes. New technologies, practices, partnerships and
   innovations promise tremendous benefits, but also bring new challenges.
   Virtually every advancement being made in transportation today requires
   an implementation effort which includes some form of training or
   education. At the same time, the technologies available to
   transportation trainers and educators continues to also grow.

   There is a very rich and diverse community which provides
   transportation training and education to practitioners, professionals,
   students, executives and a whole host of others. What we lack is an
   on-going mechanism to learn from each other, share ideas, successes and
   opportunities for change.

   This notice is to inquire as to your interest to help create or even
   just be part of a "community of practice" for transportation educators
   and trainers. At this point, the idea is just that - an idea. However,
   if there are enough people like yourself who have sufficient interest
   in such an idea, by next year there may be something more substantial
   to share.

   Please let us know of your interest via the email address below. If you
   have any thoughts or ideas about how we can make this happen, please
   include them. If you have any additional questions, please contact
   maggie.glesner@fhwa.dot.gov .

                                 Thank you!
