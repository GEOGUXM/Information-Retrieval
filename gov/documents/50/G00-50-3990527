   The files available below are subsamples of a scan created using
   National Archive standards to allow for high-quality printing at the
   scale of the original printed maps. Quality of the image file you
   download will vary not only on the basis of dpi (listed by each file)
   but as a function of your display and printing device sizes and
   capabilities.

   This map is available at several sizes and DPIs (72 DPI and 150 DPI).
   Please note the file size for each map. Each file has been "zipped"
   (.zip) and will need to be "unzipped" before you can use it.
     * 36" x 25", 72 DPI (9 MB)
     * 64.5" x 44.6", 72 DPI (29 MB)
     * 24" x 16.7", 150 DPI (18 MB)
     * 36" x 25", 150 DPI (41 MB)
     * 64.5" x 44.6", 150 DPI (137 MB. A few copies of this version are
       available on CD. Click here to request a CD via email. Please be
       sure to put "South Florida Satellite Image" in the subject line.)
