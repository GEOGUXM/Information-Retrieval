              STATE SCHOOLS CHIEF EASTIN ANNOUNCES DISTRIBUTION
              OF GOVERNOR'S PERFORMANCE AWARD FUNDS TO SCHOOLS

               SACRAMENTO-State Superintendent of Public Instruction
     Delaine Eastin today announced that the Governor's Performance
     Awards will be distributed to 4,502 schools that have met the
     state's benchmark for their Academic Performance Index (API) growth
     targets.

               The California Department of Education (CDE) will post
     data for each eligible school by district and county on its Web site
     at

                           http://www.cde.ca.gov/psaa/awards
                         on January 31st by 12 noon.

               Schools will begin receiving their apportionment from the
     State Controller's office today. Based on $63 per student, the
     average awards are: elementary schools $39,470, middle schools
     $56,297, and high schools $98,470. A total of $227 million has been
     allocated for this program. Use of the unrestricted funds should be
     decided by each school site council and ratified by the local
     governing board.

               "I'm pleased so many of our schools will receive
     recognition for improving academic performance," said Eastin. "More
     than 67 percent of public schools statewide met their growth targets
     and qualified for financial awards. That in itself is a commendable
     achievement. During the second year of the program, I hope we will
     improve on that percentage to enable more schools to earn awards."

               For more information regarding the API-based award
     programs, please contact the CDE's Awards Unit staff at
     916/657-3810.
