   Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund: a federal trust with blood clotting
   disorders and HIV

   As of December 31, 2001, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Program
   has committed more than $543 million in compassionate payments. All
   eligible, complete petitions postmarked no later than November 13, 2001
   have been processed for payment.

   NOTICE: By regulation, the postmark dates for filing petitions under
   the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Program were July 31, 2000 through
   November 13, 2001. As a result, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund
   Program is unable to accept any new petitions because the time period
   for filing petitions has ended. If you have a question regarding this
   issue, contact the Ricky Ray toll-free help line, 1-888-496-0338.

   The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund was established by the U.S.
   Congress in 1998 to make compassionate payments of $100,000 to certain
   individuals with blood clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, who were
   treated with anti-hemophilic factor between July 1, 1982 and December
   31, 1987, and who contracted HIV. Certain spouses and children who
   contracted HIV from these individuals may be eligible for a
   compassionate payment. Specified survivors of these individuals may
   also receive payment.

   The U.S. Congress appropriated $75 million to support the Ricky Ray
   Program during Fiscal Year 2000. As a result, the Ricky Ray Program
   Office began issuing compassionate payments to eligible individuals in
   August, 2000.  These payments were made in accordance with the
   procedures described in the Ricky Ray Program regulations, published in
   the Federal Register on May 31, 2000.

   The U.S. Congress ended its 106^th session by passing an omnibus
   appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 that includes $580 million for
   the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund program. The combined totals of
   the Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001 appropriations  $655 millionprovides
   sufficient funding to make compassionate payments on all eligible
   petitions received to date.

   We received more than 5,700 petitions -- about 4,350 were postmarked
   July 31, the initial postmark date for petitions. A confirmation of
   receipt with a petition number was sent to all individuals who
   submitted a petition. The Ricky Ray Program Office processed petitions
   and made compassionate payments to eligible individuals who filed
   petitions with required documentation in the order in which petitions
   were received.  The order of receipt was determined by the petition
   postmark date and the random selection process described in the Ricky
   Ray Program Regulations.

   The procedures set forth in the Ricky Ray Program Regulations,
   published in the Federal Register on May 31, 2000, are effective as of
   July 31, 2000. These procedures supersede the Notice of Intent to File
   a Petition process published in the Federal Register on March 24, 1999.
   Individuals must file a formal petition for payment as outlined in the
   regulations -- even if they previously filed a Notice of Intent.

   To be eligible for payment, petitions had to be postmarked or have a
   commercial carrier receipt dated between July 31, 2000 and November 13,
   2001. Any petition postmarked after November 13, 2001, will not be
   accepted for review.
