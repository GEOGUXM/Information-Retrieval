   In Reply Refer To: W/OM12 File With: D-20, D-22. And D-38
   Subject: Backup of Aviation Weather Center In-Flight Advisory Products
   References: WSOM Chapter D-20, Transmittal Issuance 91-3 dated May 3,
   1991; WSOM Chapter D-22, Transmittal Issuance 91-7 dated May 22, 1991;
   and WSOM Chapter D-38, Transmittal Issuance 88-5 dated May 27, 1988.

   Supersedes: WSOM Chapter D-20, Section 11, WSOM Chapter D-22, Section
   11.

   1. Purpose. This Operations Manual Letter (OML) details changes to
   National Weather Service (NWS) policy and procedures for the backup of
   the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Aviation
   Weather Center (AWC) production and issuance of In-Flight Aviation
   Weather Advisories and Aviation Area Forecasts. Specific products
   addressed are Airman's Meteorological (AIRMET) Advisories, Significant
   Meteorological (SIGMET) Advisories, and Aviation Area Forecasts (FA) in
   the National Airspace System (NAS); and Aviation Area Forecasts (FA) in
   the National Airspace System (NAS); and International SIGMETs in the
   Oakland and New York International Flight Information Regions (FIR).

   2. Background. The overall responsibility for preparing FAs, SIGMETs,
   and AIRMETs for the NAS, and International SIGMETs for portions of the
   New York and Oakland FIRs rests with the AWC. Prior to this policy,
   backup of domestic In-Flight Aviation Weather Advisories was not
   centralized. Backup responsibility for product generation and
   transmittal resided at Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) located in
   Monterey, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Chicago, Illinois; Fort
   Worth, Texas; Sterling, Virginia; and Miami, Florida. The FA was not
   backed up, and in lieu of hourly Convective SIGMETs, SIGMETs were
   issued for areas of active convection, as defined in Chapter D-38 for
   International SIGMETs. The International SIGMETs were backed up by WFO
   Honolulu for the Oakland FIR and by the NCEP Tropical Prediction Center
   (TPC) for the New York FIR, as prescribed in WSOM Chapter J-03.

   Organizational changes and restructuring of field operations resulting
   from the NWS modernization resulted in the need to update backup
   procedures and responsibilities of the referenced AWC products. The
   centralization of AWC backup provides consistent products and promotes
   forecaster skill and efficient use of resources.

   3. Overview. The NWS and the U.S. Air Force have signed a Memorandum of
   Agreement for the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) to provide backup of
   a number of AWC products and to provide an interim site for AWC
   forecasters in the advent of a prolonged outage at the AWC. Because of
   mission similarities, both parties are proficient in the warning and
   forecasting activities in the NAS. This comparable responsibility will
   provide tangible improvements in backup forecast reliability. The
   International SIGMETs will continue to be backed up by WFO Honolulu and
   the TPC. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) of NCEP will provide an
   interim site for the AWC forecasters to provide Convective SIGMETs in
   the NAS.

   This OML details the policy, procedures, and organizational
   responsibilities for backup of the AWC In-Flight Weather Advisory
   products and Area Aviation Forecasts.

   4. Policy. In the case of the loss of product-generating or

   -disseminating capability at the AWC, In-Flight Advisory responsibility
   in the NAS shall be transferred to AFWA and, as in the past, with
   respect to the International FIRs, to WFO Honolulu and the TPC.
   Generation and dissemination of the FA and Convective SIGMETs shall be
   suspended for the first 48-hours while backup procedures are in effect.
   After 48 hours, the FA shall be generated and disseminated by AWC
   forecasters working on an interim basis at the AFWA facility at Offutt
   Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska; and Convective SIGMETs shall be
   generated and disseminated by AWC forecasters working on an interim
   basis at the SPC facility in Norman, Oklahoma.

   5. Procedures. AWC shall advise, through telephone communications,
   AFWA, the Alaska Aviation Weather Unit (AAWU), TPC, WFO Honolulu, each
   of the Center Weather Service Units (CWSUs), and the NCEP Senior Duty
   Meteorologist (SDM) of a planned or anticipated outage, and its
   duration, if known. For an emergency outage, AWC shall notify all of
   the above, if possible. If not possible, the AWC shall contact the SDM,
   by telephone, or any other means possible, and the SDM shall notify
   AFWA, AAWU, TPC, WFO Honolulu, the CWSUs and the ARTCCs of the outage,
   and its anticipated duration, if known. Upon handoff of advisory
   responsibility, AFWA and the designated NWS offices shall assign the
   positions necessary to begin a MET watch of their in-flight advisory
   areas. Return of the advisory responsibility to the AWC at its facility
   shall be initiated by the AWC after a determination by AWC management
   of adequate operational capability and data availability. The offices
   responsible for issuing backup products shall issue them with the WMO
   Headers and AFOS PILS Identifiers used by AWC.

   APPENDIX A AWC IN-FLIGHT ADVISORY PRODUCTS (D-20,D-22,D-38)

   Notification Procedures

   1. For non-emergency outages (planned or advance knowledge):

   AWC shall advise, through telephone communications, e.g., conference
   call using FTS2000 bridge, AFWA, the Alaska Aviation Weather Unit
   (AAWU), TPC, WFO Honolulu, each of the Center Weather Service Units
   (CWSUs), and the NCEP Senior Duty Meteorologist (SDM) of the planned or
   anticipated outage, and its duration, if known. Notification shall be
   made as early as possible to allow for any required staffing changes
   and for an orderly handoff of advisory responsibility.

   A. The SDM shall issue an administrative message over the FAA Weather
   Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) and NWS communications
   circuits informing of the planned or anticipated outage of AWC, the
   anticipated time and duration of the outage. If the outage occurs
   during the time of day that any of the CWSUs are not staffed, the SDM
   shall send a message via NWS Family of Services that shall be alarmed
   on WARP to provide them notification.

   C. The CWSU meteorologist shall make notifications of the outage as
   directed by the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) manager.

   D. AWC shall:

   - amend each FA with "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING
   ddtttt...see AIRMET BULLETINS AND SIGMETS" inserted in place of the
   AIRMET SIERRA statement and "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING
   ddtttt...NO FA AVBL TIL (ddtttt or FTHR NOTICE)" to the end of the FA;
   and;

   - append the message, "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING ddtttt" to
   the end of each of what will be the last scheduled Convective SIGMET
   (E, C, and W) and AIRMET bulletins prior to the outage and to any
   nonconvective SIGMETs issued within 4 hours of the start time of the
   outage.

   2. For unplanned (emergency) outages:

   A. AWC shall follow the procedures for notification listed in 1.A.,
   above, if possible. If not possible, the AWC shall contact the SDM, by
   telephone, or any other means possible, and the SDM shall make the
   telephone call(s) notifying AFWA, AAWU, TPC, WFO Honolulu, the CWSUs
   and the ARTCCs of the outage, and its anticipated duration, if known.

   AWC IN-FLIGHT ADVISORY PRODUCTS (D-20,D-22,D-38) APPENDIX A

   B. The SDM shall:

   - send out a message as in 1.B., above;

   - amend each FA with the message, "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT
   BEGINNING ddtttt...see AIRMET BULLETINS AND SIGMETS" inserted in place
   of the AIRMET SIERRA statement;

   - append the message, "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING
   ddtttt...NO FA AVBL TIL (ddtttt or FTHR NOTICE)" to the end of each FA;

   - amend each current convective SIGMET (E, C, and W) and AIRMET
   bulletin and any nonconvective SIGMET (s) to append the message,
   "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING ddtttt" after the outage has
   been determined; and

   - issue the message, "BACKUP PROCEDURES IN EFFECT BEGINNING
   ddtttt...SEE SIGMETS FOR CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY" in place of the scheduled
   convective SIGMETs. These messages shall be issued hourly between H+50
   and H+54.

   These messages shall be sent using the AWC headers and sent via FAA
   WMSCR and NWS communications circuits.

   3. Resumption of product generation at AWC:

   When product generation is resumed at AWC, a new FA with the "VALID
   UNTIL" time of the FA regularly scheduled for issuance prior to the
   time operations resumed shall be issued, with the following exceptions:

   - no new FA issuance is required if the outage and resumption of
   service occur within the valid period of a single FA;

   - if the next regularly scheduled issuance is within 2 hours of the
   resumption of service, or

   - if the outage has been longer than 48 hours and there is a valid FA
   which was issued by an AWC forecaster deployed at Offutt, AFB.

   AWC shall advise, via telephone, AFWA, the AAWU, TPC, WFO Honolulu,
   each of CWSUs, and the NCEP SDM of the planned time that it will again
   assume operational responsibility.

   APPENDIX A AWC IN-FLIGHT ADVISORY PRODUCTS (D-20,D-22,D-38)

   The SDM shall issue an administrative message over the FAA WMSCR and
   NWS communications circuits informing of resumption by AWC for
   preparation and issuance of advisory products and FAs, either at Offutt
   and SPC, or at the AWC facility.

   APPENDIX B AWC IN-FLIGHT ADVISORY PRODUCTS (D-20,D-22,D-38)

   Operational Procedures

   Upon notification of an anticipated outage, or of the handoff of
   advisory responsibility, AFWA and the designated NWS offices shall
   assign the positions necessary to begin a MET watch of their in-flight
   advisory areas. Additional preliminary duties include:

   - review of backup procedures; and

   - coordination between AFWA and Honolulu or AFWA and TPC where weather
   that meets or approaches advisory criteria is affecting or will soon be
   affecting adjoining areas of responsibility.

   Upon handoff of advisory responsibility, any existing Convective
   SIGMETs shall continue until expiration. When the expiration time is
   reached, no additional Convective SIGMETs will be issued. Forecasters
   at AFWA shall use the criteria and procedures prescribed for
   international SIGMETs to issue 4 hourly SIGMETs for "active
   thunderstorms' in lieu of hourly Convective SIGMETs. The term "active
   thunderstorms' is defined as the occurrence or expected occurrence of
   an area (3,000 square nautical miles or more) of widespread
   cumulonimbus clouds or cumulonimbus along a line with little on no
   space between clouds, or to cumulonimbus embedded in cloud layers or
   concealed by haze. It does not refer to isolated or scattered
   cumulonimbus not embedded in cloud layers or concealed by haze.
   Cumulonimbus clouds that can be avoided by visual observation from the
   flight deck are not considered to be "active thunderstorms" in the
   sense of this definition.

   If the outage occurs just prior to the scheduled issuance time of the
   AWC product, the backup product should be issued as soon as the
   forecaster determines that sufficient information is available at the
   backup office to support an adequate advisory.

   Upon handoff of advisory responsibility, if no advisory criteria are
   met:

   - AFWA shall maintain an advisory meteorological watch and issue
   advisories in accordance with Sections 7 and 8 of this chapter for
   nonconvective criteria and in accordance with the definition of "active
   thunderstorms" in this appendix for convection for the NAS; and

   - WFO Honolulu and TPC shall issue advisories, based on the criteria in
   WSOM Chapter D-38, Section 5 for the Oakland and New York FIRs,
   respectively.

   If it is determined that the outage at AWC will last longer that 48
   hours, AWC forecasters shall deploy to the AFWA facility

   AWC IN-FLIGHT ADVISORY PRODUCTS (D-20,D-22,D-38) APPENDIX B

   at Offutt, AFB, and to SPC, Norman, Oklahoma. They shall assume
   responsibility for issuing products for the NAS once the outage has
   reached 48 hours. The AWC forecasters at Offutt AFB shall resume
   issuance of the FA. The new FA shall have the "VALID UNTIL" time of the
   regularly scheduled FA that would have been issued at the beginning of
   the forecast period. The AWC forecasters at SPC shall resume issuance
   of the hourly Convective SIGMETs.
