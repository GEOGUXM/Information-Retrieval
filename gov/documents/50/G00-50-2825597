   SOCIAL SECURITY HANDBOOK
   This Handbook is intended for the use of people who want an explanation
   of the various Social Security programs, so that they may understand
   how the programs operate, who is entitled to benefits, and how these
   benefits may be obtained. It has been prepared solely for convenient
   reference purposes and does not have the effect of law or regulations.

   SOCIAL SECURITY RULINGS (SSR'S)
   SSR's are published under the authority of the Commissioner of Social
   Security and made available to the public a series of precedential
   decisions relating to Federal old-age, survivors, disability,
   supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. SSR's
   may be based on case decisions made at all administrative levels of
   adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
   opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy
   interpretations of the law and regulations. SSR's are effective upon
   publication in the Federal Register. Although SSR's do not have the
   force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
   components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with
   section 422.406(b)(1) of Social Security Regulations No. 22, and are to
   be relied upon as precedents in adjudicating other cases. An SSR may be
   superseded, modified, or revoked by later legislation, regulations,
   court decisions, or rulings.

   International Agreements
   Social Security's Office of International Policy (OIP) negotiates
   international agreements with foreign governments, develops policies
   and procedures regarding the Social Security program outside the U.S.
   and serves as a liaison to international agencies and associations
   which deal with Social Security matters. In addition, OIP provides
   programs of training and technical consultation on Social Security and
   related fields to Social Security officials and other experts outside
   the U.S. It also serves as liaison with other Federal agencies, such as
   the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury, on Social
   Security matters outside the United States.

   The United States has bilateral Social Security agreements with 18
   countries. The agreements eliminate dual Social Security coverage and
   taxes and improve benefit protection for workers who have divided their
   careers between the United States and another country.
