                   Title: ***Water Plant Tours Canceled***
     The FBI has issued a Water Utility Terrorist Threat Advisory to all
    water service providers. In response to this advisory, the Flagstaff
    Utility Department has taken appropriate security measures to ensure
     the safety of our water supply. For the duration of this advisory,
    Flagstaff Utilities will not be allowing tours of our Water Treatment
    Facilities. Tours are expected to resume immediately following. Thank
     you for your cooperation during this time, and please feel free to
                           contact us at 779-7646.

            Title: Flagstaff Utilities Undertakes Re-Engineering
       In an effort to provide you the best value for your dollar, The
    Flagstaff Utilities Department has hired a consultant to improve our
     efficiency through Re-engineering. The Re-engineering process will
    initiate skill-based-pay for our labor force, as well as analyze our
   work practices to optimize our efforts to reduce delays and unnecessary
   steps. Initial review of our department shows that we are not in danger
   of privatization, however there are areas that can be improved. Through
     Re-engineering the Flagstaff Utilities Department will prove to be
     competitive with private utilities and other "best-in class" public
     utilities. To inquire about our Re-engineering process and status,
     please feel free to contact the Utilities Department Re-engineering
