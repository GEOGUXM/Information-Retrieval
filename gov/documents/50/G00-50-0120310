                    [wedge_sm.gif] About the City Council

    Term of Office: Councilmembers serve four-year terms and are elected
    from one of the seven Council Wards. They must live in the Ward from
    which they are elected. The present council will serve until December
    31, 2003. Prior to the 1999 election, Councilmembers served two-year
       terms. The job is part-time and the salary is $30,000 annually.
        Councilmembers employ one legislative aide to assist them in
                    constituent and legislative affairs.

    Council Powers & Duties: The City Council is the Legislative body of
   the City and the Mayors Office is the Administrative body of the City.
       The City Council is responsible for setting City policy through
    ordinances, resolutions and adopting the Citys budget. The Council
    legislates by passing ordinances which become City laws. An ordinance
    is read at four separate Council meetings and becomes effective after
    passage by the Council, approval by the Mayor and publication in the
      Legal Ledger. All other official acts by the Council are done by
      passing a resolution which becomes effective upon passage by the
    Council and approval by the Mayor. The Council passes ordinances and
   resolutions by majority vote (four out of seven members). If a measure
   is vetoed by the Mayor, the veto may be overridden by the Council by a
                     vote of five out of seven members.

     The Council also performs a quasi-judicial role in hearing appeals
            regarding actions taken by a number of City agencies.

   The City Council also serves as the Housing and Redevelopment Authority
     (HRA). The HRA is a legally distinct public entity which undertakes
   housing and commercial development activities through the authorization
    of loans and issuance of bonds. Councilmembers also serve on a number
    of other boards and commissions of intergovernmental agencies such as
        the Saint Paul Port Authority and the RiverCentre Authority.

     Council Meetings: The Council meets every week on Wednesday at 3:30
      p.m. in the City Council Chambers, 3^rd floor, City Hall. Public
    hearings are conducted at 5:30 p.m. with the exception of the meeting
   on the third Wednesday of the month during which the Council conducts a
     policy session after its regular business. Council meetings are not
                    held on the fifth week of the month.

     An agenda for the meeting can be obtained from the receptionist in
     Suite 310 City Hall or from the City Councils Minutes and Agendas
                                    page.

    Council Meetings can be seen live on cable televison in Saint Paul on
       Channel 18. Meetings are rebroadcast throughout the week. Check
                             schedule for times.

     Public Hearings: The Council is required to hold public hearings on
      proposed ordinances, public improvements, property acquisitions,
      special assessments, utility charges, and the City budget. Public
          hearings may be held on other issues as the need arises.

     The Council shall hear interested persons at a public hearing. The
   opportunity to be heard comes when the Council President announces the
   public hearing on a particular matter. At this point, anyone wishing to
   be heard on the matter may step forward. The Council may limit the time
                        allowed for public testimony.

                   COUNCIL MEETINGS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
