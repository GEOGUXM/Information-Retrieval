   Notice of Public Hearing

   Bay Area citizens are invited by to comment on
   proposed amendments to the 2001 Transportation Improvement Program
   (TIP). The TIP is the region's transportation spending plan that
   contains public mass transit, highway and local road projects proposed
   for funding based on anticipated available federal, state and local
   funding for the 3-year period from 2000-01 to 2002-03. The 2001 TIP was
   developed to be consistent with MTC's Regional Transportation Plan, the
   25-year blueprint for transportation projects in the nine-county San
   Francisco Bay Area.

   Each year, prior to receiving grant approval for funds administered by
   the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), a grantee must comply with
   certain public participation requirements. Each grantee must make
   available to the public information concerning the amount of federal
   funding available and the program of projects the grantee plans to
   undertake with such funds. The programs of projects that the grantees
   in the MTC region plan to undertake in FY 2001-02 are listed in the
   first program year of the 2001 TIP. Programming of these projects was
   based on estimated federal apportionments. The proposed amendments to
   the 2001 TIP are being made to reflect changes resulting from the
   difference between the estimated and the actual apportionments in FY
   2001-02, and to include projects to be financed by additional funding
   through federal earmarks. The public is hereby provided the opportunity
   to review and comment on all amendments to the TIP. Projects exempt
   from federal air quality conformity analysis may be amended into the
   2001 TIP immediately. Non-exempt projects will be amended into the TIP
   following the final federal conformity determination on the 2001 RTP.
   This process will satisfy the program of projects requirements as
   established by the FTA pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Section 5307 (c).

   A listing of the proposed TIP amendments will be available for public
   review beginning on Friday, January 25, 2002, at the MTC/ABAG Library.
   The proposed TIP amendments also will be mailed to major libraries in
   each of the nine Bay Area counties.

   A public hearing to receive public testimony on the proposed TIP
   amendments is scheduled for:

   Wednesday, February 13, 2002, at 10:30 a.m.,
   or immediately following the Bay Area Toll Authority Oversight
   Committee meeting
   Joseph P. Bort MetroCenter Auditorium
   101 Eighth Street, Oakland, California
   (opposite the Lake Merritt BART Station)

   Written comments may be submitted to MTC's Public Information Office at
   101 Eighth St., Oakland, CA 94607 or faxed to MTC at 510/464-7848 or
   sent via E-mail to info@mtc.ca.gov. Written comments are due by 5 p.m.,
   Feb. 26, 2002. For more information call 510/464-7787.
