Introduction

   In March 1983, President Reagan signed a proclamation establishing an
   Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending the 200 nautical mile from the
   coasts of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands,
   and the U.S. territories and possessions. In 1984, the U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) began a program to map these areas of the EEZ. To
   accomplish the mapping of the deepwater portion (depths greater than
   400m) of this area, the USGS selected the long-range sidescan sonar
   system GLORIA (Geological LOng-Range Inclined Asdic).  At that time the
   GLORIA system was owned and operated by British colleagues at the
   United Kingdom's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS), now the
   Southampton Oceanography Centre, Challenger Division. The GLORIA system
   was developed specifically to map the morphology and texture of
   seafloor features in the deep ocean.

GLORIA-II Sidescan Sonar System

   The GLORIA system is a digital sidescan sonar system capable of
   producing digital image maps of the seafloor from reflected sound
   waves. The sidescan sonar system was used aboard the research vessel
   FARNELLA and is shown with the GLORIA fish mounted on the stern of the
   ship.

   GLORIA reflection illustration GLORIA creates images (sonographs) that
   are a record of the acoustic backscatter from the ocean floor. These
   images are created by transmitting a series of sound pulses and
   recording their echoes from the sea floor as the collecting ship moves
   along a set course. The sound source and receivers are built into a
   "fish" that is towed about 200 meters behind a ship. This electronic
   mapping system emits a signal (pulse) every 30 seconds. The pulse
   travels through the ocean to the bottom where it is partly absorbed and
   partly reflected by the seafloor. The returned signal is then recorded
   by shipboard computers. In general, the returned signal is recorded in
   a range of 0-255 with strong returns recorded as higher values and weak
   returns recorded as lower values. The darkness or brightness of a
   feature or an area on the sonographs and completed mosaics is therefore
   a function of how much sound is reflected from the seafloor.

   The USGS selected sidescan sonar as the mapping tool because it could
   be used to obtain information on geologic processes. The intensity of
   the back-scattered sound from the seafloor is a function of the
   gradient or slope of the seafloor, of the surface roughness, and of the
   sediment characteristics such as texture. Another advantage to the
   GLORIA system was because the system provides information from a swath
   of seafloor, large areas could be mapped quickly. More detailed
   information and specifications of the GLORIA-II system is available
   from Somers and others (1978).

   digital data are processed and used to construct digital maps of the
   seafloor such as the one shown (Gulf of Mexico mosaic #13). Seafloor
   variation is depicted by the light and dark areas representing the high
   and low returned signal values, and can be interpreted by a geologist.

Digital Processing

   The imagery contained in these mosaics is from computer processed,
   digitally collected sidescan sonographs. The sidescan sonographs or
   swaths were first processed to correct for geometric and radiometric
   distortions that exists in the raw data. These major source of
   geometric distortions were: 1- water-depth offset; 2- slant-range
   geometry; 3- aspect distortion; and changes in the ship's speed.
   Radiometric corrections applied were: 1- a shading correction to
   correct for the attenuation of the sonar energy in water as a function
   of range; 2- a power correction for very-near-nadir data because of
   slow buildup in the energy signal transmitted by the system; 3- a
   speckle-noise correction; and 4- removal of striping noise. A more
   detailed description of the digital processing is available from Chavez
   (1986).

Digital Mosaicking

   After the sidescan sonar data swaths were processed to correct them
   geometrically and radiometrically, they were ready for digital
   mosaicking. The final results of the digital mosaicking steps were to
   create mosaics of a 2degree X 2degree (or smaller) for the survey area.
   This resulted in 16 mosaics for the Gulf of Mexico and 21 mosaics
   covering the U.S. East Coast Atlantic Continental Margin.

   To begin, the swaths, approximately 6 hours in length, were spliced
   end-to-end to make a continuous line segment were the portions of the
   ship's heading remained generally constant. The swaths were tone
   matched by applying a contrast stretch to minimize the seam where they
   were joined. Control points were then selected from the newly created
   strips. The strips were then georeferenced within it's map area. This
   step was repeated for each strip of sonar data for the specific area.

   After all the strips for a given area were georeferenced, the adjacent
   lines segments were stenciled together to create a continous mosaic. In
   cases where further registration of the strips were required to align
   seafloor features, additional ground control points and rubber sheeting
   was done prior to the stenciling. When the swaths were aligned,
   interactive stenciling of the swaths were done by drawing a polygon
   around the area of the swath to be retained. The stenciled line
   segments were then combined, sequentially building the composite map.

  On-line Mosaics

   The Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, was
   directly involved in mapping the areas of the Gulf of Mexico, Puerto
   Rico, and the U.S. East Coast Atlantic Continental Margin. The GLORIA
   imagery provides the first broad-scale view of sea-floor features and
   the effects of sedimentary processes that have been unknown or poorly
   known until recently. These data are a unique set of basic information
   that will support many future studies by government, academic, and
   industry workers. Maps and images from these areas are currently
   available on-line.
