   Escrow Violations

   In California, escrow processing can be performed under various forms
   of licensure.  Most commonly, real estate related escrows are performed
   by independent escrow companies licensed by the California Department
   of Corporations and title insurance companies licensed by the
   California Department of Insurance.  Real estate brokers licensed by
   the California Department of Real Estate can also perform escrows, but
   only in transactions where the broker is acting as an agent.  To
   determine if a specific escrow company, title company or real estate
   broker with an escrow division has been the subject of administrative
   action, please check the following sites:
     * California Department of Corporations - Escrow Agents/Employee
       Disciplinary Actions
     * California Department of Insurance - Consumer Alert/Enforcement
       Actions
