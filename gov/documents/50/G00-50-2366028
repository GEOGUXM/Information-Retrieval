   Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC) collaborated with FTS Office of
   Service Development Business Applications Development to provide an IT
   solution to a contracting process. Under a pilot program known as
   Buyers.gov Reverse Auction Exchange, the FTS team arranged a reverse
   auction for computer equipment for a customer at MacDill AFB, FL. ITAC
   contracted with CISglobal of Silver Spring, MD, to provide auction
   enabler services. CISglobal, a minority woman-owned firm, is a leader
   in e-Procurement solutions. The thirty-two minute auction resulted in a
   saving of fifteen percent below the government estimate. Reverse
   auctions are most effective when the estimated dollar value of the
   requirements is $500,000 or higher. For more information contact Jo
