   One way to get public information about an individual bank is to go to
   a Web site maintained by a federal bank regulator: the Office of the
   Comptroller of the Currency (national banks), the Federal Reserve Board
   (state chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System
   and bank holding companies) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
   Corporation (insured state banks that are not members of the Federal
   Reserve System). These agencies maintain records about the banks they
   supervise. If you want to find out about a financial institution that
   is not a bank, you can visit the Web site maintained by the Office of
   Thrift Supervision (savings and loans) or the National Credit Union
   Administration (credit unions).

   Here is a list of individual sites and what they have to offer:

   NIC - National Information Center - The National Information Center
   (NIC) provides comprehensive information on banks and other
   institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory,
   regulatory, or research interest including both domestic and foreign
   banking organizations operating in the U.S. The NIC includes the
   organizational structure of financial institutions and financial
   information for some of those institutions. Historical information is
   available on the structure of all the institutions. Financial
   information is available for selected time periods.

   Department of the Treasury - At the Department of the Treasury site,
   you can download publications, tax and other Treasury forms. Search
   orders & directives.  You will also find Freedom of Information Act
   ( FOIA) and Privacy Act requests. FOIA Contacts, FOIA FAQS, Treasury
   FOIA Sites, Directives & Handbook.

   NCUA - National Credit Union Administration - The National Credit Union
   Administration charters and supervises federal credit unions. Find out
   about The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) and the
   NCUA Fraud Hotline -- a telephone line established solely for the
   reporting of suspicious or illegal activity committed by credit union
   employees, members, or officials in federally insured credit unions.

   FFIEC - Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council - The
   Council is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform
   principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of
   financial institutions.

   FDIC - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - The Federal Deposit
   Insurance Corporation's mission is to maintain the stability of and
   public confidence in the nation's financial system.  Here you will find
   out about the FDIC's consumer outreach programs and publications that
   address the concerns of depositors and other customers of banks and
   savings associations.

   FTC - Federal Trade Commission - The FTC maintains a vast array of
   information concerning consumer protection issues, frauds and scams,
   and allows you to file a complaint online.

   also supervises federally licensed branches and agencies of foreign
   banks.

   OTS - Office of Thrift Supervision - The OTS is the primary regulator
   of all federal and many state-chartered thrift institutions, which
   include savings banks and savings and loan associations. This Web site
   provides access to information on the agency's programs and activities.
