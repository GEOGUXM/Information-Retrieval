   The Challenge

   One of the most important ecological issues concerning our planet is
   climate change. It is generally agreed that the Earth's climate will
   modify in response to radiative forcing induced by changes in
   atmospheric trace gases, cloud cover, cloud type, solar radiation, and
   tropospheric aerosols (liquid or solid particles suspended in the air).
   Clouds and aerosols both play a major role in climate since both
   affect, and are affected by, terrestrial and ocean dynamics. In order
   to develop conceptual and predictive global climate models, it is vital
   to monitor these properties. However, up to this point in time,
   monitoring changes in these parameters on a global scale has been
   difficult.

   The Solution

   The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument,
   launched on 18 December 1999 onboard the Terra Platform, is uniquely
   designed (wide spectral range, high spatial resolution, and near daily
   global coverage) to observe and monitor changes in the Earth's
   atmosphere.

   The Process

   The MODIS Atmosphere Discipline Group is developing remote sensing
   algorithms for deriving time-series data products pertaining to cloud
   and aerosol properties and distribution. These products will also be
   used as input for generating additional data products for the MODIS
   Land and MODIS Ocean Groups, as well as other EOS instrument (e.g.,
   CERES and MISR) teams. Ultimately, these products will be integrated by
   the Earth science community into conceptual and predictive global
   system models of our changing planet.
