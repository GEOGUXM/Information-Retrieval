   USGS Topographic Maps
          The USGS produces more than 80,000 kinds of topographic and
          other maps. These include the 7.5-minute topographic series,
          topographic maps at smaller scales, maps of U.S. possessions and
          territories and of Antarctica, special maps of national parks
          and monuments, and geologic and hydrologic maps.

   Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles
          A digital orthophoto quadrangle (DOQ) is a computer-generated
          image of an aerial photograph that has been orthorectified --
          altered so that it has the geometric properties of a map.

   National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)

   National Hydrography Dataset
          USGS-EPA dataset provides comprehensive coverage of hydrographic
          data for the United States.

   Landsat-7 Remote Sensing Satellite
          Data from NASA's new Landsat-7 remote sensing satellite are now
          available for purchase through the USGS EROS Data Center. To
          find out more about Landsat-7 and how to order data, visit the
          USGS Landsat-7 web site.

          On April 15, 1999, NASA successfully launched the Landsat-7
          Earth remote sensing satellite. Follow the progress of
          engineering tests and see early image acquisitions through the
          Landsat-7 Web site at the USGS's EROS Data Center. [Original

   National Atlas of the United States
          The National Atlas is designed to promote greater geographic
          awareness through the development and delivery of products that
          provide easy to use, map-like views of our natural and
          socio-cultural landscapes. The National Atlas is being designed
          to serve the interests and needs of a diverse populace in many
          ways; as an essential reference; as a framework for information
          discovery; as an instrument of education; as an aid in research;
          and as an accurate and reliable source for scientific
          information.

   Global Land 1-KM AVHRR

   EDC DAAC
          The USGS EROS Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (EDC
          DAAC) was established as part of NASA's Earth Observing System
          Data and Information System (EOSDIS) initiative to promote the
          interdisciplinary study and understanding of the integrated
          Earth system. Access to land processes data, including
          satellite- and aircraft-acquired data stored in the EDC DAAC's
          archives, plays an important role in promoting such study and
          understanding.

   Washington, DC, NAPP

   Get the Picture
          The USGS sells National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP)
          photographs. The NAPP collection covers the lower 48 States, and
          the photographs are retaken approximately every 5 years.
          Photographs from the NAPP collection can be ordered online so
          you may wish to get a picture of your home area or perhaps your
          favorite shoreline recreation area or camp site. These
          photographs also make great gifts.

   Working with Maps

   Working with Maps
          Maps of the Earth are illustrations of how we have visualized
          our planet. Throughout our history, explorers and scientists
          have tried to answer the questions of "where are we?" and "where
          are we going?" Students and teachers are invited to visit the
          USGS Learning Weband discover and explore the many meanings of
          maps.

The Planets

            Browse the Solar System
                   Browse the Solar System with the new USGS chart "Geology of the
                   Solar System." The USGS is a participant in the Mars Pathfinder
                   Mission.

   USGS

        Temporal Urban Mapping
               Temporal urban mapping develops a historical perspective of
               urban development by combining a variety of data sources into an
               integrated, multi-scale, and multi-resolution database.
