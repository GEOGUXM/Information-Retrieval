   President Bush to Request $100 Million Increase For Reading First in Fy
   2003
   Secretary Paige announces $1 billion federal investment at Reading
   Leadership Academy
   FOR RELEASE:
   January 25, 2002 Contact: Dan Langan
                    Melinda Malico
                    (202) 401-1576

   On behalf of President Bush, U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige
   today told a gathering of key education leaders and state policymakers
   that the President will seek a $100 million increase in funding for
   Reading First.

   Reading First is President Bush's program to help every young child in
   every state become a successful reader by the end of grade three. The
   program, created through the new No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, will
   help states and local school districts establish high-quality
   comprehensive reading instruction — based on scientific research — for
   children in grades K-3.

   Paige made the announcement during the concluding session of the U.S.
   Department of Education's first Reading Leadership Academy in
   Washington, D.C.

   "President Bush and I believe that reading is the foundation of all
   learning," Paige said. "Children who are never taught to read well may
   never perform at their full potential. If they are left behind because
   of poor reading instruction, they may be left behind entirely.
   President Bush is serious about providing all children with good
   reading instruction in the early years and this year his budget tripled
   federal funding for reading programs to $900 million.

   "I'm thrilled that his budget proposal for next year will include an 11
   percent increase for Reading First — bringing the federal investment in
   Reading First to $1 billion."

   The Reading Leadership Academies are designed to help state leaders
   gear up for swift and successful implementation of the new reading
   program. Secretary Paige invited governors and chief state school
   officers in each state to send a team to Washington for one of three
   academies. Two additional academies will take place in Washington,
   D.C., Feb. 13-15 and 20-22, 2002.

   Officials from Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska,
   Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming are attending the first of
   the three academies.

   scientifically based reading instruction, read Put Reading First, a

   Improvement of Early Reading Achievement, available online at:

   2003 and for the current year (FY 2002) follow. Additional information
