      The California Arts Council gratefully acknowledges the pro bono
   contribution by Goodchap Design Communications for creating the new CAC
                                    logo.

   Founded by James Goodchap in 1991, Goodchap Design Communications is an
     unusual mix of creative professionals from California and Britain.

   Goodchap Design Communications partner with clients to produce anything
      from corporate identity revisions, collateral design, trade show
   marketing and packaging to "new media" marketing communications such as
      website interface design, PowerPoint and promotional multi-media
     presentations. And they like to have fun doing it! The unique style
   combination of the designers affords powerful solutions to clients who
      are looking to distinguish themselves and their products from the
                                competition.

    To learn more about the Goodchap team and review a current portfolio,
                           go to www.goodchap.com.
