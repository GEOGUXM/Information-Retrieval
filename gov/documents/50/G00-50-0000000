             The seven-day mission will be highlighted by the mating of the
             U.S.-built Node 1 station element to the Functional Energy Block
             (FGB) which will already be in orbit, and two spacewalks to
             connect power and data transmission cables between the Node and
             the FGB. The FGB, built by Boeing and the Russian Space Agency,
             is scheduled for launch on a Russian Proton rocket from the
             Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakstan in November 1997. Node 1 was
             originally scheduled for Launch December 4, 1997 but was
             rescheduled for launch in July of 1998.

             Node 1 will be the first Space Station hardware delivered by the
             Space Shuttle. It has two Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA), one
             attached to either end. One PMA is permanently mated to the FGB
             and the other used for orbiter dockings and crew access to the
             station. Node 1 also will contain an International Standard
             Payload Rack used to support on-orbit activities once activated
             after the fifth Shuttle/Station assembly flight.

             To begin the assembly sequence, the crew will conduct a series
             of rendezvous maneuvers similar to those conducted on other
             Shuttle missions to reach the orbiting FGB. On the way, Currie
             will use the Shuttle's robot arm to place Node 1 atop the
             Orbiter Docking System. Cabana will complete the rendezvous by
             flying Endeavour to within 35 feet of the FGB, allowing Currie
             to capture the FGB with the robot arm and place it on the Node's
             Pressurized Mating Adapter.

             Once the two elements are docked, Ross and Newman will conduct
             two scheduled spacewalks to connect power and data cables
             between the Node, PMAs and the FGB. The day following the
             spacewalks, Endeavour will undock from the two components,
             completing the first Space Station assembly mission.

             Other payloads on the STS-88 mission will be the IMAX Cargo Bay
             Camera (ICBC), the Argentinean Scientific Applications
             Satellite-S (SAC-A), the MightySat 1 Hitchhiker payload, the
             Space Experiment Module (SEM-07) and Getaway Special G-093
             sponsored by the University of Michigan.

   Launch:

             December 4, 1998 3:35:34 a.m. EST (8:35:34 GMT). 5-10 minute
             launch window.

             On Thursday, December 4, 1998 the launch countdown continued on
             schedule with only a slight delay in the tart of tanking. The
             crew departed the Operations and Checkout Building shortly after
             midnight and proceeded to Pad 39-A. The hatch was closed and
             locked for flight at approximately 1:10 am EST. At 2:29am EST
             the countdown clock came out of the hold at the T-minus 20
             minute mark beginning the terminal portion of the launch
             countdown. At 2:41am EST the countdown clock entered a 45 minute
             hold at the T-minus 9 minute mark. During this time the shuttle
             launch director conducted a poll of the launch team and all
             systems were ready for flight. At 3:33am the Orbiter Access Arm
             was retracted and the command was given to the crew to close and
             lock their visors. Liftoff occured exactly ontime at 3:35:34am
             EST (8:34am GMT).

             On Wednesday, December 3, 1998 the launch attempt for a 3:58am
             EST launch was scrubbed at the T-minus 19 second mark after a
             smooth countdown. After arriving at the pad, the crew proceeded
             to the 195ft level where one by one, they ingressed into the
             orbiter. The hatch was closed at 01:56 am EST. At 3:42am EST, in
             a poll of the launch team by NTD during the T-minus 9 minute
             mark, all systems were go for launch except a constraint due to
             RTLS weather. A go was given to come out of the hold as
             scheduled and countdown to the T-minus 5 minute mark.

             At 3:49am EST, a go was given for RTLS weather and the countdown
             clock proceeded thru the optional hold at the T-minus 5 minute
             mark. The Orbiter Access Arm (OAA) was retracted at 3:51am EST
             at T-minus 7 minutes. At T-minus 4 minutes 24 seconds a master
             alarm in the crew cabin was noted and the countdown clock
             automatically stopped the clock at a built in hold at the
             T-minus 4 minute mark. The alarm was due to pressure on
             Hydraulic System #1 temporarily registering below 2800 psi
             during its startup transition from low to high.

             The launch countdown was then held at the T-31 second mark to
             further assess the situation. Shuttle system engineers attempted
             to quickly completed an assessment of the suspect hydraulic
             system and eventually gave an initial "go" to resume the
             countdown. With only seconds to respond, launch controllers were
             unable to resume the countdown clock in time to launch within
             the allotted remaining indow, which was limited due to liquid
             oxygen (Lox) drain-back constraints. Managers are discussing the
             24-hour launch turn-around plans and are expected to make a
             final determination later this morning.

             On Wednesday, December 2, 1998 Endeavour's inertial measurement
             units were activated and film installed in numerous cameras on
             the launch pad. The orbiter's communications systems were
             activated at 2:30 a.m. and safety personnel conducted debris
             walk downs. Flight crew equipment late stow began at 6 a.m. and
             the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) was moved to the park
             position at around 8 a.m. EST. Loading the external tank with
             about 500,000 gallons of cryogenic propellants began at about
             6:40 p.m and completed by 9:30pm EST..

             On Tuesday, December 1, 1998 Shuttle Endeavour's payload bay
             closeouts were complete and the doors are closed for flight. The
             orbiter's backup flight systems have been tested and load tests
             on the Shuttle's data processing system are complete. Loading of
             cryogenic reactants into Endeavour's power reactant storage and
             distribution system concluded early this afternoon. The orbiter
             midbody umbilical unit was demated and retracted into the Fixed
             Service Structure at Pad 39A. The orbiter's navigation system
             self tests and main engine final preparations were also
             completed. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 12/01/1998)

             On Monday, November 30, 1998, the crew arrived at the Kennedy
             Space Center around midnight EST and the launch countdown began
             on schedule at 7 a.m. in KSC Firing Room 3. Workers finished
             final payload bay closeouts and the payload bay doors were
             closed for flight. Air Force weather forecasters are indicating
             a 60 percent chance that weather could prohibit launch on Dec.
             3. The threat of low cloud ceilings and showers are the primary
             concern. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 11/30/1998)

             On Monday, November 23, 1998, Shuttle and International Space
             Station (ISS) managers gathered at KSC for the Flight Readiness
             Review (FRR). After reviewing Space Shuttle system and ISS
             topics, managers announced Dec. 3 as the official STS-88 launch
             date. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 11/23/1998)

             On Friday, November 6, 1998, at Launch Pad 39A, the Terminal
             Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT) concluded at about 11 a.m.
             Crew members successfully conducted a launch day dress rehearsal
             complete with an orbiter crew compartment ingress and simulated
             main engine cut-off at T-5 seconds. The crew then practiced
             emergency egress procedures assisted by the KSC close-out crew.
             The crew departs KSC today at about 2:15 p.m. headed for their
             homes in Houston, TX. Orbiter inertial measurement unit
             calibration occurs today and preparations for payload interface
             verification testing are in work. The Unity connecting module
             will be installed in the orbiter's cargo bay Nov. 13. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 11/06/1998)

             On Thursday, 11/5/98 At Launch Pad 39A, Endeavour's helium
             signature leak tests and secondary payload tests are complete.
             Gaseous nitrogen servicing of the orbiter's water spray boiler
             No. 3 and main engine testing occur this week. The STS-88 flight
             crew is at KSC to participate in the Terminal Countdown
             Demonstration Test. Crew members are being briefed on orbiter
             and payload activities, practicing emergency escape procedures
             and conducting a full dress rehearsal of launch day activities
             on Friday. The countdown test culminates with a simulated main
             engine cutoff at 11 a.m. tomorrow. The Unity connecting module
             will be installed in orbiter's cargo bay Nov. 13. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 11/05/1998)

             On Wednesday, October 21, 1998, Shuttle Endeavour is now hard
             down on Launch Pad 39A. The Shuttle began its 3.4-mile trip from
             the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the pad at about 2:18
             a.m. today. Launch pad validations are under way and tonight
             workers will conduct a planned hot fire of Endeavour's auxiliary
             power units No. 1 and No. 3. The Rotating Service Structure will
             be extended around the vehicle early Thursday morning and main
             engine flight readiness testing follows later in the day. The
             Unity Connecting Module payload arrives at the pad Monday for
             installation in the pad's payload changeout room. (Reference KSC

             On Thursday, 10/15/98 Endeavour was mounted on the orbiter
             transfer vehicle yesterday and began first motion to the Vehicle
             Assembly Building at 6:18 a.m. today. The orbiter is currently
             located in the VAB transfer aisle and will be mated to the
             STS-88 external tank and solid rocket boosters in VAB high bay 3
             later today. The Shuttle Interface Test will be conducted
             through Monday and the entire Shuttle stack will roll out to
             Launch Pad 39A on Wednesday beginning at 7 a.m. (Reference KSC

   Landing:

             December 15, 1998, KSC 10:53 pm EST

             At 9:23pm EST the crew of Endeavour was given a "go" for the
             deorbit burn and the burn occurred on time at 9:48 pm EST. The
             shuttle was originally scheduled to land on the Shuttle Landing
             Facility's (SLF) Runway 33, but the decision was made at about
             9:00 pm in switch to Runway 15 (North to South). The weather was
             excellent for landing with few clouds in the area. Sonic booms
             were heard in the area at 10:50pm EST as Endevour dropped below
             the speed of sound. At 35,000ft while traveling at 570 mph, the
             crew performed a 245 degree turn along the Heading Alignment
             Circle (HAC) to align Endeavour with Runway 15. Winds were from
             320 degrees at 5-10mph. Main gear touchdown occured at 10:53:29
             pm EST at a mission elapsed time (MET) of 11 days, 19 hours 17
             min 55 seconds. Nose Wheel Touchdown occured at at 10:53:38 pm
             EST (11 days, 19 hours, 18 minutes,4 seconds) and wheel stop at
             10:54:21pm EST. (11 days, 19 hours, 18 minutes 47 seconds).

             The landing is the 46th landing at Kennedy Space Center. and the
             18th consecutive KSC landing. It is also the 10th night landing
             in the history of the shuttle program, and the 5th KSC night
             landing.
