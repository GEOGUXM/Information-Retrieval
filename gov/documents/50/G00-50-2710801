          X International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds

     The above logo symbolizes the importance of interactions between
     pathogens and root-boring insects in the biological control of
     weeds. The insects provide an entry point for the pathogens and, in
     combination, provide better control than either agent alone. The
     background image on the logo, the jagged line, represents the Rocky
     Mountains, in which Bozeman is situated.
