   Electronics Power: Power/chamber : 258.3 Watts Power/endcap
   (32chambers) : 8265.6 Watts Power Dissipated in the Cable: Power
   supplies located at UX15 , 25m away from the wheel. AWG 4 for 25m run.
   AWG 3 for 12m run in the wheel. AWG18 for 2m run in the faraday cage
   (pigtails). Power_cable/endcap : 3936 Watts Voltage Drop/leg* : 1.66
   Volts Voltage required at UX15 : 10.32 Volts Total Power Dissipated by
   CSC : 12201.6 Watts Weight of Copper/endcap : 876 lbs. * These numbers
   represent calculations based on electronics that were not subjected to
   radiation. Upon completion of the radiation induced effects tests the
   numbers will be appropriately re-calculated.
