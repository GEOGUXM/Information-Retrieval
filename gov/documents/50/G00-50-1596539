   Viewer Privacy and Security Notice

      Introduction

      1. This World Wide Web (WWW) site is provided as a public service by
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

      2. Information presented on this FEMA WWW site is considered public
      information and may be distributed or copied. Use of appropriate
      byline/photo/image credits is requested.

      Information collected and stored automatically

      1. The information we learn about you from your visit to our website
      depends upon what functions you perform when visiting our site.

      2. For site management, information is collected for statistical
      purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to
      create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as
      assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining
      technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or
      problem areas.

      3. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
      read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
      information about your visit automatically. This information does not
      identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the
      following information about your visit:

        * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
          private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
          from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
          number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
          are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
        * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
        * The date and time you access our site;
        * The pages you visit; and
        * If you linked to the FEMA website from another website, the address
          of that website.
          We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
          visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and
          the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
          information about individuals and their visits.

   Cookies:

   1. The only cookies FEMA uses on its web are those that allow several
   complex software user-driven applications to work correctly. For
   instance, our online ordering services (for publications of the U.S.
   Fire Administration and for the FEMA Flood Map Store) allow users to
   "shop" through the catalog. As a user goes through and checks off a
   series of publications, each transaction is a separate "signal" sent
   between their computer and ours. In order to maintain a complete record
   of the total order, the FEMA server sends a cookie to identify that
   user's order. The only information collected is related to that
   particular publication order and this information is NOT retained once
   the order is sent.
     * This is the state of technology on the Web. There currently exist
       no non-cookie applications for this multi-order function.

   Please be assured that FEMA's use of cookie technology is NOT a covert
   attempt to either collect or analyze information on Internet users.

   Information Collected from E-mails and Web Forms

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail or using Web Forms:

     * You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information,
       for example, in an electronic mail message containing a complaint
       or compliment. We use personally-identifying information from
       viewers in various ways to further the usefulness and accuracy of
       the information contained on our Web site or to add new sections
       and services. Visit Feedback, http://www.fema.gov/feedback/, to
       learn what can happen to the information you provide us when you
       send us e-mail.
     * We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying
       information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
       provide such information to us.

   Security and Intrusion Detection

   1. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, this government computer system employs
   software programs to monitor host and network traffic to identify
   unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise
   cause damage.

   2. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other
   attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
   Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for
   regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records
   Administration guidelines.

   3. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act."

   Privacy Statement Relating to System Of Records

   insurance products for an associated fee. The following relate to the
   purchase of FEMA flood related products.

   E-Commerce Privacy Statement

   1. Personal information submitted by a user in a comment or question
   via phone, fax, or e-mail is not distributed to parties outside of the
   FEMA Flood Map Store.

   2. Only information submitted through the FEMA Flood Map Store ordering
   process is protected. Please do NOT include credit card information in
   E-mail. The open nature of Internet E-mail prevents FEMA from

   3. Using commercially available services for security and credit card
   transactions, the FEMA Flood Map Store ensures that only authorized
   personnel view credit card numbers that are submitted through the FEMA
   Flood Map Store.

   4. Personal information that is supplied by a user when submitting an
   order via the FEMA Flood Map Store, phone, fax, or e-mail is used for
   fulfilling that order. This information may be used to notify customers
   of new products that may be of interest to them.

   5. Where identifying information is asked, it is used only for
   responding to users' comments or questions and is not made available
   for other purposes.

   6. To assist users in finding official Government information, we
   provide links to other Web sites. Once users have left the FEMA Flood
   Map Store and entered another site, they are subject to the privacy
   policy of that site.

   7. As noted above, session (temporary) cookies, not permanent cookies,
   are used to facilitate the on line ordering process.

   Map Service Center Encryption Statement

   The FEMA Flood Map Store utilizes industry standard Secure Socket
   Layer, SSL, encryption in conjunction with freely available web
   browsers. The SSL technology ensures private, secure transactions for
   customers who submit electronic orders by credit card through the FEMA
