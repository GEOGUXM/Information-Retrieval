   What CAP can do for you
   [clearpixel.gif] [clearpixel.gif]

   Led by writer-aviator Gill Robb Wilson, with the support of General
   Henry "Hap" Arnold, the Civil Air Patrol was created on Dec. 1,
   1941--one week before Pearl Harbor.

   For more than 50 years, CAP has performed three congressionally
   mandated missions: Aerospace Education, Cadet Programs and Emergency

   CAP is the civilian Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force and organized along
   military lines. There are more than 1,700 units; half of which have
   both senior members and cadets attached.

   With more than 60,000 members, over 500 light aircraft and an extensive
   communications capability, the CAP is fully equipped to complete its
   missions for America.

   Cadets and senior members provide a wealth of talent that can be drawn
   on for many different projects and events.
