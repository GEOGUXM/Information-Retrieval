                       Fathers and Childrens Health

     * 21 Million Children's Health:  Our Shared Responsibility.  The
       Medical Child Support Working Group's Report to Congress, June
       2000.
       In the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998,
       Congress directed the establishment of the Medical Support Working
       Group by the Secretaries of HHS and Labor. The charge of the
       Working Group was to identify the impediments to the effective
       enforcement of medical child support and recommend solutions to
       those impediments. The Working Group's 76 recommendations are
       presented in this report to Congress. Besides the full report, the
       Executive Summary and list of the recommendations with references
       to the pages where they are discussed are available online.
     * Nonresident Fathers:  To What Extent Do They Have Access to
       Employment-Based Health Care Coverage, June 2000.
       The report contains the findings presented to the Medical Support
       Working Group during the course of their deliberations. These
       findings, based on analysis of the Current Population Survey Child
       Support Supplement and the Survey of Income and Program
       Participation, provided a fact-based analytical framework for the
       Working Group activities. Prepared by Laura Wheaton of the Urban
       Institute.
