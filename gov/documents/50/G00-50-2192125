     Dockets before 1995.
   The computerized Docket Management System was conceived and created in
   1995. It was decided at that time to scan documents into the current
   DMS system beginning with the calendar date of January 1, 1995. Any
   dockets submitted to DOT Dockets prior to January 1, 1995 will not
   appear in the current computerized Docket Management System.

   This area will help you determine if you have a document or TIFF viewer
   already available (click here to go directly to Step 3 for the test).

   If you were not able to see the document in Step 3, then you will need
   to install a document viewer. If you are using Windows 95/98/NT then go
   to step one. If you are using a Macintosh computer please go directly
   to Step 2. If you choose a viewer other than Imaging for Windows, the
   viewer will install itself into your current internet browser to view
   the documents.

   Step 1: Do You Need a Viewer?

   For Windows 95/98/NT:

   Go to the Start button (usually found on the bottom of your screen) and
   click on it. On the pop up menu go up to "Programs", then "Accessories"
   and see if there is a program called "Imaging". If you do NOT find
   imaging there please proceed to Step 2 and select a viewer to install.
   If you have this program you do not need to install a viewer. You may
   use "Imaging" to be able to view our images. Please proceed to Step 3
   to test the ability of your viewer.

   Step 2: Get A Viewer

   The sites listed below contain instructions on how to download image
   viewers for your computer. The viewers are available for evaluation
   purposes but must be purchased according to the vendors guidelines.
   Imaging for Windows is a Free application. Viewers are available for
   both PC and Macintosh computers and for all popular internet browsers.

   Each of the sites below has detailed information for installation.
   Follow the instructions to complete installation of your chosen viewer.

   Click below to choose a viewer that will work with your computer:


   [dot_red.jpg]   AlternaTiff by Medical Informatics Engineering (Free)
   for WIN95, WIN98 and NT.
   [dot_red.jpg]   Eastman Software Imaging for Windows (Free)
   This is for use with Windows 95/98/NT. This also comes on your Windows
   98 and Windows NT setup CD-Rom.
   [dot_red.jpg]   TiffSurfer by VisionShape

   [dot_red.jpg]   CPC View by Cartesian

   for WFW311, WIN95 and NT.  (The cost for this viewer is somewhat
   expensive.  Be sure you read all the information before you commit to
   downloading this viewer.)
   They also have a Macintosh version but you will need to contact them
   directly.
   [dot_red.jpg]   Docview
   for WFW311, WIN95 and NT.
   [dot_red.jpg]   GraphicConverter 3.1.1(Macintosh platform only)
   (You may want to utilize the Mirror 1 or Mirror 2 site for a quicker
   download.)
   If you are using AOL, go to the keyword "MUT".  Use the Mac Software
   File Search and search for "Lemke".  Download ver. 3.1.1.  This should
   take about 20 minutes.
   Step 3: Test the Viewer

   Test your viewer with this 3-page image. If you can view the image, hit
   the back button on your browser to return to this page and you can
   proceed to Step 4. If you can not view the image return to Step 1.
   Step 4: Go to the search page

   After you have installed the viewer, you are ready to go.   Just return
   to the search page, perform a query, and then select a document from
   the "hitlist".  The "View Image" button will be at the bottom of the
   document page.  Selecting the button will open the document image.
