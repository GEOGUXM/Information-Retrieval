   DOE R&D FY2000 Portfolio
   It has often been said that the only constant is change. While change
   may be constant, progress is achieved only when change is directed
   toward defined goals and objectives. Innovation, which is the ability
   to direct change based upon a strong scientific and technological
   infrastructure, is a characteristic strength of this Nation. The
   Department of Energy exercises stewardship responsibility for the
   scientific and technological infrastructure that supports the
   innovation that has created our national and economic security and
   environmental integrity. Today the Department of Energy is one of the
   largest sponsors of basic and applied research and development for the
   Nation.

   In 1997, the Department published the U.S. Department of Energy
   Strategic Plan -- Providing America with Energy Security, Environmental
   Quality and Science Leadership (September 1997), organizing the
   departmental strategic goals according to four strategic business
   lines: Science, Energy, Environmental Quality and National Security.
   These business lines comprise the four major mission areas through
   which all the Departments activities are directed, providing a
   comprehensive, integrated view of the Departments programs and
   offices, and the context within which the programs and offices manage
   and execute their funding.

   In 1999, the Department initiated a Research and Development (R&D)
   Portfolio management approach to integrate and strengthen the planning,
   management and administration of this $7 billion enterprise. The
   Departments complete R&D portfolio is described in a four volume set
   comprised of one volume for each business line. In addition, this
   Overview provides a top-down summary of the entire R&D Portfolio. It
   describes the background and rationale for the Departments investments
   in research and development and some of the resulting benefits to the
   Nation. It also describes the new approach to R&D management that is
   being implemented through the development of the R&D portfolio and
   provides a description and overview of the individual business line
   portfolios (Chapters 3-6). Chapter 2 of this volume provides an
   analysis of the Departments R&D investment portfolio.

   The general structure and format of each business line portfolio is
   illustrated in Figure 1. The portfolio volumes are structured according
   to the four business lines, rather than according to DOE programs and
   offices. The participation and contribution each program or office
   makes to each business line portfolio is indicated in the business line
   portfolio. The program description of the R&D areas identifies science
   and technology needs, and the relevance and drivers of R&D activities.
   Specific R&D areas are described and the appropriated FY99, FY00, and
   requested FY01 funding levels for each R&D area are indicated. Key
   accomplishments are described and an analysis of investment trends
   provides a short-term picture of the general direction investments in
   each R&D area have taken.

   The R&D Portfolio provides separate, comprehensive descriptions of the
   R&D investments in each of the Department's four strategic business
   linesEnergy, Environmental Quality, National Security and Science.
