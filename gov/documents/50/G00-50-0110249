Welcome

Welcome to CalGOLD

In 1992 the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA),
   combined with local and regional agencies, established a network of
   permit assistance centers throughout the state to help businesses
   comply with environmental and other regulations. So far, these centers
   have helped thousands of businesses establish or expand their
   operations. By giving businesses much of the information they need at a
   single location and having permitting experts from state, local, or
   regional agencies on site, the Permit Assistance Centers have removed
   much of the hassle and confusion of complying with regulations.

   This year, due to the outstanding success achieved by the program and
   in an effort to expand program coverage from the 14 regional Centers to
   the entire state, Cal/EPA created California Government: On-Line to
   Desktops (CalGOLD) to provide permit assistance on the Internet in a
   cost-effective, consumer-driven manner.

   Cal/EPA is continuing to partner with local and regional agencies in
   the state for greater coordination of multi-agency permitting processes
   on the Internet. The Centers are now collecting state, local, and
   regional permitting, licensing, and other requirements for specific
   businesses to maximize the use and convenience of CalGOLD.
     * Special software has been developed to provide customized responses
       to businesses initial permit service requests  all with a click of
       a finger.
     * Current forms and applications required by a wide range of
       permitting authorities will be available to businesses on the
       Internet. Some can be completed and submitted right over the
       Internet.
     * The CalGOLD site will also offer direct Internet links to state,
       local, regional, and federal permitting authorities for more
       information.

   Local agencies and business groups will be able to extend the reach of
   this exciting new service  identifying business-by-business
   requirements for all state, local, regional, and federal permits 
   simply by creating a link to CalGOLD from their own Internet sites.

   Your suggestions and comments on how to improve the usefulness of
   CalGOLD are always appreciated.
