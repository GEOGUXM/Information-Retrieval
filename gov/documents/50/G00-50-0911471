   Introduction

   [Photo of anemone and starfish courtesy Deborah Lee Soltesz] Coral
   reefs are in peril worldwide for a variety of reasons, including
   excessive sedimentation, eutrophication, bleaching due to high seawater
   temperature, overfishing, anchor damage, and boat grounding. Reefs in
   remote areas are declining due to reasons not yet well established.
   Mapping is an important first step in identifying these changes.
   However, the lack of geographic and thematic maps of coral reefs has
   been identified by a number of agencies and academic panels as a major
   weakness in our understanding of reefs and our ability to assess
   change.

   The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has the capability to
   produce digital image maps useful for conducting unprecedented detailed
   mapping of coral reef environments. The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology
   Program has funded a project to study geologic processes affecting
   coral reef habitats. A component of this project is to investigate the
   use of remotely sensed image and spatial data to help map and study
   coral reef environments. Interpretation of the remotely sensed data is
   corroborated by extensive field mapping and correlation with field
   measured distribution and density of coral cover. The focus of this web
   page deals with the remote sensing work done for the Pacific Ocean
   component of the USGS coral reef project.

   The Goal

   The main goal of this project task is to investigate and analyze
   remotely sensed image data to determine their applicability for
   detecting and mapping the location of live and dead reef areas, density
   of coral cover, and the major type of coral present, as well as algae,
   silt/mud, and carbonate sand cover. High resolution multitemporal
   airborne image data are being analyzed for their potential to help map
   coral reef environments, and to detect change and monitor clear shallow
   waters.

   Regions of Study

   Our main effort up to now has been on the island of Moloka'i, Hawai'i.
   Presented on the following webpage are some of the USGS research and
   applications of remote sensing to the coral reef environment on
   Moloka'i. Included are image maps and products generated using a
   variety of sources of remotely sensed data for the USGS Project for
   Geologic Studies of Coral Reef Habitats:

   Moloka'i, Hawai'i

   The USGS Project for Geologic Studies of Coral Reef Habitats also
   includes investigations in Oahu, Maui, and Biscayne National Park,
   Florida. Information, maps, and imagery from the remote sensing
   research in these regions will be linked on this page as they become
   available.

   Acknowlegements: There are other USGS and University of Hawai'i
   scientists involved in the coral reefs project whose field data have
   been used, are being used, or will be used to help in the analysis and
   interpretation of the remotely sensed images. Example data sets
   includes sediment thickness, suspended sediments, algae types, coral
   density, and coral types. Those involved include Curt Storlazzi of the
   University of California, Santa Cruz; Andrea Ogsten of the University
   of Washington; and Paul L. Jokiel, Lucile Marchese, and Will Smith of
   the University of Hawai'i;
