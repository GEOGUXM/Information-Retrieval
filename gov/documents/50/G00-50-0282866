   HIGHLIGHTS
   The regional trail system in King County continues to grow to meet the
   needs of the public. Since the first 2 miles of County trail was paved
   in 1975, the system now offers over 100 miles of paved and nearly 70
   miles of unpaved trails. Some of the most recent additions include the
   Snoqualmie Valley Trail (in the Three Forks Natural Area) and the
   cross-state John Wayne Pioneer Trail. Many additional miles of the
   Cedar River Trail south of Renton have been paved. Many more miles of
   trail corridor, in different parts of King County, have been acquired
   and are presently in the planning process.

   In 1997, the King County Park System launched Trail College in
   partnership with the non-profit Washington Trails Association. Trail
   College is a monthly program at King County's Cougar Mountain Regional
   Wildland Park (near the intersection of I-90 and I-405) that provides
   year-round trail maintenance volunteer opportunities and training in a
   "wild" setting close to the metropolitan area. Many of the volunteers
   who "graduate" from Trail College devote additional hours to King
   County trails in the winter months, and then head out to backcountry
   volunteer projects in the summer.

   All told, there are dozens of public trails all over King County for
   recreation and for commuters. Some trails connect urban areas with
   suburbs and rural communities, such as the Burke-Gilman and Sammamish
   River Trails or the Interurban and Green River Trails. Others, such as
   hiking trails at King County's Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park,
   take trail users "back in time" to earlier days when coal mining
   thrived or Cold War missile bases kept watch over the region.

   For updates on seasonal trail conditions (as well as acquisition and
   development of new trails), please visit the King County Parks website
   or call 206-296-4232.
