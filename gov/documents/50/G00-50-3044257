   Description of research projects:

   BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF POSTHARVEST DISEASES OF POME FRUITS
   Description of research projects
   The main objective of the project is to develop microbial-based
   biological control of postharvest decays of pome fruits. The first
   targeted pathogens are Penicillium expansum causing blue mold and
   Botrytis cinerea causing gray mold.

   [BioSave110.jpg] Our research demonstrated feasibility of using
   biological control against these fruit decays on pome fruits and, in
   cooperation with EcoScience Inc., our antagonist was commercialized,
   and has been used by packinghouses for the past three years. Presently
   the work is focused on enhancing the biocontrol system and expanding
   its usage to different postharvest handling practices. We use three
   main approaches to enhance the biocontrol system:



   I) Improving antagonist selection and developing antagonist mixtures
   with superior biocontrol potential.
   II) Improving performance of biocontrol by combining it with
   non-fungicidal methods, and changing the environment to the benefit of
   the antagonist.
   III) Improving the antagonist strain through physiological manipulation
   and genetic modification to increase its ecological fitness and
   biocontrol function.
   In order to expand usage of biological control to other fruit handling
   systems, we conduct research on developing biocontrol for postharvest
   fruit handling in the decentralized fruit production in the Eastern and
   Central United States. In these areas, for example, the suspension for
   drenching fruit after harvest is kept for up to one week as opposed to
   the large packinghouses in western part of the country, where there is
   more fruit drenched per packinghouse each day and the suspensions are
   changed daily. Maintaining treatment suspensions for one week reduces
   effectiveness of the biocontrol agent, because it results in longer
   then recommended exposure to the damaging action of diphenylamine
   (DPA), an antioxidant used for protection against superficial scald in
   drenching solution. Thus, we are developing a biocontrol system which
   is based on an antagonist(s) compatible with prolonged exposure to
   DPA.
