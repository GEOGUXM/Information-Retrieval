     __________________________________________________________________

                                  Welcome!

   The Erie County Clerk's Office is the business center for the County.
   The Clerk's Office, including our Auto Bureau, processes more than 2
   million transactions per year. All records for the purchase and sale of
   real property and numerous other public documents are recorded and
   filed in this Office.

   For the 14th consecutive year, the Erie County Clerk's Office has
   delivered excess revenue back to Erie County taxpayers. Since 1988, the
   total accumulated surplus of the Office has been more than $12 million.
   Our net operating surplus for 2000 is $230,000. Gross receipts totaled
   $62.4 million, with $56.1 million of that amount distributed to the
   State, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, cities and town
   governments.

   Our Office has continued to develop technology enhancements to our
   systems. A growing portion of the records maintained in the County
   Clerk's Office have become accessible on a 24/7 basis through an
   intranet service that is used extensively by businesses which regularly
   search our documents.

   With the assistance of the County Executive and the Legislature, we
   were provided a $1 million appropriation in 2000 that will allow us to
   back scan and index deeds and mortgages going back to 1980. This will
   add thirteen years to the electronic data base which we already
   maintain for this information. This facilitates the work of attorneys
   and title companies who handle real estate matters for the public and
   businesses.

   In 2000 the Clerk's Office received a State grant to digitize our
   immigration records. This will preserve the records, improve their
   availability and save space. We are also completing the digitizing of
   maps which are maintained in our Office, with the same benefits.

   In the Erie County Auto Bureau, the collection of $21.4 million
   (including sales tax) in gross revenue resulted in the retention of
   $2.1 million for the County. A decrease in county retention from
   previous years is directly attributable to the centralization of
   license and registration activities of the State. During the past year,
   this loss was offset to a small degree by the receipt of a state grant
   which originated with the State Senate with the assistance of Senator
   Dale Volker in the amount of $50,000. Another grant, sponsored by
   Majority Leader Paul Tokasz, will make $115,000 available for Auto
   Bureau projects.

   Many State mandated services are performed with little or no revenue
   for the County. This is an area we will continue to address.

   Our Office has been actively involved with county Public Works
   officials, architects and contractors in preparations for the move of
   the Downtown Auto Bureau to a new location later in 2001, and the move
   of the entire Registrar Section to Old County Hall in 2002.

   The activities of the County Clerk's Office are literally an open book,
   and our Office is available to access all available public records. Our
   Auto Bureau's four branches are able to handle any motor vehicle
   registration or licensing matters. Through the internet, on the
   telephone, or in person, we look forward to serving you!
