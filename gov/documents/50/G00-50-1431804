   The Colorado River District - protecting Western Colorado's water since
   1937

        GIS Data for the CRWCD is Now Available On-line at "Gagepage"

   Thanks to a cooperative effort with the Southwest Data Center in
   Ridgway, Colorado, we are now providing access to geographic
   information system (GIS) map coverages and data over the internet.
   These coverages can be manipulated using a standard Internet browser,
   with the help of ESRI's ArcIMS server software. To use this website
   effectively, the user requires basic GIS skills.  To learn more about
   this software, please visit the ESRI website, especially the support
   area for ArcIMS.

   "Gagepage" currently allows the user to link to realtime USGS and DWR
   stream flow graphs by clicking on stream gage locations.  The user can
   zoom, pan, identify, and query the water resources spatial database
   provided by the Division of Water Resources.  We are planning to
   enhance this site for you, so we are interested in your feedback.
   Please let us know what you think of our "Gagepage", and any
   suggestions you may have by e-mail.
