        "The essential fact is that all the pictures which science now draws
        of nature, and which alone seem capable of according with
        observational facts, are mathematical pictures."

                                                            --Sir James Jeans

                    What is So Special About Formation Flying?

            A collection of spacecraft may be categorized as a fleet, a
      constellation, or a formation, depending on how closely the spacecraft
                          are coupled in time and space.


   Fleet
        * A fleet, such as the Space Shuttles Discovery, Columbia, and
          Atlantis, is a collection of discrete spacecraft whose flights have
          no particular relationship to each other in time or space.


   Constellation
        * A constellation, such as the 24 NAVSTAR Global Positioning
          Satellites orbiting in six orbital planes around Earth, are
          discrete spacecraft that are partially organized in time and space
          and controlled separately from Earth.


   Formation Flier
        * A spacecraft formation, a new technology never before tested in
          space, includes two or more spacecraft in a tightly controlled
          spatial configuration, whose operations are closely synchronized,
          with a collective control system distributed among the spacecraft
          so that the individual spacecraft are not controlled from Earth.

      Flying two or more spacecraft in a precise formation presents a number
                              of complex challenges:
        * The spacecraft must have a sensory and control system enabling it
          to attain and maintain a precise relative position.
        * The spacecraft must have a sensory and control system enabling it
          to attain a specified attitude, with all spacecraft targeting the
          desired object.
        * The spacecraft must be able to communicate with each other.

      To make interferometer observations from space, the spacecraft must be
                   able to perform a number of basic maneuvers.
