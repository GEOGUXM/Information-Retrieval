     * DRAFT TIA bulletin: Traffic Management in ATM Networks Over
       Satellite Links
          + Abstract:
            This report presents a survey of the traffic management issues
            in the designing and implementation of satellite-ATM networks.
            First a reference satellite-ATM network architecture is
            presented along with an overview of the service categories
            available in ATM networks. The error characteristics of
            satellite channels, and techniques to improve the error
            characteristics, and the impact on ATM network performance are
            then discussed. A delay model for satellite networks and the
            major components of delay and delay variation are described. A
            survey of design options for TCP over UBR, GFR and ABR
            services in ATM is presented next. The main focuses is on
            traffic management issues. Several recommendations on the
            design options for efficiently carrying data services over
            satellite-ATM networks are presented.
