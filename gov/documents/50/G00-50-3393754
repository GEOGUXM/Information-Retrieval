   Since its establishment in 1996, the Department of Clinical Bioethics
   has revitalized existing bioethics activities at the National
   Institutes of Health and launched a series of new educational and
   research initiatives. Included among our offerings is a 2-year
   fellowship program targeted to promising scholars with either
   undergraduate of doctoral-level degrees, and a variety of conferences
   and courses ranging from the ethics of human subject research to issues
   in managed care. The Department's research efforts are divided into
   three distinct areas: health policy, human subjects research, and
   genetics.

   Departmental organizational structure
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center is the world's largest research
   hospital and the site of NIH clinical research for over 50 years. A
   bioethicist first served the needs of the NIH research community in
   1977. However, when John Gallin became director of the Clinical Center
   in 1995, bioethics became a major initiative. This single ethics
   position became a full-fledged program, the goal to create a premier
   center for bioethics that would compliment and inform the NIH's
   cutting-edge program of biomedical reseearch. In this stimulating
   environment of scientific discovery and burgeoning new technologies,
   the Department of Clinical Bioethics has flourished, wrestling with
   major policy issues, offering educational and clinical services, and
   developing numerous research projects to help advance and inform public
   policy debate.
