   Holocaust Victim's Unpaid Insurance Claims
                                             [Cdismal.gif]

   During World War II, many Jewish families in Europe purchased life
   insurance policies as financial protection for loved ones who would
   survive the war. However, Nazi Germany did not preserve insurance
   policy documents nor did they issue death certificates for Jews and
   countless untold others murdered in the concentration camps. As a
   result, many Holocaust victims and their heirs to this day have been
   unable to collect on the policies purchased over half a century ago.

   The State of California's Department of Insurance has played a pivotal
   role in protecting the rights of Holocaust survivors and their heirs.
   California was instrumental in the establishment of the International
   Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) and continues to
   participate in finding a solution to this issue through its membership
   on the ICHEICs executive board. The California Department of Insurance
   is one of three states representing the National Association of
   Insurance Commissioners on the Plenary Committee of this important
   international commission.
