                        Make the Sky your Classroom!

   For thirty-four years the National Congress has provided educators with
   professional development, personal growth and unlimited networking
   opportunities. The Congress offers participants the opportunity to
   share new experiences and discover learning tools to engage students at
   all grade levels in hands-on/minds-on classroom activities.
   National Congress benefits educators by giving them a unique
   opportunity to explore the latest tools, standards and techniques
   available for use in today's classrooms. Master teachers from around
   the nation present national standards-based sessions that show
   educators how they can inspire and challenge their students to excel in
   science, math, technology, language arts, social studies and other
   subjects.

   Educators attending the Congress will receive volumes of information
   and practical hands-on training on how to use aviation and space themes
   to teach science, math, technology plus other subjects in their
   classrooms. How these themes tie in with National Standards will be a
   major part of the conference.
   One thing is for certain, once you attend the Congress, you'll never
   teach the same again!
