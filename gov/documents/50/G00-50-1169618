                      Integrative Neural Immune Program
          ________________________________________________________

   The NIH Integrative Neural Immune Program is designed to foster
   intramural interdisciplinary research in the field of neural-immune
   interactions, the biological basis of the so-called Mind-Body
   interaction. The Programs structure facilitates inter-institute,
   inter-agency, university, and private sector partnering to further its
   interdisciplinary goals. Subject areas include a broad range of
   research topics from the study of molecular, cellular and
   neuroanatomical mechanisms of neural immune interactions to systems
   level analysis of communications between the central nervous, endocrine
   and immune systems. This research has relevance to the role of the
   immune system in neuronal cell death and repair, neuronal development
   and plasticity, and the role of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems
   in susceptibility and resistance to autoimmune/inflammatory and
   allergic diseases. Basic research in this area has important clinical
   implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of
   diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, neuro-AIDS,
   stroke and nerve trauma.  This research will inform our understanding
   of the relationship between depression and immune diseases, and the
   effects of stress and belief on immune-mediated diseases, such as
   arthritis, allergic and infectious diseases.

   The Integrative Neural Immune Program is an interdisciplinary
   intramural research program designed to bridge neurobiology and
   immunology laboratories and related clinical branches through a series
   of Cores, including an Administrative Core, Scientific Communications
   Core, Training Core, Laboratory Core and Virtual Core. The Program is
   currently in development and will initially emphasize scientific
   communications and interactions between participating labs, through an
   on campus Neural Immune lecture series and a series of
   intramural-extramural workshops and conferences aimed at defining the
   current state of the field and important research agendas for the
   future.
   The first of the conferences hosted by the Neural Immune Program is The
   Science of Mind-Body Interactions, sponsored by the John D. and
   Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and co-sponsored by 14 NIH
   Institutes, Centers and Offices. Other initiatives include
   identification of resources required to facilitate interdisciplinary
   collaborative research and development of a Neural Immune Training
   Program partnered with area universities. The ultimate goal of the
   Program will be to allow researchers to rapidly address cutting edge
   multi-disciplinary research questions pertinent to neural immune
   interactions and to translate basic research findings into tangible
   clinical health outcomes.
