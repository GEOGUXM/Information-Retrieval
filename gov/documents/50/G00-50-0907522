   Welcome to the home pages for the operational wave models of NOAA/NCEP.
   As of July 30, 2001, this page includes the new hurricane wave model
   for the North Atlantic. Please also visit the experimental wave model
   pages. There are several ways to access the model results and related
   information :
     * The interactive data interface (JavaScript required)
       (troubleshooting) gives access maps, spectral plots and spectral
       text bulletins with a point-and-click interface (several model runs
       available).
     * The tabular data interface gives access to the same data, but is
       organized with links in several large tables (most recent model run
       only).
     * The text data interface gives access to this data in lists, without
       using any graphical web elements (most recent model run only).
     * The most recent ERS2 altimeter wind and wave data.
     * The products page gives a short description of all data accessible
       through the above interfaces, and instructions on getting
       additional binary data from our FTP site. The primer gives a short
       description of how to interpret data presented here.
     * A historical archive of wave hindcast results produced with the
       latest version of the wave models can be accessed through an
       interactive (JavaScript required) or tabular interface.

   The operational ocean wave predictions of NOAA/NWS/NCEP are performed
   using the wave model WAVEWATCH III (source code available) using
   operational products of NCEP as input. This combination of inputs and
   wave model is called NOAA WAVEWATCH III or NWW3. The wave model suite
   consists of global and regional implementations. As background
   information, a list of selected references and a chronological list of
   model changes are available. Finally, extensive validation data are
   available for the global, Alaskan Waters and Western North Atlantic
   models. Sign up for the OMB mailing list for pertinent updates on these
   products.
