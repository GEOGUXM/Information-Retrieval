   What is informal education?
   Informal education happens outside the formal classroom. Its commonly
   called lifelong learning, as people of all ages continue to seek
   knowledge and enrich their lives.

   Public Outreach
   The Solar System Ambassador Program is a public outreach program
   designed to work with motivated volunteers across the nation.
   Volunteers are asked to organize and conduct public events that
   communicate exciting discoveries and plans for exploration in Solar
   System research and technology through non-traditional forums, e.g.
   Rotary Clubs, libraries, museums, planetariums, "star parties," mall
   displays, etc.

   There are now 278 Ambassadors in 50 states and Puerto Rico bringing the
   excitement of space to the public. Ambassadors are space enthusiasts,
   K-12 in-service educators, retirees, community college teachers, and
   members of the general public interested in providing greater service
   and inspiration to the community at large.

   After School Programs
   LA's BEST (Better Educated Students for Tomorrow) is an after school
   enrichment program serving 17,000 third through fifth grade students in
   101 inner city elementary schools within the Los Angeles Unified School
   District. LA's BEST is a partnership between the Office of the Mayor of
   Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second
   largest school district in the country.

   JPL provides teacher enhancement workshops for science leaders and for
   activity consultants. JPL also assists in the implementation of a group
   science project approach, where teams of three or four students work
   collaboratively to complete a science learning project for judging at
   local fairs, regional fairs, and a City-wide fair held at JPL in March.
   This year's "JPL Daze at LA's BEST," when JPLers visit as many school
   sites as possible on a single day to conduct hands-on science inquiry
   experiences will be on December 5, 2001

   Museums, Science Centers, and Planetariums
   Space Place partners include over 150 museums and libraries (and a few
   zoos and aquariums) in smaller towns and cities across the nation.
   These partners create a Space Place display area in their own
   facilities and receive several mailings each year of display materials.
   Visit the award-winning Space Place website to try fun activities for
   K-6 students.
