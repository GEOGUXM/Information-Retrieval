   The Center for Information Technology's Software Distribution Project
   (SDP) is sponsoring a Vendor Day.

   The SDP provides major software titles to more than 40,000 customers
   from NIH and DHHS. Although the project is far reaching, there are many
   employees and current participants that are unaware of the benefits of
   the SDP.

   The purpose of this event is to provide an open forum where the NIH and
   DHHS community can meet with the various vendors that are associated
   with the SDP. The format for the event will be exhibit style, in
   additional to formal presentations by some of the exhibitors.
