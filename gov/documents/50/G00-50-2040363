   Located in Portland, Oregon, the Protected Resources Division (PRD)
   provides program oversight, and regional policy guidance on the
   conservation of at-risk anadromous, estuarine, and marine fishes in the
   NMFS Northwest Region. The PRD staff includes biologists, natural
   resource specialists, and policy analysts who work in conjunction with
   other NMFS programs to help administer provisions of the U.S.
   Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the past, this work has focused
   exclusively on imperiled West Coast stocks of salmon and steelhead;
   recently, however, NMFS is beginning to examine the status of several
   species of Puget Sound marine fishes. PRD's work includes:
     * Assisting with species status reviews that determine the condition
       of the regions salmon stocks and making recommendations on whether
       ESA listings are warranted;
     * Evaluating the efficacy of conservation efforts aimed at protecting
       at-risk stocks and coordinating recovery programs that protect the
       listed species while stocks rebuild;
     * Consulting with scientists on all research projects dealing with
       listed salmon stocks;
     * Developing regional policies relating to NMFS ESA responsibilities;
       and
     * Promoting education/outreach activities to enhance public
       understanding of salmon conservation issues.
