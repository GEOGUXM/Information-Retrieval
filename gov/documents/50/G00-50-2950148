                               Net Conferences
                           What is Net Conferencing?
     Net Conferencing is an Internet-based transmission technology combined
     with standard telephone line connection. This technology makes possible
      simultaneous real time viewing, listening, and discussion of subject
      matter presented live in the form of a Power Point presentation. The
      participants are able to ask questions by typing them on the keyboard
        at any time or simply by asking them over the telephone, as in a
                            standard teleconference.
                        What do you need to participate?
       You will need access to both your telephone and to a computer with
      Internet capability. This means 2 telephone lines. If you do not have
          both, you will still be able to participate by using just the
                                   telephone.
