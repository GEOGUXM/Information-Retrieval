                             The Marbled Grouper

   [marbbig.jpg] The marbled grouper is one of the least sighted grouper
   in all of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. These animals are usually
   found at depths below safe diving limits, and only rarely venture up to
   the top of the reef.  When diving on the Flower Garden Banks and
   Stetson Bank, look for this fish along walls or drop-offs. Marbled
   grouper are distinguished by the very steep forehead.

   Notice how well this fish is camouflaged?

   In general, fish are camouflaged for two reasons... 1) to avoid being
   eaten, and 2) to avoid being detected by potential prey.  A grouper
   like this is a predator, so its camouflage is most useful for sneaking
   up on potential prey.   However, even large grouper like this one can
   fall prey to predators such as sharks, so camouflage designed for
   offense can quickly become crucial for defense should a larger predator
   appear!
