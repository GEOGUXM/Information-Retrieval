   ARTICLE C.1 INTRODUCTION

   Chronic recording of single unit activity from large numbers of neurons
   in the central nervous system (CNS) is desired by neural prosthesis
   researchers who need long-term multielectrode connections with neurons
   for prosthetic control signals. Neurophysiologists also need
   multiple-unit recording electrodes for studying cortical interactions
   in chronic preparations. Micromachining of penetrating microelectrode
   structures and thin-film definition of recording sites and insulated
   conductor paths on these structures makes possible multiple,
   precisely-shaped microelectrode sites on shanks as small as 60 microns
   wide and 15 microns thick. On the same microstructure, integration of
   electronic circuitry designed to switch between different recording
   sites and to buffer the weak neural signals detected at the sites
   permits the activity from many recording sites to be recorded in an
   unshielded environment. The buffered signals from neurally active sites
   can be multiplexed onto a small number of output leads.

   The Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP) is supporting the development of a
   microelectrode array capable of recording from up to 64 sites located
   on a probe with multiple penetrating shanks. The broad objectives of
   the project are to develop multi-channel penetrating electrode arrays
   for both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) recording that will
   operate reliably in the hostile ionic environment within the body over
   decades of use in chronic implants. This will require the integration
   of micromachined electrode structures with active electronics and with
   integral flexible ribbon cables or with integral telemetry systems.
   This project will support the development and testing of the chronic
   recording electrode arrays. Electrode systems that include active
   electronics and ribbon cables will be tested in-vitro and in chronic
   animals. Probes will be furnished to the NPP for testing by other
   investigators.

   Prosthesis Program studies in this and related areas is available free

   ARTICLE C.2 STATEMENT OF WORK

   I. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best effort to design, fabricate, and test
   multiple-site intracortical recording microelectrode probes. The
   contractor shall also acquire or develop associated cables, connectors,
   and head mounts to produce a reliable signal path between the recording
   sites on a microelectrode probe and an extracoporal mating connector.

   Specifically the contractor shall:

   A. During the first year of the contract, design and fabricate a
   microelectrode recording probe.

   1. A single probe shall have at least eight penetrating shanks, each
   with sufficient strength to penetrate the pia-arachnoid and cortex in
   primates without probe breakage. Shanks shall not exceed 60 microns in
   thickness or width and shall be at least 2.5 mm in length.

   2. Each probe shall have at least forty-eight recording sites
   distributed along the shanks.

   3. Each probe shall have at least 4 signal output lines.

   4. Each probe shall include electronic switching circuitry to enable
   each of the recording sites to be directly connected to at least one of
   the signal output lines of the probe for neural recording. Switching an
   output line between different recording sites shall require no more
   than 5 milliseconds.

   5. At least one recording site on each shank shall connect to the
   switching circuitry by two independent conductor paths. These two paths
   shall be capable of being switched to two different output lines to
   permit verification of electrical continuity of the conductor path to
   the recording site and shall permit direct monitoring of the voltage
   developed between the recording site and a large return electrode when
   small-signal impedance test currents are passed through the site.

   B. For the recording probe of A., develop or obtain a flexible
   microcable, connector, and head mount system to permit the probe, when
   implanted in cortical tissue, to communicate with an extracorporal
   connector.

   1. At the probe, the output lines and any required control and power
   lines shall connect to a flexible microcable that is at least 2 cm. in
   length. The 4 mm. of this cable closest to the probe shall be at least
   as flexible as a 100 micron diameter gold wire.

   2. The non-probe end of the microcable shall terminate on a
   percutaneous connector/mount assembly suitable for mounting on the head
   of a mammal.

   3. The portions of the probe, cable, percutaneous connector and mount
   system that contact tissue shall be made of biocompatible materials.

   4. The probe, cable, and percutaneous connector shall be capable of
   sustaining sterilization with steam or ethylene oxide (either is
   adequate for this requirement) without changes in operating
   characteristics.

   5. The probe, cable, and percutaneous connector shall be designed to
   provide chronic neural recordings from the mammalian cortex. In this
   application, chronic refers to periods greater than 6 months.

   6. At least 20 probe-cable-connector assemblies shall be supplied to
   the Project Officer over the 3 year period of the contract for
   evaluation by other members of the Neural Prosthesis Program.

   C. Evaluate the probe-cable-connector(PCC) assemblies developed in B.
   in-vitro and in a mammalian cortex (excluding chimpanzees).

   1. Test the PCC assembly in-vitro in a simulation of the conditions to
   be expected in-vivo. In-vitro testing shall include soak testing (0.9%
   NaCl solution) of the probe and microcable, testing of the
   connect-disconnect function of the percutaneous connector and testing
   of the mechanical shock resistance of the complete system.

   2. Investigate the electrical stability of the PCC assembly over a
   period of at least 6 months when recording in mammalian cortex by
   observing the integrity of the electrical insulation at all points of
   the PCC assembly and studying the stability of the electrode recording
   surface.

   3. Demonstrate chronic neural recording over periods of at least 6
   months using the PCC. Modify the PCC design as needed in response to
   any problems revealed by the chronic recording.

   D. Design, fabricate and test an active circuit multiplexed recording
   probe with the following characteristics:

   1. The probe shall have at least 64 recording sites distributed along 8
   or 16 pitchfork shanks. The sites shall have characteristics suitable
   for recording single unit neural activity.

   2. The probe shanks shall have a maximum width of 80 microns, a maximum
   thickness of 60 microns and a minimum length of 2.5 mm.

   3. The probe electronics shall include at least eight
   preamplifier/filters and a multiplexer with characteristics suitable
   for amplifying the neural spike potentials at selected recording sites
   and multiplexing these amplified signals onto a single output line.

   a. The preamplifiers shall have an input impedance greater than 20
   megohms at 1000 Hz, a bandwidth of at least 500 Hz to 6 KHz, a noise
   level referred to the input over the specified bandwidth of less than
   20 microvolts r.m.s. for a source impedance of 2 megohms, and shall
   tolerate up to 200 millivolts of DC offset at the input.

   b. The multiplexer shall combine the outputs of the preamplifiers onto
   a single, multiplexed line. The output impedance of this line shall be
   less than 500 ohms and it shall be short-circuit proof.

   c. The electronic circuitry shall operate at a voltage of five volts or
   less.

   4. The probe shall include an electronic switch matrix between the
   recording sites and the preamplifiers with the following
   characteristics:

   a. The switch matrix shall be externally programmable. Switching the
   matrix to a new electrode configuration shall require less than 1000
   ms.

   b. The switch matrix shall allow selection of any set of adjacent
   recording sites, along a single shank or across shanks, as inputs to
   the preamplifiers. Additional combinations of selected electrodes are
   desired but completely random selection of recording sites is not
   required.

   c. On probe cross talk signals from non selected recording sites shall
   be at least 40 db below signals from the selected recording sites.

   5. The probe shanks shall have sufficient strength to penetrate the
   pia-arachnoid and cortex in primates without probe breakage.

   6. The height of the non-penetrating portion of the probe that contains
   the switch matrix, the preamplifiers and the multiplexer shall be no
   more than 1 mm.

   7. The probe circuitry shall be designed to require no more than 7
   conductors in the cable from the probe to the connector. The probe
   shall be compatible with the microcable and connector assembly
   developed in B.

   8. The probe electronics shall be covered with a biocompatible coating
   that will permit stable operation of the probe in a 0.9% NaCl saltwater
   bath for at least 1 year.

   9. The contractor shall deliver 5 active recording microelectrodes by
   the end of the contract period.

   E. Develop and fabricate a subdural platform for mounting single or
   multiple electrode probes giving special consideration to the
   following.

   1. The platform shall be of a size and configuration to permit it to
   rest on the pia-arachnoid surface of the cortex with minimal damage to
   underlying structures, and it shall be designed to minimize motion
   between the probe shank and the neural substrate. The height of the
   platform shall be less than 3 mm.

   2. Communication between extracorporal electronics and the implanted
   platform shall be through a telemetry system that utilizes an
   extracorporal inductive coil placed over the platform.

   3. The inductive telemetry system on the platform shall provide power
   to operate at least 1 probe and shall have telemetering capacity to
   control and receive signals from at least one probe with the
   characteristics of the probe developed in C.

   4. The platform shall incorporate the necessary hardware to substitute
   a flexible ribbon cable for the inductive telemetry system.

   5. The contractor shall deliver ten platforms with mounted
   microelectrodes by the end of the contract period.
