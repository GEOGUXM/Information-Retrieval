   MEMORANDUM FOR:     All Holders of Operations Manual

   SUBJECT:     Transmittal Memorandum for Operations Manual Issuance 98-2

   1.   Material Transmitted:

   New page B-20 for Appendix B to WSOM Chapter D-51, Marine Services for
   Coastal, Offshore, and High Seas.

   2.    Effective Date:

   May 1, 1998, at 1300 UTC.

   3.    Summary:

   The attached chart is an additional page to the replacement pages for
   Appendix B to WSOM Chapter D-51, issuance 97-10, dated November 13,
   1997.

   In addition to adding page B-20, make the following pen and ink changes
   to Appendix B of WSOM Chapter D-51:

   a.    Due to conflicts with EAS coding, the Alaska zones PKZ910 and
   PKZ920 will be changed to PKZ091 and PKZ092 respectively.

       (1)     Changes to these zones on page B-11 and B-18.

   b.    Correct typographical errors and minor omissions:

       (1)     On page B-1, under the NWSFO New York City listing:

   (a)    Change the header for ANZ350 to read, "Coastal waters from
   longitude 73^o W to Montauk Point NY out 20 nm."

   (b)    Change the header for ANZ355 to read "Coastal waters from Sandy
   Hook NJ to longitude 73EW out 20 nm."

   (2)    On page B-5, under the NWSFO San Juan listing:

   (a)    PR Official Area of Responsibility, change "Island" to
   "Islands."

   (b) Warning and Forecast Heading, add the phrase "of Puerto Rico" after
   "Nearshore waters of west coast" for zone AMZ755.

   (3) On page B-6, under the continuation of the NWSFO San Juan listing,
   add the word "from" after "Caribbean waters from Punta Viento to Punta
   Melones and the waters outside of 12 nm."

   (4) On page B-6, under the NWSFO New Orleans listing, change
   "Apalachiclo" to "Apalachicola" in the Outlook.

   (5) On pages B-6 and B-7, note that NWSFO New Orleans currently
   prepares and issues the Coastal Waters Forecast for the zones GMZ455,
   GMZ475, GMZ450, GMZ470, and GMZ490, while NWSO Lake Charles prepares
   and issues Special Marine Warnings and Marine Weather Statements. The
   responsibility for the Coastal Waters Forecast for these zones will
   transfer to NWSO Lake Charles. This information is for clarification
   since the page break gives the appearance that these are separate
   responsibilities.

   (6) On page B-14, under the NWSFO Honolulu listing, change the
   longitudes for the Central South Pacific Ocean from "120^oE"   to
   "120^oW  and  "160^oW" to "160^oE."

   4.    Effect on other Instructions: After completing the pen and ink
   changes, file this memorandum with WSOM Chapter D-51.
