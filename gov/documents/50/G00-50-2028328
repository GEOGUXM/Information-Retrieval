                                 Helping You

     As your Representative in Congress, I can assist you on a wide
     variety of issues.  Depending on your needs, the Washington, DC
     office and the Utah office can help with anything from a visit to
     Washington, DC to citizenship.
     The Washington, DC office specializes in requests such as flag
     orders, tours of popular attractions in the Washington, DC area, and
     specific questions about legislation.

     The Utah office can help with requests for passport applications,
     immigration papers, Social Security questions, small business loans
     and other federal financing programs, military academy nominations,
     and veterans issues.

     Both the Washington and Utah offices take schedule requests.  You
     should direct your request to the office in which you would like to
     meet.  Please note that all schedule requests must be verified in
     writing.

     Please dont hesitate to give our office a call if you have any
     questions or concerns. You may also meet staff throughout the Salt
     Lake Valley at one of my office's mobile office hours.
