   Governor's Scholars Award Program
   First Year Scholarship Awards

   To encourage high school students to study hard and master state
   content standards, last year Governor Davis signed into law SB 1688,
   establishing the Governor's Scholars Award Program to award $1,000
   scholarships for 9th, 10th, and 11th grade students who demonstrate
   academic achievement on the statewide Standardized Testing and
   Reporting (STAR) examinations.  This legislation also established the
   Governor's Distinguished Math and Science Scholars Program to encourage
   high school students to pursue rigorous coursework and to excel in
   mathematics and the sciences.  This program awards $2,500 individual
   scholarships to Governor's Scholars who achieve the highest scores on
   Advanced Placement (AP) calculus and science exams.

   Students who are eligible for the Governor's Scholars Award and the
   Governor's Distinguished Math and Science Awards and have received
   notification from their schools will be able to claim their awards
   online beginning April 23, 2001 at www.scholarshare.com.  A total of
   106,237 students achieved scores on the Spring SAT9 tests for 9th, 10th
   and 11th graders placing them in the top 10 percent of test takers in
   their grade at their school or the top 5 percent of test takers
   statewide.  Students who are Governor's Scholars and also received top
   scores on Advanced Placement calculus and science exams will be able to
   claim $2,500 Governor's Distinguished Math and Science Awards. An
   estimated 350 students qualify for both awards.

   Students are eligible for a Governor's Scholars Award if they meet all
   of the following criteria:
     * Must attend a California public high school for at least one
       continuous year; and
     * Must take standards-based STAR examination (both English/language
       arts and mathematics) and Stanford 9 examination (reading and
       mathematics) in 9th, 10th, or 11th grade.

   From eligible students, selection of scholars is based on the following
   criteria:
     * A student must attain a score on the Stanford 9 examination that
       places him/her in the top 5% of test-takers statewide in the 9th,
       10th, or 11th grade (combined reading and mathematics score); OR
     * A student must attain a score on the Stanford 9 examination that
       places him/her in the top 10% of test-takers within each California
       comprehensive public high school in the 9th, 10th, or 11th grade
       (combined reading and mathematics score).

   To find out how students may claim their awards and answers to the most
   common questions regarding the program, please visit the Governor's
