                          Labor Market Information

      Labor Force Data for Sub-County Areas in California
      Data for cities and other sub-county areas are provided by county for
      the current month and for 1990 through 2000 annual averages.
      Instructions are available to calculate data for other time periods.

      Monthly labor force data for sub-county areas are derived by
      multiplying current estimates of county-wide employment and
      unemployment by the respective employment and unemployment shares
      (percentages) for each sub-county area at the time of the 1990 Census.
      Sub-county labor force is then obtained by summing employment and
      unemployment, and the result is divided into unemployment to calculate
      the unemployment rate.

      Some cities have been designated as a Labor Surplus Area by the U.S.
      Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The Labor Surplus Area
      List  (formerly published as the "Area Trends" report) is available
      online.
