   Ability You Can Count On Resource & Services Fair -

   October 24, 2000     10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the Building 10 Visitors
   Center

      The objective of the Resource and Services Fair is to highlight the
      benefits of tapping into the labor pool of persons with disabilities
      and provide practical information and resources about assistive
      technologies to the NIH community.   We have arranged for a variety of
      national and local vendors to exhibit and display disability-related
      resources and services.
