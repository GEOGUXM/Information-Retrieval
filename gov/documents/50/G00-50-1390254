[blueball.gif] Syllabus

   This course is the third of a new three-quarter sequence offered in
   1999-2000. The first two parts, 243A and 243B, were given by C.S.
   Fadley and S. Chiang, resp.
   Surface science is intimately connected with atomic-scale structure and
   with the advanced techniques used to study them. Because of the wide
   variety of structures possible at solid-vacuum, solid-liquid, and
   solid-solid interfaces, surface crystallography requires specially
   adapted concepts. And because surface-sensitive techniques often
   interact strongly with the surfaces being studied, they need a
   substantial theoretical underpinning to enable the extraction of
   relevant information, even of structural type.
   Concepts to be addressed in surface crystallography include
   surface-adapted 2D lattices, high-index surfaces, superlattices,
   domains and symmetry. Examples of actual solved surface structures will
   be given and discussed. The relationship between structure and
   diffraction will be considered next, since diffraction has been the
   primary source of surface structural information. The course will then
   discuss diffraction techniques based on electrons, starting with
   low-energy electron diffraction: the role of multiple ("dynamical")
   scattering will be explored, together with solutions to compute it;
   also covered will be methods of surface structure determination. Next,
   the photoelectric effect will be added to electron scattering, as
   occurs in photoelectron diffraction. X-ray absorption will then also be
   discussed, in the context of the technique of x-ray absorption fine
   structure: it also involves electron scattering. Even scanning
   tunneling microscopy can be viewed in an electron-scattering picture.

[blueball.gif] Acknowledgments

   The structural part of this course draws heavily on a long-time
   collaboration with Prof. K. Hermann (Berlin), who has produced several
   softwares that we will rely on. It also draws on the Surface Structure
   Database (SSD) produced in collaboration with Prof. K. Hermann and
   Prof. P.R. Watson (Corvallis). Finally, it benefits from the prior
   courses 243A and 243B given by C.S. Fadley and S. Chiang.
