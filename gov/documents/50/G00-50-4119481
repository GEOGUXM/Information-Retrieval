                              Who gets parole?

   Once a person is convicted of a crime, he or she may be sentenced by
   the court to a prison term. There are two types of prison terms,
   indeterminate and determinate.

   An indeterminate sentence, often referred to as a life sentence, is a
   term for which there is no fixed term of imprisonment, such as
   15-years-to-life. Offenders sentenced to such life, or indeterminate,
   terms must serve a minimum term before becoming eligible for a parole
   consideration hearing before the Board. Indeterminately sentenced
   prisoners are not released from prison unless the Board has determined
   that they will not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public
   and are suitable for release, or the Governor has granted a pardon or
   compassionate release.

   Determinate terms are fixed terms of imprisonment, such as a 3-year
   term for burglary, and are established by statute. Once the prisoner
   has served the determinate term imposed by the sentencing court, he or
   she must be released from prison and placed on parole. The Board is not
   involved in this process.

   Once a determinately or indeterminately sentenced prisoner is released
   from prison, the Board may impose special conditions of parole in
   addition to the general conditions which are automatically placed on
   every parolee.
