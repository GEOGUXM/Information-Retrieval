   process. They allow the cadet staff to examine the promoting cadet
   under stress and see how the cadet performs under pressure. Promotion
   boards are designed for evaluation purposes only. Because of the
   importance of progression through the cadet program, promotion boards
   take precedence over most other unit activities.

       8.4 Promotion boards will be held the first week of each month. If
   a cadet can not attend that week, the Flight 112 staff is encouraged to
   hold a promotion board on an alternate date for that cadet, to ensure
   that the cadet has the opportunity to promote as quickly as possible.

   boards, unless not present: the Flight 112 Commander, the Flight 112

   increase in grade. Cadet officers do not need promotion boards for
   achievement numbers 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, or 16.
