    Search Examples That Work:


    Type in...    You will get...
   information

   The word information or the root word information plus any word
   endings. (One example is:  informational).
   information retrieval   The phrase information retrieval in the exact
   sequence typed, with additional word endings on either or both words.

   inform*   The word inform, or the root word, inform with additional
   word endings. (This allows you to control where the word is stemmed.)
   "information"   The word information, exactly as typed.
   "information
   retrieval"   The phrase information retrieval exactly as typed, without
   additional word endings on either word.
    Accrue Operator

   information,
   retrieval, library   Documents containing at least one of the words
   specified, ranking them using "the more, the better."  The search
   engine calculates the number of times each word appears in the
   document; the more instances found, the higher the document is ranked.
   The syntax for the Accrue Operator is a sequence of related terms,
   separated by commas.
    Wildcards

   information*   Words beginning with information or where information is
   the root word. (The * replaces one or more characters.)
   retr??val   When you are unsure of the spelling, finds documents
   containing either retrieval or retreival. (The ? replaces one
   character.)
    Mixed Case

   information retrieval   Returns both upper and lower case results.
   Information Retrieval   Only returns results that match the upper and
   lower case as it was typed.
    Boolean Search

   information
   AND retrieval   Finds documents that contain both words.
   information
   OR retrieval   Finds documents that contain at least one of the words.
   information
   NOT retrieval   Excludes all documents that contain the word retrieval.
    Proximity Search

   information
   <near> retrieval   Finds documents containing instances of the words in
   close proximity to each other.  The nearer they are found together, the
   higher the ranking.
   information
   <sentence> retrieval   Expands the proximity to look for instances
   where words are found in the same sentence.
   information
   <paragraph> retrieval   Expands the proximity to look for instances
   where the words are found in the same paragraph.
    Field Search

   title

                      What is shown on the results page
      after a search?   The results are ranked by an internal algorithm
     within the VerityÂ’s search engine, and the results are returned in
     order of highest relevance.  The results are presented in "pages",
   consisting of 10 documents per page. A query will not return more than
             200 documents. Other information returned includes:
     * how many documents were found that have a match for your search
       terms
     * how many documents were in the collection of files that was
       examined
     * a list of documents that contain one or more matches with your
       search term
          + a link to a dynamically-created copy of the file, with every
            occurrence of your search term highlighted (this link is above
            the synopsis, and looks like the title of the document)
          + a link to the actual page (this link is below the synopsis,
            and looks like the web address of the document)
          + a brief synopsis of the file
