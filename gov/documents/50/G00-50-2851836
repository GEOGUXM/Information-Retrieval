   2-STEP CALPAIN EXTRACTION/ELUTION 1. Extract 10 grams of muscle in 30
   ml of extraction buffer plus inhibitors. 3x30 secs. in Waring blender
   2. Centrifuge for 1 hour in JA-17 rotor at 16,500 rpm. 3. Dialyze
   overnight against dialysis buffer. 4. Centrifuge for 30 minutes in
   JA-17 rotor at 16,500 rpm. Filter supernate through glasswool. 5. Load
   on a 15ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated to 1x elution buffer. 6.
   Wash columns with 50 ml of 1x elution buffer. 7. Elute column with 1x
   elution buffer+200mM NaCl and 1x+400mM NaCl in the following manner: A.
   Elute with 10 ml 1x elution buffer+200mM NaCl and collect outflow. B.
   Elute with 25 ml 1x elution buffer+200mM NaCl and collect outflow
   separately. C. Elute with 10 ml 1x elution buffer+200mM NaCl and
   collect outflow separately. D. Elute with 45 ml of 1x+400mM NaCl
   collecting all of the outflow separately. 8. Assay 1 ml aliquots of
   200mM NaCl elution for calpastatin using 0.6 units activity of
   µ-calpain as the positive. Use the sample + EDTA as the blank for each
   sample. Then heat 20 ml of the eluent for 15 min. Cool on ice and
   centrifuge in tabletop centrifuge for 15 min. Assay the heated
   supernate for calpastatin using both µ-calpain and m-calpain. Assay 1
   ml aliquots of the 1x elution buffer+400mM NaCl for m-calpain. 9.
   Heated Calpastatin activity is determined using the m- calpain as the
   positive. µ- calpain activity is determined by subtracting the
   non-heated calpastatin activity (µ-calpain as positive) from the heated
   calpastatin activity (µ-calpain as positive) m-calpain activity is
   determined as for the normal procedure. Reference: Geesink, G. H., and
