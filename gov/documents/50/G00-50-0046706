   Introduction                   Einstein and Gravitational Waves
   Sources of Gravitational Waves How to Detect Gravitational Waves
   What are gravitational waves?

   Gravitational waves are analogous to light waves.

   Light consists of propagating electromagnetic fields, generated by the
   motions of electrically charged particles, which carry energy and
   momentum that can be detected by a suitable instrument, such as the
   human eye. Light carries information about the structure of the matter
   that generated it. Different frequencies of light waves, detected as
   different colors by the human eye, are caused by different energy
   transitions in the charged particle distribution which generated them.
   (For example, light from a hot source becomes more red and less yellow
   as it cools.) Spatial variations in the phase of light waves (i.e.
   differences received on different parts of the retina) allow us to
   perceive the direction to, and shape of, the matter that generated
   them.

   Gravitational wave are propagating gravitational fields, "ripples" in
   the curvature of space-time, generated by the motion of massive
   particles. Gravitational waves cause a variable strain of space-time,
   which result in changes in changes in the distance between points, with
   the size of the changes proportional to the distance between the
   points. Gravitational waves can be detected by devices which measure
   the induced length changes. Waves of different frequencies are caused
   by different motions of mass, and difference in the phases of the waves
   allow us to perceive the direction to the source and the shape of the
   matter that generated them.

   Gravitational waves are much weaker than electromagnetic waves. This is
   mainly because the fundamental force of gravity is weaker per unit mass
   than the fundamental electromagnetic force per unit charge. This
   weakness has two consequences:
    1. gravitational waves are generated at potentially detectable levels
       only by very massive sources undergoing very violent dynamics (that
       is, by astrophysical sources)
    2. the waves thus produced propagate essentially unchanged from their
       sources, unaffected by scattering or absorption due to intervening
       matter

   Why are Gravitational Waves Interesting?

   Detection of gravitational waves is important because of their
   consequences for our understanding of fundamental physical law and
   because they will open up a new window on the universe for
   observational astronomy.

   Gravitational wave detection would likely yield experimental tests of
   fundamental physical law which cannot be made any other way. For
   example;
    1. Detection of gravitational waves would verify a fundamental
       prediction of General Relativity
    2. Comparison of arrival times of light and gravitational waves, from
       e.g. supernovae, would test Einstein's prediction that light and
       gravitational waves travel at the same speed.
    3. Measurements could verify or refute the prediction of General
       Relativity that the waves only change distances perpendicular to
       the direction of propagation.

   Gravitational waves also offer a new window for observational
   astronomy, one that contains information different from that in the
   electromagnetic window. Gravitational waves are difficult to detect
   because they interact so weakly with matter. This property--the
   extremely weak interaction with matter--means they propagate unchanged
   from their sources: detailed information about the time evolution of
   sources during violent events is preserved, unchanged by subsequent
   absorption or scattering. (This contrasts with electromagnetic waves,
   which can be screened or scattered by intervening matter. Even
   neutrinos produced in supernovae are scattered many times while leaving
   the cores of those explosions.)

   Relativistic motion of bulk matter and strong gravitational fields are
   central to most theoretical views about violent activity in supernovae,
   galactic nuclei, and quasars. When gravitational waves from these
   objects are detected, we will have the first observations of the
   interiors of strong-gravity, high-velocity regions.
