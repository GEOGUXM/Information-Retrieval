   Avoidable Hospitalizations in Washington State (01-11-3401)
   With the continued growth in state health care expenditures, interest
   in cost containment remains high. This report identifies one area where
   expenditure reductions may be possible: avoidable hospitalizations.
   Initial research indicates that potentially unnecessary
   hospitalizations in Washington are an issue for the federal Medicare
   program, private insurers, and for the state's Medicaid program. Based
   on the findings in this paper, the Institute will undertake a more
   comprehensive examination of avoidable hospitalizations for Medicaid
   recipients.

   Purchasing State Employee Health Benefits: An Overview and Options for
   Change (01-01-3401)
   This report examines the bidding process used by the Public Employee
   Benefits Board to purchase state employee health benefits from managed
   care organizations. Three options having the potential to improve
   decision-making and reduce costs are identified: 1) requiring the
   bidding process to occur before the biennial budget is passed; 2)
   limiting the number of accepted bids in a geographic area; and 3)
   requesting annual and multi-year bids. [Steve Lerch, Ph.D. - January

   High-Cost Medicaid Clients: Targeting Diseases for Case Management
   (00-12-3401)
   The rapid growth of Washington States health care expenditures has
   renewed efforts to contain the states health care costs. Of particular
   interest is the potential to reduce expenditures and improve health
   outcomes for low-income Medicaid recipients with disabilities or who
   are over age 65. This paper proposes an approach that uses medical
   claims data to identify high-cost Medicaid beneficiaries and provide
   them with case management services to help improve their health status
   and contain their medical costs. [Steve Lerch, Ph.D.  and Jim Mayfield-

   Medicaid Expansion for Employed Persons with Disabilities: Costs and
   Benefits or the "Ticket to Work" Buy-In (#00-11-3401)
   The federal Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999
   is intended to increase employment opportunities for persons with
   disabilities, focusing on individuals participating in the two federal
   income assistance programs: Social Security Disability Insurance and
   Supplemental Security Income.  A key provision of the Ticket to Work
   law gives states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to employed
   persons with severe disabilities. The Medicaid expansion, often
   referred to as a buy-in, represents a major change in access to health
   care for persons with severe disabilities by greatly increasing the
   income and asset thresholds for Medicaid eligibility. This report,
   undertaken at legislative request, examines the impacts of implementing
   the optional Medicaid buy-in provision of the Ticket to Work law.
