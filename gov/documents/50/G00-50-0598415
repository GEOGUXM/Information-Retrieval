                       New Orleans FBI Speakers Bureau

   The New Orleans FBI division will furnish a speaker to your
   organization upon receiving a written request addressed to the Special
   Agent in Charge (SAC), Charles Mathews, III, 1250 Poydras Street, Suite
   2200, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113-1829. The topic must be related to
   matters under FBI jurisdiction. The speakers are Supervisory Special
   Agents and Special Agents assigned to Louisiana and will be selected
   based upon the requested topic of discussion.

   The request should also include times and two to three dates if
   possible. You will be notified in writing as soon as possible of
   acceptance. Every effort will be made to honor your request.

   FBI Special Agents routinely make speeches to Civic groups,
   professional organizations, university classes and school groups.
