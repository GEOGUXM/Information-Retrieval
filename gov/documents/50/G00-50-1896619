     FrogWeb: Frequently Asked Questions About Amphibian Declines &
     Deformities

   If you have a question about FrogWeb or amphibians, first check below
   to see if we have an answer for you. To view the answer, simply click
   on the question. If you don't see your question below, click on the
   "Contact Us" button to the left.

   Because our ability to answer questions is dependent upon human
   references who are often performing research "in the field" for long
   periods of time, we are unable to provide assistance for research
   papers or class projects (contact your public or school library for
   assistance). We also cannot answer questions regarding pets or pet
   care. Please contact a veterinarian for assistance with pet concerns.

   Note that the response time will depend upon the nature of the question
   and the availability of expertise.

       amphibians. Can you help?

   Questions about volunteer opportunities and monitoring
     * How can I help with the frog surveys?
     * I've seen a few frogs in my area, but none with deformities. Are
       deformed frogs the only ones that I should report, or do you want
       to know about normal frogs as well?
     * Are you interested in data about other deformed amphibians, in
       addition to frogs?
     * How do I find amateur groups in my area who are going out and
       monitoring local frog ponds and wetlands?
     * Are scientists studying amphibian declines in my area?

   General questions about amphibians
     * We have a small pond in our backyard. How can we attract frogs?
     * My child wants to keep a frog as a pet. Is having a pet frog a good
       idea, especially if the population is declining?
     * My child has a non-native pet frog that he purchased at a pet
       store, but doesn't want to keep anymore. Can I turn it loose in the
       backyard?
     * I don't know how to identify different species of frogs and toads.
       Do you have a guide that can help me tell what kinds are in my
       backyard?
     * I would like to help restore the frog population in my area;
       however, there are no frogs to be found. Should I try to raise and
       release frogs on my own? Is there anywhere I could obtain the eggs,
       help them mature, and then disperse them?
     * How can I build my own frog pond?
     * What happens to frogs in the winter?
     * A great deal of amphibian habitat in our area is being destroyed
       due to development of wetlands areas. Our community is interested
       in learning more about "amphibian tunnels" that enable frogs and
       other amphibians to cross roads safely. Where can we get more
       information?

     * The answer really depends upon the species of amphibian and how it
       was obtained. Several amphibian species are listed as threatened or
       endangered in North America and/or other regions. U.S. federal law
       prohibits species listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife
       Service from being taken, sold, exported, or killed. Ownership of
       these species is therefore illegal. Additionally, the United States
       is an active participant in the Convention on Illegal Trade in
       Endangered Species (CITES), an international ban supported by 152
       countries. CITES was created to prevent international trade from
       threatening species with extinction. You can view the complete list
       of species included in the international trade ban on the CITES Web
       site. If you are considering an amphibian as a pet, make sure your
       new friend is not among those listed by CITES or the U.S. Fish &
       Wildlife Service. It should also be noted that reputable pet
       dealers are mindful of these restrictions and comply with federal
       and international laws dealing with illegal trade in endangered
       species. Additionally, most animals sold by these dealers are
       non-threatened species bred specifically for the pet trade, and are
       not removed from the wild. This ensures that complex ecosystem
       processes, such as predator-prey relationships, are not disrupted.

     * No, you should not release non-native species in your area. There
       are several reasons why this is a bad idea:
          + Your amphibian may not be able to survive if released into an
            alien habitat.
          + It may be unable to locate the types of food it depends upon
            to live.
          + Your local climate may be inhospitable, and it may encounter
            difficulty finding shelter.
          + Because it has lived in captivity, it may not recognize or
            respond to threats from predators.
          + You may also harm native amphibian species in your area if
            your released amphibian introduces a fungus, parasite, or
            disease into the native populations.
          + Non-native species can invade and permanently alter an
            ecosystem, outcompeting, crowding out, and even killing native
            species. A single breeding pair of non-native species can
            produce dozens of offspring in a single breeding season. When
            native species are seriously reduced or eliminated from an
            ecosystem, the entire food chain may be disrupted.
       If you can no longer keep your non-native amphibian pet, consider
       these options:
          + ask a local pet store if they can take it
          + advertise it in a newspaper, trading gazette, or on an
            amphibian or herpetological Web site
          + find out if a local school would be interested in adopting it
            as a class pet
          + contact your local Humane Society, SPCA, or other animal-care
            organization to see if they can place it for adoption [Back to

     * Select the "Species Information" button from the FrogWeb site to
       get more information about identifying your local amphibians. [Back
       to Top]
     * Before undertaking any restoration project, you need to try to
       determine why there are currently no frogs to be found. Is there no
       habitat to support them? This is often the most likely cause. Do
       fish, who may consume all of the tadpoles, also occupy the same
       ponds? Are your wetlands areas polluted? Amphibians are relatively
       good colonizers, so the fact that you have no frogs at all is a
       good indication of severe problems. You can bring in new eggs and
       tadpoles, or frogs, and release them, but if the ecological
       problems persist, your effrots will be wasted, and could be
       detrimental to the areas that were your source of stocking
       material.
       Though your intentions are laudable, you should be aware before you
       begin a restoration project that most translocations of animals to
       new places fail, and some can even do more harm than good. If you
       do decide to attempt a reintroduction of native amphibian species,
       you should do so only after seeing that any suspected environmental
       problems in the immediate habitat have been relieved, and that the
       area would not be re-colonized naturally, without human
       intervention. It is imperative that any species brought in to
       recolonize be native to that particular area. Do your homework, and
       learn what species are native to your area. Additionally, you
       should find these "re-colonizers" locally, and NOT from commercial
       houses or from outside the region. Commercial and outside stocks of
       amphibians could introduce diseases and genetic problems that would
       make matters worse, rather than better. Local populations will best
       be adapted to local conditions. The best place to obtain local
       animals (after obtaining permission from the landowner) is from
       places where the habitat is undergoing destruction or alteration
       due to development or other disasters. [Back to Top]

       provide instructions for building your own frog pond. [Back to Top]
     *
     * Roads and highways not only further divide amphibians' already
       fragmented habitat, but also lead to the death of hundreds of
       thousands of frogs and salamanders each year from cars and trucks.
       These deaths are particularly acute during the breeding season,
       when millions of amphibians migrate to both permanent and seasonal
       wetlands, heedless of oncoming traffic. Because transportation
       infrastructure is a necessary consequence of increasing sprawl in
       both rural and suburban areas, scientists and planners are looking
       to innovative ways to prevent amphibian migrations across busy
       roads and interstates, while allowing them to reach breeding pools
       on the other side of these busy thoroughfares. Dubbed "ecopasses,"
       these simple, yet revolutionary, concrete structures allow
       amphibians to cross underneath roads safely, and prevent them from
       climbing up onto the highway through use of a "lip" at the top of
       the structure. The University of Florida, the Florida Department of
       Transportation, and several environmental agencies, recently teamed
       up to install these structures in some areas of the state
       particularly deadly to frogs and salamanders. Read about the
       successful implementation of this concept, and get more
       information, at the US Department of Transportation's site
       Amphibian-Reptile Wall and Culverts.[Back to Top]
