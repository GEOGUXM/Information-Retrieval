   density than the ARIES-ST (spherical torus). * FIRE, the compact high
   field tokamak, exceeds ARIES-RS power densities and approaches ARIES-RS
   wall loading for 20 second pulses. * ITER-RC is about a factor of 10
   lower in power density and wall loading than ARIES-RS. Technical Basis
   for a Compact High Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment has Improved
   Markedly since 1989-1991. Tokamak experiments (1989-1999) have
   developed improved confinement modes that scale (e.g.,ITER-98H) 1.3
   times higher than the 1989 CIT design assumption. Alcator C-Mod - the
   prototype for Compact High Field tokamaks has shown: * Confinement in
   excess of 1.4 times the 1989 design guidelines for CIT and ~1.15 times
   the recent ITER-98H design guidelines. * Successful ICRF heating at
   high density in shaped diverted plasmas * Successful detached divertor
   operation at high power density D-T experiments on TFTR and JET have
   shown: * Tritium can be handled safely in a laboratory fusion
   experiment!!! * D-T plasmas behaved roughly as predicted with slight
   improvements in confinement but alpha heating effects were weak.

   01990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Year * Even with ITER, the MFE program
   would be unable to address the burning plasma issues in alpha-dominated
   (Q > 5) plasmas for 15 years. * Compact High-Field Tokamak Burning
   Plasma Experiment(s) would be a natural extension of the ongoing
   "advanced" tokamak program and could begin alpha- dominated experiments
   by ~ 2010. * The information "exists now" to make a technical
   assessment, and decision on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next
   decade. Major Conclusions of the FIRE Design Study * Exploration,
   understanding and optimization of alpha-dominated (high-gain) burning
   plasmas are critical issues for all approaches to fusion. * The tokamak
   is a cost-effective vehicle to investigate alpha-dominated plasma
   physics, and its coupling to advanced toroidal physics for MFE. * The
   FIRE compact high field tokamak can address the important alpha-
   dominated plasma issues, many of the long pulse advanced tokamak issues
   and begin the integration of alpha-dominated plasmas with advanced
   toroidal physics in a $1B class facility. * The FIRE design point has
   been chosen to be a "stepping stone" between the physics accessible
   with present tokamak facilities and the physics required in the ARIES
   vision for magnetic fusion energy. * A dual track Modular Strategy for
   Magnetic and Inertial Fusion including strong base programs and
   near-term alpha-dominated burning plasma experiments would provide a
   strong science foundation for fusion while providing visible
   deliverables by ~ 2010.
