                             WHITE-COLLAR CRIME

   White-Collar Crimes, which are not dependent upon the application or
   threat of physical force or violence, are those illegal acts
   characterized by fraud, deceit, concealment, or violation of trust.
   Such acts are committed by individuals and organizations to obtain
   money, property or services; to avoid the payment or loss of money or
   services; or to secure a personal, political, or business advantage.

   White-Collar Crime is the largest criminal program and highest
   investigative priority for the FBI within the states of Colorado and
   Wyoming, and for good reason. White-Collar Crimes cost the citizens of
   Colorado and Wyoming billions of dollars annually and frequently go
   unreported. These often invisible crimes are expensive, both to
   organizations and, ultimately, all consumers who pay for the crimes in
   the form of higher fees, fewer services and/or direct personal
   financial loss.

   From the overwhelming number and variety of White-Collar Crimes, the
   FBI has identified and classified the most flagrant crime problems into
   twelve national priority crime problem areas, all of which exist in
   Colorado and Wyoming, and are being vigorously investigated by the FBI:

     * Health Care Fraud
     * Public Corruption
     * Financial Institution Fraud
     * Government Fraud
     * Insurance Fraud (non-Health Care)
     * Securities and Commodities Fraud
     * Telemarketing Fraud
     * Bankruptcy Fraud
     * Environmental Crimes
     * Money Laundering
     * Intellectual Property Rights Violations
     * Wire and Mail Fraud Schemes
