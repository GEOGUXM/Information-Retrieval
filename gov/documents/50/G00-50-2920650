HHS Announces Arrival of DL\net

   The Department of Health and Human Services is making the HHS
   distributed learning network --- or DL\net --- available to all
   employees and Commissioned Corps officers throughout the agency.

What is the HHS Distributed Learning Network (DL\net)?

   The HHS Distributed Learning Network, also known as DL\net, is designed
   to make learning, information, and performance support available to HHS
   employees, stakeholders, partners, grantees, and customers wherever and
   whenever needed. Access to the DL\net is through an HHS Learning
   Portal.

   The Portal is an internet site --- a single entry point to meet common
   learning needs, provide opportunities for individuals to collaborate
   online with others who have interests in common, and obtain assistance
   in using technology for learning.

What Learning Opportunities are Available?

   HHS employees have access to HHS learning activities and references to
   help them in their work, as well as opportunities to collaborate online
   with colleagues throughout HHS who share common interests. For those
   who are interested, accounts can be purchased for $60 providing
   unlimited access to courseware from two leading vendors in online
   training --- SkillSoft and NETg. These courses include everything from
   computer operations to business applications.

There are other resources available:

   Communities of Interest will link you to communities within HHS that
   are grouped around areas of expertise and interest.

   Communications Center includes Discussion Groups and Chat Rooms. HHS
   News will keep you up-to-date on new HHS Distributed Learning
   happenings. You can also search for other Federal learning resources
   and references.

   Eventually, Precision Skilling^TM will be available to help you
   identify competencies to enhance your expertise and career
   opportunities.

   To access the DL\net, sign on at: http://learning.hhs.gov or contact us
   for more information.
