   Holocaust Victims Claim Information

                        Are you a Holocaust survivor
                      or an heir of a Holocaust victim?

   If so, unclaimed assets being held in bank accounts in Switzerland may
   belong to you. California State Controller Kathleen Connell has
   established this link to the Holocaust Claims Processing Office in New
   York to help visitors to her Web site research and file a claim.
   If you believe you may be the owner of or heir to assets held or
   deposited with a Swiss bank between January 1, 1933, and May 9, 1945,
   please contact the Holocaust Claims Processing Office. You may reach
   that office at one of the following addresses or phone numbers:

   The Swiss Bankers Association published a list on July 23, 1997, of
   approximately 1,800 names on bank accounts that have been dormant since
   the end of World War II. In addition, the Jewish Congress has published
   a list of approximately 1,300 foreign accounts held by the Swiss Bank
   Corporation in New York that were frozen during World War II. It is
   believed that these accounts, which have seen no activity since the end
   of the war, belonged to Holocaust victims and survivors. Attempts are
   underway to restore this property to its rightful owners or heirs.
