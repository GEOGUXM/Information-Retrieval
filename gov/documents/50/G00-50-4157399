Reserve Council

   Supplement 1. Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve Council Charter

The Reserve Council

   In managing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem
   Reserve, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to establish a Coral
   Reef Ecosystem Reserve Council, in accordance with the National Marine
   Sanctuaries Act. The role of the Council is to provide advice and
   recommendations to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA), an agency of the Department of Commerce on the Reserve
   Operations Plan and the designation and management of the sanctuary.
   The Council plays an important role in helping shape these initiatives
   which will provide lasting protection to the marine resources of the
   Reserve and sanctuary.

   The Council operates under a charter developed by NOAA, which
   prescribes the frequency of meetings, objectives and roles, and
   operation of the Council. The Council was officially established on
   December 5, 2000, when the charter was signed. All travel costs to
   meeting locations for Council members will be paid by NOAA. Council
   meetings will be open to the public.

   The voting members of the Council (except for the State of Hawaii
   representative) were chosen through an open, competitive process held
   during December 2000 and January 2001. A call for applications was
   published in the Federal Register and posted on this website.
   Forty-seven applications were received, and fourteen of these
   applicants were chosen by NOAA, in consultation with the State of
   Hawaii and the Department of the Interior, to become members of the
   Council. Non-voting members were chosen by the organization they
   represent in a separate process. Members were announced on January 29,
   2001.

   Alternates will be chosen for each seat to ensure adequate
   representation should a Council member be unable to attend a meeting. A
   call for applications for alternates was published in the Federal
   Register in February, 2001. Applications were received through March 2,
   2001. To increase the pool of applicants, another call for applications
   for alternates was published in the Federal Register on May 4, 2001.
   Applications must be received by June 4, 2001. The alternates will be
   selected in the same manner as voting representatives.

   The following documents contain the applications (Supplement 2) and
   contact and mailing information (Supplement 3):
