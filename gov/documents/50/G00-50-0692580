                                    Goals

     * To understand the genesis, development and decay of tropical
       disturbances by investigating the thermo-hydrodynamical processes
       using numerical simulation models.

     * To study small-scale features of hurricane systems, such as the
       collective role of deep convection, the exchange of physical
       quantities at the lower boundary and the formation of organized
       spiral bands.

     * To investigate the capability of numerical models in predicting
       hurricane movement and intensity, and to facilitate their
       conversion to operational use.
