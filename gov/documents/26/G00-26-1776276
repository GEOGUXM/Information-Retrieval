   Anthrax

   Veterinary Services
   November 2001

   Anthrax, a disease of mammals and humans, is caused by a spore-forming
   bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax has an almost worldwide
   distribution and is a zoonotic disease, meaning it may spread from
   animals to humans.  All mammals appear to be susceptible to anthrax to
   some degree, but ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats are the
   most susceptible and commonly affected, followed by horses, and then
   swine.

   The U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) main diagnostics laboratory
   in Ames, Iowa, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),
   maintains small quantities of anthrax to use as reference material in
   making confirmatory anthrax diagnoses in animals.  USDAs Animal and
   Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)  maintains that laboratory as
   part of fulfilling its mission to protect American agriculture.

   Disease Epidemiology

   Anthrax is endemic to the United States, occurring sporadically
   throughout the country as environmental conditions allow.  The Del Rio,
   Texas, region has reported ongoing outbreaks of anthrax in deer and
   livestock this summer.  The most recent outbreak there occurred on
   Sept. 21, 2001.  Other recent outbreaks include an outbreak in cattle
   and horses in Minnesota in June-July 2000; in cattle, horses, and bison
   in North Dakota in August 2000; and in cattle in Nebraska in January
   2001.

   During their vegetative stage, cells of the anthrax agent multiply in
   the lymph nodes of susceptible animals, including humans. When cells of
   B. anthracis escape from the animals body and are exposed to oxygen,
   they form spores. These spores are highly resistant to heat, cold,
   chemical disinfectants, and long dry periods. B. anthracis spores are
   reported to survive for years in the environment. Environmental
   persistence may be related to a number of factors, including high
   levels of soil nitrogen and organic
   content, alkaline soil (a pH level higher than 6.0), and ambient
   temperatures higher than 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

   The anthrax organism may be spread within an area by streams, insects,
   wild animals and birds, and contamination from wastes of infected
   animals. Anthrax may be perpetuated in nature by hosts such as a
   wildlife reservoir, which in turn spills over into the livestock
   population.  Animals are usually infected by ingesting soilborne
   spores, such as in contaminated food or water. Spores can be picked up
   directly from the soil through grazing or from feed grown on infected
   soil. When periods of drought cause livestock to forage much closer to
   the ground, animals may ingest spores in soil they accidentally eat
   along with forage. After flooding, the concentration of spores caught
   in standing water increases when preexisting or transitory ponds begin
   to evaporate.

   Although rare, it is possible for animals to inhale dust harboring
   anthrax spores. Bites from flies and other insects that may harbor
   vegetative anthrax have also been reported to be vehicles for
   mechanical transmission.

   Clinical Signs

   Disease occurs when spores enter the body, germinate, multiply, and
   release toxins. The incubation
   period of natural infection in animals is typically 3 to 7 days with a
   range of 1 to 14 days, or more.

   In cattle and sheep, the course of illness may last about 1 to 2
   hours.  Clinical signs, such as fever up to 107 degrees Fahrenheit,
   muscle tremors, respiratory distress, and convulsions, often go
   unnoticed.  After death, there may be bloody discharges from the
   natural openings of the body, rapid bloating, a lack of rigor mortis,
   and the presence of unclotted blood. This failure of blood to clot is
   due to a toxin released by B. anthracis.

   Anthrax in horses and related animals is acute and can last up to 96
   hours. Clinical manifestations depend upon how the infection occurred.
   If due to ingestion of spores, as in cattle, septicemia, fever, colic,
   and enteritis are prominent. Anthrax due to insect bite introduction
   (mechanical transmission) is characterized by localized hot, painful,
   edematous, and subcutaneous swellings at the bite location that spread
   to the throat, lower neck, floor of the thorax, abdomen, prepuce, and
   mammary glands. These horses may have a high fever and dyspnea due to
   swelling of the throat or colic due to intestinal involvement.

   Swine, dogs, and cats usually show a characteristic swelling of the
   neck secondary to regional lymph node involvement, which causes
   dysphagia and dyspnea following ingestion of the bacteria.  An
   intestinal form of  anthrax with severe enteritis sometimes occurs in
   these species. Many carnivores apparently have a natural resistance,
   and recovery is not uncommon.
