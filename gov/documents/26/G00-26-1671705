   NOAA Extends Comment Period on Interim Final Rule for the Licensing of
                  Private Land Remote-Sensing Space Systems

   On July 31, 2000, NOAA published its Interim Final Rule revising its
   minimum requirements for the licensing, monitoring, and compliance of
   operations of private Earth remote sensing space systems. At that time,
   comments to the Interim Final Rule were requested no later than
   September 29, 2000. Due to several requests for an extension of the
   public comment period, the comment period has been extended to October
   30, 2000.

                 Meeting Held to Discuss Archive Obligations

   On August 29-30, NOAA and US Geological Survey (USGS) staff met with
   NOAA's commercial remote sensing licensees, to discuss licensees'
   obligations to provide data to the U.S. National Satellite Land Remote
   Sensing Data Archive. The meeting took place at the Archive, which is
   located at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South
   Dakota. Meeting participants had wide-ranging and thorough discussions
   on the definitions for unenhanced data, acceptance of restricted data,
   Archive strategies for requesting licensee data, data purge
   notifications, pricing policies, and formats and standards. As a
   follow-up to this meeting, USGS and NOAA will develop an outline of
   information required from licensees on their archiving plans and
   practices. Licensees will be required to provide this information to
   NOAA by early 2001.

NOAA Releases New Regulations on the Licensing of Private Land Remote-Sensing
                                Space Systems

   On July 20, 2000, NOAA submitted its interim final regulations on the
   Licensing of Private Land Remote-Sensing Space Systems to the Federal
   Register for publication. These regulations were published in the
   Federal Register on Monday, July 31. The regulations will become
   effective on August 30, 2000.

   These regulations will replace the current regulations which have been
   in place since 1987. The new regulations incorporate comments from
   NOAA's 1997 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and reflect changes in the
   industry, technical advances in remote sensing, and changes in U.S.
   laws and policies. They are intended to promote the development of the
   U.S. commercial remote sensing industry and promote the collection and
   widespread availability of earth remote sensing data while protecting
   U.S. national security concerns, foreign policy and international
   obligations.

   U.S. Government Printing Office's GPO Access Web Site. Click Here to

U.S. and Canadian Governments Sign an Agreement on Commercial Remote Sensing
                              Satellite Systems

   On June 16, 2000, the Department of State announced that the United
   States and Canada have entered into an agreement that fosters broad
   private uses of commercial remote sensing satellite systems while
   protecting common national security and foreign policy interests. The
   agreement, accomodating the advanced capabilities of RADARSAT-2, a
   Canadian synthetic aperture radar satellite system to be launched by a
   U.S. commercial space launch vehicle, will contribute to enhanced
   cooperation between our two countries in the commercial remote sensing
   satellite sector.

   this agreement. Click here for further information on Canada's
   commercial remote sensing policy.

  NOAA Supporting Long-Term Study of the Commercial Remote Sensing Industry

   Under the aegis of a five-year Space Act Agreement (SAA), the American
   Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing and NASA's Commercial
   Remote Sensing Program have begun to cooperate in developing a
   long-range analysis of the commercial remote sensing industry. The
   analysis will be supported by interviews with industry and government
   experts, a web-based survey, and a thorough review and analysis of
   related literature. The project aims to more clearly determine future
   remote sensing needs and requirements, and maximize the industry's
   baselines, standards, and socio-economic potential.

   A five-year effort will result in a comprehensive industry analysis.
   And by the end of FY 2004, ASPRS and NASA/CRSP expect to develop the
   remote sensing industry standard baseline, 10-year forecast, and
   related processes.

   At the request of ASPRS, the NOAA/NESDIS Commercial Remote Sensing
   Licensing Team has agreed to participate in this activity. Through its
   participation, NOAA/NESDIS expects to gain important insights into the
   status and future trends of this industry.
