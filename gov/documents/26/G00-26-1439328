   Stock Assessment and Multispecies Modeling

   The Stock Assessment and Multispecies Modeling homepage is designed to
   provide information on stock assessment methods used by the Alaska
   Fisheries Science Center and to promote communication within the
   assessment-research community. Also provided are samples of reports and
   activities of REFM Division personnel.

   Members of the Center's Stock Assessment and Multispecies Modeling
   Program are responsible for determining the condition of fisheries
   resources in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone using data collected by
   other Center scientists and developing strategies for managing those
   resources. Their research focuses on updating information on population
   dynamic trends, estimation of biological yields, and management
   strategies.  Members of our staff have contributed recently to the new
   National Fisheries standards.
