                  A message from Administrator Andrew S. Natsios

      Image: small USAID logo The Reorganization Working Group (see my Agency
       Notice of July 17) led by Janet Ballantyne and George Wachtenheim has
       completed its work. As a result of their efforts and the outstanding
       help given to them from all around the Agency, a number of decisions
      have been made and actions taken. I appreciate your input that enabled
       the Working Group to present coherent recommendations. The purpose of
      this notice is to bring you up to date on my decisions and to describe
         the next steps we must take to make the reorganization and reform
                                 actually happen.

                           Reorganization Decision Memos

      I have signed five decision memos. Briefly, these memos are as follows:
        * Memo #1: Unifies program and administrative allocation decisions
          and policy formulation within PPC; establishes the criteria for the
          establishment and staffing of three new pillar bureaus; clarifies
          the role of the regional bureaus; and mandates a DA/AID review of
          all Washington-based programs with a view toward maximizing
          resource availability to the field.
        * Memo #2: Establishes the three pillar bureaus (Global Health;
          Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade; and Democracy, Conflict and
          Humanitarian Assistance), while eliminating the Global and BHR
          Bureaus.
        * Memo #3: In accordance with the mandates of the first two
          reorganization memos, establishes a revised Agency Organization
          Chart.
        * Memo #4: Provides generic function statements for PPC and the
          pillar and regional bureaus.
        * Memo #5: Contains instructions to components of the M Bureau to
          undertake implementation of the reorganization within established
          deadlines. Three categories of actions are addressed, those which
          affect: 1. people (e.g. movements between bureaus), 2. reallocation
          of office space, and 3. communications (i.e. computers and
          telephones).

      Other proposals have been developed by the Reorganization Working Group
       that will impact on the joining of the policy and resource allocation
      processes within PPC. A final decision on these matters will rest with
                              AA/PPC, Patrick Cronin.

                                    Next Steps

       Some of the "next steps" are implicit from some of the above decision
                      memos. Others are listed briefly below.
        * Based on criteria that will be provided in advance, Acting DA/AID
          Janet Ballantyne will conduct a review of all Washington-based
          programs (excluding those currently managed by BHR). This review
          will result in recommendations to the Administrator regarding which
          projects will be considered for phaseout and, of those that will
          continue, which will be located in the pillar bureaus, the field,
          and the regional bureau. It will also determine the number and
          nature of USDH and other technical staff to be assigned to the
          pillar and regional bureaus.
        * Once they are in place, the new pillar and regional AAs will decide
          the structure for their bureaus that will best enable them to
          achieve our Agency goals.
        * PPC will decide on the future of the R4 report and CBJ and issue
          appropriate guidance.

         Finally, as you are aware, apart from the tasks undertaken by the
      Reorganization Working Group, elements in M have been putting together
         reform programs in the critical areas of procurement, personnel,
          financial management, administrative services, and information
       management. I will communicate the results of this work in a separate
                                      notice.

            While I am extremely pleased by the accomplishments of the
           Reorganization Working Group, we know from our experience as
      development professionals that it is only effective implementation that
       produces results. Implementation of our restructuring efforts is just
      beginning, and I know that I can count on your commitment and hard work
      in helping this to succeed. In the end, we will have an Agency that is
      better able to meet the foreign policy needs of our country and, in the
      process, improve the lives of the people we work with around the world.
