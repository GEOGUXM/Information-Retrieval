      The NOAA collection spans centuries of time and much of the natural
     world from the center of the Earth to the surface of the Sun.

     NOAA is descended from the oldest physical science agencies in the
     United States Federal Government including the Coast Survey (1807),
     Weather Service (1870) and Fish Commission (1871).

     The NOAA of today carries on the work begun by these agencies under
     the auspices of the National Ocean Service, the National Weather
     Service , the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Office of
     Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the National Environmental
     Satellite, Data, and Information Service.

     Because of this broad base of scientific expertise and the
     geographic range under which NOAA science and observations are
     conducted, the NOAA collection includes thousands of weather and
     space images, hundreds of images of our shores and coastal seas, and
     thousands of marine species images ranging from the great whales to
     the most minute plankton.

     The geographic range of NOAA work encompasses polar region to polar
     region and much of the World's oceans. On any given day NOAA
     personnel could be chasing tornadoes, flying into hurricanes,
     battling stormy seas, tagging turtles and whales, taking scientific
     readings at the South Pole, monitoring the health of coral reefs, or
     engaging in virtually any task that can be thought of related to
     monitoring our environment and the health of our planet.

     Come join NOAA on its journey through the sciences and over the face
     of our planet, under its waves, and into space!
