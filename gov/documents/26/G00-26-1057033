   Technical Reference
                           New Updated
                       2001 DATAR Manual
                       is available online!

      Your source for technical information about the California Alcohol and
      Drug Data System (CADDS) InfoNet.

      What are the CADDS and DATAR Data Systems?

      SACPA Related Updates for CADDS & DATAR Systems

      If your organization is interested in joining the CADDS InfoNet and
      already has an automated CADDS data system, see Getting Started .

      If your organization is interested in joining the CADDS InfoNet but
      does not have an automated CADDS data system (i.e., you are mailing
      paper forms to Sacramento), contact the ITG staff about implementing
      the CADDS Access Solution, free PC software developed by ITG for CADDS
      data collection and storage.

      The reference information on the remainder of this page assumes that
      you already have an automated CADDS data system and are participating
      in the InfoNet.

      2001 CADDS Manual & Forms

      This is the latest available version of the CADDS Instruction Manual,
      updated July 2001. The manual has been updated with the latest
      Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act (SACPA) changes. NOTE: Samples
      of the CADDS forms are only available in .pdf format. For usable copies
      of the actual forms, please contact your ADP CADDS Liaison.

      CADDS Record Layouts

      The ASCII file that you send to Sacramento (or to your county office)
      via the InfoNet must be 152 bytes in length and must have the layout
      described in the CADDS Admission & Discharge record layout . You can
      also download the CADDS Record Layouts in an MS-Word97 document by
      'right-clicking' here and choosing 'save target as'.

      Understanding the Returned Files

      CADDS data is processed by ADP several times each month. CADDS records
      which cannot be processed are automatically returned via the InfoNet to
      the same e-mail address from which they were sent. In their first 152
      columns, these records have the same layout as the submitted Admission
      & Discharge records, except that ADP has added century indicators in
      columns 15-19 (a formerly blank area).

      In the subsequent columns the returned files contain error codes. For
      more information, see the record layout page for UDIS and SUSP files.

      CADDS Error Codes

      The error codes assigned by the CADDS system are very specific and will
      explain why certain records are being returned. Please save a copy of
      the CADDS Error Codes for your reference. These codes also are included
      in the MS-Word97 CADDS Record Layout document.
