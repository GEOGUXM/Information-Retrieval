               The Retrieval Group of the Information Access Division
   works with industry, academia and other government agencies to promote
   the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating
   (largely) unstructured textual information, especially the browsing,
   searching, and presentation of that information.

   Activities (grouped into 4 major areas):
     * Encourage retrieval research involving large, unstructured text
       files by providing test collections and organizing the TREC
       conference and its proceedings
     * Continue to create new test collections, focusing mainly on
       collections to support specific information retrieval sub-tasks
       such as cross-language retrieval and multimedia retrieval
     * Develop better evaluation methodology for information access,
       including improved evaluation measures for comparing systems using
       test collections and new evaluation measures for interactive
       searching and browsing operations
     * Enable faster development of prototype (commercial, academic and
       government) retrieval systems by distribution of a basic
       state-of-the-art search engine (the PRISE system) that includes
       implementation of a Z39.50 client/server
