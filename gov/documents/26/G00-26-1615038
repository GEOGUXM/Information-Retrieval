Search Hints

   The information below provides basic instruction and guidelines for
   searching for documents in the Reading Room Catalog. For further
   assistance, please contact the Reading Room staff.

General Information

     * It doesn't matter if you use capital letters or lower case -- the
       catalog is case insensitive.

     * Although you can specify search criteria in more than one field at
       a time (e.g. search on date and title), there is no true Boolean
       searching within fields (i.e. you can't use AND, OR, NOT).

     * The default for displaying search results is by ascending Accession
       Number. Generally, the higher the accession number, the more
       recently that item was entered into the Catalog. There are three
       other options for sorting and displaying search results -- you can
       choose to display results by the following:
         1. Document Number (alpha-numerically): items with no document
            number will display first.
         2. Title (alphabetically)
         3. Date Published (chronologically): items where no dates are
            indicated will display first, then those items published in
            the same year are grouped together. Within that year, records
            that have no month or day listed display first, then those
            with just a month and year, then within that month, those with
            days, months and years (i.e. 1999 then 11/1999 then 11/14/1999
            then 12/1999).

     * The following fields have controlled vocabulary:
         1. Document Categories
         2. Corporate Authors
         3. Shelving Location
         4. Location Extension
       You must choose a search term from one of the options in the
       authority lists by clicking on the down arrow at the far right of
       the field.

     * Big searches take time. A search that results in a large number of
       hits (i.e. over 500) may take several seconds to perform. You will
       first see the number of results and then it may take several more
       seconds before the actual results are displayed. To prevent these
       delays, you may want to narrow your search criteria (i.e. rather
       than search for all documents that contain "Hanford" in the title,
       limit the search to those documents that contain "Hanford" in the
       title that were published after 1993).

     * Each search will retrieve the total number of records in the
       catalog that match the specified search criteria, but only 50
       records are printed or displayed on the screen at a time. If your
       search retrieves more than 50 records and you want to print the
       entire results, you need to print each list of 50 records
       separately. You can select items from each group of 50 and then
       just print what is selected.

Comparison Operators

     * The initial search screen has the comparison operators set on the
       most commonly used operator. To change the operator for a field,
       click on the arrow to the right of that field. Not all of the
       following options are available for all fields:
          + Equals
          + Greater Than
          + Less Than
          + Starts With
          + Contains
          + Ends With
          + Does Not Equal

Document Number Searching

   The quickest search is by document number. Usually the Reading Room
   catalog contains the document number as it appears on the report, using
   the rules in the chart below:


              * Do NOT use preceding zeros with HW numbers,
                                    i.e. HW-7000, (not HW-07000

              * Enter HW-3- & HW-7- numbers with 2 hyphens:
                                  i.e. HW-3-1234 (not HW 3-1234)

     * All documents with these prefixes get entered as below, regardless
       of how it is on the actual document:
          + DOE/RL-95-01
          + HW-12345
          + DUH-10000
          + GEH-19226
          + GAO/RCED-95-3
          + EPA-520/2-88-030

                 * Standard abbreviations used for suffixes:
                      + ADD for addendum
                      + BK for book
                      + CH for chapter
                      + DEL for declassified with deletions
                      + PT for part
                      + RD for rough draft
                      + REV for revision
                      + SEC for section
                      + SUP for supplement
                      + VOL for volume

      * It is generally best to leave off all the suffixes so all
        variations of a document number will be retrieved.
          Example: a search for "document number contains" HW-17381 will
                                     retrieve
                                   HW-17381-DEL
                                HW-17381-DEL Rev.1
                                  HW-17381-NOTES
                                HW-17381-DEL Rev.2

Title Searching

     * When searching on titles, remember that the computer will look for
       exact matches so it is usually best to use just a portion of the
       title and sometimes to truncate words.
       Example: searching for "remediat" in the title will retrieve all
       titles with the words "remediation" and "remediate" and
       "remediating" in them.
     * If the document title youre searching for contains an acronym or
       abbreviation, try searching for it with the acronym or abbreviation
       spelled out as well as just the acronym or abbreviation itself.
     * Unless youre positive you have the title exactly right, it is best
       to use the comparison operator "contains" when searching in the
       title field.
     * You cannot combine terms in the title field.

Author Searching

     * You can search by the author's last name or last name and first
       initial. The initial is optional.
     * Only one name can be searched at a time, even if the report had
       several authors.

Back to Top

Date Searching

     * It is usually best to use just the year but there are 3 possible
       variations to use when searching the date field:
          + yyyy
          + yyyy/mm
          + yyyy/mm/dd

     * Although the search form has a box for both "Start" and "End" you
       can leave the "End" box empty.
       Example: if youre looking for documents published in 1855, do a
       search using the "equals" comparison operator and type 1855 in the
       "Start" box.

     * When using the "Between" operator, be aware that it includes the
       start and end dates. Example: searching for documents between
       "Start" 1943 and "End" 1945 will retrieve reports dated January 1,
       1943 through December 31, 1945.

Searching for Electronic Full-text Documents

   Clicking on the box in this field of the search form will produce a
   listing of all the records in the catalog that have URL's with direct
   links to the full text of the report. This can be used in conjunction
   with other search criteria to limit the results to only reports with
   links to full text.

Viewing and Printing Search Results

   Once your search has retrieved records, there are several options for
   viewing and/or printing the results.

     * The search results screen gives abbreviated information (Accession
       Number, Document Number, Location on the Reading Room shelves, full
       Title, and the Date Published) about the documents -- to view the
       complete catalog record for a specific item, click on the Accession
       Number. This will bring up the "Reading Room Detailed Document
       Report."
     * If you want to reduce the number of records retrieved and only view
       or print a few on the list, click on the "Select" box for each
       record you want. Once all the desired records are marked, click on
       the "Retrieve Selected Records" button at the end of the list of
       search results. This will give you the same abbreviated information
       that you saw on the earlier screen, but just for the records you
       chose.
     * You can print search results by clicking on your browsers print
       button or using the print option under the File Menu. You can print
       either the initial screen with the full list of search results, or
       a narrowed down list of marked records, or the full catalog record
       of individual items from the "Reading Room Detailed Document
       Report".
