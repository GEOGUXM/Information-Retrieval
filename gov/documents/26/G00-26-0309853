   The Texas A&M CDF team has both hardware and software projects in Run
   II and is expected to play a leading role in several areas. These
   include (1) Online/Offline Data Monitoring System (ObjectMon), (2)
   Adding Timing Information for the EM Calorimeters for Run IIb Upgrade
   (EM Timing Project), (3) Standard/Quasi-Model-Independent Searches for
   New Physics, especially in Supersymmetry, (4) Tau ID at Level 3 and
   Offline using Neural Nets, and (5) Muon Reconstruction Software. If you
   wish to join and contribute to our project, please let us know about it
   via sending a notice to Prof. Teruki Kamon, Prof. Peter McIntyre and
   Prof. David Toback
