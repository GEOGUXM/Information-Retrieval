   Actuaries at SSA The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
   (OASDI) program is administered by the Social Security Administration
   (SSA). The program is funded by payroll taxes, taxes on self-employment
   income, and income from the taxation of benefits. Income in excess of
   expenditures is invested in Federal Government securities held in trust
   funds.

   Overall review of the OASDI program's balance between future benefit
   liabilities and future tax collections is central to the
   responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Actuary. We estimate the
   financial impact of the many proposals to change the Social Security
   program. We also determine automatic increases in benefit rates
   (cost-of-living adjustments) and other amounts that affect the
   financial status of the program.

   Another program administered by SSA is the Supplemental Security
   Income, or SSI, program. The program is funded by general tax revenue.
   Unlike Social Security, there is no trust fund for SSI. The Office of
   the Chief Actuary estimates the future cost of the SSI program and the
   financial impact of proposals to change it.
