   RACC Tips - August 29, 2001 by Paul Kirkwood, SR
Per the Last RACC Meeting call...Here are the performance tips that are
used at some sites.

1. Every Day shift (And every shift prior to Svr Wx).
Log out of all D2D and applications running (Including Text).
In the Options of the DtLogin Screen select Restart Login Screen.
This cleans up the X Server, which can end up using up a lot of memory
as it grows over a shift (Max I have seen is 250MB).

2. Before a Svr Wx shift, restart all processes on the DS's and AS's, If
the ESA, SOO, or AFP are not in the office staff (Lead Forecaster
Decision) can call NCF and ask them to restart the processes. We also
stop and restart the Notification Server.  Have all the processes be
fresh and newly started before the SVR wx occurs.  Also Reset the XServers
before the event.

3. (We also have NCF put us in Critical Weather Watch.)

4. To speed up the DS, For all triggers, we only use the textdb -w if
necessary, We do not use the textdb -r option on any of them.  We also
only run a trigger once per PIL.  If you need to run multiple
applications on the Same PIL, we use on C-Shell or Posix shell script to
run all applications.  This way your number of triggers is much smaller.

5. Tweaking the number of frames to loop in the small panes of D2D, helps
free up memory, but does take longer to reload after swapping panes.  I
am currently running metrics on the difference.

There have been some comments that the WarnGen text window takes some
time to pop up on the text workstation during a severe weather event.
Here is a list of performance tips to try to speed up the text
window/workstations.

6.  If you have time before the weather reaches your area.  Close all
windows and programs running on the text workstation.  Logout of the workstation
and power off the text workstation, then turn the power
back on.

7.  Exit out of the Monitoring and Controller window.  Do not have this running
on your warning workstation.

8.  Make sure that you do not have the Update Obs feature turned on in
any of your text windows.

9.  Recommend not running any other local applications on your text workstation.

10.  Limit the number of looping frames in your D2D windows.  If you
can, do not loop your products in the small panes.

11.  Limit the number of alerts you send to that text workstation.

12.  If your Aplication Server is being impacted you can do the
following to disable SCAN/FFMP.

  as user fxa on AS1,

  To stop:

  cd /awips/fxa/bin
  ./stopFFMPprocessor
  ./stopSCANprocessor
  chmod 444 startFFMPprocessor
  chmod 444 startSCANprocessor
  chmod 444 SCANprocessor
  chmod 444 FFMPprocessor
  remsh as2 "chmod 444 /awips/fxa/bin/startFFMPprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 444 /awips/fxa/bin/startSCANprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 444 /awips/fxa/bin/SCANprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 444 /awips/fxa/bin/FFMPprocessor"

  To start:

  cd /awips/fxa/bin
  chmod 775 startFFMPprocessor
  chmod 775 startSCANprocessor
  chmod 775 SCANprocessor
  chmod 775 FFMPprocessor
  remsh as2 "chmod 775 /awips/fxa/bin/startFFMPprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 775 /awips/fxa/bin/startSCANprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 775 /awips/fxa/bin/SCANprocessor"
  remsh as2 "chmod 775 /awips/fxa/bin/FFMPprocessor"
  ./startFFMPprocessor
  ./startSCANprocessor

 PLEASE remember to notify the NCF if do this so that they
 will not restart these processes for you.  You can also
 have the NCF put your site in critical watch mode during
 active weather and they will be able to monitor your system.

 Thanks,
 Paul K.
