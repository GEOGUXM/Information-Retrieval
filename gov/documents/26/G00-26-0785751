   State Vehicular Recreation Areas
   Home Page




   The State Vehicular Recreation Areas or SVRAs, are OHV parks that are
   operated by the OHMVR Division of California State Parks. Each SVRA has
   an operational program that provides (in most locations) the following
   services:

     Trails, tracks, and other OHV Recreation opportunities. Facilities
     like restrooms, camping, shade ramadas, water, and in some
     locations, an OHV parts store. Public safety, including law
     enforcement, first aid, and search and rescue. Maintenance and
     housekeeping, including repair and maintenance of OHV trails,
     buildings, equipment and public use facilities. Interpretive and
     educational activities and publications promoting safe and
     responsible OHV recreation. Resource management designed to sustain
     OHV opportunities, protects and enhances wildlife habitat, erosion
     control, revegetation, etc.

   Federal and Local OHV Parks, Areas and Trails

     This is a broad category of OHV recreation opportunity, primarily
     associated with the OHV Programs partnership with cities, counties
     and federal agencies. It includes local OHV "parks" such as Glen
     Helen or Frank Raines; large federal "areas" like Glamis Dunes or
     Kennedy Meadows; and "trails" such as the Rubicon or Mojave Road.
     They provide thousands of acres and hundreds of miles of roads and
     trails for OHV Recreation. The Bureau of Land Management, the US
     Forest Service and many cities and counties receive several millions
     of dollars from the OHV Fund every year to help them provide for and
     manage the OHVs using their land.

   Statewide Motorized Trail System

     The Statewide Motorized Trail System (SMTS) is a unique compilation
     of the above. The backbone of the SMTS is the California Back
     Country Discovery Trail (CBDT). The CBDT is a concept that is now
     materializing, which will provide long- distance touring
     opportunities throughout the state. The ultimate goal of the CBDT is
     to establish a motorized trail clear across California that links
     Mexico to Oregon.
