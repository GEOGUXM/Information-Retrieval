     Section B. Information Collected and How it is Used
       _______________________________________________________________

     What information we collect if you only browse this site. If you do
     nothing during your visit to our web site but browse, read pages, or
     download information, we will gather and store certain information
     about your visit. In most cases, this information does not identify
     you personally. We automatically collect and store the following
     information about your visit:

    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used (The Internet
       Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your
       Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the
       Internet Protocol Address to direct the web pages you see in your
       browser to you. This address can be translated to determine the
       domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or
       yourschool.edu). If you own and use a domain name that is unique to
       you as an individual, we will be able to identify to you personally
       the actions you took in browsing our site and our responses.);
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
    3. The date and time you visited this site;
    4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
    5. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.

     The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used
     by the Office of the Administrator for the Courts only to improve
     the content of our web services and to help us understand how people
     are using our services. We analyze this information and the web site
     logs to determine how our web site is being used, so that we may
     continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

     What we collect if you volunteer information. If during your visit
     to our web site you send us an email, participate in a survey, or
     fill out a form, we will also collect and retain:

    1. Your email address and the contents of your email including any
       audio, video, or graphic information files or formats you send us.
    2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
    3. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other
       purpose.

     We use your email to respond appropriately, including to respond
     directly to you, to address issues you may identify, to further
     improve our web site, or to forward to another agency for
     appropriate action. Survey information and information from other
     on-line forms is used as described on the pages that provide
     instructions for those forms and surveys.

     Section C. Personal Information and Choice
       _______________________________________________________________

     You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.
     "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
     readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal
     information includes such things as an individual's name, address,
     phone number, and email address. A domain name or Internet Protocol
     address may also be considered personal information if you have
     registered a domain name or licensed an Internet Protocol address,
     and are the sole user of the name or address.

     We do not collect personal information about you unless you
     voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, participate in a
     survey, complete an on-line form, or access this website from a
     domain name or Internet Protocol address that can be identified to
     you personally. You may choose not to contact us by email,
     participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using
     an on-line form. Your choice to not participate in these activities
     will not impair your ability to browse this website and read or
     download any information provided on the site.

     If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered
     by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may
     protect it. This information may be a public record once you provide
     it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not
     protected by state or federal law.

     If you believe that your personal information is being used for a
     purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact
     the OAC Data Dissemination Administrator (see Section H. Contact
     Information, below).

     Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
     provided by or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be
     treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be
     subject to public access.

     Section D. Public Access to Information
       _______________________________________________________________

     In Washington, laws exist to ensure that state government is open
     and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and
     information possessed by state government. At the same time, there
     are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that
     serve various needs, including the privacy of individuals.
     Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

     All of the information collected at this site become public records
     that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the
     public, unless an exemption in law exists.

     Section E. Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable
     Information
       _______________________________________________________________

     You may review any personally identifiable information we collect
     about you via this website by using the information in the Contact
     Information section at the end of this Notice. You may request
     changes to your personally identifiable information you believe to
     be inaccurate by submitting either an email or written request that
     credibly shows the inaccuracy. We will take reasonable steps to
     verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

     Section F. Security
       _______________________________________________________________

     As developer and manager of Washington Courts website, the Office of
     the Administrator for the Courts has taken several steps to
     safeguard the integrity of its data and prevent unauthorized access

     intended to prevent corruption of data, block unknown or
     unauthorized access to our systems and information, and to provide
     reasonable protection of private information in our possession.

     This information should not be construed in any way as giving
     business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the
     security of information provided via Washington courts web sites.
