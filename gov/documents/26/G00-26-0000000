   Prototype Bug and Enhancement Tracking System Now Available

      A prototype tracking system developed by the USB now enables you to
      search for bugs, Technical Action Requests (TARs), and enhancements by
      business area, bug/enhancement, or text. As the USB receives
      information from each business area, they are populating the system.

      During the next three to four months until the Helpdesk's new tracking
      system is available to all users, use this interim system to quickly
      locate incident and enhancement numbers, priorities, descriptions, and
      schedules.

      Contact the Helpdesk at 301-402-7469 or by email at helpdesk@od.nih.gov
      with questions.
