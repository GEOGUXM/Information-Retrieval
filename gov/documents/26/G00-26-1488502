    President Clintons Radio Address to the Nation: Keeping the Heat and
                   Lights On During Unusually Cold Weather

   December 30, 2000

   Today, President Clinton, in his radio address to the nation, will
   announce a series of steps to reduce the likelihood and severity of
   energy shortages to help Americans in what will likely be the coldest
   winter in several years. Unparalleled economic growth and cold weather
   have led to significant increases in the demand for energy. For
   instance, demand for electricity in California is up 13 percent from
   last year, largely in response to a growing economy. Yet power
   generation capacity has not kept up to that pace, and electricity
   supplies have tightened while prices have risen in the western United
   States. When combined with cold weather following three warmer than
   average winters in a row, the increased demand for energy to heat and
   power our homes and businesses has led to energy bills significantly
   larger than in recent winters. The Clinton Administration has been
   taking steps since last winter to meet this challenge, and is taking
   further steps reduce the risk of supply shortages and to ease the
   burden of energy prices on families and small businesses.

   PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL RELEASE $300 MILLION IN LIHEAP EMERGENCY FUNDS
   IN RESPONSE TO HIGH HEATING FUEL PRICES: President Clinton will direct
   the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to release $300
   million in Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) emergency
   funds to all States to assist low-income households facing substantial
   increases in home heating fuel prices. With this release of $300
   million in LIHEAP emergency funds, the President will have directed HHS
   to release a total of $856 million in LIHEAP emergency funds since
   September to help States assist low-income households in coping with
   high fuel prices during this winter. In addition to this release, HHS
   released $156 million on December 18th and $400 million on September
   23rd. The Department of Energy projects that heating oil prices this
   winter will be 29 percent higher than last winter, and natural gas
   prices will be 40 percent higher than last winter.

   PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE 4 STEPS TO HELP AMERICANS DURING
   THE WINTER: The measures that President Clinton has already taken were
   critical steps towards preparing for cold weather and energy shortages
   with their accompanying high prices this winter. Following on their
   success, and in order to stay ahead of potential challenges, President
   Clinton is taking four additional steps to prepare for possible energy
   shortages during the cold months ahead.
     * Keeping the Heating Fuels Distribution Systems Open: President
       Clinton will direct the Departments of Energy and Transportation to
       work together to ensure that the heating oil distribution system is
       not disrupted by inclement weather. For instance, the Coast Guard
       will keep open shipping channels that may freeze so that heating
       oil barges can make critical deliveries of heating oil to Northern
       ports. The Department of Energy Office of Energy Emergencies will
       coordinate closely with the Department of Transportation Emergency
       Transportation Representative to address any transportation
       problems as they arise in order to keep heating fuel moving through
       the distribution system to the consumer.
     * Conserving Electricity at Federal Facilities: President Clinton
       will direct managers of all Federal buildings in the Pacific
       Northwest to join those in California to take steps to reduce
       consumption of power to the maximum extent practicable consistent
       with the health and welfare of employees. By expanding its
       conservation effort beyond California to Washington and Oregon, the
       Federal government can help ease possible electricity shortages and
       reduce the risk of power outages in homes and businesses on the
       West Coast.
     * Keeping the Lights on in California: Secretary of Energy Bill
       Richardson extended an emergency order initially invoked on
       December 14th pursuant to the Federal Power Act to require
       generators and marketers to make power available to keep the lights
       on in California.
     * Providing SBA Loans to Small Businesses Hurt by Rising Energy
       Costs: President Clinton will direct the Small Business
       Administration (SBA) to work with its lending partners to reach out
       to small businesses suffering from the burden of high energy costs.
       For qualified businesses, short-term and long-term loans will be
       available to cushion the impact of rising energy prices on these
       businesses. With an SBA-guaranteed loan, small businesses will have
       sufficient cash available to continue to meet their immediate
       energy needs. Additionally, these guaranteed loans will allow them
       to spread their energy payments over a longer period than the
       payment period typically provided by their vendors.

   THESE ACTIONS BUILD ON THE SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
   EXCHANGE THAT INCREASED CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES: In September, President
   Clinton directed Secretary of Energy Richardson to initiate a 30
   million barrel time exchange of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum
   Reserve (SPR) in order to prevent a supply crisis, that could have had
   a particularly harsh effect on home heating oil supplies in the
   Northeast. On September 20th, just prior to the announcement of the
   exchange, inventories were 21 million barrels below the same time last
   year. Since then, crude oil inventories had risen to last years levels.
   The improved inventory outlook is reflected in the lower price of crude
   oil, which has fallen from over $37 to under $27 per barrel. The
   heating oil inventory situation has also stabilized, with distillate
   production over the last four weeks 11 million barrels above the same
   period in 1999. As we enter winter following an unusually cold November
   and December, President Clintons SPR time-exchange has improved the
   crude oil inventories and the incentives for refiners to continue
   producing heating oil needed to heat homes and businesses this winter.
