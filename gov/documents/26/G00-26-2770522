   REVISED PRESS RELEASE
   FCC PROPOSES NEW EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO) RULES FOR BROADCAST
   AND CABLE

   Washington, D.C. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a
   Second Notice of Proposed Rule Making seeking comments on new equal
   employment opportunity (EEO) rules for broadcast and cable, including
   multichannel video program distributors (MVPDs). The Commission
   reaffirmed the Commissions long-standing anti-discrimination rule and
   proposed to require broad outreach to all qualified job candidates for
   positions at radio, television and cable companies.

   The proposed rules respond to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
   decision in 2001 in DC/MD/DE Broadcasters Association v. FCC
   (Association) which held that a portion of the outreach requirements of
   the broadcast EEO rule adopted in 2000 was unconstitutional. The former
   rule provided two recruitment options, which were referred to as Option
   A and Option B. The Court found no statutory or constitutional
   infirmity with Option A. However, it found that Option B was
   unconstitutional. Even though the Court found only Option B
   unconstitutional, it vacated the Commissions EEO rules. The Court
   concluded that the two options could not be readily severed.

   The Commission stated that it is important to have EEO rules that
   prohibit discrimination in broadcast and cable employment and also
   require broadcasters and cable entities to reach out to all segments of
   the community in filling vacancies. The proposed new rules require
   broadcast licensees to widely disseminate information about job
   openings to all segments of the community to ensure that all qualified
   applicants have sufficient opportunity to compete for jobs in the
   broadcast industry. The Commission also proposes new EEO rules
   applicable to cable entities, including MVPDs, to conform them, as much
   as possible, to the broadcast EEO rule.

   In addition to requiring broadcasters and cable entities, including
   MVPDs to recruit for every full-time vacancy in a manner designed to
   achieve broad outreach, the proposed rules would require the
   implementation of two supplemental recruitment measures: (1) sending
   job vacancy announcements to recruitment organizations that request
   them; and (2) selecting from a menu of non-vacancy specific outreach
   approaches, such as job fairs, internship programs, and interaction
   with educational and community groups.

   Broadcast stations with fewer than five full-time employees and cable
   entities, including MVPDs, with fewer than six full-time employees in
   the past have not been required to demonstrate compliance with the EEO
   program requirements. The Second Notice requests comments as to whether
   these exemptions can or should be increased. The proposed rules would
   require all other broadcasters and cable entities to place an annual
   EEO report in their public file detailing their outreach efforts. Under
   the Commissions former rule, broadcasters were required to file a
   Statement of Compliance every second, fourth and sixth year of the
   license term certifying compliance with the EEO rule. The proposed
   rules would eliminate this requirement in the second and sixth years
   and require a filing only by radio stations with more than ten
   full-time employees and television stations with five or more full-time
   employees, which would be subject to mid-term review of their EEO
   efforts, in the fourth year of the license term. Cable entities would
   be required to file annual reports concerning their EEO efforts and to
   submit their annual EEO public file reports as part of the supplemental
   information required by statute to be filed every five years.

   The Commission also proposes to retain the requirement that
   broadcasters and cable entities file annual employment reports. The
   Commission would use the information in the annual employment reports
   only to monitor industry employment trends and prepare reports to
   Congress. Nevertheless, the Commission welcomes comments on whether the
   forms can or should be revised.

   Action by the Commission December 12, 2001, by Second Notice of
   Proposed Rule Making (FCC 01-363). Chairman Powell, Commissioners
   Abernathy, Copps, and Martin, with Chairman Powell, Commissioners Copps
   and Martin issuing separate statements.
