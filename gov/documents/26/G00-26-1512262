Introduction - The Dust Hypothesis

Question:




           Satellite Images

        Africa
        NASA and NOAA satellites have recorded Saharan dust crossing the
        Atlantic Ocean

   Why have coral reefs that are bathed in clear oceanic waters throughout
   much of the Caribbean suffered algal infestation, coral diseases, and
   near extinction of herbivorous sea urchins almost simultaneously during
   the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s? The best known factors detrimental
   to coral reefs include sewage, run-off from land, dredging, UV light,
   etc. These factors do not apply for many affected reefs where human
   population is low. Is there an alternative way to spread nutrients and
   diseases?

   Increasing aridity and desertification in northern Africa began in the
   mid-1960s, was exacerbated in the 1970s and 1980s, and then began to
   decline in the 1990s. Is it circumstance that coral reef declines
   occurred during the same period as desertification? Various peaks in
   the dust record, at Barbados and elsewhere in the western Atlantic
   (Prospero and Nees, 1986), coincide with benchmark events on reefs
   throughout the Caribbean (courtesy of Prospero, 1997) with known coral
   reef perturbations.

  Hypothesis

   The hypothesis proposed here is that many coral reef events, algal
   infestation, white band and black band disease, sea fan disease, sea
   urchin die-off and possibly mass coral bleaching are somehow related to
   dust from north Africa.

   That Saharan dust is deposited in the western Atlantic is demonstrated
   by the following:
    1. The record from Barbados and elsewhere
    2. Red iron-and clay-rich soils on carbonate islands throughout the
       Caribbean that are known to be of Saharan dust origin (Muhs et al.,
       1990)
    3. The Amazon rain forest in South America derives essential nutrients
       (mainly phosphate) from Saharan dust (Swap et al., 1992).

   The mechanisms by which dust may affect reefs include direct
   fertilization of benthic algae by iron or other nutrients interacting
   with NH[4] and NO[2] + NO[3]-rich submarine ground water, and by
   broadcasting of bacterial, viral and fungal spores. Example: The fungus
   affecting sea fans throughout the Caribbean has been identified as a
   land-based Aspergillus sp. a fungus that does not reproduce in sea
   water (Smith et al., 1996).

  Conclusion

   Dust may be a viable explanation for the plight of coral reefs
   throughout the Caribbean. The hypothesis is in need of verification.

   Reef and Human Health" conference was held August 14-15, 2001 in St.
