                          Fact Sheet #10 (FY 2002)
                              January 28, 2002

                  U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
     BUREAU FOR DEMOCRACY, CONFLICT, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (DCHA)
              OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA)

           Fact Sheet #10, Fiscal Year (FY 2002), January 28, 2002
     __________________________________________________________________

                              Numbers Affected
     * Total Addected: Approximately 350,000 (U.N.)
     * Deaths: Approximately 147 (U.N. and USAID/OFDA field reports)
     * Displaced People: Approximately to 30,000 (USAID/OFDA field
       reports)
     * Homes Destroyed: 12,500 households (60,000 to 80,000 people)
       (USAID/OFDA field reports)

                              Current Situation
     * A survey by relief agencies determined that there were
       approximately 229,000 people in Goma on January 23. The city
       population is increasing as displaced people return to Goma.
     * Most aid agencies agree that approximately 12,500 households,
       between 60,000 and 80,000 people, lost their homes as a result of
       the volcano. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
       Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates this figure to be 103,000 people, and
       local authorities estimate that the figure is as high as 180,000.
     * USAID/OFDA field staff report that there are approximately 30,000
       displaced people in the following areas: in Sake, DRC (5,000); in
       Rutshuru, DRC (5,000); in displacement camps near Gisenyi and
       Ruhengeri, Rwanda (5,000); in Bukavu, DRC (15,000).
     * The World Food Program (WFP) expects to complete a general
       distribution of one-week rations to the entire population in Goma
       by January 29. Subsequent food distributions will be targeted to
       affected groups. WFP has previously announced that it would provide
       rations for the entire city population for three months. This plan
       has been changed in favor of more focused distributions, based on
       discussions with relief agencies operating in the area.
     * UNICEF has been coordinating the distribution of non-food items in
       Goma and Sake, DRC. There is currently a general distribution of
       goods to all residents, comprised of blankets, soap, water jugs,
       and plastic sheets for shelter. Thirty-eight thousand families have
       received non-food items distribution to date. Relief agencies plan
       to begin distribution of non-food items to families that lost their
       homes on February 2. The distribution will provide a "displacement
       pack" containing two water jugs, three blankets, one five-person
       cooking set, five kilograms of soap, and one plastic sheet for
       shelter. Local authorities have found records in government offices
       that will help to construct a list of people whose homes were
       damaged by the volcano.
     * Each day there are several incidents of unruly crowds at the eleven
       food and non-food item distribution points in Goma and Sake.
       Implementing agencies are working with local authorities to better
       manage the crowds.
     * There are currently 30 water bladders positioned throughout the
       city, receiving a total of one million liters of water by truck
       from the city water network each day. There are also 24
       chlorination stations along the waterfront to provide potable
       water. The water distribution system is estimated to be providing
       water to 50 percent of its previous service area.
     * There has been one confirmed case of cholera in Goma, and two
       recent cases of cholera-like symptoms. The cases of cholera
       symptoms are coming from two quarters where water is relatively
       scarce. There have also been several unconfirmed cases of measles
       in Goma.
     * Some relief shipments crossing into the Democratic Republic of
       Congo (DRC) are being delayed by border guards, and some levies are
       being imposed on humanitarian traffic.

                          U.S. Government Response
     * USAID/OFDA has made $3 million available for relief assistance in
       response to the Goma volcano. Funds may be applied toward monetary
       grants to relief agencies, additional commodities shipments, or
       local purchase of relief items as needs require.
     * USAID/OFDA is providing seismographic equipment to the Goma
       Volcanic Observatory that will allow seismologists in the area to
       better understand the continuing low-level earthquakes being
       experienced in the affected area. The equipment includes three
       seismometers and three seismographs, obtained by USAID/OFDA through
       an agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey. The equipment will
       arrive at Kigali, Rwanda on February 1.
     * USAID/OFDA has provided two airlifts of relief commodities
       containing a total of 40,000 wool blankets, 35,200 water jugs, 20
       10,000-liter water bladders, 300 rolls of plastic sheeting for
       shelter, and 5,000 dust masks.
     * USAID Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) has approved the loan of
       1,714 metric tons (MT) of Title II emergency food aid, valued at
       $1.1 million, from existing programs in the region.
     * The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved the loan of
       3,450 MT of 416(b) emergency food commodities, valued at $2,3
       million, from existing programs in the region.
     * The USAID assistance team consists of six people in Kigali, Goma
       and Bukavu, DRC, including a health specialist, a water/sanitation
       engineer, a food security specialist, and three field operations
       officers.
     * USAID/OFDA has provided $50,000 to the U.S. Embassies in Kinshasa
       and Kigali for Goma relief assistance.

                               Relief Efforts
     * Fifteen donors, not including the U.S. Government, have pledged
       over $23 million of assistance for the Goma volcano disaster.
       Both the Government of DRC and the Government of Rwanda have been
       providing material assistance and coordination support for the
       relief effort.

                                 Background
     * Â· Mt. Nyiragongo erupted at approximately 9:30 AM local time (2:30
       AM EST) on January 17. The volcano produced three paths of lava,
       one of which headed toward the city of Goma, 18 kilometers to the
       south. A fourth fissure opened at 4:00 PM on January 17. The area
       had been experiencing tremors intermittently since March 2001. The
       most recent eruption of Mt. Nyiragongo was in 1977, when the lava
       flow covered 20 square kilometers, killed 2,000 people, and
       destroyed 400 houses and a 10-kilometre section of road.
     * On January 18, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Margaret K. McMillion and
       U.S. Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Aubrey
       Hooks declared disasters for the eruption of Mt. Nyiragongo near
       Goma in the DRC.
