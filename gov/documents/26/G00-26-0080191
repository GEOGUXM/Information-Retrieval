   In the past two years, the goals of the Human Genome Center have
   undergone a dramatic evolution. This change is the result of several
   factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the Human Genome Initiative.
   They include: 1) the successful completion of the first phase goal of
   the Center, namely a high-resolution, sequence-ready map of human
   chromosome 19; 2) advances in DNA sequencing that allowed us to
   accelerate scaling this operation; 3) the development of a strategic
   plan for the Biology and Biotechnology Research Program which
   integrates our resources and strengths in genomics with programs in DNA
   repair, individual susceptibility, structural biology, and microbial
   biotechnology; and 4) the formation of a Joint Genome Institute for the
   Department of Energy with its three Genome Centers at Livermore,
   Berkeley, and Los Alamos as anchors.

   In the last year, the primary emphasis of our Livermore Center
   activities has been on high-throughput sequencing, shotgun sequencing
   technology development, and functional genomics. To provide resources
   for future functional studies, we have focused our sequencing efforts
   on two areas: genomic regions containing DNA repair genes and human
   chromosome 19. Utilizing our high-resolution, bacterial clone-based map
   of human chromosome 19, we have generated over 3.4 Mb of genomic
   sequence targeted to selected regions of biological interest. This
   chromosome is GC-rich (and thus, potentially gene-rich) and contains a
   large number of clustered gene families, several of which are targets
   for genomic sequencing. Sequence analysis of a variety of regions from
   chromosome 19 indicate that it is indeed gene-rich, even in regions
   expected to be gene-poor due to a paucity of genetic markers. This
   makes it an attractive target for gene-finding studies employing the
   complementary genomic and full-length cDNA sequencing approaches.

   In addition to genomic sequence, over 50 complementary DNA clones
   (cDNAs) from genes on human chromosome 19 were fully sequenced and
   submitted to public sequence databases. We have expanded the basis of
   the LLNL-based I.M.A.G.E. Consortium, an effort to characterize the
   transcribed human genome, through interactions with numerous
   collaborators (in particular, Washington University - Merck) such that
   the clone collection is now the largest public collection of sequenced
   cDNA clones, with over 500,000 arrayed clones, over 500,000 sequences
   in public databases, and over 15,000 mapped cDNAs.

   Our entire database structure has been redesigned to handle genomic
   information from any species and to make a more user-friendly WEB page
   interface. A sequence tracking system has been established and a more
   generic process control system is being developed. We have focused our
   instrumentation efforts on two technologies. The first is a
   high-density, fluorescence-based hybridization system that will allow
   us to screen any genome rapidly and efficiently, thereby eliminating
   the use of radioactivity. We are also developing the next generation
   DNA sequencing instrument based upon a unique Livermore design of 96-
   and 384-lane rigid microchannels. The 96-channel system will undergo
   beta-test this year.
