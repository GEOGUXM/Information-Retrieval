                          Civil Aviation Officials


  The Federal Aviation Administration works with other civil aviation
authorities to promote civil aviation safety, security and efficiency.

 Some of our programs that may be of interest to other civil aviation
                           authorities are:

                     Safer Skies: A Focused Agenda
  In the three years since FAA announced Safer Skies, we have learned
  that using hard data, establishing priorities, and working together
   with industry is the best way to lower the accident rate for both
 commercial and general aviation. Better yet, we're producing results.

     GAIN (Global Aviation Information Network) is an industry led
 initiative that promotes and facilitates the voluntary collection and
 sharing of safety information by and among users in the international
                 aviation community to improve safety.

 Federal Aviation Regulations and other safety oversight documents and
     programs can be found a the web site of FAA's Regulation and
                        Certification Group-AVR

Federal Aviation Administration airport safety and design standards and
        other information from the Office of Airports web site.

     FAA's Civil Aviation Security website describes our programs.
