   Mouse Pads Have Run Out!

      We have run out of mouse pads! We hope to get some new prize to give
      out Real Soon Now

   Get a Free Fermilab Mouse pad

      This mouse pad is blue with the words "Fermilab Computing,
      http://www.fnal.gov" written on the bottom. A worthy addition to any
      mechanical mouse! And it will remind you of Fermilab with every click!

      Here are the stipulations:
        * You have to be nominally qualified to be an intern in this program.
          See our Home page for details, but the basic idea is that you are
          currently enrolled at a four-year college in the US and you are a
          physics, computer science or engineering major. (If you are a
          professor who would advise a student to come to this program, then
          we'll send you one, too.)
        * One mouse pad per person.
        * Requests from outside the US will not be honored.
        * This offer is only valid via this web page--no phone calls
          accepted.
        * We only have a few, so it is first come, first served.
        * We may withdraw this offer at any time.

      We send these out approximately once per month, so allow up to four
      weeks for delivery.

      This form is disabled until we get more prizes to hand out!
