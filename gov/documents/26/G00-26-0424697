   Healthy Eating for a Lifetime
       Nutrition Information

      What we choose to eat can have a direct affect on our ability to enjoy
      life to its fullest. This is true for everyone, despite his or her age
      and current health. Our food choices play a major role in:
        * promoting and maintaining good health;
        * promoting growth in infants, children and adolescents;
        * preventing some chronic diseases (like heart disease and diabetes)
          and treating others; and,
        * speeding recovery from injuries and surgery.

                           The Food Guide Pyramid

                           The Food Guide Pyramid

   The Food Guide Pyramid is a visual tool making it easy to see how many
   servings we need to eat from each food group each day. Within its six
   food groups, the Pyramid contains many kinds of health promoting foods.
   All foods can fit into a healthy eating style.

   The Pyramid base, the largest area, is filled with grains. Building our
   diets around grains, especially whole grains, is what the food guide
   pyramid promotes. Eating the suggested portions from this food group
   will assure that more than half of our calories comes from complex
   carbohydrates. Moving up the Pyramid, notice the groups get smaller.
   Foods represented in these groups are needed in smaller amounts for
   good health. The tip of the Pyramid is the smallest group and should be
   eaten from the least: oils, fats and sweets.

   The Food Guide Pyramid is available in different languages representing
   various cultures and eating styles. There are variations for young
   children (Adobe .PDF format) and for seniors. There are also pyramids
   to help you with special eating plans -- such as diabetic or
   vegetarian.

   5 A Day for Better Health

   Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day '5 A Day' means to
   eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Eating more
   from these food groups is one the most important ways to guard your
   health. Fruits and vegetables are low in calories and fat, contain
   valuable fiber and nutrients that may prevent the onset of disease.
   Recommended number of servings are three from vegetable and two from
   fruit. See serving sizes above and enjoy your 5 A Day!

   Remember, Eat More Fruits and Vegetables:

   1. They're easy to fix and serve
   2. There are so many choices
   3. They're the original fast food
   4. They taste great
   5. They're good for your health

   Variety, Balance and Moderation with the Pyramid

   A healthy diet includes all foods. Variety is important because no one
   food can provide all the nutrients the body needs for optimal health.
   Try new foods to tantalize your taste buds and vary your nutrient
   intake.

   We can make many possible choices within each food group. Choices may
   be made to accentuate specific needs like fiber. For example, in the
   protein-rich 'meat' group, beans are a low fat, high fiber option
   compared to ground beef. In the fruit group, whole fruit is usually a
   higher fiber choice than fruit juice.

   Foods containing important nutrients can help us prevent disease and
   even restore our health. Striking a balance between foods that promote
   health and those that may be risky is important for long term well
   being. Choose foods that are better for your health more often.

   Without a doubt, fats and cholesterol are the single most important
   group of nutrients to limit in your diet if you want to reduce your
   risk of chronic disease. Heart disease and cancer, two of this nation's
   leading killers, are linked to diets high in fat. Other chronic health
   problems may be exacerbated by high fat diets. Saturated fat, that is,
   fat that is solid at room temperature, appears to carry the greatest
   amount of risk.

   Alcohol is not pictured on the food pyramid, but if it were it would be
   in the tip of the pyramid. Alcohol has only empty calories in the way
   that sugar and most fats do. Pregnant women should avoid alcohol
   beverages.

   Foods and beverages that are less nutritious do not have to be
   eliminated but they should be consumed in moderation - saved for
   special occasions. Making healthy food choices can be the difference
   between health and disease.

   What else do I need to know about food and health?

   You can remember these ABCs for your health, and your family's health.
   These three basic messages pull together the ten guidelines
   (http://www.usda.gov/cnpp/) that point the way to good health.

   Aim, Build, Choose- For Good Health

   A. Aim for Fitness
     * Aim for a healthy weight.
     * Be physically active each day.

   B. Build a Healthy Base
     * Let the pyramid guide your food choices.
     * Eat a variety of grains daily, especially whole grains.
     * Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily.
     * Keep food safe (http://www.metrokc.gov/health/foodsfty/) to eat.

   C. Choose Sensibly
     * Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and
       moderate in total fat.
     * Choose beverages and foods that limit your intake of sugars.
     * Choose and prepare foods with less salt.
     * It is not recommended that you drink alcohol. If you choose to
       drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. Pregnant women
       should avoid alcoholic beverages.

                                                            Return to menu

   Are some foods better choices for some people than others?

   Breast milk is the best "first food" for every infant. The first solid
   foods are usually chosen by each culture as foods that are easy to chew
   and a good source of nutrients. As more foods are introduced, the
   pyramid food serving recommendations become the best way of eating for
   toddlers, children and adolescents.

   Through the growing years, the difference is more in portion sizes and
   number of portions than what foods are chosen. Adolescent boys will
   need the largest amounts of food, usually measured by the energy the
   foods provide, or calories, especially during their periods of peak
   growth. Children who have a high level of physical activity also
   require more calories.

   Empty calories provided by sugars or fats may fit into food choices
   during these years better than at any other times in life. But eating
   these foods often becomes a habit past the years of high activity and
   rapid growth, and can lead to overweight and obesity.

   Once individuals reach adulthood, the pyramid still forms the basis of
   good choices through the senior years. However, there may be better
   choices within each food group to help individuals meet the nutritional
   needs of their body and lifestyle, while reducing the risks of chronic
   disease associated with their genetic predisposition.

   How can I make healthy food choices in spite of limited money?

   When funds are short and you have a difficult time stretching your food
   dollars, don't give up on healthy eating. Planning ahead and taking a
   few short cuts will save both your time and your food dollars. It's
   worth the effort for better health to learn to stretch your food
   dollars.

   Stretching your food dollars is easy with a little time for careful
   planning and creativity.
     * Prepare a shopping list before going grocery shopping. A list will
       help you avoid impulse purchases and will also help prevent extra
       trips to the store. A good idea is to keep a note pad near the
       cupboard or refrigerator to write down out-of-stock items to buy on
       your next trip to the grocery store.
     * Check the store ads and be on the lookout for store specials. Buy
       foods, such as fruits, vegetables and fish when they are on sale.
       Foods are often are on sale when they are in-season and at their
       freshest, an extra benefit.
     * Replace staples like flour, rice and pasta when they are on
       special.
     * Shop after eating so you're not hungry and less likely to give into
       temptation.
     * Read labels and compare prices to get the best buy.
     * Use coupons, but only for products you normally buy. Coupons can
       gobble up both time and money, if used unwisely.
     * Incorporate less meat and more beans into your meals. Canned beans,
       such as kidney or garbanzo, may be easier to use than dried beans.

                                                            Return to menu

   Stock your pantry and refrigerator with quick to fix foods to save both
   money and time.

   Start with staples - Staples are foods you eat all the time, maybe even
   every day. Keep your pantry, refrigerator and freezer well stocked with
   your favorite basic foods. If you do, you will be able to make healthy
   meals fast.

   Staples for your family might be:
   Milk, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, bread, tortillas, pita bread,
   flour, peanut butter, beans (dry and canned), lentils and peas, canned
   tomatoes, canned tuna fish, frozen veggie burgers, nuts, rice, pasta
   and noodles, potatoes, garlic, onions, raisins, fruits and vegetables
   (frozen, canned and fresh), cooking oil.

   Don't forget the flavor

   Spices, herbs and condiments, such as soy sauce and salsa, can also
   make simple foods taste special.

   What are some tips for easy-to-fix and healthy meals?

   Plan and cook ahead of time

   Prepare ingredients ahead of time. Vegetables and greens can be washed
   and trimmed the night before. Get in the habit of preparing enough of
   some items so that you can eat twice from that recipe. For example,
   make a double or triple batch of spaghetti sauce and freeze the extra
   for future use. Spaghetti sauce can be moved from the freezer to the
   refrigerator to defrost the night before and easily reheated after a
   busy day. Make a big pot of beans or a large batch of rice to form the
   base of a variety of quick recipes. Cooked beans keep several days in
   the refrigerator or for months in the freezer.

   Quick Breakfast Ideas Take time to eat breakfast to provide energy

   Be sure to take time to eat breakfast to provide energy to "start your
   head" for the day ahead. Winning breakfasts that are quick, easy and
   healthy include:
     * bagels with your favorite lowfat cream cheese
     * ready-to-eat cereal topped with sliced banana and yogurt
     * quick hot cereals
     * bran muffins served with fresh fruit
     * peanut butter on toast with milk
     * dinner leftovers wrapped in a tortilla
     * yogurt sprinkled with whole grain cereal
     * breakfast shakes can be made with milk or yogurt, fruit and a
       teaspoon of bran

   Pasta/Noodles

   Pasta can be used to create delicious and healthy meals in a short
   time. Mix any cooked pasta with your favorite cooked vegetables, add
   herbs and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and you've got a
   family-pleasing meal.

   Beans

   Beans are quick to fix and are fiber-rich Beans are fiber-rich,
   inexpensive and the canned varieties are quick to prepare. With
   pre-planning and soaking beans overnight and cooking in a crock-pot all
   day, a healthy meal will be ready for dinner after a busy day for a
   hungry family.

   Stir Fry

   Stir-frying is a method of cooking foods over high heat with very
   little oil, and it's fast and easy. In a skillet or wok cook bite-size
   pieces of meat, chicken or fish and stir-fry in a small amount of oil
   over medium-high to high heat until cooked through. Add chopped
   vegetables and cook until just done.

   Salads and Sandwiches pita sandwich

   Salads and sandwiches can provide a meal with little effort. Add cooked
   rice, canned beans or marinated vegetables to lettuce salads for a more
   filling dish. Add leftovers to a tortilla to make a tasty "wrap".

   Snacks and Desserts

   eat fruit as your sweet snack Just like a car needs gas to run its
   engine, your body needs food for fuel to keep you healthy and
   energized. When you feel hungry between meals, your body is sending you
   a signal to refuel. Think of snacks as healthy mini-meals. Healthy
   snack ideas include fresh fruit such as grapes or a sliced apple, low
   fat yogurt, whole grain crackers, graham crackers, pretzels or
   air-popped popcorn. Small amounts of prepared foods, like leftovers,
   work well for a quick pick-me-up. For a delicious dessert, top frozen
   yogurt with fresh berries or canned peaches. Make your own juice cubes
   by freezing 100% fruit juice in ice cube trays; lay a plastic fork or
   spoon in each one to use as a handle.

   How can I make healthy choices if I don't cook?

   The options in our modern grocery stores allow many healthy choices for
   those who don't like to cook or who lack cooking skills or equipment.
   Generally, ready to eat foods purchased at the grocery store cost more
   than if the same ingredients are purchased for the homemade food. These
   ready to eat foods do cost less than if purchased in a café or
   restaurant. Convenience usually comes with a price -- whether it money,
   time or quality of the food. For the best health bargain, learn to read
   and understand food labels.

   From the produce section:

   Choose foods that can easily be eaten raw. Bananas, apples, grapes and
   baby carrots are four of the easiest to prepare or carry along in a
   lunch bag or briefcase.
     * Green and red leafy lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers and
       tomatoes are other good vegetable choices; a low fat salad dressing
       could be a dip with these.
     * Baking a small white potato, a sweet potato, a yam or a piece of
       winter squash in a microwave for 5-10 minutes provides a hot dish
       with very little effort.
     * Frozen vegetables such as peas or green beans are also a good
       investment.
     * Almost all fruits in season are good choices since they require no
       cooking and little preparation.
     * Fruit juices, such as orange juice, or the blended juices like
       banana-orange-pineapple, are tasty and convenient. Be sure they are
       labeled 100% juice for the best nutrition.

   From the dairy section:

   Try to have a cow's milk or a fortified soy milk beverage with at least
   one meal every day.
     * Choose low fat milk, low fat yogurt or cottage cheese
     * Low fat cheeses, like individually wrapped string cheese.
     * Low fat soymilk fortified with calcium, or other soy milk products,
       can also meet the need for calcium and protein.

   From the meat section (and protein rich foods)
     * Choose protein rich foods that are low in fat, or from which the
       fat can be removed.
     * Make a salad into a meal by adding low fat lunchmeat, hard-boiled
       egg, cooked shrimp, canned tuna, cooked chicken, garbanzo or kidney
       beans.
     * A roasted chicken from the deli is a good choice if the skin is
       removed before eating.
     * Fresh fish can be baked quickly: choose thin fillets like sole and
       bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes for each half-inch of thickness.
     * Peanut or other nut butter is a convenient protein source if you
       can afford the extra calories from the peanut or nut oils.

                                                          [backtomenu.gif]

   To get your grains:
     * Cereal, hot or cold, is a good breakfast when paired with fruit and
       cow's milk or a fortified soymilk.
     * Bread can become a sandwich, or be eaten alongside of a salad or
       soup.
     * Tortillas, fat free refried beans, some chicken and chopped tomato
       and lettuce are an easy meal, which becomes a treat with some
       salsa.
     * Pocket (pita) bread can become a handheld meal when filled with an
       assortment of foods from salads to meat and cheese.
     * Ramen noodles can be the basis for quick soup: add frozen
       vegetables and some meat or seafood to the liquid, or stir in a
       beaten egg during the last few minutes of cooking.

   Deli sections:

   Deli counters are a tempting place to shop. Make healthy choices by
   avoiding salads held together with mayonnaise or sour cream.
     * Look for salads with a variety of vegetables.
     * Lean meats like turkey breast are a good choice.
     * At salad bars, choose dark green leafy lettuces and spinach.
     * One portion of a main dish like lasagne can be made into a meal
       with a side of raw vegetables like carrots and celery.
     * Low fat frozen entrees can be used in the same way.

   How can I make healthy choices if I don't eat meat?

   Vegetarian or 'plant-based' diets can be a very healthy eating style.
   By not eating meat, you automatically consume less cholesterol and
   saturated fat. All the other rules still apply, however, of practicing
   variety, balance and moderation.

   By looking at the Food Guide Pyramid, it is easy to see there are many
   non-animal sources of the protein. To start, get in the habit of having
   some kind of cooked beans (legumes) every day. Some examples of these
   are: green or red lentils, peanuts, split peas, pinto, soy (beans,
   tofu, tempeh) , garbanzo, black, white, kidney, navy beans, and so many
   more. You are probably already familiar with some of them as chili with
   kidney beans, refried pintos used in Mexican-style dishes, red beans
   and rice, lentil soup or chili, garbanzo beans made into hummus. Beans
   are available in many forms and with different spicing to give them a
   great flavor. Nuts are high in protein but also deliver a lot of fat
   compared to beans. Enjoy them in moderation. If you are choosing a
   meat-free diet, it is important to choose at least one serving from
   these options every day. One cup of cooked beans give you the protein
   in 2 ounces of meat.
