     A daily, high-resolution, real-time, global, sea surface temperature
     (RTG_SST) analysis has been developed at the National Centers for
     Environmental Prediction/Ocean Modeling Branch (NCEP / OMB). The
     analysis was implemented in the NCEP production suite 30 January
     2001, and provides the daily ocean surface temperatures for the
     Meso-Eta model.
     The daily sea surface temperature product is produced on a
     half-degree (latitude, longitude) grid, with an optimum
     interpolation analysis of the most recent 24-hours buoy and ship
     data, satellite-retrieved SST data, and SST's derived from
     satellite-observed sea-ice coverage. The algorithm employs the
     following data-handling and analysis techniques:

     Satellite retrieved SST values are averaged within 0.5 deg. grid
     boxes with day and night 'superobs' created separately for each
     satellite;
     Bias calculation and removal, for satellite retrieved SST, is the
     technique employed in the 7-day Reynolds-Smith climatological
     analysis;
     SST reports from individual ships and buoys are separately averaged
     within grid boxes;
     The first-guess is the prior (un-smoothed) analysis with one-day's
     climate adjustment added;
     Surface temperature is calculated for water where the ice cover
     exceeds 50%, using salinity climatology in Millero's formula for the
     freezing point of salt water:

     t(S) = -0.0575 S + 0.0017 S^3/2 - 0.0002 S^2,

     with S in psu.
     An inhomogeneous correlation-scale-parameter l, for the correlation
     function: exp(-d^2/l^2) , is calculated from a climatological
     temperature gradient, as

     l = min ( 450 , max( 2.25 / |grad T| , 100 )),

     with d and l in kilometers. "grad T" is in deg. C / km

     Evaluations of the analysis products have shown it to produce
     realistically tight gradients in the Gulf Stream regions of the
     Atlantic and the Kuroshio region of the Pacific, and to be in close
     agreement with SST reports from moored buoys in both oceans. Also,
     it has been shown to properly depict the wintertime colder shelf
     water -- a feature critical in getting an accurate model prediction
     for coastal winter storms.
     The evaluation of the RTG_SST analysis is available by clicking the
     link to the RTG_SST Verification page.
     Grib files for the global SST product are available at the following
     FTP sites:
     ftp://ftp.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data1/rtg_sst (most recent 2 days)
     ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/sst (most recent 7 days)
     ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/history/sst (fields back to Feb. 11,
     2001)
     For information on reading and unpacking GRIB files, go to
     http://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/faqs/Tools.html
     The RTG_SST analysis is done over all ocean areas and the Great
     Lakes. There is no analysis over land. The land values are filled by
     a Cressman interpolation to produce a complete grid for possible
     interpolation to other grids. The ocean and land areas are defined
     by a land sea mask. This data set is an ASCII file, ls.dat, which
     may be found at the FTP site:
     ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/history/sst/lsmask
     The spatial grid is defined identically to the grid for the SST
     arrays, with indices starting at the Greenwich Meridian and near the
     South Pole. The values in ls.dat are set to 0 over the ocean and 3
     over land. It can be read by the following Fortran code:

     DIMENSION LS(720,360)
     OPEN (11,FILE='ls.dat')

     C
     C Read in land sea tags (0 for ocean; 3 for land)
     C

     READ (11,'(80I1)') LS
     STOP
     END
