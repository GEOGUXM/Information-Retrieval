                         Do you need help with your

   There are several options for consumers who are having difficulty with
       their case and need assistance. Many issues can be resolved at the
       local level using CAP, the Administrative Review or Mediation
       process.
       When questions or problems first arise while you are involved with
       DOR, please talk first with your counselor. If you are still
       unsatisfied, the next step is to contact your counselor's
       supervisor. You may bring a family member or representative with
       you at any time to meet with Department staff.
       The following are links to information and forms for the different
       case review processes.
       CAP (Client Assistance Program)
