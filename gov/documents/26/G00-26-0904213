       The California Department of Transportation wants you to return home
        safely to your family. The following tips are to help you stay safe

        * Do not speed in work zones; obey the posted speed limits.
        * Stay Alert! Expect the unexpected.
        * Watch for workers; drive with caution.
        * Don't change lanes unnecessarily.
        * Avoid using mobile phones while driving in work zones.
        * Turn on headlights so that workers and other drivers can see you.
     * Be especially alert at night while driving in work zones.
     * Expect delays, especially during peak travel times.
     * Allow ample space between you and the car in front of you.
     * Anticipate lane shifts, and merge when directed to do so.
