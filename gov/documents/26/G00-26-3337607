   Hurricane Linda, 1997 September 12

   Hurricane Linda approaching Baja California on 1997 September 12 at
   18:00 UT (10:00 PST). Data are from the NOAA GOES-9 satellite. The
   colored texture image was by combining visible and infrared channels.
   The cloud height field is determined from the 11 micron IR channel;
   vertical scale is exaggerated by about a factor of 6 in this rendering.

   Image and height field map provided by Marit Jentoft-Nilsen.

          The cloud height field is converted to an ElevationGrid node to
          which the image texture is applied. (model: 6kB gzipped, 67kB
