     Of particular interest to IT Users

     Information Technology (IT) users, both individuals and organizations
     may be particularly interested in the following NIST security programs
     and services. These are grouped by: 1) training and education, 2)
     security standards and guidelines, and 3) security validated products.

   Traning and Education
     * Computer Security Resource Center - This useful site contains
       information about a variety of computer security issues, products,
       and research of concern to Federal agencies, industry, and users.
       It also provides links to a wide variety of security resources,
       organizations and other material regarding computer security. This
       site is operated and maintained by NIST's Computer Security
       Division as a service to the computer security and IT community.
       Contact: John Wack
     * Software Vulnerability & Patch Information - NIST provides an
       on-line searchable index of information on computer vulnerabilities
       known as ICAT. It provides search capability at a fine granularity
       and links users to vulnerability and patch information. This tool
       can help agencies ensure that their software is patched and
       protected against widely known vulnerabilities. Contact: Peter Mell
     * International Common Criteria Conference - NIST and its
       international partners annually holds the International Common
       Criteria Conference, which draws attendance from user
       organizations, IT vendors and testing labs. The purpose of the
       conference is to further use and understanding of the Common
       Criteria. The conference helps ensure that not only do we have
       truly global standards for certifying commercial software products,
       but that these bring real benefits for both commercial suppliers
       and end users in both government and the public sector. Contact:
       Peggy Himes
     * Common Criteria Training Courses - NIST's NIAP offers training
       courses in the Common Criteria (ISO 15408) to educate producers and
       consumers of information technology (IT) products and systems about
       the Common Criteria, Common Evaluation Methodology, and the Common
       Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme. Contact: Peggy Himes

   Security Standards and Guidelines
     * Standards - Under its statutory responsibilities, NIST develops
       standards and guidelines to protect sensitive federal systems.
       While these standards formally apply only within the Federal
       government, many organizations in the private sector voluntarily
       choose to adopt them as well, particularly those in the area of
       cryptography. These standards are formally known as Federal
       Information Processing Standards. Examples include the Advanced
       Encryption Standard and the Digital Signature Standard. Contact:
       Elaine Barker
     * Guidelines - NIST also develops guidelines in an array of technical
       (e.g., public key infrastructure, PBX security) and security
       management topics (e.g., security planning, use of tested
       products). Contact: Tim Grance
     * ITL Bulletins - ITL Bulletins are published by NIST's Information
       Technology Laboratory, of which the Computer Security Division is a
       component. Many of these bulletins address security topics,
       typically about six per year. Each presents an in-depth discussion
       of a single topic of significant interest to the information
       systems community. The computer security ITL Bulletins are found
       here. Contact: Tim Grance

   Security Validated Products
     * Validated products - NIST operates two security testing programs
       for IT products: the National Information Assurance Partnership
       (NIAP) and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program. A list of
       validated products is available at the NIAP and CMVP pages. Testing
       the security of products helps give users higher assurance (but is
       no guarantee, of course) that they work as intended.
          + NIAP, jointly led by NIST and NSA, provides for the voluntary
            security evaluation of IT products. The evaluation is
            conducted against a set of security specifications provided to
            the laboratory by the sponsor of the evaluation. Once the
            evaluation is successfully completed, a certificate is issued
            and the product is placed on the NIAP Validated Products list.
            Contact: Ron Ross
          + The Cryptographic Module Validation Program, jointly led by
            NIST and the Government of Canada's Communications Security
            Establishment, provides for the voluntary testing of
            cryptographic modules (both hardware and software). Testing is
            conducted against the security specifications detailed in
            Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Testing is
            also conducted to help assure the correct implementation of
            specific cryptographic algorithms approved to protect
            sensitive information in the Federal government. Note that
            cryptographic modules are typically not sold directly to
            consumers but are integrated into commercially available
            products. Contact: Ray Snouffer
