                          EEO Laws and Regulations
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program is based on both
   EEO laws and affirmative action requirements. A synopsis of these laws
   follows.

                                  Title VII

   Title VII, a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, made it illegal
   for an employer to deny anyone a job because of race, color, religion,
   sex, or national origin. Title VII also prohibited discrimination in
   firing, promoting, training, setting of wages or salary, and all other
   privileges of employment. Title VII did not apply, however, to Federal
   employees at that time.

                            Equal Pay Act of 1963

   The Equal Pay Act of 1963 protects men and women who perform
   substantially equal work in the same establishment from sex-based wage
   discrimination.

                            Executive Order 11246

   Executive Order 11246, signed by President Johnson on September 24,
   1965, barred discrimination in Federal employment based on race, color,
   religion, or national origin. This order also provided for
   nondiscrimination in employment by Government contractors and
   subcontractors. The Order called for programs on equal opportunity at
   the agency level under the supervision of the U.S. Civil Service
   Commission (now known as the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or
   OPM). It required that the Civil Service Commission issue regulations
   establishing discrimination complaint procedures for applicants and
   employees.


                Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967

   The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects individual
   who are 40 years of age or older.

                            Executive Order 11478

   Executive Order 11478, issued in 1969 by President Nixon, required each
   department and agency of the Federal Government to establish and
   maintain an affirmative program of equal employment opportunity for all
   civilian employees and applicants. This Executive Order gave OPM the
   authority to guide and oversee EEO programs within Federal departments
   and agencies.


                               EEO Act of 1972

   Section 717 of the EEO Act of 1972 extended the provision of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1964 to include Federal Employment. Discrimination based
   on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin are now prohibited
   by law rather than by Executive Order.

   Federal agencies are required to submit annual national and regional
   EEO Affirmative Employment Plans to OPM (now to the Equal Employment
   Opportunity Commission) for review and approval.


                Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

   Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination
   against qualified individuals with disabilities and who work in the
   federal government.

           Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

   Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits
   employment discrimination against qualified individuals with
   disabilities in the private sector, and in state and local governments.

                        The Civil Rights Act of 1991

   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of
   intentional employment discrimination.
