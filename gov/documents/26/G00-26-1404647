       _______________________________________________________________

     What are the public health implications of Pancreatic Cancer?
     * An estimated 29,200 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic
       cancer in 2001
     * Most people with pancreatic cancer die within six months
     * Pancreatic Cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the
       U.S.

     What advances would most enhance the field of Pancreatic Cancer?
     * Improve the health of the field
     * Strengthen our understanding of the biology
     * Determine risk factors, develop preventive strategies, and improve
       detection
     * Improve the impact of therapy
     * Advance health services research
     * Create a scientific toolkit

     How has NCI addressed the challenges to Pancreatic Cancer research?
     * NCI established the Pancreatic Cancer Progress Review Group (PRG),
       a panel of pancreatic cancer experts from various disciplines,
       advocates and industry representatives who identified areas of
       research that will expedite progress against the disease.
     * The PRG described and explained its recommendations in a report,
       "Pancreatic Cancer: An Agenda for Action," which is available
       online.
     * During an Implementation Meeting, NCI engaged the PRG members in a
       dialog to identify the most compelling gaps in Pancreatic Cancer
       research.

     Based on these actions, NCI announces the following 10 steps to
     increase support for research on this disease. (As always, NCI's
     ability to implement these steps will depend on its budget for
     FY2002.)
    1. Pay Line: Beginning in FY 2002, the pay line for pancreatic
       cancer-relevant research will be 50 percent higher than the overall
       pay line for NCI research grants. Only those applications that are
       100 percent relevant to pancreatic cancer will be eligible for the
       higher pay line. To mark an application for consideration, an
       investigator should cite the PRG Report and include the following
       language in the Background section of the grant application: The
       research described in this application is 100 percent relevant to
       pancreatic cancer.
    2. Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs):
         a. NCI will fund at least three meritorious, peer reviewed
            pancreatic cancer-specific SPOREs next year.
         b. As in the early development of the prostate cancer SPOREs, NCI
            may loosen human endpoint requirements in pancreatic cancer
            SPORE research projects until the field of translational
            research in pancreatic cancer matures.
         c. New pancreatic SPOREs will be encouraged to develop expanded
            human tissue collections beyond their institutional
            boundaries. NCI may allow SPOREs to exceed the current budget
            cap to develop expanded tissue collections, banking
            activities, and data from high-risk individuals.
         d. Pancreatic SPOREs should use developmental funds to explore
            new scientific opportunities and to encourage new and
            established investigators to develop their skills in
            pancreatic cancer research.
         e. NCI may require all new gastrointestinal SPOREs to include at
            least one pancreatic cancer project.
    3. Mouse Models: The NCI will provide supplements to investigators
       within the Mouse Models Consortium for the development of
       pancreatic cancer models.
    4. Other Models: The NCI will evaluate the need for supplements to
       develop alternative models of pancreatic cancer that are
       complementary to mouse models.
    5. Tissue Samples: In conjunction with the advisory committee for the
       Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN), the NCI will explore the
       feasibility of providing greater access to pancreatic tissue
       samples.
    6. Patient Samples and Data: The NCI will explore the feasibility of
       providing "ultra rapid access" to samples and questionnaires from
       pancreatic cancer patients, and it will address the need for
       uniform data collection instruments and tissue sampling protocols.
    7. Markers for Early Detection: The Early Detection Research Network
       (EDRN) and the Center for Proteomics will develop initiatives to
       identify markers for early detection of pancreatic cancer.
    8. Drug Development: The NCI will expand the Rapid Access to
       Intervention Development (RAID) Program in response to high demand.
    9. Patient and Provider Education: The NCI will work with advocacy
       groups to promote education materials and information on the World
       Wide Web.
   10. Palliative Care and End of Life: The NCI will use the Centers of
       Excellence in Cancer Communications to expand research on
       palliative care and end of life. NCI is also exploring a variety of
       ways to enhance its support for palliative care research; further
       details will be announced when planning is completed.
