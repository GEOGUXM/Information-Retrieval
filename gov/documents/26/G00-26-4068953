     The Science Directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center does more
   than scientific research. As the Lead Center for NASA's Microgravity
   Research Program and Space Optics Manufacturing Technology, it is
   Marshall's mission to foster the generation and communication of
   knowledge by conducting basic and applied research, developing enabling
   technologies, administering assigned programs and projects, and
   engaging in appropriate partnerships with other government agencies,
   academia, and industry. The Science Directorate also manages the Space
   Product Development Program and the Gravity Probe-B Program. The
   collection of images in this gallery reflects the multi-faceted
   programs managed by the Science Directorate.
