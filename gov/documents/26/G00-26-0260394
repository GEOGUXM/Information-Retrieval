   (RPD) develops standards/guidance/criteria to protect the public and
   the environment from radiation exposure. The 1992 Energy Policy Act
   requires EPA to set radiation protection standards for Yucca Mountain.
   These standards must be "based on and consistent with" the National
   Academy of Sciences (see link below) Report, Technical Bases for Yucca
   Mountain Standards.
