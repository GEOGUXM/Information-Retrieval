                                   CM/ECF

                  Case Management / Electronic Case Filing

   The court is planning on implementing a new electronic case filing
   system in 2002.  Implementation of this system will cause a
   revolutionary change in the way documents are filed with the court.
   Instead of filing paper documents with the Clerk's office, attorneys
   will file electronic documents, including bankruptcy petitions, over
   the Internet and make the corresponding docket entry at the same
   time.   Parties will have immediate access to the document once it is
   filed electronically.

   CM/ECF provides the following features:

   [aglabul1.gif]

   The tracking of motions, answers, deadlines, and hearings.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   UP-to-date reports, queries, and docket sheets produced.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Electronic filing before and after business hours including weekends
   and holidays.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Electronic delivery of documents to, from and within the courts.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Electronic retrieval of case documents and dockets by all users.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Electronic document management, storage, security, and archiving.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Automatic creation of docket entries from attorney filings.
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Electronic notices of filing to other CM/ECF participants.

   The goal of the CM/ECF project is to create a system that allows nearly
   all documents associated with a court case to be handled
   electronically.  CM/ECF supports the unique interests of different
   communities (the courts, the attorneys, and the public) while providing
   the same range of document processing capabilities to all.

   Attorneys will file documents electronically over a network by using a
   standard Web browser.  The documents submitted electronically must be
   in Portable Document Format (PDF.)  This format enables regular
   documents to be viewed electronically and shared with others on the
   Internet without loss of any document formatting characteristics.  PDF
   is also a secure format that doesn't allow hidden text or links, as do
   many word processors.

   The network used to access CM/ECF is the Internet in the case of the
   attorneys and the public.  Interaction with CM/ECF is via a web
   browser, HTML forms that enable document "attachments," and interactive
   software.  The web server application software collects the forms data,
   processes it, and forwards data and documents to a private server for
   storage.

   Case management information is created and notices of filing are
   transmitted to case participants when a document is filed
   electronically.  Immediately upon filing, the case docket sheet and
   associated documents become available on-line to both the case
   participants and the public.

   Attorneys will need the following hardware and software to
   electronically file, view and retrieve documents int he electronic
   filing system:

   [aglabul1.gif]

   Netscape Navigator version 4.0 or higher.  Netscape 6.0 is not
   recommended for use with CM/ECF.  (128 bit encryption is also
   recommended);
   [aglabul1.gif]

   A computer capable of running the above browser, such as one using
   Windows 9x, NT, 2000, Macintosh, Linux or Solaris operating system. ;
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Adobe Acrobat 3.0 or higher to convert documents from a word processor
   format to portable document format (PDF);
   [aglabul1.gif]

   A PDF-compatible word processor like Macintosh or Windows-based version
   of WordPerfect or Word;
   [aglabul1.gif]

   A modem supporting a transfer rate of 28.8 kbs or higher (56 kbs is
   recommended);
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Internet access through any Internet service provider using Point to
   Point Protocol (PPP);
   [aglabul1.gif]

   Access to a scanner if paper documents need to be imaged and sent to
   the court.

   The above specifications are subject to change.

   In addition to court staff, training on the CM/ECF system will be
   provided for attorneys.  Please complete the questionnaire and return
   it to the address indicated.  You will be contacted at a later date
   concerning training.  The Clerk is in the preliminary stages of
   planning the system.
