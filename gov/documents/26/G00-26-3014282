                               WELFARE-TO-WORK

     Welfare-To-Work is a mandated program under the California Work
     Opportunities and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Act which
     require parents or caretakers in families on welfare, unless exempt,
     to meet work requirements by participating in welfare-to-work
     activities. Supportive services are provided to help individuals
     participate in work or their assigned activities. Assistance through
     the CalWORKs program is time limited.

     TIME LIMITS
     When an individual begins participating in Welfare-To-Work, an 18 or
     24-month time period begins. Individuals who were receiving
     assistance prior to the counties program implementation date
     (February 1998 for Orange County) have a 24 months limit. The time
     limit is 18 months for individuals who were approved after the
     county implementation date. If it is determined that sufficient
     employment is not available, assistance may be received beyond the
     18/24 month period if the individual participates in community
     service and/or employment for the minimum required hours per week.
     This may continue until the recipient accumulates 60 months (5
     years) of assistance.

     As of January 1, 1998 adults have a 60 cumulative month lifetime
     limit to receive CalWORKs assistance. Cash aid received from the
     federal welfare program in any other state also counts. There are
     exceptions that may extend or stop the time clock. Some of these
     exceptions are:
     * The time limit does not apply to children
     * A month on cash aid is not counted when a person is:

     - Age 60 or older
     - Exempt from Welfare-To-Work for certain reasons
     - Disabled for 30 days or more

     WORK REQUIREMENTS
     For single parent families, the parent must participate for at least
     32 hours per week. For two-parent families, one parent, or both
     parents together, must participate for at least 35 hours per week.
     If federal child care benefits are received, both parents must
     participate for total of 55 hours per week.

     WELFARE-TO-WORK ACTIVITIES
     An individualâ€™s Welfare-To-Work plan may include participation in
     any of the following activities:
     * Employment, including unsubsidized employment, subsidized
       employment, and self-employment.
     * Work experience
     * Work study
     * On-the-job training
     * Community service
     * Vocational training
     * Adult basic education
     * Job search/job readiness activities
     * Certain education programs
     * Mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence services

     SUPPORTIVE SERVICES
     When participating in the CalWORKs Welfare-To-Work program,
     individuals may have their child care expense paid directly to an
     approved child care provider. Assistance is also available for
     transportation needs and items such as tools or uniforms that may be
     needed for employment.

     RETENTION SERVICES
     Orange County provides job retention services for current and former
     recipients as part of the CalWORKs program. These case management
     and support services are designed to assist individuals keep their
     job and find better jobs.
