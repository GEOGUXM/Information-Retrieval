       You can search specifically for pages on the California Coastal
    Commission web site via the general California Government Search Page
                                   below.

     * REMEMBER: to pull up our content or that which relates to us always
       include California Coastal Commission as one of the search terms.
     * FOR EXAMPLE: If you wanted to find at which Commission meeting
       there was an item relating to runoff, you would type in the words:
       California Coastal Commission meeting runoff (make sure that the
       button chosen below is ALL WORDS).
     * You will need to scroll down past the STATE PORTAL SEARCH RESULT to
       the ALL CALIFORNIA SITES SEARCH RESULT.

   Please  be aware that the California Coastal Commission does not
   maintain and is not responsible the search engine below which you are
   using; there may be a gap between the MOST current pages and indexed
   search engine content. Also, with some searches you may find the most
   relevant content at the beginning or else you may need to wade through
   content from other governmental entities.
