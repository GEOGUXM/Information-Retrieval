   Terra Launches Successfully

   [terralaunch.jpg] The successful launch of the Terra platform aboard an
   Atlas rocket December 18, 1999 puts us closer to the first MODIS data
   availability. Assuming no significant problems, MODIS 250m products are
   expected to be available from the EDC DAAC roughly 90 to 120 days after
   the launch. For mission status updates, browse to the Terra website at
   http://terra.nasa.gov or for MODIS instrument-specific information, try
