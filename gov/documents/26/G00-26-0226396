   The National Weather Service and educators are partners in our efforts
   to provide the best information on hazardous weather and flooding. The
   material students learn in school provides them the ability to
   understand what the weather can do and to help prepare themselves to
   take protective action.

   As advances occur in the sciences of meteorology and hydrology, the NWS
   continues to assist educators to improve student awareness of
   meteorology, hydrology and climatology. These pages provide information
   and links to useful material for educators interested in using
   meteorology in their programs.
