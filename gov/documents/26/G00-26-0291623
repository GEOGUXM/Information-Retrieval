  Description of the Conference

   The Dynamics of Molecular Collisions Conference focuses on all aspects
   of molecular collisions -- experimental and theoretical studies of
   elastic, inelastic, and reactive encounters involving atoms, molecules,
   ions, clusters, and surfaces -- as well as half collisions --
   photodissociation, photo-induced reaction, and photodesorption. The
   Conference began as a Gordon Conference in 1965, and though it now
   operates independently, retains the Gordon Conference format and
   spirit.


  Meeting Site

   The meeting will be held at Copper Mountain Resort and Conference
   Center located 75 miles due west of Denver, Colorado on Interstate 70.

                            Copper Mountain area

   Nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Copper Mountain Resort
   offers abundant recreational facilities, including 18 holes of
   championship golf. Conference attendees will receive complimentary
   access to the Copper Indoor Racquet and Athletic Club, which features
   cardio equipment, weight room, indoor pool and jacuzzi. There are over
   47 miles of paved bike paths, acres of mountain biking, tennis, and
   swimming. Copper Mountain offers everything you would expect to find in
   the mountains - horseback riding, hiking, white water rafting, fishing
   and a scenic narrow gauge railroad.

   More information on Copper Mountain is available at the Resort web
   site, http://www.ski-copper.com.

   abstracts. The organizers will make the selection after the June 1,
   2001 deadline for the submission of abstracts [see below] based on the
   originality and significance of the research reported. Individuals
   selected for presenting contributed talks will be notified by June 15,
   2001.


  Poster Sessions

   A poster session will follow the formal session on Monday through
   Thursday evenings. Conference participants are strongly encouraged to
   present posters. One-page, "camera ready" poster abstracts for
   inclusion in the conference program book should be submitted to the
   conference chair by June 1, 2001. The abstract must fit onto a 8.5" by
   11" (21.59x27.94 cm, not A4) page with reasonable margins. The
   conference participant who will "present" the poster should be
   underlined in the author list. The submissions may be in either hard
   copy or electronic (PC Word or WordPerfect documents or PDF files with
   embedded fonts) form. Faxes or email (except "attachments") are NOT
   acceptable. Participants will be limited to presenting only one poster,
   but may appear as co-authors on others. All figures will be reproduced
   in black and white.


  Accommodations

   Reservations for meals and lodging must be made DIRECTLY with Copper
   Mountain Resort. (Registration for the scientific program of the DMC
   Conference is a separate process [see below].) When making your
   reservations at Copper Mountain Resort, you must identify yourself as
   an attendee of the Dynamics of Molecular Collisions Conference to
   obtain the discounted rate. The cost of five nights of lodging (Sunday
   through Thursday) and five days of meals (dinner Sunday through lunch
   Friday), based on double occupancy, is $605 U.S. The meal plan portion
   of this amount is $347.50 U.S., and the double-occupancy hotel room
   (two double beds) rate is $51.50 U.S. per person per night. The single
   room rate is $103 U.S. per person per night, and two-bedroom suites
   (accommodating four people) are available at the rate of $51.75 per
   person per night.

   A block of hotel-style double rooms has been reserved for DMC
   Conference attendees. A "single room" is single occupancy of one of
   these rooms, and the two-bedroom suites are subject to availability.
   Attendees who do not stay at Copper Mountain for the entire conference
   must pay the full meal plan package ($347.50 U.S.), but will only be
   charged for lodging for the period of attendance provided the
   partial-week reservation is made in advance. Otherwise, attendees will
   be billed for one extra night's stay as a penalty for early departure.
   You can reach Copper Mountain by phone at 1-800-458-8386. The DMC
   Conference is group number 2A03QH.

   You must provide payment in full when you register at Copper Mountain.
   Since the amount is sizeable, you might wish to obtain an advance in
   the form of a check from your institution made out to "Copper Mountain
   Resort and Conference Center" before you make your reservation because
   of the time required to draw the check. You may download a form here to
   use when sending a check after registering by phone, or when
   registering my mail. The lodging charges listed reflect the tax exempt
   rate. To qualify for the tax exempt rate you must pay with an
   institutional check or institutional credit card, AND provide a copy of
   your institution's tax exempt certificate.

   If you call Copper Mountain to make your reservations, you will be
   required to provide a credit card number. If you intend to pay by
   institutional check, you should say so when you register. You will then
   have seven (7) days for your check to arrive before your card is
   billed.

   If you plan on sharing a room with a person or persons of your choice
   who will be sharing the cost of the room, you must cross-reference
   (name and daytime phone number) each other when registering. If you are
   requesting an "assigned" roommate, you will be sent email by the
   conference chair providing the name and daytime phone number of your
   assigned roommate as soon as the assignment has been made. Please do
   not attempt to register at Copper Mountain until you have the
   information about your roommate.


  Altitude Caution

   Copper Mountain Resort and Conference Center lies at an altitude of
   9,600 feet (2,927 meters) above sea level. Attendees are cautioned to
   become acclimated to the extreme altitude before engaging in any
   strenuous activity. Many people experience headache, shortness of
   breath or dizziness until their systems adjust to the lower oxygen
   level and atmospheric pressure at this altitude.


  Conference Registration

   Registration forms for the scientific program of the DMC Conference may
   be downloaded and/or printed from a PDF document by clicking here.
   Completed registration forms should be sent to "DMC Conference, Attn:
   James T. Muckerman, Chemistry Department, Building 555A, Brookhaven
   National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973-5000." Be sure to enclose the
   appropriate payment, or enter the credit card information in the
   appropriate spaces on the Registration Form (cardholder's name, card
   number and expiration date). Checks in U.S. dollars made payable to
   "BSA for DMC" or VISA, MasterCard or American Express cards are
   acceptable. The fee for early registration (received on or before April
   16, 2001) is $100 U.S. The registration fee after April 16 is $150 U.S.

   Note that the deadline for early registration has been extended for
   graduate students and postdocs (only) until June 15, 2001.


  Transportation

   Resort Express (1-800-334-7433) offers regular and frequent limousine
   service to Copper Mountain from the Denver International airport.
   Departures are every 1.5 hours from 9:30 AM to 9:30 PM seven days a
   week. The one-way travel time is 90 minutes. The DMC Conference has
   arranged through Meritek Travel (1-970-968-2310) for a discounted group
   round trip fare of $84 U.S. per person. The regular fare is $98 U.S. To
   obtain the discounted fare, you must reserve in advance with Meritek
   Travel and identify yourself as being with the DMC Conference. Meritek
   Travel also claims to offer discounted airfares (lower than those
   available by calling the airlines). Advance payment (by credit card) is
   required, and if you cancel your reservation you must do so at least 24
   hours in advance.


  Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholarships

   Graduate student and postdoctoral scholarship awards will be announced
   at the Conference. The number and amount of these scholarships will
   depend on available funds. To be eligible for one of these awards an
   applicant must respond "YES" to the appropriate question on the
   conference Registration Form, and submit a poster abstract by the June
   1 deadline on which he/she is the presenter.
