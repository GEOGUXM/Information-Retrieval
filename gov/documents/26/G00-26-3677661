   [fermib.jpg] Workshop on
                B Physics at the Tevatron
   Run II and Beyond
     __________________________________________________________________

        A workshop with the goal of exploring the b physics potential
               of the Fermilab Tevatron in Run II and beyond.

       The first meeting was held at Fermilab on September 23-25, 1999

   Working Groups The working groups are expected to address related
   issues in charm physics and pay special attention to the differences
   between the hadronic environment and the B factories running on the
   [Upsilon.gif] (4S).

     * CP Violation
       Conveners: Yosef Nir, Helen Quinn, Manfred Paulini (CDF), Rick
       Jesik (D0), Tomasz Skwarnicki (BTeV)
       This group covers measurements of alpha, beta, and gamma, using
       both B and B[s] decays; tests of the Standard Model in CP asymmetry
       measurements; etc.
     * Semileptonic and Rare Decays
       Conveners: Aida El-Khadra, Michael Luke, Jonathan Lewis (CDF),
       Andrzej Zieminski (D0), Ron Poling (BTeV)
       This group covers semileptonic decays (B, [Lambda.gif] [b], etc.),
       rare decays (e.g., B -> K^*µ^+µ^-, B[d,s] -> µ^+µ^-) within and
       beyond the Standard Model.
     * Mixing and Lifetimes
       Conveners: Ulrich Nierste, Mikhail Voloshin, Christoph Paus (CDF),
       Neal Cason (D0), Harry Cheung (BTeV)
       This group covers B and B[s] mixing (both [Delta.gif] [Gamma.gif]
       and [Delta.gif] m); lifetimes of b mesons and baryons (
       [Lambda.gif] [b]...).
     * Production, Fragmentation, Spectroscopy
       Conveners: Eric Braaten, Keith Ellis, Eric Laenen, William Trischuk
       (CDF), Rick Van Kooten (D0), Scott Menary (BTeV)
       This group covers issues related to b production, fragmentation (+
       tagging); as well as b hadron spectroscopy (mesons, baryons, B[c],
       bbq, etc.).

   Fermilab Visitor Information; Transportation (It may be simplest to
   rent a car, a taxi round trip to the airport is around $70 anyway. ACE
   has a special Fermilab rate which includes some insurance.); Lodging
   (Please make your own reservations asking for the Fermilab rates.)
