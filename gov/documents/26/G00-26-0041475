   Doing Business with the Nevada Operations Office
   The Nevada Operations Office was created and located in Las Vegas,
   Nevada, in 1962, to oversee and take responsibility for the operations
   and programs of the Nevada Test Site. Our current primary mission is to
   preserve the nation's capability to resume testing and maintain the
   strategic nuclear stockpile.

   The Nevada Test Site also serves the nation as a proving ground for
   alternative energy research and Department of Defense projects that
   require the isolation, complex infrastructure, and technical expertise
   we can provide.

   As a National Environmental Research park, the Nevada Test Site is home
   to important environmental activities including technology development,
   clean up and remediation of contaminated environments, and waste
   management. The Test Site is a unique outdoor laboratory where federal
   agencies and private industry conduct large-scale open-air experiments
   with hazardous and toxic chemicals and test remediation and emergency
   response techniques.
