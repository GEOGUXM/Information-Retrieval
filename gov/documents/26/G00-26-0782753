I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Goals

   [blue_green_line.gif]

   The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium was initiated in 1993 by four academic groups
   on a collaborative basis after informal discussions led to a common
   vision of how to achieve an important goal in the study of the human
   genome: the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their
   Expression. Specifically, we share high-quality, arrayed cDNA libraries
   and place sequence, map, and expression data on the clones in these
   arrays into the public domain. Using this information, unique clones
   can be rearrayed to form a "master array" which we hope will ultimately
   contain a representative cDNA from each and every gene in the genome
   under study. The human and mouse genomes were the first to be studied,
   and the collection now contains clones from rat, zebrafish, Xenopus and
   rhesus macaque. We anticipate arraying (and sharing) cDNA libraries
   from additional species over time. All of our clones are available free
   of any royalties, and may be used by anyone agreeing with our
   guidelines.

   The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium can provide custom arraying and rearraying
   services for public EST projects; please contact image@image.llnl.gov
   to discuss details.
