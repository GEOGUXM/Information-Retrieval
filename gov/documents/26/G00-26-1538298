                            Emergency Management

     Major incidents such as train accidents, fires, floods, and
     terrorist attacks have been an issue for transit agencies and
     transit management since the development of modern public
     transportation. The earliest examples include the 1862 Fleet River
     Flood and the 1881 terrorist bombing between Charing Cross and
     Westminster Station, both on the London Underground, and the
     devastating 1918 Malbone Street wreck on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
     (BRT), one of the predecessors to the New York City subway. More
     recent examples are Hurricane Andrew (1992), the World Trade Center
     bombing (1993), the Northridge Earthquake in southern California
     (1994), and the floods in the Midwest (1993-1997.)

     Experience with these events, and numerous others, confirms that
     responding to critical incidents is one of the most difficult
     functions performed in the transit environment. During transit
     emergencies, personnel from multiple transit disciplines and outside
     agencies must come together to manage the incident, performing such
     tasks as rescuing or evacuating passengers, extinguishing fires,
     controlling crowds, repairing track and wayside structures, and
     restoring service.  In addition to responding to emergencies
     affecting their own system, transit agencies are also finding that
     they are instrumental in assisting in larger emergencies, such as
     evacuations.

     The FTA has developed numerous guidelines to provide practical
     assistance to transit personnel and other individuals and
     organizations with responsibility for planning for, managing, and
     recovering from emergencies and disasters.
