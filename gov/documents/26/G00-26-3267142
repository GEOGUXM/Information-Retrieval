     __________________________________________________________________

   Previous solar Ultra-Violet (UV) spectrometers mounted on free flyer
   spacecrafts have provided a lot of informations onto the solar
   atmosphere from the chromosphere (about 5000 K) to the corona (2 000
   000 K).

   As a reminder, few examples are given below.
   The OSO series had obtained a wealth of data:
     * OSO2 (1965), OSO3 (1967), OSO4 (1967), OSO5 (1969),OSO6 (1969) had
       an on-board normal incidence UV-EUV spectrometer.
     * OSO8 (1975) had 2 UV spectrometers in the normal incidence range.
       The full 1200-2000 angstrom range was scanned by the UVS from LASP
       (University of Colorado). The Multichannel Polychromator from
       CNRS/LPSP had a simultaneous small scanning range around HI Lyman
       alpha (1215A) and beta(1025A), MgII h and k (2800A), and CaII H and
       K (3950A).

   ATM/SKYLAB (1973) with the set of on-board UV-EUV spectrometer/
   spectroheliograph has given the impulse to coordinated modern coronal
   studies.
   The UVS spectrometer on SMM (1979) has further demonstrated the
   requirement for high (angular, spectral, temporal) resolution.
   In this domain a special mention must be given to:
     * the HRTS/NRL rocket ( and Spacelab 2) UV spectrometer that has
       leaded our thinkings on the high resolution dynamics of the upper
       chromosphere-transition region solar atmosphere,
     * the TRC/LPSP imager that has pushed us towards high angular
       resolution.

   The SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiations) design
   has emerged in 1986 after several spectrometer studies during the SOHO
   (SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory) Assessment and Phase A studies at
   ESA (European Space Agency) in the 1982-85 years. The spectrometer is
   trying to combine several advantage of previous instruments:
     * Telescope with one surface (cf. HCO/ATM spectrometer) to keep high
       efficiency, low scattering and minimum degradation (due to UV
       sunburn polymerisation from residual contaminants). Off-axis
       parabola provides high image quality.
     * Stigmatic spectrometer in the single Wadsworth mount (cf. HRTS
       double Wadsworth mount) to give high spectral resolution in a wide
       spectral band in keeping the angular resolution along the slit over
       several hundreth pixels. The optimisation of wavelength scan and
       focussing platform offers an access to a wide spectral range (500
       to 1600 angstrom).
     * All optical blanks (mirrors and grating) are in SiC and the coating
       is in CVD-SiC to provide the best efficiency in the available
       spectral range.

   In spring 1988, SUMER was selected to be part of the SOHO payload.
