      Nearly 45 percent of public water supply is provided by the reservoirs
      of Puerto Rico. There are currently eight major water supply reservoirs
      in Puerto Rico, and they are Lago Guajataca, Lago Loíza, Lago La Plata,
      Lago de Cidra, Lago Toa Vaca, Lago Cerrillos, Lago Caonillas, and Lago
      Dos Bocas.

      The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the Puerto Rico
      Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
      Authority (PRASA), has a long-term program of monitoring reservoir
      levels and water quality.  In addition, the USGS has conducted a number
      of sedimentation surveys of water supply reservoirs to determine how
      fast the water storage capacity of these reservoirs is being reduced by
      infilling sediment.  Recently, the USGS has summarized the results of
      these reservoir sedimentation surveys. They found that a number of
      reservoirs, but particularly Lago Loíza and Lago Dos Bocas, are filling
      more rapidly than was projected at the time they were built.

      levels, click on the name of the reservoir below.
