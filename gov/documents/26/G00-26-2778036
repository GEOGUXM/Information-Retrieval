     Understanding the complexity of the carbon cycle and the linkages to
     physical, biogeochemical and ecological processes and human influences
     requires a comprehensive research strategy and a new level of
     scientific and programmatic integration. This strategy requires a
     common program vision, shared by the scientific community and
     participating federal agencies, that focuses on clearly defined
     problems with identifiable deliverables of value to the scientific
     community and the public and private sectors. The first step to
     acheiving this vision was the creation of A U.S. Carbon Cycle Science
     Plan.

                      A U.S. CARBON CYCLE SCIENCE PLAN

   Science planning was initiated in the spring of 1998 with the
   establishmentof a multidisciplinary science planning working group,
   sponsored by DOE,NASA, NOAA, NSF, and USGS, under the auspices of the
   United States Global Change Research Program.

   The Carbon and Climate Working Group held planning meetings in March
   and May 1998. A workshop was held in August 1998, in Westminster,
   Colorado, to solicit input from the scientific community, and from
   interested Federal agencies. The resulting integrated carbon cycle
   research plan addressing oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial
   components is now available. The completed science plan, titled "A U.S.
   Carbon Cycle Science Plan", is available in hard copy from:
        U.S. Global Change Research Program

   The Plan can be downloaded in PDF format as a Single Complete Document
   (1.5 MB) or In Sections.
