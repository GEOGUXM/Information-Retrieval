   Caregiving may be one of the most important roles you will undertake in
   your lifetime. Typically it is not an easy role, nor is it one for
   which most of us are prepared. Like most people, you may have questions
   about how to cope with your care receivers illnesses or disability. If
   you have a job and are juggling several responsibilities or if your
   family member or friend needs a lot of assistance, you may need help
   with caregiving, too. Whether you are expecting to become a caregiver
   or have been thrust into the role overnight, it is useful to know where
   you can get information and help.
