                 [horizons_cartoon-t.gif] JPL's HORIZONS System

   The JPL HORIZONS On-Line Solar System Data and Ephemeris Computation
   Service provides access to key solar system data and flexible
   production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar system objects
   (71000+ asteroids and comets, 91 natural satellites, 9 planets, the
   Sun). HORIZONS is provided by the Solar System Dynamics Group of the
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This page is part of the JPL Solar System
   Dynamics WWW site.

   The HORIZONS system can be accessed using any of the following methods:
     * WWW (see note below)
     * telnet (how to use the telnet method)
     * email (how to use the email method)

   NOTE: The WWW interface to HORIZONS provides a subset of capabilities
   that should be sufficient for most observers needing topocentric
   ephemerides. Additional functions available only from the telnet and
   email interfaces include:
     * Small-body PARAMETER-MATCHING population searches
     * OSCULATING ELEMENT ephemerides
     * CARTESIAN VECTOR ephemerides
     * Integration of USER-INPUT ORBITS
     * SPK BINARY FILE production (telnet interface only)
     * Ephemerides for SITES ON BODIES OTHER THAN THE EARTH
     * CLOSE-APPROACH TABLES
    HORIZONS Documentation New users may want to consult the instructions
       for using the WWW interface to HORIZONS. Complete documentation
       (updated 2001 November 5) is available:

     * as an HTML document,
     * as a PostScript document, and
     * on-line from HORIZONS.

   The latest HORIZONS system news is also available. Although the
   HORIZONS system will best serve most ephemeris requests, JPL's
   ephemeris files DE-200, DE-405, and DE-406 are available via ftp and
   CD-ROM.

Using the telnet Method

   The HORIZONS system can be accessed using telnet to connect to host
   ssd.jpl.nasa.gov on port 6775. If the direct telnet link does not work
   on your browser, you may be able to connect manually. For example, from
   most UNIX systems you would type:
        telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775

   Most MacOS and Windows telnet programs have a dialog box in which the
   port number (6775) should be entered. If after connecting to
   "ssd.jpl.nasa.gov" you are prompted for a login name (which is not
   required for HORIZONS), your telnet port is probably not set to 6775.
   Please contact your local computer system administrator or consult your
   telnet program documentation if you need more help. If your connection
   is refused, either the maximum number of connections are being used, or
   the system is temporarily off line. In either case, please try again
   later.

Using the email Method

   The HORIZONS system can be accessed using email to submit batch-style
   input files. Instructions on how to access the email server, including
   a complete detailed example, is available by sending an email message
   to horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov with the subject ``BATCH-LONG''.
