   activities taking place.

   CS^3 Concept-Set Structuring System [LJRT99]
   The CS^3 system is a rule-based information retrieval system designed
   to provide ranked output by associating Retrieval Status Values(RSVs)
   to textual documents. A rule-tree is constructed based on an input set
   of rules.

   The system allows users to create and/or modify a rule base by
   providing an interface in which a set of related rules are represented
   by an AND/OR tree. The edges in the tree can be assigned weights that
   reflect the degree to which the left hand side of an IF/THEN rule
   implies the concept in the right hand side. This system can be used
   both for setting up canned Boolean queries and Concept Based Retrieval.
   The software is written in a way that it can be added on as a top layer
   to an existing Boolean Search Engine. Our current efforts are in the
   direction of demonstrating our ideas in the context of DOE's
   InfoBridge. The software is implemented using a Java applet.

                  Slides Database Management System (SDMS)

   This system manages the slides database of the National Wetland
   Research Center (NWRC). This work represents a reengineering of the
   system that was used before. The current system, unlike its
   predecessor, can be accessed using an Internet browser.

   Each slide in the database is described by a set of keywords/formatted
   attributes. By using those keywords in queries, the system allows users
   to search the Slide Database. A user friendly interface is also
   provided to support other functions such as insertion and editing.

   Perl, CGI and MS-Access are used to implement the system. It has access
   controls to where scientists can propose changes to descriptions, but
   only library personnel can make the actual updates.

                Web to Bayou Periodical Index (WBPI) [ELR98]

   The system enhances the search capabilities of legacy internet
   resources (e.g. old-style pre-existing resources developed prior to the
   advent of more modern methods). Two approaches are modeled and
   implemented. The first approach uses structured databases and the other
   approach uses HTML documents enhanced with content tags that are
   managed by the Isite retrieval engine.

   Both implementations enable users to specify search terms in particular
   fields of the resource in order to obtain only that small portion of
   the resource that match the specified search field values. The URL
   below is for the approach based on creating a structured DB. We use
   Pro-C, CGI programs and Oracle DB.

                       Aerial Photography Index System

   The Aerial Photography Index System includes a search engine that
   allows an Internet user of the RAC's aerial photography website
   (www.rac.louisiana.edu) to search for aerial photographs by place name,
   by longitude and latitude, or by the photograph's roll and frame
   number. The development of the search engine entailed the development
   of an internet link to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)
   developed by the Census Bureau and maintained by the USGS to retrieve
   the geographic coordinates for place name specified in a user query.
   The system uses a metadata file with the corner coordinates for each
   frame of aerial photography to determine the match between coordinates
   returned by the GNIS and the aerial phtographies stored in our website.
   Future plans include the development of a map based search interface
   that will allow the user to click on an area of a map and retrieve the
   photography covering that region, along with the capability to retrieve
   all frames of aerial photography within an arbitrary region that a user
   can sketch.

   Multiple demonstrations of the Aerial Photography Indexing System have
   been provided to the USGS-National Mapping Division, Louisiana
   Geographic Information Council (LAGIC), USGS-National Wetlands Research
   Center, Louisiana State Foresters Annual Meeting, Eros Data Center,
   Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, and at the 15th Annual
   Louisiana Remote Sensing/GIS Workshop. In accordance with the Aerial
   Photography Index System, the EE-IR Center's GIS Specialist has
   developed metadata for the aerial photography within the system. These
   data are then served online with the photographs via the EE-IR Center
   metadata repository.

   Java and CGI are used in the implementation of the Aerial Photography
   Index System.

                         Meta-Data Conversion system

   The Metadata Converter/Crawler System is designed to translate
   metadata from the Federal Geographic Data Committee standard to the
   MARC21 and XML/RDF standards (with an ISO mapping coming in a later
   stage of development). The importance of conversion lies in producing a
   standard representation for heterogeneous metadata formats to enable
   better classification quality and search performance for Web content
   management. By extracting the semantic content of the metadata records
   and transforming it automatically into other formats, our process
   greatly increases the value of the original, high quality resources. In
   addition, our system builds in a mechanism for tracking and managing
   online linkages back to the original full metadata record by way of
   persistent uniform resource locators. Once records are registered with
   our converter, they are then indexed automatically with a web crawler
   for inclusion in our global metadata search engine. Taken as a whole,
   our system is a comprehensive alternative to the existing Z39.50-based
   FGDC Clearinghouse model managed by the U.S. government. The system is
   implemented using C, Java, and CGI.

                         Web to Database System(WDB)

   The system is an enhanced version of a general purpose tool for linking
   tables in a relational database system to the Web, for searching via
   standard Web browsers. NWRC has two bibliographic databases stored as a
   MiniSQL DB that are provided Web access by means of this software:
   Wetlands Values Database and Duckdata, a waterfowl and wetlands
   information database. The user-interface has been enhanced to allow
   more versatile query specifications. Also, some update functions are
   added. WDB was written in Perl.

                 Catalog Acquisition and Search Tool (CAST)

   This is a search engine for electronic product catalogs on the
   internet. The system is designed and developed to access multiple
   catalogs from multiple distributors of a given class of products. It is
   assumed that the critical information that needs to be indexed appears
   in an HTML document in a tabular form. The needed catalog pages are
   downloaded to our site and enhanced by the (automatic) insertion of
   content tags. This downloading is carried out by our own extension of a
   public domain spider, called the MOM-Spider.

   Flexible searches of the catalogs are made possible by using the Isite
   retrieval engine called ISITE, which is capable of exploiting the
   content tags that have been inserted into the HTML catalogs. We also
   enhance ISITE with a concept based retrieval capability (using ideas
   described  in the CS^3 project). Most of the programming or software
   modifications we did involves the Perl language.

       Content-based Image Retrieval(CBIR) [ChRa97a, ChRa97b, ChRa97c]

   An Image Retrieval System that enables the retrieval of images by
   content. Depending on the color contents of the query image, the system
   retrieves images that are closest to an image from the database chosen
   as the query. The goal of this work is to improve the efficiency of
   content based image retrieval by using what we call an Estimated
   Distance, rather than the more expensive Real Distance that users would
   prefer to adopt. The improvement in efficiency will yield the benefit
   that the system can deal with an image database consisting of a very
   large number of images. The current demo shows that, for a chosen small
   collection of images, the Estimated Distance based on color indeed
   allows the user to find the images in the "right" order. Java and CGI
   are used to implement this system.

                 Personalizing the Web Page of EE-IR center

   NWRC is developing an organization-specific portal that channelizes
   information from various information resources. Users accessing the
   EE-IR center's Home page may be interested in displaying only parts of
   the information contained in some channels (sub-channels).

   In this system, we provide a tool that is used to tailor different
   views of the information on EE-IR center's Home page. The tool is
   enhanced with an interface that allows those users accessing the EE-IR
   center's Web page, to personalize and customize the layout and
   channels/sub-channels of the information provided by the EE-IR center.

   The system is implemented using Javascript, Pro C, CGI, and Oracle.

                           Project Management Tool

   Project Management Tool is a web based tool that lets users track
   progress of various projects. It is fully integrated, web-enabled tool
   that helps in efficient monitoring of the projects and searching for
   the details of a single or multiple projects. The functionalities of
   this tool includes browsing through the existing projects, searching by
   the fields of team members or project title or date, adding new
   project, and updating the information for each project. This software
   helps in project planning, tracking the projects, and multi project
   management. Security is provided through limited access for
   searching/browsing the data, and adding information to the projects.

   Detailed and timely updation of each project's information helps in
   keeping track of the team members involved, the status of the project,
   the location, implementation ideas, software used and the summary of
   each project. Further advantages of this tool can be in analyzing the
   project progress versus the initial planning. It can also helps in
   assigning the resources to the projects, and depending on a person's
   availability reschedule the person to a different project.

   C and CGI are use to implement the system.
