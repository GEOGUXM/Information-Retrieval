                                About this web site

          The ASDP web site (http://asdp.bnl.gov) is sponsored by NYSGRC(
        NIGMS), NIH/NCRR and DOE. The ASDP web site provides access to a web
        server for high-throughput structure determination. It also provides
            access to a wide range of resources that might be useful in
         structure determination and analysis. These include links to other
         structural genomics web sites, structural databases including the
            PDB, and widely used crystallography software including data
                         collection, phasing and modeling.

                    What is ASDP? (Lecture Notes on 4/23/2001)

        The ASDP is a platform that consists of "pipelined" crystallographic
             programs and web interface software. The ASDP platform is
          implemented and utilized by means of a web server. The ASDP web
        server is composed by the ASDP with its graphical user interface, an
            easy-to-use (unix-like) file system, and extensive computing
         resources. The ASDP web server allows users to solve structures by
           simple mouse clicks and file manipulations over the Internet.

                                How does ASDP work?

        The ASDP web server will assign each registered user (click here to
        register) some disk space (a Web-home directory) that resides at the
         server location for rapid access. Users' data and information will
        be protected by a secure login/password system. X-ray data collected
        at NSLS beamlines or from other sources can be linked directly to an
        user's Web-home data directory. The user also will be able to upload
           and download files from and to his/her own computer/pc to the
        Web-home, and to submit jobs through the web-based interface. These
         jobs will run on the large computing cluster available to the ASDP
         user community. The users will provide basic crystallographic and
        molecular information (such as space group and unit cell parameters
         acquired during the data collection or directly extracted from the
          data file). After setting up experimental data files, ASDP will
        automatically perform appropriate data conversions required for the
        use of various crystallographic programs, and will install necessary
        script files for running programs. Users then will be presented with
             a "clickable" list of steps/programs, each with suggested
        input/script files (i.e. "recipes") to submit jobs. Options for the
                    level of automation will be up to the users.

                                    Disclaimer

        This web site does not distribute crystallography software packages.
           Requirement of software package should send to its author(s).

                        About research grants and proposals

         The research grants are supported by NIGMS(GM-99-009) and NCRR(P41
        RR12408) As one of specific aims in the research proposal of NYSGRC,
             this group is devoted to development of "An Internet-based
        Computational Pipeline for Protein Crystallography" and providing a
         web server to the users at NYSGRC and NSLS/BNL for high-throughput
                              structure determination.

                          About background and references

          This web site was originally set up for the workshop of "Toward
              Automation of Structure Determination in Macromolecular
        Crystallography" which was held on June 20-21, 1999 sponsored by DOE
         and EMBL. The meeting report was published in: Acta Cryst. (2000).
                                  D56, 1510-1511.
