     Workforce Investment Act (WIA), Section 166


                                DINAP VISION

   WELCOME to the Division of Indian and Native American Programs' (DINAP)
   "Partnership" Home Page! This website has been designed to provide
   general information about the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), Section
   166 Indian and Native American Program, to enrich the lives of Indian
   and Native Americans, and to help them achieve economic
   self-sufficiency through employment and job training.

   For these fundamental reasons, it is our shared vision that the Section
   166 WIA program be administered in a manner consistent with the
   traditional cultural values, beliefs, and ways of the people it is
   designed to serve.

   This shared vision should result in policies that respect and honor the
   partnership at all levels within the Department of Labor, and lead to
   an established policy commitment to Indian self-determination.
