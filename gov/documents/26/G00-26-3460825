   AHRQ conducts several workshops throughout the year. The purpose of the
   workshop is to facilitate the use of the MEPS public use data files by
   the health services research community by providing both practical
   information about MEPS files and an opportunity to construct analytic
   files with the assistance of AHRQ staff. This workshop is designed for
   health services researchers who have a background or interest in using
   national health surveys. To obtain more details about the material
   presented view our online workbook by clicking the link below.
