How to contribute to the Archive

   The Internet Traffic Archive is moderated. The moderator's duties are
   to ensure compliance with the guidelines discussed in this section, and
   to maintain high standards for the quality of the trace collection. For
   example, the moderator might reject a trace with a high degree of
   packet loss, or of a size the moderator deems inappropriate (e.g., too
   small to be worth the effort; too large to be worth the disk space).
   The moderator also maintains the Web pages and the mailing lists for
   discussion of the archive contents and for announcing archive updates
   and changes.
   The present moderator is Vern Paxson (vern@ee.lbl.gov).
   Submission guidelines for contributing traces.
   Submission guidelines for contributing software.
   To contribute to the archive, email the moderator a description of the
   submission conforming to the guidelines. The email should include an
   ftp site from which the moderator can fetch the trace or software, and
   the size of the trace.
   The moderator may accept the submission as it stands; return the
   submission for revision, detailing what must be done to make the
   contribution acceptable for the archive; or reject the submission as
   inappropriate. Expect turn-around times of 2-3 weeks.
