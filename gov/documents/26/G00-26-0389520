USGS to Distribute EO-1 Data

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is teaming up with NASA to extend the
   useful life of the Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) technology demonstration
   satellite. NASA officially completed the EO-1 mission in November 2001,
   but the two agencies, already management partners for the Landsat
   satellite program, have agreed to work together to extend EO-1
   operations through February 2002 and then continue on a month-by-month
   basis.

   The NASA New Millennium Program's Earth Observing -1 Satellite (NMP
   EO-1) was successfully launched on November 21, 2000, originally tasked
   with a one-year mission to flight-validate a variety of new
   technologies aimed at lowering the cost and increasing the performance
   of future Earth science missions. Part of the EO-1 technology
   validation effort is directly applicable to the future Landsat Data
   Continuity Mission (LDCM).
   NASA's one-year EO-1 technology demonstration/validation mission was
   successfully completed in November 2001. As the end of the initial
   1-year mission neared, the remote sensing research and applications
   community expressed high interest in an EO-1 Extended Mission. As a
   result of the superior performance of the satellite's three imaging
   instruments and exceptional value of the collected data, an interim
   agreement was reached between NASA and the United States Geological
   Survey (USGS) to continue EO-1 operations in order to augment the EO-1
   scientific data base and promote technology applications. User demand -
   - through pay-as-you-go satellite tasking -- will determine the
   longevity of operations barring a satellite technical failure.
   The EO-1 Extended Mission represents a change from a technology
   demonstration to an operational mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is
   chartered to collect and provide Hyperion and ALI products from the
   USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota who will also
   permanently archive such data in accordance with the Land Remote
   Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-555). Collection of new data
   will be driven by user's scheduling Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) to
   task the instruments. Under the Extended Mission, previously and newly
   acquired data is considered in the public domain.
