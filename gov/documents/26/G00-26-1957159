    DOE Shield DOE Openness:
               Human Radiation Experiments
      __________________________________________________________________

   The Office of Human Radiation Experiments, established in March 1994,
   leads the Department of Energy's efforts to tell the agency's Cold War
   story of radiation research using human subjects. We have undertaken an
   intensive effort to identify and catalog relevant historical documents
   from DOE's 3.2 million cubic feet of records scattered across the
   country. Internet access to these resources is a key part of making DOE
   more open and responsive to the American public.
