   Ultra-Thin Whitetopping (UTW) Project
           ALF in UTW Pavements

   Introduction

   Ultra-Thin Whitetopping (UTW) is a recently developed rehabilitation
   technique in which a 50- to 100-mm thick layer of high-strength,
   fiber-reinforced, portland cement concrete is placed over a milled
   surface of rutted and/or cracked asphalt concrete pavement. In 1998, to
   help State and local highway agencies make decisions about using UTW
   for various applications, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and
   the American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) entered into a
   cooperative agreement to research UTW. The agreement resulted in a
   research project involving the evaluation of eight 14.6-m long test
   lanes of UTW placed over asphalt concrete pavements in the FHWA's
   Pavement Test Facility in McLean, Virginia.

   Purpose

   The purpose of this study is to validate design equations and models
   recommended in the ACPA's design methods for UTW and to document the
   performance of UTW. More specifically, the objectives are to: (1)
   evaluate UTW performance under controlled wheel-loads and temperature;
   (2) study the effects of design features on UTW performance; (3)
   measure pavement responses to develop mechanistic models; and (4)
   verify and develop models to predict load-carrying capacity.

   Experimental Design

   The study is specifically aimed to address the effects of overlay
   thickness, joint spacing, and fiber reinforcement on UTW performance.
   The experiment matrix is shown in Table 1.

   The overlay thickness and joint spacings are typical values currently
   employed in UTW designs. Joints are sawed longitudinally and
   transversely with the same spacing. The fiber concrete is a
   conventional portland cement concrete with fibrilated polypropylene
   fiber added to increase resistance to plastic shrinkage cracking and to
   provide additional tensile strength.

   The UTW was placed over 200-mm thick AC pavements that were in various
   stages of rutting distress after extensive testing with Accelerated
   Loading Facility (ALF) pavement testing machines at different times
   during the previous 5 years. The pavement sections had been built with
   seven different AC mixtures as part of an experiment to validate the
   Superpave performance grading asphalt binder system. Prior to placement
   of the UTW overlays, the AC in each section was milled to either of two
   depths (64 or 89 mm) to remove the surface ruts and to provide for a
   final pavement thickness, after overlaying, of 200 mm.

   Loading of the Test Sections

   Test sections are being loaded by two ALF pavement testing machines.
   The FHWA ALF machines apply real-world truck loading in an outdoor, but
   controlled pavement temperature environment. Loads can be varied
   between 44 and 100 kN on a pair of dual 11R22.5 radial ply truck tires
   (which represent one half of a single-axle load). Actual loadings
   during the UTW experiment are either 44 or 54 kN; at these levels, the
   ALF applies 1.52 or 3.62 80-kN equivalent single axle loads (ESAL) per
   pass, respectively, to a typical test section (Lanes 11 and 12). The
   speed of the load tires is a constant 18.5 km/h (5.1 m/sec), with an
   average load rate of 35,000 repetitions per week.

   Concrete Properties

   The concrete mixture used for the UTW contained 363 kg/m^3 of
   cementitious material, 50 percent of which was Type I cement per AASHTO
   M-85 and 50 percent of which was Grade 120 slag per AASHTO M-302. The
   aggregate was a number 7 crushed stone with a 12.5 mm top size per ASTM
   C-33. The mixture included a mid-range water reducer in aiming to
   achieve a design slump of 178 mm while maintaining a water-cementitious
   material ratio of 0.45. The target entrained air content was 4.5 to 7.5
   percent, while target strengths were 27,600 kPa in compression and
   4,500 kPa in flexure. A 7-day moist cure was specified. Fibrilated
   polypropylene fiber (1.78 kg/m^3) was used in half of the sections.

   Results of field tests for slump, unit weight, and air content and of
   28-day laboratory tests are shown in Table 2.

                 Modulus of elasticity (MPa) - 31,526 38,507

   Instrumentation

   The test sections are instrumentated to allow measurement of pavement
   deflections and strains at various locations in the concrete slabs and
   the overlaid AC layer (figure 1). Fifteen to eighteen strain gauges
   were installed in each lane near the top and bottom of the UTW and on
   top of the AC. Interior and corner deflections are being monitored with
   linear voltage displacement transducers (LVDT's).

   Data Collection and Analysis

   Data is being collected for key parameters in the UTW design procedure,
   including the layer moduli, PCC flexural strengths, bond strengths, and
   the percent of fatigue life consumed for the existing AC pavements. The
   design factorial will provide pavement performance data to test the
   accuracy of the UTW design equations. Fatigue cracking, faulting, and
   roughness data will be used to calibrate models. Pavement response data
   (deflections and strains) will be compared to theoretical calculated
   values. Pavement response data will also be used to study the effects
   of load transfer and bond strengths on UTW performance.

   Schedule

   Loading of the test sections began in May, 1998, and is scheduled to be
   completed in November, 1999. Loading of individual sections varies
   between 7 and 30 weeks. The current status of the loading is shown on
   the Testing Status Page.
