             The primary objective of STS-75 is to carry the Tethered
             Satellite System Reflight (TSS-1R) into orbit and to deploy it
             spaceward on a conducting tether. The mission will also fly the
             United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3) designed to
             investigate materials science and condensed matter physics.

             The TSS-1R mission is a reflight of TSS-1 which was flown
             onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-46 in July/August of 1992.
             During that flight, the tether was deployed a distance of 860
             feet. STS-75 mission scientist hope to deploy the tether to a
             distance of over 12 miles (20.7km).

             The Tether Satellite System will circle the Earth at an altitude
             of 296 kilometers which will place the tether system within the
             rarefied electrically charged layer of the atmosphere known as
             the ionosphere. The conducting tether will generate high voltage
             and electrical currents as it moves through the ionosphere
             across the magnetic field lines of the earth. Scientists will be
             able to learn more about the electrodynamics of a conducting
             tether system to deepen our understanding of physical processes
             in the near-Earth space environment. These studies will help
             provide explanations for events such as the formation and
             behavior of comet tails and bursts of radio "noise" detected
             from other planets.

             The specific TSS1-R mission objectives are: characterize the
             current-voltage response of the TSS-orbiter system, characterize
             the satellites high-voltage sheath structure and current
             collection process, demonstrate electric power generation,
             verify tether control laws and basic tether dynamics,
             demonstrate the effect of neutral gas on the plasma sheath and
             current collection, characterize the TSS radio frequency and
             plasma wave emissions and characterize the TSS
             dynamic-electrodynamic coupling.

             TSS-1R Science Investigations include: TSS Deployer Core
             Equipment and Satellite Core Equipment (DCORE/SCORE), Research
             on Orbital Plasma Electrodynamics (ROPE), Research on
             Electrodynamic Tether Effects (RETE), Magnetic Field Experiment
             for TSS Missions (TEMAG), Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether System
             (SETS), Shuttle Potential and Return Electron Experiment
             (SPREE), Tether Optical Phenomena Experiment (TOP),
             Investigation of Electromagnetic Emissions by the Electrodynamic
             Tether (EMET), Observations at the Earth's Surface of
             Electromagnetic Emissions by TSS (OESSE), Investigation and
             Measurement of Dynamic Noise in the TSS (IMDN), Theoretical and
             Experimental Investigation of TSS Dynamics (TEID) and the Theory
             and Modeling in Support of Tethered Satellite Applications
             (TMST).

             The USMP-3 payload consists of four major experiments mounted on
             two Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structures (MPESS) and
             three Shuttle Mid-deck experiments. The experiments are:
             Advanced Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (AADSF),
             Material pour l'Etude des Phenomenes Interessant la
             Solidification sur Terre et en Orbite (MEPHISTO), Space
             Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS), Orbital Acceleration
             Research Experiment (OARE), Critical Fluid Light Scattering
             Experiment (ZENO) and Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment
             (IDGE).

   Launch:

             Launch February 22, 1996 3:18:00.061 pm EST. Launch window was 2
             hours 30 min. There were no unscheduled holds. Winds at liftoff
             were from approximately 63.4 degrees at 5.76 knots. Ambient
             temperature was 72.8 F, barometric pressure was 29.94in Hg and
             relative humidity was at 78%.

             About four seconds after liftoff, Shuttle Commander Andy Allen
             reported that his instruments showed that one of the shuttle
             main engines was operating at only 45% of its normal power
             level. Flight controllers in Houston quickly responded that all
             engines were performing nominally. The engines throttled as
             expected about 1 minute into the launch, and operated normally
             all the way to main engine cutoff at 8 and a half minutes into
             the flight. Engineers will look at data from the launch to try
             to understand the faulty reading. ( Reference STS-75 MCC Status
             Report # 01)

             On Tuesday, 2/20/96, the mission management team met briefly to
             discuss an incident that occurred overnight at Pad 39B. At about
             1 a.m., a neutralizing agent, believed to be sodium hydroxide
             was spilled over the left-hand solid rocket booster and the left
             side of the external tank. This non-toxic liquid is used to
             neutralize any potential hazardous vapors that may be present
             during normal operations to remove covers off the reaction
             control system thrusters on Columbia. The incident has not
             seriously delayed the launch countdown. However, engineering
             evaluations are in work to determine if any concerns exist for
             the liquid contacting the flight hardware. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 2/21/1996).

             The countdown started at 4pm EST at the T-minus 43 hour mark on
             Monday, 2/19/96 and the payload bay doors were closed. The
             STS-75 crew arrived at the Shuttle Landing Facility at 3:30pm
             EST. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/20/1996).

             On Tuesday, 2/13/96, a faulty wire to one of the pyrotechnic
             devices at the 17-inch disconnect located between the orbiter
             and external tank was replaced and tested successfully. Also,
             problems with the crew hatch were resolved and final testing was
             successful. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/13/1996).

             On Friday, 2/9/96, Hypergolic loading operations took place and
             the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) was conducted. The countdown
             is scheduled to begin on February 19. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 2/09/1996).

             On Friday, 2/2/96, work continued to remove and replace the high
             pressure fuel turbo pump from main engine number 1. The new pump
             was installed and electrical hookup started. The Terminal
             Countdown Demonstration Test was also concluded. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 2/02/1996).

             On 1/29/96, the Shuttle Columbia was transferred to Pad 39B from
             the Vehicle Assembly Building. First motion occurred at 2:33
             a.m. The vehicle was hard down on the pad at about 9:30 a.m.
             Later that evening, the three auxiliary power units (APU) were
             to be hot fired. After that, workers will start the week long
             process to remove and replace the high pressure fuel turbo pump
             from Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) No. 1.

             On 1/23/96, Columbia was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly
             Building with first motion occurring at 10:45 p.m. From there it
             was lifted and mated with external tank. The Shuttle interface
             verification test was scheduled for 1/26/96. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 1/24/1996).
             On 11/27/95, work began on the removal and replacement of Window
             No. 6. The three main engines have been removed. The forward
             reaction control system removed on Tuesday 11/28/95 and the
             freon coolant loop No. 1 deserviced. Testing was started on the
             Ku-band antenna. In the Operations and Checkout building work on
             the the STS-75 payloads, Tethered Satellite and USMP-3, has been
             going smoothly and is nearing completion. They will be in
             preparation for final testing. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             11/27/1995).

   Landing:

             KSC Saturday, March 9, 1996 at 8:58:38 a.m EST, SLF Runway 33
             Landing times: Main gear touchdown at MET 15days 17hours 40min
             21sec, or 8:58:21 am EST. Nose gear touchdown at MET 15days
             17hours 40min 36sec, or 8:58:36 EST. Wheels stop at 15days
             17hours 41min 25 sec or 8:59:25am EST.(Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 3/09/1995).

             The first KSC landing opportunity for Saturday, March 9, 1996
             was waived off due to cloud cover at KSC. This would have
             required a deorbit burn at 6:23am EST, with a landing at 7:24am
             EST. A "go" was given by Mission Control for the deorbit burn at
             7:46am EST to support the 2nd KSC opportunity. Deorbit burn at
             MET: 15d16h37m43s on orbit 251 at 7:56am EST.

             In the event of unacceptable weather at KSC, the shuttle would
             have landed during one of 3 landing opportunities at Edwards
             AFB. The first opportunity would have been on orbit 252 with a
             9:25am EST deorbit burn leading to a landing at 10:26am EST
             (7:26am Dryden time).

             On 3/9/96, flight controllers opted to forego KSC landing
             opportunities at 7:16 a.m., 8:52 am EST and 10:27 on because of
             forecast low clouds and the possibility of rain and gusty winds.
             Weather conditions did not inprove and at 9:25am EST, mission
             controllers waived off KSC's final landing opportunity for
             3/8/96. ( Reference STS-75 MCC Status Report # 28)

   Mission Highlights:

             About four seconds after liftoff, instruments showed that one
             Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) was operating at only 45% of
             normal power. It was quickly determined that the problem was in
             the instrumentation and not in the engine. Over the next few
             days, t he TSS-1R and USMP-3 payloads were powered up and
             prepared for science operations. Problems were noted with a
             payload interface device known as a "Smart Flex". The deployment
             of the TSS satellite was delayed 24 hours to perform additional
             testing on the device. On Flight Day 4 (2/25/95), deploy
             operations began at 2:45pm CST. At approximately 7:30pm CST,
             after TSS-1R had deployed 19.7km of tether and had almost
             reached full deployment, the tether broke.
