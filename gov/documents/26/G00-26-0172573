                           Administrative Appeals
    The Office of Administrative Appeals (OAA) decides appeals of initial
   administrative determinations made by the Restricted Access Management
    program. OAA's jurisdiction covers the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ)
    program for Pacific halibut and sablefish, the Groundfish Moratorium,
   the Scallop Moratorium, the Western Alaska Community Development Quota
    program, and the Groundfish and Crab License Limitation Program. The
    OAA consists of a chief appeals officer, two appeals officers, and an
   appeals assistant. Regulations governing the OAA are found at 50 C.F.R.
                                sec. 679.43.
