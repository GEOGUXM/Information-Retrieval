                              About Ben's Guide
                         to U.S. Government for Kids

   Ben's Guide to U.S. Government for Kids is brought to the World Wide
   Web as a service of the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government
   Printing Office (GPO). Ben's Guide serves as the educational component
   of GPO Access, GPO's service to provide the official online version of
   legislative and regulatory information.

   This site provides learning tools for K-12 students, parents, and
   teachers. These resources will teach how our government works, the use
   of the primary source materials of GPO Access, and how one can use GPO
   Access to carry out their civic responsibilities. And, just as GPO
   Access provides locator services to U.S. Government sites, Ben's Guide
   provides a similar service to U.S. Government Web sites developed for
   kids.

   Direct any comments about or suggestions for Ben's Guide to
   askben@gpo.gov.
