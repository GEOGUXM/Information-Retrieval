                             Cryogenic Actuators



   The primary mirror for NGST will not have the luxury of being massive
   and retaining its perfect optical shape through material stiffness. The
   quality of the reflective surface will be computer controled via
   actuators which can adjust the shape of the mirror to give high
   quality, sharp images. These actuators will need to work at the
   extremely cold temperatures that NGST is expected to operate at
   (~30-100 Kelvin). Mirror actuation is one aspect of microdynamics that
   NGST must address.



   Cryogenic actuatuation will be required for:
    1. Primary mirror segments and secondary mirror alignment (position
       actuators)
    2. Primary mirror segment figure control (force actuators)
    3. Deformable Mirror control

   The primary requirements for these actuators are (a) operation at
   cryogenic temperatures and (b) extremely fine position knowledge and
   control.

                          NGST actuator candidates

   The current state-of-the-art:
     * No know actuator is available that satisfies the alignment actuator
       conditions in a signal device
     * Picomotors have 30 nm resolution but do not operate cold
     * Piezoelectric and electrostrictive materials loose stroke at low
       temperature

                         Actuator performance graphs

     Because the required actuators do not yet exist for NGST the NASA is
   sponsoring 7 external studies by the following companies to develop the
   necessary technology. Initial testing is underway at JPL Cryogenic
   Actuator Test Facility.
