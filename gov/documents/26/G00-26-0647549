  Cookie Information

   "Cookies" are bits of information that websites can send back and forth
   to your computer. When a Server receives a request that includes a
   Cookie, the Server is able to use the information stored in the Cookie.
   The Server then recognizes you the next time you logon to the website.

   This Website uses "cookies" to track sessions and maintain user
   information (business, not personal, information). Fleet type and zip
   code information is kept and linked to each user IP address to create a
   custom session. Information is dynamically generated for each user
   based on the information provided. In addition, when a user returns to
   the site at a later date, the same custom information is provided to
   the user. This tracking approach helps determine if federal EPAct
   requirements and possible incentives apply to individual fleets. Also,
   the cookie approach saves each user time, since fleet information only
   needs to be entered once.

   All information gathered in this site is kept strictly confidential and
   is not used by NREL or the federal government in any other way.

   This approach is consistent with the electronic government concept of
   providing easy access to information that may have been cumbersome and
   time consuming for the user before. It supports the Administration's
   goal of promoting energy savings and fuel efficiency by providing fleet
   managers (whether or not they are subject to EPAct requirements) with
   information (such as financial incentives, vehicle choices, and
   alternative fuel stations available in their areas) to help them make
   decisions about purchasing alternative fuel vehicles.

   If, at any time, you would like your cookie removed, please contact the
   site's Webmaster and provide your name and e-mail address with a
   request to remove your cookie. We will remove your cookie information
   upon receiving this request.
