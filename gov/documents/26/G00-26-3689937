Freedom Of Information Act Requests

   How to Make a FOIA Request | Fees | Fee Waivers | Time Limits | Privacy
                                     Act

   The FOIA does not require agencies to do research for you, to analyze
   data, to answer written questions, or to create documents that can't be
   reproduced with a reasonable amount of effort.

How to Make a FOIA Request

   Submit a written FOIA request (letter, fax, or e-mail) for documents
   maintained by the Risk Management Agency to:

       Donna Gibson, FOIA Coordinator
       USDA-RMA
       Room 6620/Stop 0821
       1400 Independence Ave SW
       Washington, DC 20250
       Fax: (202) 720-6665
       E-mail: Donna_Gibson@wdc.usda.gov

   In order to protect your privacy, whenever you request information
   about yourself, you will be asked to provide either a notarized
   statement or a statement signed under the penalty of perjury stating
   that you are the person that you claim to be. If you request
   information about yourself and do not follow one of these procedures,
   your request cannot be processed. This requirement helps to ensure that
   private information about you will not be disclosed to anyone else.

   In making your request, identify the documents you want as clearly as
   possible. The more precise and accurate the request, the more likely
   you are to get a complete response. For example, include the following
   in your request:

       Subject
       Office or agency that maintains the information
       Location of documents
       Time documents were probably created
       Grant or contract numbers, if applicable
       Your telephone number, e-mail address, and mailing address
       Fee information (see below)

   FOIA requests apply to existing records only. RMA is not required to
   create a record to answer a FOIA request. If the record requested does
   not exist on paper or in electronic form, RMA's reply to the requester
   will explain that.

Fees

   The FOIA office can charge fees for processing FOIA requests.
   Therefore, specify the fee category in which you feel your request
   falls and the amount you are willing to pay. The FOIA divides
   requesters into four categories:
    1. Commercial requesters, who may be charged fees for searching for
       documents, reviewing the documents, and duplication.
    2. Educational or noncommercial scientific institutions, which may be
       charged only for duplication, minus the first 100 pages.
    3. Representatives of the news media, who may be charged only for
       duplication, minus the first 100 pages.
    4. A ll other requesters, who may be charged fees for searching for
       documents and duplication, minus the first 2 hours of search time
       and the first 100 pages.

   No charge will be made if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal
   to or greater than the fee itself; for USDA this amount is $25. In
   cases where no documents are located, the Agency is entitled to charge
   the requester for any applicable search time involved.

Fee Waivers

   Fee waivers may be granted when disclosure of the documents is in the
   public interest and is likely to contribute significantly to public
   understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is
   not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. When making
   a request for a fee waiver, consider the following:
    1. Does the document concern the operations or activities of the
       government?
    2. Is disclosure likely to contribute to the public understanding of
       these operations and activities? and
    3. Will that contribution be significant?

   NOTE: Requests for fee waivers must be fully documented and justified
   by a written explanation.

   Appeals: A person whose initial FOIA request for documents has been
   denied, either in part or in whole, or who has received a no records
   response, or whose request for a fee waiver has been denied, has the
   right to appeal the denial to the appropriate RMA administrator within
   45 days after receipt of notification of the denial.

Time Limits

   Agencies are required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business
   days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. For the Privacy
   Act, the time limit is 10 business days. This period does not begin
   until the request is actually received by the FOIA office.

   In specific situations, an additional 10-day extension may be granted
   in responding to a request. The FOIA provides for extensions of initial
   time limits under unusual circumstances, which are defined as: (1) the
   need to search for and collect records from separate offices; (2) the
   need to examine a voluminous amount of records required by the request;
   and (3) the need to consult with another agency or agency component. We
   are required to respond to your request within 20 working days of
   receiving it.

   If there is a delay in fulfilling your request beyond the 20-day time
   frame, we will notify you. Our response might include an explanation of
   how soon we can provide the records you requested, a copy of all the
   records you requested, a portion of the records requested with an
   explanation of why we withheld some records, or an explanation that we
   have found no records responsive to your request. When we deny records
   or cannot find them, you have a right to appeal our actions within
   45-days of the date of our reply to you.

Privacy Act

   The Privacy Act (PA), 5 U.S.C. 552a, protects individuals against
   clearly unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy. The PA informs
   individuals as to what information is maintained on them and where the
   information is stored and allows an individual to access documents
   maintained in a PA System of Records (records retrievable by an
   individual's name or other personal identifier) and to request an
   amendment of the records. Documents maintained in a PA System of
   Records are available to first-party requesters (individuals that the
   record pertains to) or their representatives unless they fall within
   the exemptions of both the PA and the FOIA.
