                Privacy and Security Policy for NIH-OD Websites

  How we handle the information we gather when you visit our web site

   We collect and store only the following information about you:
   The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e.,
   IBM.com, if you are connecting from an IBM account, or Yale.edu if you
   are connecting from Yale University's domain); the date and time you
   access our site; the item you requested from the server; and the
   Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our
   site. If your browser accepts cookies we may use a cookie to determine
   if you are a repeat or new visitor, or to understand how many different
   visitors come to our sites. When we examine this data, it is always
   presented in an aggregate form. Except as outlined in the security
   section at the bottom of this document, we do not track or look at
   individuals' usage behavior.

   We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally identifying
   information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
   provide such information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement
   investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any
   information we receive with any outside parties.

  What is a cookie?

   A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser
   -- along with a Web page -- when you access a Web site. There a two
   kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored
   temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never
   written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser.
   A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by
   your browser to a file on your hard drive. Some cookies we use are
   persistent and some are session only. If you have your browser set to
   notify you before accepting cookies the notice will tell you if the
   cookie expires some time in the future or not. Persistent cookies have
   an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no date
   associated with them.

  NIH-OD's use of Cookies:

   We have set our software so that your browser will only return cookie
   information to the domain where the cookie originated (in this case,
   NIH-OD.gov). No other site can request it. When you return to this
   site, the cookie is sent back to the Web server, along with your new
   request. We use this information to create summary statistics which are
   used for web site planning and maintenance and to analyze system
   performance. This information tells us the number of visitors to the
   different sections of our site and helps us understand if our site is
   meeting the needs of our visitors. This information is only presented
   in an aggregate form--never for an individual user. Some example
   cookies from NIH-OD servers are shown on this page. Note: Regardless of
   the particular uses for cookies on NIH-OD web sites, we do not share
   any cookie information with any third parties.

  If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:

   When you send us personally-identifying information, (e.g., in an
   electronic mail message containing a question or comment), or by
   filling out a form that E-mails us this information, we use this
   information to respond to your request. We may also forward your E-mail
   to other Government employees, who are better able to answer you
   questions.

  Links to other sites:

   The documents posted on this Website may contain hypertext links or
   pointers to information created and maintained by other public and
   private organizations. These links and pointers are provided for
   visitors' convenience. NIH-OD does not control or guarantee the
   accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any linked information from
   non-NIH-OD sites.

   The inclusion of links or pointers to Web sites is not intended to
   assign importance to those sites or the information contained therein,
   nor is it intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed, or
   products or services offered on these sites.

  Security:

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, NIH-OD webservers employ industry-standard
   methods to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to
   upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized
   attempts to upload information or change information on NIH-OD servers
   are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act.

   In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no
   expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law
   enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual
   users or their usage habits.

   Questions about NIH privacy policies should be sent to the NIH Privacy
   Act Officer.
