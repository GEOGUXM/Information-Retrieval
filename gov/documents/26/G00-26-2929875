Introductory Activities for Teachers and Students

   It is often very helpful to have teachers and students complete an
   activity that encourages them to look for specific information on web
   pages.
     * Dan and Ann's Scavenger Hunt for Kids and Handout. This activity
       links students to many sites on the WWW, including Athena.
     * A Geophysical Treasure Hunt - Designed for secondary students and
       teachers, this structured introductory activity focuses on the
       real-time data available on theAthena web-site.
     * Read about The Goddess Athena in historical context with pictures
       of her image, her temple the Parthenon, and references.

   These materials are used in presentations at conferences, workshops and
   to the interested public. Feel free to use these materials in your own
   teacher training workshops when you are turning others on to the Athena
   instructional materials.

Athena Pilot Teacher Reflections

   Here are some informal reflections by teachers who have piloted Athena
   materials in their classrooms. The classrooms are as varied as the
   experiences.
