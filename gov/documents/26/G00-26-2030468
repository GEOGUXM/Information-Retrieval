                Sage-ST ä
                Year 2000 Compliance
       _______________________________________________________________

   Y2K Update    Sage Year 2000 Issues in Versions 4.1 through 5.12
       _______________________________________________________________


   As a Managing & Operating (M&O) Contractor to the Department of Energy,
   BBWI cannot legally represent or warrant that Sage-ST ä is Year 2000
   compliant. However, the INEEL has addressed this issue and we provide
   the following information to assist you in your Year 2000 compliant
   activities involving applications utilizing this tool.

   The Sage-ST development tool set has a development and enhancement
   history that spans over ten years. During these years many applications
   and systems have been developed based on the tool's libraries and
   database.

   The database internal to Sage-ST has been year 2000 compliant from its
   inception. In all date fields, the century information is preserved.
   Based on user requirements throughout the years, several date display
   formats are provided. Some of these display formats do not include the
   century indicator. Although using a two-digit year is not a good Year
   2000 programming practice, in Sage-ST the century is assumed and added
   when stored inside the database. The Sage-ST convention has been to
   assume >=50 to be in the 1900s and <50 to be in the 2000s. Thus, even
   in older applications, the display and entry of dates into a Sage-ST
   database using a two-digit year will not be a Year 2000 problem. We
   cannot control a programmer's use of a date once it is pulled out of
   the database, so the application itself could use the two-digit year
   and not be correct.

   Earlier versions of DOS did not account for the century, thus some of
   the earlier versions of Sage-ST when using the system date will have
   errors even on new DOS systems. This problem has been corrected in
   Sage-ST and will work properly on newer versions. The Windows ä
   versions have not had this problem.

   A time and date library called TIMELIB is provided. The known and
   reported problems were corrected several years ago. We expect no
   problems now. As you can see by this, we are confident the later
   versions of Sage-ST are and will prove to be Year 2000 compliant.

   In addition, the INEEL has put together a plan to verify Year 2000
   compliance for Sage-ST. This plan consists of three major components.
   First, there were some known problems with dates and Year 2000 issues
   in earlier versions of Sage-St. Although these have been fixed and are
   no longer an issue in the current versions, several projects continue
   to use these older versions. We will go back through the development
   and release history of Sage-St and list the various version releases
   and date-related corrections, and post these on our Sage-ST web site at
   homepage.htm . For those using an older version, Year 2000 patches will
   be available that can be compiled and used by the projects to correct
   known problems.

   Second, the current version of Sage-ST will be independently analyzed
   with a Year 2000 tool. The INEEL development team will then mitigate
   any Year 2000 problems in the Sage-ST tool encountered by this
   independent effort.

   Third, the INEEL is in the process of establishing its own capability
   to analyze, correct, and verify Year 2000 problems for others in the
   government and elsewhere. The INEEL will use Sage-ST as a means in
   developing and demonstrating this capability. Thus, the current version
   of Sage-ST will go through an additional internal Year 2000 review
   process.

   The plan will be implemented as time and resources permit during this
   calendar year. We will complete all activities as early as possible and
   by 12/31/98. It is felt these efforts will provide adequate confidence
   that the tool and its libraries will operate correctly during the turn
   of the century and beyond. This will not replace the fact that
   applications using the Sage-ST tool set will need their own review for
   the use of dates and date calculations.

   Year 2000 compliant plan or the INEEL's Year 2000 support capabilities

UPDATE (March 1999)

   This update provides a summary of INEEL activities in 1998 relating to
   Year 2000 compliance for Sage-ST.

   In our initial documentation, we outlined a 3 phased plan to verify
   Year 2000 compliance for Sage-ST.

   Phase I: There were some known problems with dates and Year 2000 issues
   in earlier versions of Sage-ST, which were corrected and tested in
   subsequent versions. Some projects may continue to utilize earlier
   versions of Sage-ST, and to address that situation, we reviewed the
   development and release history of Sage-ST. We have posted the various
   version releases and date-related corrections to those versions on our
   homepage at homepage/htm. Year 2000 patches are available to anyone
   requiring these corrections by contacting us by email at:
   hotline@sage.inel.gov.

   Phase II: Sage-St was analyzed and tested for Year 2000 compliance by
   actually setting the clock forward to January 1, 2000. This testing was
   performed on specific applications and tools utilizing Sage-ST. All
   date instances were analyzed to be Year 2000 compliant.

   Phase III: The INEEL has planned to provide Year 2000 compliance
   service and support for others in the government, etc. In doing so,
   Sage-ST was used to exercise a testing capability by an independent
   party. This was completed and to the best of our abilities and
   knowledge, we have provided a Year 2000 compliant tool to all of our
   customers.

   As we stated in our previous documentation, even though we assert that
   Sage-ST has been reviewed, analyzed, tested and corrected for Year 2000
   compliance, we cannot control a programmer's use of a date once it is
   pulled out of the database. An application could be developed using the
   two-digit year, and not be correct. Individual applications must be
   tested separately from the tool itself to certify compliance.

Sage Year 2000 Issues in Versions 4.1 through 5.12

   The significant problems found were in TimeLib.CurrentDate0 and
   TimeLib.Date2toDate0. In the earlier versions of Sage these procedures
   were not able to convert a date later than 1999 accurately to the
   desired Sage format. As a result incorrect character strings were
   produced.

   In Sage versions earlier than 4.1 other problems existed in addition to
   those above. The current system date was not read correctly from DOS
   and an error existed in Sage's leap year algorithm.

   Additionally, some other changes had been made in the Julian date
   conversion routines, but I was not able to find exactly where these
   occurred.
    Sage Versions:4.1 5/7/93 Alsys 5.1.2 FirstAda (16 bit mode) DOS compiler
    4.11 8/10/93
    4.14 11/16/93
    4.15 1/5/94
    4.16 3/14/94
    4.2 7/19/95 Alsys 5.1.3 386/486 (32 bit mode) DOS compiler
    Alsys 5.3 386/486 (32 bit mode) DOS compiler
    5.1 11/12/96 ActiveAda 5.52 compiler Windows
    ObjectAda V7.0 Windows
    5.12 6/24/97 ObjectAda V7.0 Windows

   Change history:

   Versions 4.1, 4.11, 4.14 & 4.15 are the same and have a problem
   formatting dates after 1999.

   Version 4.16 was modified in other areas, but exhibits the same date
   problem.

   Version 4.2 contains a major fix for CurrentDate0.

   Version 5.1 is the same as 4.2.

   Version 5.12 contains a further fix for CurrentDate0 and also an
   initial fix for Date2toDate0 to remove the assumption of the digits
   "19" in the output date. This version calls a new procedure in the
   TimeDate package which uses calls in DosLib that in turn call AsmLib.

   Resolutions:

   For versions 4.2 and later, a replacement of Timelib, TimeDate, Doslib,
   and AsmLib should resolve the problem.

   For versions 4.1 through 4.16 replacement of Doslib and AsmLib may
   create other problems, plus some of these compilers are 16 bit which
   will complicate package replacement further. Since these versions of
   Sage can get the date from DOS correctly, a TimeLib package can be
   modified to reformat the date without introducing the "19" error and
   this new package can be provided for an alternate acquire package to
   correct the date problem without reliance on the TimeDate, DosLib and
   AsmLib changes.

   For versions earlier than 4.1, Sage had difficulties in receiving the
   date correctly from DOS, there was an early bug in the leap year
   algorithm as well as the known CurrentDate0 formatting bug. Resolutions
   for these platforms will be more complex and should be considered on an
   as needed basis.
