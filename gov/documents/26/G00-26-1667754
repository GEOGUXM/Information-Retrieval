                             General Information

   Goals
          We are attempting to gain a better understanding of bacteria and
          plan to use this information to improve methods for disease
          prevention and treatment, and for bacterial remediation of the
          environment.

   Strategy
          We use a combined shotgun and nested deletion approach. We have
          designed and developed several plasmids which make this
          feasible.

   Nested Deletions
          A simple overview of how nested deletions are performed
