      The LAC region has experienced significant progress in recent years. A
      decade ago, USAID's programs operated amidst the debt crisis, Central
      American conflicts, cold war divisions, astronomical levels of
      inflation, a decade of declines of GDP per capita, and a decade-long
      failure of LAC countries to invest in their social and physical
      infrastructure. Throughout the region, the 1990s have brought higher
      standards of living, a return to positive economic growth rates, a
      consolidation of macro-economic reforms, and social investment that has
      yielded significant reductions in both fertility and child mortality
      rates. The shift from dictatorships to democratic governance has also
      been consolidated over the last ten years as we have witnessed
      first-time-ever transitions of power from one democratically elected
      government to another in credible and successful elections, reductions
      in human rights violations, and a strong start toward building
      inclusive, democratic institutions.

          America and the Caribbean.
