   InfoBase on Financial Privacy

   The InfoBase provides a vehicle for the prompt delivery of educational,
   reference, and introductory training material on specific topics of
   interest to field examiners. Users gain structured access to training
   and reference materials on Financial Privacy, as identified or
   developed by an FFIEC working group.

   In addition to agency policy statements, examination procedures, and
   other reference documents, the site contains multimedia training
   presentations. They are available in both Flash and QuickTime formats.
   Please note that the multimedia portion of the InfoBase requires
   additional system requirements (view recommended requirements). For
   users that can not access either of these formats, alternative PDF
   versions of the training presentations with the narration text are
   available.
