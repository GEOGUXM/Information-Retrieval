                                pSCANS Vector

   [pSCANS-BNL.gif] A new plasmid vector, pSCANS, has been constructed
   which allows rapid generation of an ordered set of nested deletions
   from either strand of a cloned DNA fragment. pSCANS is based on the
   low-copy F replicon. The size of the vector DNA has been reduced to the
   4.4-kbp range by removing the 2.5-kbp sop (stability of plasmid genes)
   region. The resulting plasmid has the low copy number typical of F
   plasmids and it remains stable enough to be easily maintained by growth
   in the presence of kanamycin, the selective antibiotic. DNA in amounts
   convenient for sequencing is readily obtained by amplification from an
   IPTG-inducible P1 lytic replicon. The vector's multiple cloning region
   (MCR), which has several unique sites for both shotgun and directional
   cloning, is flanked on one side by recognition sequences for the
   extremely rare cutting intron encoded nucleases I-CeuI and I-SceI, and
   on the other side by a recognition sequence for another intron encoded
   enzyme, PI-PspI and a nicking site for the phage f1 protein, gpII, that
   initiates f1 rolling circle DNA replication. Cleavage with the intron
   encoded enzymes leaves four-base 3' overhangs that are resistant to
   digestion with E. coli ExoIII. Between these sites and the MCR are
   recognition sites for several rare 8-base cutters that leave ExoIII
   sensitive termini. Double cutting with one intron encoded enzyme and an
   adjacent rare cutting restriction endonuclease allows for
   unidirectional 3' to 5' digestion across the insert with ExoIII.
   Alternatively, plasmid linearized with I-SceI can be blunt ended to
   produce an ExoIII sensitive end and then cut with I-CeuI to generate an
   ExoIII resistant end on one side of an insert. The f1 nicking site can
   be used for ExoIII digestion of the other strand of the insert or for
   producing single-stranded plasmid circles for library normalization or
   subtraction. After ExoIII digestion, the resulting single-stranded
   regions are digested with S1 nuclease, and the ends are repaired and
   ligated with T4 DNA polymerase and ligase. Pooling samples from several
   different ExoIII digestion time points before subsequent S1 treatment
   generates a good distribution of deletion clones following
   electroporation. Deletion clones are sized and sequenced using vector
   specific forward and reverse primers.
