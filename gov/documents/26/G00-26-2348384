     The Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs has been
     managing two facilities for veterans for over 100 years.

     The Washington Veterans Home and Washington Soldiers Home and Colony
     are facilities the residents call HOME everyday!  The Veterans Home
     in Retsil, near Port Orchard, is located in Kitsap County. The
     Soldiers Home and Colony is located in the Puyallup Valley near
     Orting, in Pierce County.

     Both homes share a common goal of providing caring and responsive
     medical and supportive care for veterans who can no longer provide
     for themselves.

     For years the department has been interested in establishing an
     Eastern Washington Veterans Home. Finally, during the 2001
     legislative session,  Gov. Gary Locke signed into law House Bill
     2227 – authorizing WDVA to operate and maintain a Veterans Home in
     Eastern Washington. The Spokane Veterans Home opened it doors on
     September 28, 2001.

   Washington Soldiers Home and Colony Washington Soldiers Home and
   Colony, located on 181 acres in the beautiful Puyallup Valley near
   Orting, serves up to 200 residents needing both skilled-nursing and
   assisted living care.

   Established in 1891, this was the first of three homes built for
   Washington state veterans.

   Washington Veterans Home In 1910 a new Veterans Home was built in

   Puget Sound and serves up to 350 residents needing both skilled-nursing
   and assisted-living care.
