  Query Tips

     Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of Excite
     for Web Servers.

     Use More Words
     The easiest way to narrow your Excite for Web Servers search and the
     first thing you should try is to simply use more words in your
     query. The greater the detail you provide, the better Excite for Web
     Servers is able to find precisely what you're looking for. Also try
     using the Query By Example
     option on the search results page.

     Use + to Require Words
     Put a plus sign (+) in front of a search word and Excite for Web
     Servers will make sure that ALL of the documents it returns contain
     the word. Example search: Travel +France.

     Use - to Exclude Words
     Put a minus sign (-) in front of a search word and Excite for Web
     Servers will make sure that NONE of the documents it returns contain
     the word. Example search: Jaguar -car -automobiles.

     Use AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT, ( )
     Excite for Web Servers supports full Boolean operators and syntax.
     You c an use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and
     parentheses ( ) for grouping . Example search: swimming AND (man OR
     woman).

     Using a Plus Sign (+) to Require Words

     What it does:
     Excite for Web Servers will make sure that ALL of the documents it
     finds include the word(s) you specify as being required.

     How to use it:
     In your search text, put a plus sign (+) in front of words that must
     be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds. Do not put a
     space between the plus sign (+) and the word. For example, to find
     documents about hockey, but only those with the term NHL in them you
     could enter:

     hockey +NHL

     What's different about it:
     Without the plus sign (+), Excite for Web Servers looks for
     documents about any of the words in your search text. Excite for Web
     Servers will rank documents that have all of the words higher, but
     will also list documents that have only some of your search words as
     well as documents that may have none of your search words, but that
     appear to be conceptually related.

     The downside:
     You may miss related documents that don't have the words you specify
     as required. For example, the search "hockey +NHL" would not include
     documents that have the words National Hockey League, but not NHL.

     Using a Minus Sign (-) to Exclude Words

     What it does:
     Excite for Web Servers will make sure that NONE of the documents it
     finds contain any word(s) you specify to exclude.

     How to do it:
     In your search text, put a minus sign (-) in front of words that
     must not be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds. Do not
     put any space between the minus sign (-) and the word. For example,
     if you want to find documents about zeppelin aircraft but not the
     rock band Led Zeppelin, you could enter: Zeppelin -Led

     What's different about it:
     Without the minus sign (-), Excite for Web Servers looks for
     documents that are conceptually-related to all the search words you
     provide, rather than looking for items to exclude from the results.

     The downside:
     It's easy to exclude too much. For example, if you were looking for
     information on greyhound dogs and not the bus company, the search
     "greyhound -bus" would exclude a document that was all about
     greyhounds, but that had the sentence "the greyhound trainers
     arrived by bus."

     Boolean Operators: AND, OR, NOT and ()

     What they do/How to use them:
     AND - Documents found must contain all words joined by the AND
     operator. Note that this is equivalent to putting a plus sign (+) in
     front of the word. For example, to find documents that have all of
     the words wizard, oz and movie, you could enter: wizard AND oz AND
     movie

     OR - Documents found must contain at least one of the words joined
     by OR. For example, to find documents that have either the words cat
     or kitten you could enter: cat OR kitten

     AND NOT - Documents found cannot contain the word after the term AND
     NOT. Note that this is equivalent to putting a minus sign (-) in
     front of the word. For example, to find documents that have the word
     pets, but not the word dogs, you could enter: pets AND NOT dogs

     ( ) - Parentheses are used to group portions of Boolean queries
     together. For example, to find documents that have the word fruit,
     and either the word banana or the word apple in them, you could
     enter: fruit AND (banana OR apple)

     What's different about it:
     Allows for excluding and requiring words, and complex combinations
     of words.

     The downside:
     It's often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include or
     exclude. You can also get unexpected results if you are not careful
     about your use of operators and parentheses. For example, the search
     bananas OR apples AND oranges is the same as the search bananas OR
     (apples AND oranges). Both queries will find documents that contain
     both apples and oranges, together with documents that contain the
     word bananas. However, the query (bananas OR apples) AND oranges is
     not the same. It will find documents containing the word oranges
     and, in the same document, either bananas or apples. Be careful out
     there!
