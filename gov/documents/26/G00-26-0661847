                        California's Energy Challenge

   California continues to experience electrical shortages that threaten
   rolling blackouts. To reduce the risk of power outages, the most
   important thing you can do is reduce your demand for electricity and
   use energy more efficiently.

   Tips for Bankers and Financial Institutions Who do Business with the
   Department of Financial Institutions:
     * Turn down lighting, especially during peak energy demand periods.
     * Cutting power saves money.
     * Support California's economy.
     * Energy efficiency is a good business practice.
     * Encourage customers to use the ATMs (automated teller machines) for
       most banking functions.
