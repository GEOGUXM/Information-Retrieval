   Two-dimensional image of a Type I Portland Cement (CCRL Cement 133).
   Colors are: red- tricalcium silicate, aqua- dicalcium silicate, green-
   tricalcium aluminate, yellow- tetracalcium aluminoferrite, pale green-
   gypsum, white- free lime, dark blue- potassium sulfate, and magenta-
   periclase. The color image was obtained by combining a set of SEM
   backscattered electron and X-ray images.

   The Building Materials Division within BFRL/NIST has formed a
   NIST/industry consortium to develop a Virtual Cement and Concrete
   Testing Laboratory (VCCTL). The goal of the consortium is to develop a
   Web-based virtual laboratory for evaluating and optimizing cement-based
   materials. Substantial savings in time, materials (purchase and
   disposal), human resources, and money can be achieved by reducing the
   number of physical concrete tests performed by private industry. The
   core of the virtual lab is a computer model for the hydration and
   microstructure development of cement-based systems that is based on 11
   years of research at NIST. Much of this research, along with other
   results generated in the NIST Partnership for High Performance Concrete
   Technology program, is described in an electronic monograph available
   at http://ciks.cbt.nist.gov/monograph. Enhancements and additions to
   the base models and WWW interface, based on the specific interests of
   the consortium members, will also be performed. Version 1.0 of the
   VCCTL is available at http://ciks.cbt.nist.gov/vcctl.

   This Figure gives an overview of the VCCTL system.

What's on this Web site

   This Web site provides background information and copies of the
   presentations relevant to the initial consortium planning meeting held
   at NIST on June 13-14, 2000, as well as copies of available software
   and relevant publications. Various demos are also available.
