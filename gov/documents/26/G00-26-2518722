   General Wage Information

   We have two primary sources of wage data - the Occupational Employment
   Statistics (OES) Survey and the California Cooperative Occupational
   Information System (CCOIS) program .

     Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Wages
   For many years, the OES survey has been a major source for detailed
       occupational employment data. In 1996, the survey was redesigned to
       include the collection of wage data by occupation. Wage data from
       this source are not available for years prior to 1996. The OES
       survey collects, on an annual basis, occupational employment and
       wage data for over 760 occupations from approximately 35,000 firms
       statewide. An overview with technical notes for the OES survey is
       available for more information.
       In addition, we have calculated the Mean Hourly Wage by
       Metropolitan Statistical Area from the 1998 OES survey.  This
       document is provided as Portable Document Format (PDF) file which
       requires Adobe Acrobat Reader to view.   If you do not already have
       the free Adobe Acrobat Reader software, download a copy for your
       computer from the Adobe website.
       The OES wage data are available for California and 25 Metropolitan
       Statistical Areas (MSA) covering 34 counties in California and five
       "Balance of State" Regions that cover the remaining 24 counties.
       These data are available here online in an HTML format (viewable
       online) or Microsoft Excel, Version 4.0, spreadsheet.

     * In addition to the above source, Labor Market Information for
       Economic Developers (LMI4ED) provides OES wage data in an
       interactive format. Users may select individual occupations of
       interest to them to produce customized tables.

   OES wages for the nation and individual states are available on the
   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics OES Homepage.

     California Cooperative Occupational Information System (CCOIS) Wages
   A cooperative partnership between EDD and local employment and training
       agencies. The CCOIS program has been implemented in all 58
       counties. Annually, each local agency selects and researches 15-40
       occupations, and surveys local employers for wages, projected
       demand, and skill requirements. The wage data from these surveys
       are published in two publications:

     * The individual local agencies produce individual area reports known
       as Occupational Outlook Reports that summarize the results of their
       research. These are available in an Adobe Acrobat format.
     * A compendium of the local CCOIS wage data published during the past
       three years in the Occupational Outlook Reports are also published
       in the Directory of California Local Area Wages.

   Note:  If you want to see all occupations for a particular area, use
   the Occupational Outlook Report. If you want to see all occupations for
   all areas, use the Directory of California Local Area Wages.

   A listing of occupations studied in 1998, 1999, and 2000 is available
   to assist you in finding an occupation or area in these two
   publications.

   Minimum Wage Information

   There is a federal and a California minimum wage. You should check with
   the agencies below to determine the appropriate wage.
     * U.S. Department of Labor (Federal): (415) 975-4510
          Website: http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/minwage/main.htm.
     * Dept of Industrial Relations (State): (415) 703-4810
          Website: California Department of Industrial Relations.

   Prevailing Wages for Government Contracts and Alien Certification

   The source for "prevailing" wage data depends upon the purpose for
   which it is needed:
     * Federal Government Contracts: For construction contracts, wages are
       part of the bid package. Contact the agency issuing the contract
       for more information. For service contracts, contact the U.S.
       Department of Labor at (202) 693-0073.
     * State and Local Government Contracts: You must use wage data
       provided by the Department of Industrial Relations in order to
       comply with their specific requirements. You can call them at (415)
       703-4774 or reach them on the Internet at http://www.dir.ca.gov.
     * Alien Certification: If you need prevailing wage information for
       preparing a H-1B visa application for alien certification (also
       referred to as a Labor Condition Application), you can use wage
       data provided by EDD's Wage Research Unit to comply with specific
       requirements. Please see the Prevailing Wage Program for Temporary
       H-1B Visas section of this website.
