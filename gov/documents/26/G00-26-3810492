                 __________________________________________

   The number of direct, international business-to-consumer transactions
   involving electronic commerce is expected to increase significantly in
   the future. Global networks have the potential to offer consumers
   substantial benefits, including convenience and access to a wide range
   of goods, services, and information at lower cost. But these benefits
   cannot be realized fully until consumers develop confidence in
   commercial activities conducted over global networks and businesses are
   assured of a stable and predictable commercial environment.
   Accordingly, the present challenge is to encourage the development of a
   global marketplace that offers safety, transparency, and legal
   certainty. The Federal Trade Commission, by seeking public comment and
   holding a public workshop, aims to facilitate an ongoing dialogue on
   how government, industry, and consumers can work together to meet this
   important challenge.
