   #972 mAdb Basic Informatics

   Description:

   Intended for new users, the lecture will introduce and demonstrate
   features of the mAdb (microArray database) system. Developed by CIT in
   collaboration with the NCI's ATC Array Facility to provide a set of
   web-based analysis tools and a data management system for storing and
   mining Gene Expression data, the system allows registered users to
   upload and then analyze microArray data from NCI/NIAID produced (or
   other supported) microArrays. Available analysis methods include a
   variety of filters and data adjustment options, hierarchical, K-means
   and SOM clustering, multi-dimensional scaling, scatter plots, logic
   comparison of results sets and statistical significance between groups.
   Datasets may also be retrieved formatted for importing into a variety
   of commercial/academic analysis packages.

   Objectives:

   Topics to be covered include
     * Overview of the mAdb system
     * Uploading images and data
     * Sharing restricted data with others
     * Analyzing data using various clustering techniques
     * Accessing clone/oligo descriptions on other systems
     * Downloading data for use in other programs

   Who should attend:

   Priority will be given to those using NCI's Advanced Technology Center
   (ATC) and NIAID microarray prints as well as to FDA CBER. Others
   interested in microarray analysis as space permits.

   Instructor(s):
