   Nuclear Science Abstracts Database

   Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) Database: NSA is a comprehensive
   collection of international nuclear science and technology literature
   for the period 1948 through 1976. It includes scientific and technical
   reports of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, U.S. Energy Research and
   Development Administration and its contractors, other agencies,
   universities, and industrial and research organizations. It is the
   precursor of the Energy Science and Technology Database. Nuclear
   Science Abstracts (NSA) Database is a comprehensive collection of
   international nuclear science and technology literature for the period
   1948 through 1976. It includes scientific and technical reports of the
   U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, U.S. Energy Research and Development
   Administration and its contractors, other agencies, universities, and
   industrial and research organizations.

   Coverage: (1946 to 1976). The entire NSA database contains 2,000,000
   records. Approximately 25% of the records in the file contain
   abstracts.

   The Energy Science and Technology Database covers energy topics from
   1976 to the present.

   Subject Coverage: All aspects of nuclear science and technology are
   covered, including:
     * Biomedical Sciences
     * Metals, Ceramics and Other Materials
     * Chemistry
     * Nuclear Materials and Waste Management
     * Environmental and Earth Sciences
     * Particle Accelerators
     * Engineering
     * Physics
     * Fusion Energy
     * Radiation Effects
     * Instrumentation
     * Reactor Technology
     * Isotope and Radiation Source Technology

   The Nuclear Science Abstracts database contains references that were
   announced in Volume 1 (1948) through Volume 33 (1976) of the printed
   version of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA). The database includes
   books, conference proceedings, papers, patents, dissertations,
   engineering drawings, and journal articles from worldwide sources.
