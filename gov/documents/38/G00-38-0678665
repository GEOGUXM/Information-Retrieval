                 [Cdismal.gif]


   A Strategic Plan is a practical guide, based upon a review of internal
   and external factors, which assists an organization in setting goals
   and allocating resources to achieve meaningful results. A Strategic
   Plan includes the Mission, Values, Vision and Goals of an organization,
   the objectives and action steps that will be required to achieve the
   goals.
   All state agencies are mandated by Government code Section 11816 to
   have in place, a strategic plan upon which their operating plans are
   based.
