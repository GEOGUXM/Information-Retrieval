   THE NOAA FEDERAL GEOGRAPHIC DATA COMMITTEE (FGDC) METADATA STANDARD

   Executive Order 12906, April 13, 1994, requires that government
   agencies use the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Metadata
   Standard (MS) to document data sets.

   The electronic manual for the Standard is "Content Standard for Digital
   Geospatial Metadata Workbook (For use with FGDC-STD-001-1998) Version
   2.0 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee May 1, 2000. It is
   available as an Adobe .PDF file at
   www.fgdc.gov/metadata/meta_workbook.html You can also access the FGDC
   home page for more information about the FGDC and the FGDC Metadata
   Standard. There are some additional NOAA-specific Usage Notes
   available.

   The FGDC Metadata Standard is modular. Some of the sections such as the
   contact information in Section 10 are repeated as applicable. For
   example, Section 10 is used in Section 1.9 for Point of Contact and
   also in 6.1 for Distributor.

   NOAA Will Now Use the FGDC Metadata Standard for Data Descriptions

   NOAA will now use the FGDC Metadata Standard to describe new data sets.
   Because of the complexity of the FGDC Metadata Standard NOAA will have
   several tools to describe data sets:

     * 1. NOAA FGDC Metadata Standard ASCII Text Character Template
       The NOAA FGDC Metadata Standard Template was developed as a
       simplified tool that can be used to describe most NOAA data sets.
       This template is based on a template developed by the NASA Global
       Change Master Directory (GCMD) team with national and international
       coordination. National coordination is with the U.S. agencies and
       international coordination is with the Committee for Earth
       Observation Satellites (CEOS) International Directory Network
       group. We corrected and modified the GCMD template for NOAA use.
       The template is available on the NOAA ESDIM home page or it can be
       obtained on PC diskette from NOAA EIS office at 301-713-0575 or
       301-713-1283.
       There are two sections:
          + A. The NOAA FGDC Metadata Standard template can be used to
            describe most NOAA data sets. NOAA FGDC Metadata Standard
            ASCII Text Template for Use with Word Processing Programs can
            be copied and used with word processors. The line numbers on
            the template refer to fields described in the FGDC Metadata
            Standard Workbook. The NOAA FGDC Metadata Template with Rules
            shows the fields and indicates if they are Mandatory,
            Optional, or Mandatory if Applicable. For legacy purposes, the
            NOAA FGDC Metadata Legacy Template shows a richer version of
            the template that includes the fields converted from NEDRES.
            Completed data descriptions should be sent to the NOAA ESDD
            office as a text file or by email to the NOAA Environmental
            Information Services Office or Peter Grimm. or Howard Diamond
          + B. The Mapping of Directory Interchange Format (DIF) to FGDC
            Metadata Standard was used to convert NOAA DIF descriptions to
            the FGDC Metadata Standard format. It shows corresponding FGDC
            Metadata Standard and DIF fields with new (non-DIF) fields
            added by NASA and NOAA.

   NOAA Participation in the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) of
   the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)

   NOAA actively participates in three ways in the Federal Geographic Data
   Committee (FGDC)of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).
   Department of Commerce employees chair three subcommittees in the areas
   of bathymetry, geodetic control, and cultural and demographic data.
   ESDIM has developed FGDC Metadata Standards for NOAA datasets. The
   NOAAServer now has over 12,000 descriptions of NOAA data sets in the
   FGDC Metadata Standard format. With the descriptions in this format,
   ESDIM has also made these descriptions available through several nodes
   in the FGDC Clearinghouse Referral Server.

   The plan, "FY-1997 National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)
   Implementation Plan for the Department of Commerce" was prepared in
   1996. Accomplishment reports for the subsequent years are available.
   The report, "1997 National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) Federal
   Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Accomplishment Report for the
   Department of Commerce" was prepared in late 1997. The report, "The
   1998 National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) Federal Geographic
   Data Committee (FGDC) Accomplishment Report for the Department of
   Commerce". The report, "The 1999 National Spatial Data Infrastructure
   (NSDI) Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Accomplishment Report
   for the Department of Commerce".

   Funding Opportunities
     * NSDI Funding Opportunities
       In order to foster more efficient use, management, and production
       of geospatial data, the NSDI offers funding opportunities. The 2001
       Funding Program is now closed.
     * NOAA Grants
       NOAA offers grants and cooperative agreements as a key piece in
       accomplishing its mission. Many grant announcements, information,
       and applications are available through the Grants Home Page

   Submitting the NOAA Data Descriptions to the NOAA EIS Office

   Data descriptions should be sent to the NOAA ESDD Office for review and
   input into the NOAA Directory. Output should be saved as an ASCII text
   file and sent on diskette or by email to the NOAA Environmental
   Information Services Office or Howard Diamond.

   Contact the NOAA Environmental Information Services Office at
   301-713-0575 or 301-713-1283 for more information and for help using
   the FGDC Metadata Standard.

   Sample NOAA Data Set Descriptions in FGDC Metadata Standard Format

   Seven NOAA data set descriptions are available as samples for your use.
   These were converted from the DIF descriptions in the NOAA
   Environmental Services Data Directory. The titles are:
     * 1. Magnetic Variation, and Daily, Monthly, Seasonal, and Annual
       Surface and Subsurface Weather for Victoria, Australia (1862-1876)
       in FGDC format and DIF format.
     * 2. Botany, Zoology, and Daily and Monthly Pressure, Temperature,
       Relative Humidity, and Surface Ozone for Austria (1863-1857) in
       FGDC format and DIF format.
     * 3. Biological, Chemical, and Hydrographic Data from the NEMP/PULSE
       Ocean Monitoring Program in FGDC format and DIF format.
     * 4. Profile Current Meter Casts in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
       NOAA Pegasus Project (1983-1986) in FGDC format and DIF format.
     * 5. Southern California Outer Continental Shelf Project (BLM):
       Intertidal Biology (Rocky/Sandy) (1975-1978) in FGDC format and DIF
       format.
     * 6. Solar X-Ray Flux Levels Measured by GOES and SMS Satellites in
       FGDC format and DIF format.
     * 7. Expendable Bathythermograph Real-time (XBPT) Data from AOML in
       FGDC format.

   More information and help using the FGDC Metadata Standard are
   available by email from the NOAA Environmental Information Services
   Office, or by telephone at 301-713-0575 or 301-713-1283.
