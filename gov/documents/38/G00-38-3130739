             Defendant Who Operated Fakegifts.com Sentenced

    COLUMBIA, South Carolina ----- United States Attorney J. STROM
 THURMOND, JR. stated today that Mark Dipadova, age 36, of California,
    was sentenced on Friday, December 14, 2001, in federal court in
 Columbia, South Carolina, for trafficking in counterfeit luxury items
  such as Rolex and Cartier watches, a violation of Title 18, United
  States Code, Section 2320. Dipadova was sentenced by Senior United
States District Judge Matthew J. Perry to 24 months in federal prison,
   to be followed by three years of supervised release. In addition,
 Dipadova was ordered to pay a total of $138,264.85 in restitution to
 the owners of the trademarks that he infringed to offset the expenses
they incurred in attempting to investigate and stop Dipadovas illegal
                               activity.

 Mark Dipadova, who also goes by Mark Voiers, James English, and Jack
    Norris; and Teresa Ford, a codefendant in the case who will be
     sentenced later, operated an Internet based business from the
Lancaster, South Carolina, area. They operated as www.fakegifts.com as
  well as under other names. During this operation, they utilized at
 least two commercial shipping services, shipping over 10,000 packages
   to domestic and foreign destinations, despite having been sued in
 federal court for their activities. The defendants acknowledged that
 they wrapped watches destined for foreign countries in aluminum foil
and hid them inside "pop-lights"  translucent battery powered lights
   that are approximately six inches in diameter  to prevent their
  detection. In the course of a two day sentencing hearing, Dipadova
   admitted that he had placed a link on the Fakegifts website to a
recording of a radio interview during which he stated that he was aware
he was violating the trademarks of companies but that he was making so
                    much money, he refused to stop.
Following the sentencing hearing, Judge Perry ordered that Dipadova be
immediately taken into custody. The government had argued that Dipadova
 was a risk of flight, in part because of the multiple identities that
                   Dipadova admitted to possessing.
   The case was investigated by agents of the United States customs
 Service. Assistant United States Attorney Dean A. Eichelberger of the
                   Columbia office handled the case.
