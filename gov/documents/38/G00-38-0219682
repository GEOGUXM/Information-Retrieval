                             About the Surfaces



   The surfaces above show models of the pressure-volume-temperature
   (left) and the viscosity-pressure-temperature behavior (right) of
   water. The temperature range is 0 to 800 °C at pressures between 0.0006
   and 40 MPa. Liquid and gaseous states are indicated by blue color,
   shaded from dark to light, respectively. Red marks the two-phase region
   where liquid and vapor coexist in phase equilibrium. Its boundaries are
   the saturated liquid and saturated vapor line which join in the
   critical point [(647.096±0.10) K, (22.064±0.032) MPa]. The projection
   of the two- phase region into the pressure-temperature plane yields the
   vapor pressure curve. The green sections of the pvT-surface represent
   parts of the solid (ice) and the vapor phase below the triple point
   [273.16 K, (611.657±0.010) Pa].

   These surfaces are the result of decades of measurements which made
   water the best characterized fluid. How can this level of accurate
   knowledge be gained for other fluids and mixtures without decades of
   measurements?

   Laesecke, A. and K. Stephan: A Database of Fluid Properties -
   Utilization for New Technologies (in German). Communications of the
   German Science Foundation (1986)1, 11-13.
