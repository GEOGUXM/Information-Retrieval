     The Project Science Team of the U.S. Space VLBI Project makes
     certain that the final scientific products of the mission(s) (the
     quasar images themselves) are of the highest quality. The process
     began long before launch, when the idea of a "united nations" of
     space VLBI radio astronomy was first conceived and organized.

     In the mission planning phase, when spacecraft design, orbits,
     tracking stations, and ground telescopes were selected, the team
     developed important software tools to simulate how well the ensemble
     could produce high-resolution images of quasars, and how such a
     cooperative effort could maintain good science return over many
     hundreds of observations. These studies allow the Project to limit
     the building and use of ground facilities to only that which is
     absolutely necessary for good image quality, and thereby saving both
     time and money while providing the highest science return.

     In the current post-launch period, the team assists guest scientists
     using the giant telescope, helps in the scheduling of observations,
     and maintains a vigorous program of scientific observations and
     theoretical studies as well.

     For the observer, the team has developed the popular FAKESAT
     observation-planning tool, and will supply detailed information on
     the schedule and progress of his or her observation. For mission
     scheduling, we have developed the sophisticated SVLBSCHED scheduling
     package. This orchestrates all the space and ground facilities
     involved in many successive observations into a single unit,
     deciding what task each piece should be doing each minute of each
     day.

     The team's program of scientific study includes the use of ground
     radio observations to understand how radio galaxies and quasars
     behave on large scales, the VSOP mission to image them with the
     highest resolution possible, and theoretical computer simulations of
     regions that still cannot be resolved (where plasma is falling into,
     and ejected away from, the black hole itself).
