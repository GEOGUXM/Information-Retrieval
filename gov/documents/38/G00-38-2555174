                                Comet Images

   [blueMarbleLine.gif]

   Due to the ever increasing number of images, the image page has been
   reorganized. Each comet now has its own sub-page.

   If you plan to republish any of the images presented on the COHP (on
   the Web, USENET, or in print), you are strongly advised to obtain
   permission from the person who took the image. My understanding of
   copyright laws is that all material is effectively copyrighted and the
   lack of a "copyright" does not void that protection. For explicitly
   copyrighted images, there is no grey area. You must obtain permission
   from the person who took the image.

Information on submitting images is provided here. (Updated 2/26/96)
