   Published Opinions
   This database contains slip opinions. Slip opinions do not necessarily
   represent the court's final decision in the case since they are subject
   to reconsideration, modification orders, editorial corrections, and
   withdrawal. The official reports advance sheets and bound volumes
   supersede the slip opinions. If you find an error, please notify the
   Reporter of Decisions at P.O. Box 40929, Olympia, WA 98504-0929; voice
   (360) 357-2090, fax: (360) 357-2099, E-Mail: reporter@courts.wa.gov

   authority.
