   Since the Space Age began in 1957, spacecraft have explored nearly
   every type of object in the solar system. Select a target from the list
   below to learn more. (Note: this site currently covers U.S. missions
   only.)

   [whitedot.gif] Mission Targets for Solar System Exploration
   [dot-blue.gif]
   [whitedot.gif] [whitedot.gif] Targets Graphic
   [bullet-blue.gif] Sun - Without our own star, life on Earth would not
   exist.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Mercury - Closest planet to the Sun, Mercury's
   daytime temperature rises to over 400 deg C (750 deg F).
   [bullet-blue.gif] Venus - Once thought to be Earth's twin, Venus is an
   uninhabitable planet due to its runaway greenhouse effect.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Earth - NASA has a whole program dedicated to
   learning more about our home planet.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Moon - Earth's only natural satellite still holds
   many puzzles.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Mars - Water may once have flowed across the now dry
   red planet.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Jupiter - Jupiter and its many moons are often
   likened to a mini-solar system.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Saturn - Saturn's ring system spans a distance nearly
   equal to the distance from the Earth to the Moon.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Uranus - Uranus spins on its side, with its
   rotational axis lying nearly in the ecliptic plane.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Neptune - Neptune is blue because methane in the
   atmosphere absorbs red wavelengths of light and reflects the blue.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Pluto - Pluto and its large moon Charon may be a
   double planet system.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Asteroids - Rocky fragments left over from the
   formation of the solar system, most asteroids orbit in a belt between
   Mars and Jupiter.
   [bullet-blue.gif] Comets - Comets may be icy remnants of our early
   solar system.

   Consider using the alphabetical or chronological list of missions
   . They link to the same mission pages that this page does, but as a
   single mission list rather than by target.

   Similarly, be sure to see the NASA Solar System Exploration Launches
   and Events Calendar. It lists important mission activities month by
   month, from 1998 through 2010. The 2011 through 2020 calendar is now
   available as well. The listed events link to the corresponding mission
   pages.

   Also, the Office of Space Science keeps a list of all space science
   missions (including missions for the Sun-Earth Connection, Structure
   and Evolution of the Universe, and Origins themes) which links to each
   mission's project homepage.

   Discovery Program
   Discovery represents the implementation of NASA's vision of planetary
   missions that are "Faster, Better, Cheaper." In the past, NASA has
   solicited independent bids for aspects of missions which were very and
   large in scope, and often cost billions of dollars. The philosophy of
   Discovery is to utilize a consortia comprised of industry, small
   businesses, and universities. The goal is to launch many smaller
   missions that do focused science with fast turn-around times and which
   cost less than $183 million to build. This new way of doing business
   attempts to streamline and downsize to meet the constraints of today's
   budgets.

   Mars Exploration Program
   NASA and JPL, together with universities, industry, and international
   partners, are currently conducting a series of robotic missions to Mars
   with the goal of understanding that planet's climate and potential for
   harboring past or present life, and laying the groundwork for future
   human missions to Mars.

   New Millennium Program
   The goal of the New Millennium Program (NMP) is to identify and test
   advanced technologies that will provide spacecraft with the
   capabilities they need in order to achieve NASA's vision. NMP benefits
   solar system exploration, astronomical missions, and Earth-observing
   missions. Through a series of deep space and Earth orbiting flights,
   NMP will demonstrate promising but risky technologies in space to prove
   that they work, paving the way for their use by new missions.
