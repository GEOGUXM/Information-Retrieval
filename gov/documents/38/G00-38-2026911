                IRIS - Radioactive Beam Physics and Experiments

Introduction

Our group is interested in testing the frontiers of particle physics theory by
performing high precision experiments at low energy. We use the nucleus as our
laboratory for examining the fundamental forces of the universe. We are
specifically studying the Weak Force, from the Electroweak Theory, through
detailed studies of Beta Decay .Our group uses two new techniques  to isolate
and examine isotopes of particular interest. We have an atom trapping
experiment  that is used to study Na-21. We are also currently developing a
Radioactive Ion Beam facility at the 88" Cyclotron. This facility allows us to
produce pure samples of radioactive isotopes for study.

How we produce radioactive beams of Oxygen-14, Nitrogen-13, and Carbon-11

We produce oxygen-14 by bombarding a solid carbon target with helium-3. The
helium-3 is accelerated by the 88" Cyclotron to 20 MeV with an intensity of 10
uA.

  Experiments of Current Interest

     The CVC Hypothesis
     The Oxygen-14 Branching Ratio

  Current Results and Status

  We can presently create beams of oxygen-14 with an intensity of 3.5 million
  atoms per second and nitrogen-13 with an intensity of 3.0 million atoms per
  second. So far we have not taken the time to examine the carbon-11 beam
  intensity. Updated February 26, 2000 JTB.

  Open Source Programs for General Use

  C++ code for data acquisition using ROOT and a CVC crate controller.
