   SUBJECT:     Transmittal Memorandum for Operations Manual Issuance
   78-23

   TO:                 All Holders of Operations Manual

   1.    Material Transmitted:

   Entire Revised WSOM Chapter D-36, International Aviation Service
   Arrangements.

   2. Summary:

   We've rewritten the entire chapter. Major changes include:

   a. Updated listings of meteorological offices serving International
   Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regular and alternate airports and
   the meteorological services available at those airports (exhibits
   D-36-1 and D-36-2).

   b. Updated listings (headings and contents) of terminal and area
   forecasts stored in the Kansas City Weather Message Switching Center
   (WMSC) computer to serve international flights (appendices B, C, and
   E).

   c. Additional area forecasts -- from New Zealand, Fiji, Peru, Brazil,
   and Argentina-- shown as stored in the WMSC (appendix E).

   d. Deletion of the separately issued appendix A to chapter D-36. Its
   data listings are now included as appendices to the main chapter
   (appendices B, C, D, E, F, and G).

   e. Revision of the chapter to conform with current standards and
   recommended practices of ICAO, as given by the new eighth edition of
   ICAO Annex 3. Among other changes, the new annex calls for required
   meteorological services to be stated by ICAO instead of calling for the
   operation of Class I, II, and III meteorological offices as a way of
   stating requirements (exhibit D-36-1).

   3. Effect on Other Instructions:

   This issuance supersedes WSOM Chapter D-36, Issuance 75-2, dated
   January 23, 1975; OMl Issuances 7-77, 9-77, and 11-77, dated July 15,
   1977, September 16, 1977, and November 7, 1977, respectively; appendix
   A to chapter D-36, Issuance 75-12, dated June 5, 1975, Issuance 75-28,
   dated December 29, 1975, and Issuance 76-19, dated August 6, 1976.

   1.     Purpose. This chapter shows regional headquarters and field
   offices how to meet valid international aviation meteorological (MET)
   requirements.

   2.     General. The United States, as a Contracting State in the
   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is responsible for
   providing MET service to international flights departing from or bound
   for airports in its territory or otherwise traversing the airspace over
   its territory. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for providing or
   arranging for the provision of this service. He is also responsible for
   making any arrangements with foreign MET services which are needed in
   connection with the provision of service.

   International air service is air service which passes through the
   airspace over the territory of more than one country, while domestic
   air service is air service which passes through the airspace over only
   one country.

   However, flights between the conterminous United States and Hawaii,
   Alaska, Puerto Rico, any United States overseas possession, or Pacific
   Trust Territory (or any two of the last mentioned five), although
   formally classed as domestic flights, are provided with international
   type documentation. Flights between the conterminous United States and
   Canada which originate in either country and terminate in the other,
   though formally classed as international flights, normally receive, by
   agreement with Canada, domestic-type service and briefings. Flights
   originating in the United States that overfly Canada, or which are
   scheduled to make an intermediate stop only in Canada before continuing
   to a destination outside Canada, are entitled to receive
   international-type documentation. A flight between two points in the
   conterminous United States that originated outside the conterminous
   United States or will terminate at a destination outside the
   conterminous United States is entitled to receive international-type
   documentation, on request, for the route segment between the two points
   in the conterminous United States; otherwise, domestic-type service and
   briefing will be provided.

   2.1     Correspondence with Foreign MET Services. Correspondence
   regarding service to international aviation will be conducted according
   to the following precepts.

   a. The Administrator of NOAA is responsible for correspondence with
   directors of foreign MET services. The Director, National Weather
   Service (NWS), has been delegated the authority, however, to correspond
   directly with directors of foreign MET services on operational matters
   covered by existing policy.

   b. In an urgent case, dealing with operational matters covered by
   existing policy, any of these five people may contact others having
   comparable functions and status in foreign MET services: the Director,
   National Meteorological Center (NMC); the Director, National Hurricane
   Center (NHC); or Meteorologists in Charge of the Honolulu, San
   Francisco, or San Juan forecast offices. Contact is normally by
   telecommunications means. Tell Weather Service Headquarters (W116x2)
   and regional headquarters, as soon as possible, about any such
   correspondence.

   c. Remember, the Administrator of NOAA is responsible for final
   arrangements with foreign MET services. Arrangements that could
   prejudice final approval should not be made at the field level.

   3.     Organization of MET Service. ICAO designates (in Air Navigation
   Plans) Area Forecast Centers (AFC's) and Meteorological Watch Offices
   (MWO's). There is one U.S. AFC (the National Meteorological Center).
   There are six U.S. MWO's (New York, San Juan, Miami, San Francisco,
   Anchorage, and Honolulu). AFC and MWO functions and the functions of
   aerodrome and other meteorological offices are described by ICAO Annex
   3, chapter 3. Certain required meteorological services, such as
   briefing or flight documentation or both, are stated by ICAO, but the
   methods and means of meeting the required services are determined by
   the Meteorological Authority designated by the ICAO Contracting State.

   4.     Services Provided. The recommended procedures for providing MET
   services to international air navigation are contained in five basic
   ICAO documents.

   a. Annex 3, Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation,
   prescribes the basic MET obligations of ICAO Contracting States in
   serving international air navigation and presents the detailed
   procedures and guidance considered desirable for uniform fulfillment of
   the basic obligations.

   b. Regional Supplementary Procedures, Doc. 7030, takes account of the
   different operating conditions encountered in various parts of the
   world.

   c. Air Navigation Plans now include many of the regional procedures
   developed by Regional Air Navigation meetings,

   d. Location Indicators, Doc. 7910, contains a list of location
   indicators for geographical locations throughout the world.

   e. PANS-ICAO Abbreviations and Codes, Doc. 8400, contains abbreviations
   and codes approved for worldwide use in the international aeronautical
   telecommunication service and in aeronautical documents.

   Offices at regular ICAO international aerodromes (exhibit D-36-1) are
   obligated to provide service in accordance with ICAO procedures.
   Offices located at ICAO alternate international aerodromes (exhibit
   D-36-2) or at other than ICAO international airports are not required
   to follow the same procedures in providing service for international
   aviation; however, they should provide whatever service data and work
   force limitations will allow. Service for international aviation
   consists basically of operational planning information, briefing,
   documentation, area MET watch, and issuance of SIGMET information.

   Keep in mind that not all users of the plain language forecasts (FACA,
   FAPA, FANT) use English as a native language. It is mandatory,
   therefore, that you take all contractions and/or abbreviations used in
   these forecasts, and in SIGMET's prepared for international use, from
   the ICAO-approved list in exhibit D-36-3. SPELL OUT all other words in
   the forecast.

   4.1     Definition of Unique Terms. Certain terms have unique
   definitions when they apply to service to international aviation. These
   are:

   a. "Requirement" is a valid need, not necessarily something the U.S. is
   required to provide. Paragraph 2.1.3 of Annex 3 is applicable.

   b. "Provide" is used solely in connection with the provision of
   service, including copies of appropriate forecasts; i.e., flight
   documentation.

   c. "Issue" is used solely with cases where the obligation specifically
   extends to sending out the MET information.

   [d363.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/D363.GIF
     __________________________________________________________________

   d. "Make available" is used solely with cases where the obligation ends
   with making the information accessible in the meteorological office.

   e. "Supply" is used solely in cases where either c. or d.applies.

   4.2     Preflight Planning Information and Flight Documentation. This
   is the main meteorological service provided for a departing aircraft.
   This service often encompasses the information for both preflight
   planning and crew documentation. As a rule, the service consists of
   sets of copies of appropriate facsimile charts and aerodrome forecasts,
   selected according to the type of aircraft and the route to be flown.
   For low-level flights in the Caribbean area, the eastern Pacific and
   the North Atlantic copies of teleprinter data are provided, partly or
   entirely, in place of charts. Service for preflight planning should be
   provided as soon as the data become available but not later, if
   possible, than 3 hours before departure. Service for crew documentation
   only should be provided as shortly before departure as practicable.
   Service for both preflight planning and crew documentation should be
   updated, if later forecasts are available, either by the provision of
   new information in hard-copy form or by briefing, consultation, and/or
   display, as appropriate to the functions of the responsible office.
   Provide chart documentation with valid time(s) as close as possible to
   the mid-point time of a flight and the most recent TAF's available that
   are valid for the estimated time of arrival.

   a. Chart Selection. The route to be flown determines the type of
   projection most suitable to the needs of the flight. A flight entirely
   within the tropics should normally be provided with Mercator charts.
   One entirely within middle and/or high latitude regions should normally
   be provided with Polar Stereographic charts. A flight traversing both
   the tropics and the extratropics should normally be provided charts on
   the projection most suitable to the ma;or portion of the route. There
   are some flights, however, which must be documented with charts on both
   projections (such as Anchorage Honolulu flights). With the preceding in
   mind and considering also the type of aircraft to be flown, the
   following selection of charts is suggested.

   Aircraft Type Chart Selection   Tropics Chart Selection Extratropics
   Piston  700 mb and/or
   500 mb; Sig Wx
   (Sfc to 400 mb) Same
   Turbo-prop 500 mb; 300 mb;Sig
   Wx (Sfc to 400 mb) Same, except 250 mb
   in place of 300 mb
   Subsonic jet 300 mb; 200 mb; SigWx
   (400 to 150 or 70 mb) 250 mb; T-VWS; Sig Wx
   (400 to 150 or 70 mb)
   Long range Subsonic jet Same as normal range subsonic jet, plus a 150
   mb chart
   Supersonic jet  Same as normal range subsonic jet, plus a 100 mb chart

   b. Preparation of Flight Documentation. Give the Pilot in Command (PIC)
   or the designated representative a set of flight documentation
   containing appropriate charts and aerodrome forecasts. Include copies
   of undecoded TAF's received through international exchanges, copies of
   the appropriate prog charts, and WS Form D-6, Key to International
   Documentation. For low-level flights in the Caribbean area and over the
   eastern Pacific, give copies of plain language forecasts (FACA's and
   FAPA's) and appropriate terminal forecasts, as well as a WS Form D-6.
   An aerodrome forecast (and amendments) used in providing MET service
   for international flights is normally the forecast for the aerodrome
   provided by the country/ state in which the aerodrome is located. If
   you can't get such a forecast, try to get a provisional forecast; or if
   the office is a WSFO, it may prepare a provisional forecast. (See WSOM
   Chapter D-37, International Aviation Aerodrome Forecasts for guidance.)
   If you use a provisional forecast, write the word "Provisional" next to
   it on the copy of the TAF you give to the PIC or the operator's local
   representative (OLR).

   c. General Guidance on Chart and Other Data Selection. Offices that
   provide preflight planning information and/or flight documentation
   service should provide the charts and other data to the OLR or the PIC
   to include any or all of the following.

   (1) A statement of the general synoptic situation --usually a copy of
   the appropriate combination significant weather (SIGWX)-surface prog
   chart(s), or significant weather teleprinter bulletins -- is enough.

   (2) Copies of applicable aerodrome forecasts, including those for
   destination airport and alternates, departure airport and alternates,
   and en route alternates. You may use TAF's, aviation symbolic terminal
   forecasts (such as FT) or the Caribbean-type plain language aerodrome
   forecasts (such as contained in the FTCA).

   (3) Forecasts of winds, temperatures aloft, and tropopause topography.
   Usually copies of the appropriate constant pressure and/or
   tropopause-vertical wind shear (TVWS) charts, or copies of appropriate
   bulletins of grid-point winds and temperatures, are enough.

   (4) Appropriate predeparture amendments to the flight and aerodrome
   forecasts, to include copies of any applicable SIGMET's (and any AIREP
   specials for which SIGMET's have not been issued) received before
   pickup of the flight documentation. If agreed upon locally, enter
   applicable SIGMET information directly onto a documentation chart
   instead of furnishing copies of the SIGMET's.

   (5) Preflight planning information also includes the provision of MET
   data in digital form for computer flight planning. This is described in
   WSOM Chapter D-32, Aviation Digital Forecasts. NMC makes these
   forecasts available twice daily.

   Give assistance as necessary in explaining the forecasts or refer the
   OLR or PIC to an appropriate office for assistance.

   d. Reproduction and Quality of Facsimile Charts. Some operators prefer
   to make their own documentation from data received from their own drops
   on facsimile or teletypewriter circuits. Operators who don't have these
   drops may arrange for this service with others.

   Stations should have suitable reproduction equipment for chart or
   forecast duplication. Stations without such equipment should advise
   their regional headquarters and made needed arrangements. Charts
   reproduced for international flights are at NWS expense. Charts
   reproduced for domestic flights are at the operator's expense.

   Charts provided to operators should be legible over at least 95 percent
   of their area. If your charts should fail to be up to this level of
   quality at any time, make every effort to remedy the deficiency as
   quickly as possible. If local efforts do not resolve the problem,
   advise your regional headquarters and ask for an urgent solution to the
   problem.

   4.3     Operational Planning for Aircraft in Flight. Give this
   information upon request. It should consist of any or all of the
   following, relevant to the flight in progress: (1) available routine
   and special reports, (2) aerodrome forecasts and amendments, (3)
   landing forecasts, (4) SIGMET's and appropriate special AIREP's, and
   (5) upper-air information. The operator is obligated to notify the
   appropriate MET office in advance, preferably before departure, of the
   requirement for en route service, so the forecast can be ready before
   requirement time. You can provide this service by making copies of the
   latest terminal forecasts and upper wind and temperature forecasts
   including amendments (in chart or grid-point form) available to the OLR
   who will determine the operational significance of the later forecast
   information and relay the information to the aircraft. (A somewhat
   different procedure, developed specifically for serving aircraft in
   flight in the Pacific area,is described in WSOM Chapter D-35.)

   4.4     Briefing and Display. An international aviation briefing is
   about the same as a domestic one. Briefing displays for offices
   regularly serving international aviation should include selected charts
   from the appropriate facsimile circuit and TAF's, in addition to hourly
   and special reports and forecasts and other data (such as SIGMET's,
   PIREP's, AIREP's, and satellite data) normally displayed for domestic
   briefings. The type and number of additional charts, other data, and
   forecasts to be displayed will depend on the routes and altitudes for
   which briefings are provided. No one shall actually revise a chart or
   forecast received from the AFC. However, if the forecaster or briefer
   believes the weather en route or at the destination will be different
   from that forecast, he is obligated to tell the flight crew or OLR
   about the difference and must make a note of the expected difference
   for record purposes.

   Sometimes amendments or SIGMET's may come out after you've handed out
   the flight documentation and before aircraft takeoff. Give copies of
   them to the OLR to pass on to the PIC. You should have a local
   agreement specifying whether the amendments will be "issued" to the OLR
   or "made available" to the OLR, as described in subsection 4.1.

   4.5     Retention of Weather Documentation Materials. NOAA directives
   require retention of forecast records for a period of 5 years: the
   first 3 years on station and the last 2 years either on station or the
   nearest regional Federal Archives and Records Center. These records
   include papers under such titles as forecasts, warnings, advisories,
   bulletins, alerts, watches, outlooks, summaries, and statements on
   anticipated atmospheric and hydrologic conditions.

   All offices that prepare operational forecast charts (original) for
   flight planning and/or prepare aerodrome forecasts (originals) shall
   comply with this requirement. Stations only providing (assembling)
   documentation materials don't have to retain file copies of
   documentation materials provided. However, documenting stations shall
   maintain a log of all documentations furnished. Retain the log on
   station for at least 5 years. Items that should be on the log are: (1)
   datetime, (2) airline flight number, (3) documentation material
   provided, including the valid time of charts and valid period of TAF's.

   5.     Requests for Service.

   5.1 Special Precautions Regarding Requests for Service. Send individual
   requests for service to regional headquarters for coordination with WS
   Headquarters (Attn: W116x2), especially when they involve new service,
   priority of existing service, or work force considerations.

   5.2     NWS Policy on the Provision of Weather Data for Centralized
   Dispatch. Our policy is to provide MET service at the airport of
   departure. This conforms with ICAO Standards and Procedures. If the
   operator wants the information at another location, make it available
   to the OLR wherever it exists in the NWS system. He can relay it to the
   central dispatch office at his expense. This is in agreement with the
   principle established at the Third Air Navigation Conference, Part VII,
   section 4, paragraph 4.4.2.2(b), as follows:

   "When the arrangements made in accordance with 4.4.2(a) do not meet
   completely the requirements of the OLR, they should be supplemented by
   the transmission to him of the necessary additional information from
   the OLR associated with the Meteorological Office at which the
   information is normally available...."

   The Third Air Navigation Conference established this principle in
   recognition of the communications problems which would result if we
   used government circuits to transmit all information asked for to
   wherever it's wanted for centralized operations control/dispatch
   services.

   5.3     At Airport Meteorological Offices Designated to Provide
   International Service. Offices located at regular international
   aerodromes (exhibit D-36-1) are designated to provide international
   service. According to ICAO Annex 3, the operator is required to state
   his meteorological service requirements to the MET Authority or MET
   office(s) concerned. If you get service requests for new routes or
   operations or planned nonscheduled operations, provide the service if
   the required forecasts are reasonably available, including through the
   Weather Message Switching Center (WMSC). If it's an unusual flight,
   requiring special arrangements, forward details through your regional
   headquarters to WS Headquarters (W116), with suggestions for providing
   the service. Don't make any final commitment in such instances until
   approved by WS Headquarters. The operator should give reasonable
   advance notice: as much as a full month if special communications or
   forecast service arrangements must be made and not less than 2 months
   if coordination with a foreign meteorological service is required. When
   lead time before operations begin is not in accordance with the
   preceding, the office concerned should either:

   a. provide the service requested, if at all possible, until WS
   Headquarters gives approval of the service arrangement or an alternate
   plan; or

   b. advise the operator that you can't provide the service because of
   insufficient advance notice. (This is rather drastic; do it only if
   absolutely necessary.)

   5.4     At Airport Meteorological Offices Not Designated to Provide
   International Service. Stations other than those at regular
   international aerodromes sometimes get requests for service for
   international flights. They generally get such requests on short
   notice. The requests require an immediate decision. Although such
   stations have no legal obligation to do so, they should try to help the
   pilot get the service. This service doesn't have to be according to
   ICAO Annex 3. Here are some possible courses of action.

   a. The simplest thing is to suggest the flight, operate as a domestic
   flight to a regular international airport where international MET
   service is available.

   (1)    Flights across the Atlantic: suggest Baltimore, Boston, Chicago,
   Detroit, Miami, New York/Kennedy, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, or
   Washington (Dulles).

   (2)    Flights to Mexico, Caribbean, Central or South America: suggest
   Los Angeles, New Orleans, Houston, Miami, or Dallas (Dallas-Ft. Worth
   Regional).

   (3)    Flights across the Pacific: suggest Seattle (Seattle-Tacoma),
   San Francisco, or Los Angeles.

   b. If the flight is nonstop to a point outside the United States
   (except Alaska and Hawaii) or Canada, there are two alternatives.

   (1) If you get the request for MET service at least 24 hours before
   proposed departure time:

   (a) the WSO's should send a message by request/ reply to the WMSC and
   ask for the appropriate grid-point wind and temperature bulletins,
   TAF's, and plain language significant weather bulletins. FAA Handbook
   7110.10D, Part II, Chapter 7, Section 1, tells how to make a request
   message. When you get the forecasts, you can either use them to brief
   the pilot or give them to the OLR, as received, for the pilot's own
   use.

   (b) the WSFO's should either use the bulletins they get routinely, or
   get the needed bulletins by request message over WMSC dedicated
   circuits.

   (2) If you get the request less than 24 hours before proposed departure
   time:

   (a) if there's time, use the teleprinter procedures described before to
   get the information.

   (b) if there isn't time, ask the PIC to contact the nearest airport
   station designated to provide international service. The call will have
   to be at the PIC's expense.

   6.     Aircraft Observations. ICAO procedures require aircraft
   observations be recorded on the AIREP form. WS Form D-8, AIREP Flight
   Log, is a copy of the essential features of the AIREP form, ICAO Model
   AR.

   6.1     Stocking and Issue of AIREP Flight Log. The Central Logistics
   Supply Center, Kansas City, Missouri, stocks WS Form D-8 in quantities
   needed by offices that provide flight documentation and/or briefing for
   international aviation. Most air carriers supply their own AIREP forms,
   so the demand for our form may be small. Nevertheless, offices serving
   international aviation should have a supply available in case of need.
   Aircraft observations are a very important data source, especially in
   data-sparse areas, so the need for a supply of AIREP Flight Logs is
   obvious.

   6.2     Collection and Disposition of AIREP Forms. Offices located at
   airports where international flights operate should collect completed
   AIREP forms -- either WS Form D-8, a form issued by an air carrier or
   an AIREP form issued by another government -- and forward them the
   first of each month to the National Climatic Center, Asheville, N.C.

              How toget TAF's that are Missing or not Routinely
                Received at Regular International Aerodromes.

   1. If the TAF is sent routinely to your office, but the latest forecast
   is missing, you should try to get the forecast through request/ reply
   from the Kansas City switch (WMSC). You can't get a single TAF this
   way, but must request the entire bulletin. Appendix B lists TAF's by
   city name and shows what bulletin they're in. Appendix C lists TAF's by
   bulletin heading, so you can see what other TAF's you'll get. The
   request/reply procedure is in the Flight Service Handbook 7110.10D,
   Part II, Chapter 7-, Section 1. Send the request message using the "RC"
   message format. If you get a negative response (NO RPRT AVBL), send an
   addressed message to Suitland (KWBCYM) via Service B or AFTN, if
   available.

   GG KWBCYM  (Priority and Suitland address)
   141500 KDTWYM  (Date/time group and requesting office address)
   FTIY31 LIIB NOT RCVD CIRCUIT 8286.  TAF FOR LIFR URGENTLY REQUIRED.

   2. If the TAF is not sent routinely to your office but is being sent
   routinely to Suitland (those TAF's listed in Appendix B), use the
   request/reply procedure described in the first example. If you get
   either a "NO RPRT AVBL" or "NOT IN SYS" response, send an addressed
   message to Suitland (KWBCYM) via Service B or AFTN, if available. Use
   this format.

   141500 KDTWYM

   PLEASE SEND LAmanual TAF FOR EDDF IN FTDL31 EDZO FOR SPECIAL RQST.

   3. If the TAF isn't sent routinely to Suitland, send message via
   Service B or AFTN, if available, to Suitland asking them to get it for
   you. They'll contact the foreign office making the TAF. If it's
   available, it will be sent to Suitland, and Suitland will forward it to
   you. Use the format in this example.
