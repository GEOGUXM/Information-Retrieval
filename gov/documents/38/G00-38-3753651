   IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   CIRCUIT Nos. 00-5212 MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant, v.
   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellees. Nos. 00-5213 MICROSOFT
   CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant, v. STATE OF NEW YORK, et al.,
   Plaintiff-Appellees. __________________ ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED
   STATES OF DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   __________________ REPLY OF LEE A. HOLLAAR TO MICROSOFT'S RESPONSE TO
   MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO PARTICIPATE AS AMICI CURIAE Microsoft objects to
   my motion to participate at amicus for a number of reasons, which I
   address here. Microsoft correctly states that "the record is not open
   to supplementation with Mr. Hollaar's personal views about the design
   of Windows 95 and Windows 98." I completely agree that such a
   submission would be improper, but I do not intend to provide my
   personal views on the design of Windows in my brief. In my motion where
   I indicated that I was the only technical expert for the plaintiffs in
   Caldera and Bristol, I was simply indicating to the Court that I have a
   background different from others who might ask to participate as
   amicus. Instead, I plan to address the technical realities of software
   integration, applicable not only to Microsoft Windows but to software
   in general, which will be critically relevant in this Court's
   resolution of some of the legal issues presented in this case. I have
   thought a great deal on this matter while working on Caldera , and am
   concerned that the decision of the Court might not rest on a sound
   technical foundation if the matters that I plan to address in my brief
   are not brought to the Court's attention. Microsoft claims that I have
   apparently forgotten that he became acquainted with the source code of
   Microsoft's operating systems in the Caldera and Bristol cases pursuant
   to protective orders that strictly prohibit him from using that
   knowledge for any purpose other than preparing his testimony in those
   cases. The source code for Microsoft's operating systems is extremely
   valuable intellectual property, and Mr. Hollaar's willingness to breach
   obligations imposed on him by other federal courts to preserve its
   confidentiality should not be continanced. Let me assure the Court that
   I take my obligations under the protective orders issued in Caldera and
   Bristol very seriously, and would do nothing in the filing of my brief
   to violate 2 those obligations. To the extent that I comment on
   anything related to those two cases, it would be from the
   publicly-available record and not from any confidential information I
   received as an expert in those cases. I find Microsoft's claim that I
   am willing to breach my obligations under the protective orders both
   unwarranted and insulting. There was no instance in either case where I
   did not completely protect Microsoft's information from improper
   disclosure, and there is no reason to believe that I will do so now.
   For my deposition in Bristol, I went so far as to retain separate
   counsel in case I were to be asked about something that was covered by
   the Caldera protective order. Furthermore, Microsoft's confidential
   information was returned to them by me immediately at the conclusion of
   each case and is no longer in my possession. But if Microsoft is
   concerned that my brief might contain information governed by the
   protective orders, I am willing to provide Microsoft with an advance
   copy of my brief before I show it to anyone other than attorneys
   assisting me with the brief or file it with the Court. I will remove
   any information that I obtained under the protective order that is not
   in the public record and to which Microsoft objects. Microsoft states
   that I have "made somewhat of a career of testifying against Microsoft"
   but forgets that in Caldera I was first approached by Microsoft to be
   their technical expert. I indicated to Microsoft that I had previously
   been retained by the Department of Justice in a Microsoft matter
   unrelated to both Caldera and this case. After I was contacted by
   attorneys for Caldera, on a referral by a colleague at Brigham Young
   University who was already a technical expert for Caldera, I informed
   Caldera's attorneys that before I could talk with them, I would have to
   clear it with Microsoft's attorneys because of being previously asked
   to be an expert for 3 Microsoft. I again contacted Microsoft's
   attorneys and indicated that I had been approached by Caldera's
   attorneys, and Microsoft again asked me to be their technical expert.
   In the end, both sides presented their arguments to me based on
   information based on publicly-available information. After my study of
   both arguments, including some testing of Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, I
   concluded that Caldera's position had the technical merit while
   Microsoft's did not, and I became their expert. Bristol was a case on a
   very fast trial schedule, and both Microsoft and Bristol went with the
   technical experts from the Caldera case because of our familiarity with
   the technical underpinnings of the case. In Bristol, I retained
   independent counsel to assure that I would not be providing information
   covered by the Caldera protective order to Bristol and its attorneys.
   Far from making a career of testifying against Microsoft, when I was
   approached by lawyers in the class actions against Microsoft, I
   indicated that I felt that it would be inappropriate for me to work
   with them because of the confidential Microsoft information I had
   learned in Caldera and Bristol, and that I questioned the merit of
   their claims. Microsoft also notes that the certificate of service
   attached to my motion contains information indicating that it was
   produced with the assistance of ProComp's counsel in New York. When I
   discovered that I would have to file my motion that day, rather than at
   the time of filing the brief, I first contacted an attorney in
   Washington DC who was a friend, but that attorney's firm does work for
   Microsoft in an unrelated area. It was suggested that I contact a
   mutual friend of ours, who is associated with ProComp, and he directed
   me to ProComp's counsel. ProComp's counsel assisted me in submitting my
   brief by providing a template for the 4 proper style of the brief,
   providing the proper certificate of service, and delivering it to the
   Court and the parties because there was not time for me to do it by
   express mailing. Beyond that, I have no connection with ProComp on this
   matter, and anticipate that material in my brief, having to do with
   assisting this Court in understanding the technical nature of
   integration of different software products, will not be duplicative of
   ProComp's (or any other amicus') brief. Again, because of my particular
   perspective and unique expertise surrounding the technological issues
   in this case that I believe would be helpful to the Court, I ask the
   Court for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae. Dated: October 30,
   2000 Respectfully submitted, ___________________ Dr. Lee A. Hollaar
