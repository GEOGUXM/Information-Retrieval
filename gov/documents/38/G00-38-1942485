   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is sponsoring the
   NASA Undergraduate Student Research Program (NASA-USRP), offering
   undergraduates across the United States mentored research experiences
   at the NASA Centers. Two sessions will be offered: 10 weeks during
   Summer 2002 and 15 weeks during Fall 2002.

   The NASA-USRP seeks applications from undergraduates enrolled full-time
   in an accredited U.S. college or university. Applicants must be rising
   juniors or seniors at the completion of the Spring 2002
   semester/quarter. Eligible fields of study are academic major or
   demonstrated coursework concentration in engineering, mathematics,
   computer science or physical/life sciences.

   The NASA Undergraduate Student Research Program website is maintained
   at Old Dominion University on an Internet server that resides outside
   the NASA Internet domain. To return to NASAs Education website, use
