   analysis undertaken by international trade specialists Danielle Kriz
   and Duaine Priestley from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of
   Computers and Business Equipment (Trade Development / International
   Trade Administration) in Europe in July 1999. They interviewed IT
   producers and consumers, trade associations, foreign government
   officials, and industry analysts in Brussels, Belgium; Glasgow
   (Scotland), London, and Cambridge, the United Kingdom; and Stuttgart,
   Frankfurt, and Munich, Germany. The work was actively supported by
   Department of Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)
   market specialists in the three countries. Research focused on the
   status of IT industries and markets in Europe, particularly the United
   Kingdom and Germany, with special attention paid to factors influencing
   the adoption of the Internet and e-commerce in those countries. This
   effort was carried out as part of a Department of Commerce Market
   Development Cooperator Program (MDCP) grant awarded in September 1998
   to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP), a state
   government public/private partnership to promote economic expansion
   within Virginia. The MDCP is a competitive matching grants program that
   builds public/private partnerships by providing federal assistance to
   nonprofit export multipliers such as states, trade associations, and
   chambers of commerce that are particularly effective in reaching small-
   and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). These awards help the start-up
   costs of export marketing ventures, with the Department of Commerce
   playing an enabling role. This MDCP award assists the VEDP in its
   efforts to help Northern Virginia-based IT SMEs compete
   internationally, with an initial focus on the European market. Office

   SUMMARY Western Europe, notably Germany and the United Kingdom (UK), is
   a large and quickly growing market for information technology (IT)
   products and services. In fact, Germany and the UK are the first and
   second largest IT markets in Europe, respectively. Both countries lag
   behind the United States in IT adoption and use, particularly in use of
   the Internet and electronic commerce. However, they are increasing
   their IT investments, largely due to recent deregulation of their
   telecommunications services markets and growing Internet use. They
   offer many market opportunities for small- and medium-sized U.S. IT
   firms, whose IT products and services are highly regarded and sought
   after in Western Europe. Certain Europe-wide IT-related regulations
   will affect U.S. firms' sales and business practices in any European
   Union member country. At the same time, Europe is a fragmented market.
   Each country, including Germany and the UK, has distinct market trends,
   factors of competitiveness, and opportunities in information
   technology. Industry experts interviewed in Europe in July 1999
   concurred that for U.S. IT SMEs interested in these markets, partnering
   with either a similarly minded European SME, or with a larger firm or
   systems integrator, may be one of the best routes to penetrate these
   markets. Other options include the use of agents and distributors.
   Regardless of market entry strategy, various public- and private-sector
   agencies in both Europe and the United States exist to assist U.S. SMEs
   in their market entry endeavors. Office of Computers and Business
   Equipment, USDOC, November 1999 INTRODUCTION This report provides an
   overview of the information technology (IT) industries and markets in
   Europe, with a focus on the United Kingdom and Germany. Special
   attention was paid to factors influencing the use of the Internet and
   the adoption of electronic commerce in those countries. The research
   centered on information relevant to U.S. small- and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) in the IT industry trying to enter these markets.
   Information gathered from on-site interviews is supplemented with data
   from market research firms and an extensive review of available
   literature. U.S. businesses increasingly view Western Europe as a
   single regional market that encompasses more than 370 million people
   and a gross domestic product (GDP) second only to the United States.
   Through a number of initiatives, including the implementation of the
   single monetary system, the Euro, the European Union has made
   significant strides in integrating its fifteen economies. In spite of
   integration, for a variety of reasons, including differences in levels
   of infrastructure development, macroeconomic factors, business
   cultures, and national languages, it remains a fragmented market. U.S.
   businesses are advised to pursue a single-market approach when
   considering Europe, but with a sub-regional perspective. This is
   particularly true for the information technology market. IT Spending

   technologies and products. Directives on Digital Signatures and
   Encryption (pending) The Commission has stated that it believes that
   the advantages of e-commerce cannot be fully realized in the absence of
   secure networking environments, and as such it also has begun work on a
   common framework for security issues, namely digital signatures and
   encryption. This initiative was a response in part to the announcements
   by Germany and Italy on their intention to introduce specific
   regulations on digital signatures, and the consideration by other EU
   member states of similar policies. The Commission felt that if such
   national policies were enacted, divergent legal and technical
   regulations would constitute a serious obstacle to the internal market
   and would hinder the development of new economic activities linked to
   e-commerce. Proposed Directive on Digital Signatures Work on a
   directive on digital signatures is furthest along of the two. The
   Commission published a proposal for a directive for a common framework
   for digital signatures in May 1998, with minimum rules concerning
   security and liability. The main elements of the proposed directive are
   the use of certification service providers, the liability of such
   providers for the validity of a certificate's content, and legal
   recognition of digital signatures, all within a technologically neutral
   framework. This directive is expected to be completed by the end of
   1999. 12 Office of Computers and Business Equipment, USDOC, November
