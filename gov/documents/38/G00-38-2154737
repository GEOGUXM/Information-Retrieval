   (Particle and Force) in 1961 - Largely unknown method: Goal: Eliminate
   the instabilities of mapping to the PIC Eulerian mesh. Approach: Fluid
   represented by directly interacting mass points - Newtonian dynamics of
   many bodies with fluid-like forces. * Suffered the same slowness and
   high memory costs of the PIC method. * Exhibited extreme fluctuations
   as "fluid particles" reconnect. * First of the Free-Lagrange method,
   precursor to SPH and Lattice-gas methods. FLIC (Fluid in Cell) in 1966:
   Goal: Eliminate particle fluctuations and high CPU costs associated
   with PIC. Approach: Co-located state and kinetic variables at cell
   center; compute fluxes across cell boundaries. * Exhibited classic
   instability from poorly couple pressure-momentum fields. * First method
   to use Fractional Area/Volume formulation - never expolited. k-
   Turbulence Model in 1967: Goal: Introduce an additional length/time
   scale and dissipation equation. * Used q-d because of the word
   processing at the time. ICE (Implicit Continuous-Fluid Eulerian) in
   1967, 1970: Goal: Develop an all-speed algorithm - a generalized MAC
   method. CFD Canada 6/96 Los Alamos Origins of ALE: Arbitrary
   Lagrangian-Eulerian Method First T-3 Lagrangian method (1967): LINC
   (Lagrangian Incompressible) Based on the cell volume remaining constant
   - not a zero-divergence. Original formulation plagued by p-v null space
   oscillations. Led to: * Implicit p-v solution scheme, as later used for
   MAC. * Showed necessity of automatic mesh rezoning (remapping). *
   Explored elastic-plastic strength models and surface tension. ALE
   capability was the second generation LINC development in 1974. * The
   first finite-volume formulation. * Precusor to the SALE and its progeny
   (Hirt) and FLIP (Brackbill). CFD Canada 6/96 Los Alamos Overview of the
   Early Days The T-3 style: * The focus was on the physics, not the
   mathematics. * All techniques resulted from collaboration - no titles
   used. The early days: * Almost all territory was unexplored; every
   development found an application. * Computing resourses were always a
   limiting factor. * All graphing was done by hand (on Fridays). * Each
   code was written from scratch. * By 1966, 160 groups used the T-3
   techniques and then use mushroomed. * Codes were never distributed;
   SOLA was the first (1975). Passing of an Era: 1968 was the last year
   that Harlow said he could keep up with all the CFD developments around
   the world. CFD Canada 6/96 Los Alamos Time Line of T-3 Activities

   Turbulence Spectral Models (T. Clarke and C. Zemach) Consider a
   "Two-Point" Generalization of the Reynolds Stress Tensor (for a Single
   Fluid) Rij (x1,x2,t) = u i(x1,t)u j(x2,t) Derive an exact transport
   equation via Navier-Stokes and (1) change coordinates: X = 1 (x ), r =
   x 2 1 + x2 1 - x2 (2) Fourier Transform with respect to the relative
   coordinate, r , and (3) perform angular integrations to reduce the
   vector-k space to a scalar k-space; Rij (x1,x2,t) 1 Rij (X,r,t) 2 Rij
   (X,k,t) 3 Rij (X,k,t) Result: A spectral model of the turbulent
   Reynolds stress, related to the "single-point" engineering model by
   integration over wavenumber; Rij (X,t) = R ij(X,k,t)dk = 2 E
   ij(X,k,t)dk 0 0 where the "Energy Spectrum" E(k,t) is Enn(k,t), the
   turbulent kinetic energy K(t) is K(X,t) = E(X,k,t)dk 0 * Requires no
   dissipation equation, or length-scale equation. * Permits computation
   of "non-equilibrium" turbulence. * Cost of direct numerical solution is
   much more costly than using a spectral model, which is more costly then
   using an engineering closure. Turbulence and Symmetry "A turbulent
   flow, initialized at t=0 in some arbitrary way, may relax, after some
   transient period, to a self-similar flow." The turbulence may satisfy
   the same symmetries and scalings as the governing equations, i.e., the
   Navier-Stokes Equations. Self-Similarity originates in invariance of
   the turbulence dynamics under a group of transformations, e.g.,
   space-time transformations such as (for isotropic) t = t, (time
   scaling), t = t + t0 (time translation), l = l, (length scaling).
   Consider a scaling subgroup, = ; for which an invariant solution obeys
   3 -2E(k,t) = E( - k,-t0 + (t + t0 )). This can be shown to have a
   solution of the form (Karman-Howarth) E(k,t) = K(t)L(t) f (kL(t)),
   where f( ) satisfies an auxiliary equation given by a theory, model,
   Navier- Stokes etc. Time dependencies are K(t) = K0 (1+ t / t0 )- K ,
   L(t) = L0 (1+ t / t0 ) , and K = 2 - 2 . This agrees precisely with K-
   closures and with results from (all?) spectral models for isotropic
   turbulence. Self-Similarity and Engineering Closures Assertion:
   Single-Point (Engineering) closures can be rigorously correct in the
   limit of spectral self-similarity. Consider the self-similar form for
   turbulence at high Reynolds number subjected to a homogeneous mean flow
   velocity gradient; Eij (k,t) = K(t)L(t) fij (kL(t)). In general, each
   fij is different. During free decay, (upon releasing the mean flow
   strain or shear) the spectrum tends asymptotically towards the form
   E(k,t) = K(t)L(t) f (kL(t)). and Eij (k,t) = Eij (k,t) - 1 ( ) = K (
   )L(t) f(kL(t)) 3 ijE k,t ij t where K ij (t ) = 1 R ( ) = 1 R ( ) - 1 (
   ) 2 ij k,t 2 ij k,t 3 ij Rnn k,t Simple Group analysis (and the
   spectral model) predicts the same time dependencies of Kij (t) and K(t)
   . Hence the anisotropy, given by K ( ) b ij t ij (t ) = K(t) ,
   asymptotes to a constant--Hence, No Long-Term Return to Isotropy!
   Conclusion: The detailed process of "Return Toward Isotropy" is a non-
   equilibrium process, not accurately depicted by engineering closures.
   Example: Experiment of Uberoi & Wallis (J. Fluid Mech. 24, 1979).
   Lesson: One should not ask "too much" of an engineering closure.
   Construction of Engineering Closures From Spectral Closures (1)
   Determine the appropriate similarity group for the problem class.
   -Might be an approximation. -In conjunction with direct computation of
   the spectral model, and direct numerical simulation. (2)Determine the
   self-similar form of the spectra. (3) Substitute the self-similar
   expression into the spectral model equations, and take "appropriate"
   k-space moments. "Appropriate" moments may be a product of the tastes
   of the researcher. E.G., does one want a dissipation rate equation or a
   length scale equation? (4) Model coefficients will depend on spectral
   moments and are determined by the details of the self-similar forms
   produced by the spectral model. Example: K- -bij models constructed
   from self-similar form for homogeneous mean-flow form. K-Equation K(t)

   Symmetry considerations and transformation groups within spectral
   turbulence models provide a framework to view the behavior of
   turbulence and closures without resort to ad-hoc modeling hypotheses.
   Spectral models in simulations provide a much richer picture of the
   dynamics of turbulence and mix than do engineering closures, but at a
   greater computational cost. In the limit of self-similarity (where a
   group transformation applies) engineering closures can be derived
   rigorously from spectral closures. But, "equilibrium" engineering
   closure, in a non-equilibrium world, is at best, approximate. CFD
