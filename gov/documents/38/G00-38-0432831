   NASA Strategic Plan  - This document establishes a framework for
   shaping NASA activities and developing a balanced set of priorities
   across the Agency.

   An Overview of NASA Fact Sheet  - In 1915 Congress created an
   organization that would "supervise and direct the scientific study of
   the problems of flight, with a view to their practical solutions." That
   organization, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, evolved
   into NASA four decades later when Congress formed a civilian agency to
   lead "the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere
   and space."

   NASA's Organization Fact Sheet  - NASA's organization formulates
   policy, controls the budget, and provides management oversight for
   programs conducted at nine NASA Field Centers, the contractor-operated
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Wallops Flight Facility under the
   direction of Goddard Space Flight Center. Read here for a description
   of activities at each of these facilities.

   NASA Product/Services Source List Fact Sheet  - NASA products and
   services include publications, educational programs, news, photos,
   models, souvenirs, emblems, patches, decals, t-shirts, caps, cups, NASA
   Television schedules, spacesuit information, stamps, coins, medals,
   space food, astronomy briefs, videos, maps, public interest space
   groups, and other space agencies. Information for obtaining these
   products and services can be found in this NASA online fact sheet.
