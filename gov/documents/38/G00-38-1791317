     Welcome to the Cal-Mortgage Loan Insurance Division's (Cal-Mortgage)
     Web Page.
     Cal-Mortgage is a division of the Office of Statewide Health
     Planning and Development (OSHPD).  Cal-Mortgage administers the
     California Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Program
     (Program). Under the Program, eligible health care facilities can
     borrow money for capital needs with credit enhancement provided by
     loan insurance from Cal-Mortgage.  Cal-Mortgage insured loans are
     guaranteed by the "full faith and credit" of the State of
     California.  This guarantee permits borrowers to obtain lower
     interest rates, similar to the rates received by the State of
     California.
     For more information on Cal-Mortgage see the Cal-Mortgage Brochure.
