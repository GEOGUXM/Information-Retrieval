   Functional Teams from Acquisition & Supply, Financial Management,
   Property, Research and Development Contracts, Travel, and Service and
   Supply Fund . This slide presentation explains the purpose of the NBRSS

   [bullrule.gif] Communications Plan
   [bullrule3.gif] Communications has been defined as an integrated
   approach to conveying clear, consistent and timely information to
   stakeholders who can affect the success of the NBS. Individuals must
   understand why the NIH has chosen to implement a new system, how it
   will affect their work, and what they will do to successfully
   transition to the new system.
