   Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center

Physical Resources Program

   Ted Melis, Physical Resources Program Manager.

Objectives:

   The physical resources monitoring and research program provides
   information on dynamic hydrologic and geomorphic processes that
   directly and indirectly link operations of Glen Canyon Dam with
   downstream ecosystem resources. Streamflow, sediment and their
   associated interactive processes are the three primary physical
   resource topics of concern. Although water quality is identified by
   Glen Canyon AMP stakeholders as a physical resource parameter,
   management objectives and information needs associated with water
   quality in the Colorado River ecosystem are primarily related to the
   biological program area, such as studies of primary productivity, fish
   recruitment, etc. As a result, GCMRC activities associated with water
   quality monitoring and research will be described under the biological
   program area sections.
