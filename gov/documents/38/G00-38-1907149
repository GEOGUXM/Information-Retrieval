   Run II at the Tevatron, with first collisions in March 2001, will be
   the focus of an ambitious physics program, covering a vast range of
   topics, including B physics, QCD, Electroweak physics, the study of the
   top quark and searches for the Higgs boson, supersymmetry and other new
   physics. The subjects that will be studied are at the forefront of our
   present understanding of particle physics, and continued development of
   Monte Carlo tools is a necessity for this research program.

   A Workshop on Monte Carlo Generator Physics will be held at Fermilab
   from April 18th to April 20th, 2001, to bring together experimentalists
   from CDF and D0 with theorists who are developing both general event
   generators, matrix element tools or other Monte Carlo tools. The
   workshop will focus on the present status of Monte Carlo tools,
   foreseen short- and medium term developments, and identification of
   areas of need.
