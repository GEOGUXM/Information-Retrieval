   How to use GRIN.

      We established GRIN to help journalists, publishers, educators, authors
      and the general public find high-quality historical photos. Photos were
      selected both for their historical importance and their visual impact.
          This is a large collection and understanding how to browse GRIN
      efficiently will save you a lot of time. We intend GRIN to be easy and
           fast to use, and to complement the NASA Image Exchange (NIX).

        There are numerous ways to browse GRIN. The primary methods are by
                         Subject, Search, and NASA Center.

      The Subject method is probably the most useful and straightforward way
        to browse GRIN. There are 93 separate categories of GRIN images. We
      have tried to anticipate the kinds of images that professionals and the
        public will want and divided the images into these categories. Many
          GRIN images are in more than one category. But some images are
         specifically confined to a single category for ease of searching.

      To see a brief description of what the subject categories include, see
       the Explanation of Subject Categories. Note that some categories are
         empty or nearly empty. We anticipate adding more images to these
                             categories in the future.

            The Search function is also an efficient means of locating
       imagesÑprovided that you understand how it works and use it to your
                 advantage. We suggest using the search function:
         1. if the subject you are searching for is not already one of the
                             existing subject categories;
       2. if the subject category of interest is too large for your purposes,
                                          or;
                 3. if you are looking for something very specific.

       Please note: The search function treats multiple words as if they are
         separated by "or" not as if they are separated by "and". In other
      words, typing in "lunar rover" will give you every entry with the word
       "lunar" and every entry with the word "rover", including many entries
      that contain only one of these words, such as a photo of a Mars rover.
      By placing your words in parentheses, the search engine will treat them
    as if they are separated by "and". So "(lunar rover)" will narrow the
                            search considerably.

   When using the search function, keep in mind that the more specific you
    can be, the faster you will find what you wantÑgeneral search words
    like "moon" will produce too many hits to be useful. Also, searching
   only in specific fields may be faster. In particular, searching in the
    Keywords category may be most useful, since we have already narrowed
   the search for you. Keywords can also include other helpful info, such
    as the old names of NASA centers, such as Lewis before it was renamed
                       John H. Glenn Research Center.

    The final method of searching GRIN is by using the NASA Center search
   function. Many of the images in GRIN come from some of the recent books
     produced about the NASA centers, so if you have one of these books,
    there is a good chance that the images inside are contained in GRIN.
      Some of the centers (like Stennis) only have a few dozen images,
    whereas others (like Johnson, Langley, and Kennedy Space Center) have
   hundreds, so this method will be more useful in some cases than others.
