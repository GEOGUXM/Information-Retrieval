                            Class Size Reduction

   girl Class Size Reduction for Grades K-3
   California's K-3 Class Size Reduction program was established in 1996
   to improve the educational program, especially in reading and
   mathematics, for children in kindergarten and grades one through three.
   Incentive funding is provided to participating school districts for the
   purpose of implementing an average pupil-teacher ratio of twenty to one
   in up to four grade levels.
   Morgan Hart CSR Reducing High School Class Size (Morgan-Hart Class Size
   Reduction) for Grade 9
   California's Morgan-Hart Class Size Reduction Act allocates funds to
   school districts for participating schools that reduce class size in
   Grade 9 English and one other course required for graduation (either
   Mathematics, Science, or Social Studies). The majority of pupils in
   participating classes must be identified as Grade 9 students.
   (Districts which implemented the program prior to 1997 may also be
   serving Grades 10, 11, or 12.)
   book, apple, star Federal Class Size Reduction
   The Federal Class Size Reduction program was established to improve
   educational achievement for all students, including those with special
   needs, by reducing class size to a ratio of 18 pupils per teacher.
   (California was granted a waiver to use a 20:1 ratio, in light of the
   pre-existing state level programs.) Although the focus of the program
   is on the early elementary grades, funding may be used to reduce class
   sizes in all grades (K-12). Although all school districts may
   participate, the funding formula favors school districts that serve a
   high proportion of children whose families have incomes below the
   poverty line.
