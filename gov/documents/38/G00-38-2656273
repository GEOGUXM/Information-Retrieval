                             Data Release Policy

   We currently release data in two formats. Finished sequence and
   prerelease sequence. We use the following guidelines for each type of
   sequence.

   1. We submit completed blocks of sequences to Genbank when they are
   finished and annotated. The current rules we use for finished blocks is
   as follows:
     * Blocks must be greater then 3kb
     * Each base must be sequenced on both strands
     * each base requires a quality score greater which yields errors less
       than 1 in 10,000.
     * Each block must be annotated.

   2. We also make prerelease sequence available. It is available on our
   web-site and we also submit it to the HTG region of genbank. This data
   is released as a courtesy to the scientific community. This data is
   clearly marked as prerelease. It is incomplete data and may contain
   errors or incorrect identification. Use of this data is at your own
   risk. The quality of the prerelease data in no way reflects upon the
   quality of the finished data which is described previously. If you use
   unfinished data, we ask that you follow our data usage guidelines.
