   What is the Office of Administrative Law Judges?

   The Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges is the
   "trial court" for many of the Department's programs. It is
   headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has eight District Offices.
   Judges hear cases involving a wide variety of labor-related actions,
   such as black lung benefits, longshore workers' compensation,
   immigration-related alien labor certifications and enforcement actions,
   nuclear and environmental whistleblower cases, Fair Labor Standards Act
   enforcement actions, and OFCCP civil rights actions. These are only a
   few examples. The Office of Administrative Law Judges also houses two
   appellate boards: the Board of Contract Appeals (BCA), and the Board of
   Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA). For additional information,
   see About OALJ

   OALJ is NOT affiliated with the Occupational Safety and Health Review
   Commission (OSHRC), which is an independent Federal agency created to
   decide contests of citations or penalties resulting from OSHA
   inspections of American work places; the Federal Mine Safety and Health
   Review Commission, which is an independent adjudicative agency that
   provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes
   arising under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act; the
   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which is an independent Federal
   agency created to enforce the National Labor Relations Act; or the
   Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB), which was created to hear
   and make final appellate decisions on claims of federal employees
   arising under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA).

   I have an employment-related question; can you help me?

     * General questions: The Office of Administrative Law Judges is an
       administrative court and, as such, cannot provide assistance to
       persons seeking legal advice. To find out where you can more
       appropriately direct your inquiry, you may call the general
       information phone number for the Department of Labor at (202)
       219-5000, check the contact list found on the Department of Labor
       website, or check the Department of Labor's Employment Laws
       Assistance for Workers and Small Businesses (elaws) interactive
       system, which is designed to help employers and employees
       understand and comply with numerous employment laws enforced by
       DOL. Each elaws Advisor gives advice and provides information on a
       specific law or regulation based on the user's particular
       situation. The Office of Small Business Programs also has National
       office contact information on enforcement agencies on its Small
       Business Compliance Assistance Page, and other contact information
       on its Regulatory Compliance Assistance Page. See also The U. S.
       Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy -- Laws and
       Regulations Page, which has links to information relating to small
       businesses.
     * Civil rights complaint: The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
       Commission ("EEOC"), has excellent information on filing a
       complaint at its Web site. [EEOC is not a Department of Labor
       agency, and this link will exit OALJ's web site]. If a government
       contractor is involved, the Department of Labor's Office of Federal
       Contract Compliance Programs has some overlapping jurisdiction with
       EEOC and a list of OFCCP's key personnel is found on DOL's web
       site.
     * Wage and Hour questions: The Wage and Hour Division of the
       Employment Standards Adminstration may be able to answer questions
       about some job-related questions. Its web site contains advisors on
       questions on Federal child labor rules from young workers, parents,
       teachers and employers; information for employers and employees
       regarding Federal minimum wage, overtime, child labor, and
       recordkeeping requirements; and the Family Medical and Leave Act.
       The elaws Advisor may also be helpful.
     * ERISA questions: PWBA's Division of Technical Assistance and
       Inquiries, Phone: (202) 219-8776, may be able to assist members of
       the public with technical questions relating to pension, health, or
       other benefits offered by employers and protected by ERISA, COBRA,
       and and HIPAA, (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
       Act of 1996). PWBA's Web site contains an extensive collection of
       information concerning legal rights and responsibilities relating
       to employment benefits. The elaws Advisor may also be helpful.
     * FOIA-related questions: The U.S. Department of Justice, FOIA Home
       Page has a good collection of FOIA resources. Other FOIA links can
       be found on the FOIA-page on this web site.
     * Immigration-related questions: Most aspects of immigration are
       administered by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
       The Employment and Training Administration's web site has some
       information on foreign labor certification programs. The Employment
       Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division administers
       enforcement aspects of DOL-immigration related programs.
     * Safety and Health questions: Information about contacting the
       Occupational Safety and Health Administration is found on OSHA's
       web site. The elaws Advisor may also be helpful.
                     ___________________________________

   Who are ALJs, and how are they appointed?

   The position of Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), originally called
   hearing examiner, was created by the Administrative Procedure Act of
   1946, Public Law 79-404. The Act insures fairness and due process in
   Federal agency rule making and adjudication proceedings. It provides
   those parties whose affairs are controlled or regulated by agencies of
   the Federal Government an opportunity for a formal hearing on the
   record before an impartial hearing officer. It also provides for a
   merit selection system administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel
   Management and statutory protection of the judge's decisional
   independence from undue agency influence. For more information, visit
   the OPM website.

   Since administrative law judges are employees of the agency, Congress
   was concerned that they may be perceived as being prone to making
   decisions in favor of that agency. Thus, the Administrative Procedure
   Act includes provisions that give administrative law judges protections
   from improper influences and ensure independence when conducting formal
   proceedings, interpreting the law, and applying agency regulations in
   the course of administrative hearings. Thus, administrative law judges
   are not subject to agency efficiency ratings, promotions or demotions;
   their compensation is established by the Office of Personnel Management
   independent of agency recommendations; they may only be disciplined
   after good cause is shown before the Merit Systems Protection Board
                     ___________________________________

   How can I find a lawyer?

   The Office of Administrative Law Judges is prohibited, by regulation,
   to appoint counsel or to refer parties to attorneys. 29 C.F.R. § 18.35.
   Local bar associations or similar groups offer lawyer referral
   services, usually without charge.
                     ___________________________________

   Where will my hearing take place?

   Department of Labor administrative law judges "ride the circuit." Thus,
   hearings locations are selected with due regard for the convenience of
   the parties and the witnesses. See 29 C.F.R. § 18.27(c). Moreover, some
   statutes and regulations provide specific requirements for locations of
   hearings near the claimant's or complainant's residence. See, e.g., 20
   C.F.R. § 725.453A (location of black lung hearings), 29 C.F.R. §
   24.6(c) (location of whistleblower hearings).
                     ___________________________________

   When will a decision be reached in my case?

   OALJ attempts to handle all cases in an expeditious manner. Some case
   types are required by statute or regulation to be handled on an
   expedited basis, and they will generally be accorded first priority.

   Litigants should keep in mind that judges have many duties in addition
   to deciding cases. Judges have a large number of newly filed cases to
   contend with each year. In addition to hearings, judges conduct
   prehearing conferences, settlement conferences, motions hearings, write
   orders and opinions, and consider other court matters both in the
   hearing room and in their chambers.

   Cases may be delayed for a variety of reasons. For example, attorneys
   and/or litigants request continuances, settlement negotiations may be
   in progress, a litigant may become subject to bankuptcy proceedings, or
   a stay may be ordered by a federal court. Some case loads are heavier
   than the number of available judges. Finally, DOL judges generally
   travel to conduct hearings in a suitable location. If the location is
   not in an area where judge's frequently appear, the scheduling of a
   hearing may be delayed.
                     ___________________________________

   How can I check on the status of my case?

   Your lawyer, who likely is familiar with practice before the agency, is
   your best resource.

   If you do call the court, please have available the specific case name
   or docket number. Contact Information.
                     ___________________________________

   Did OALJ receive my filing?

   You should contact the presiding judge's office or the Docket section
   to confirm receipt of a filing. Contact Information.
                     ___________________________________

   What is my case number?

   When a case is docketed before the Office of Administrative Law Judges,
   a case number is assigned. The number will appear on documents you
   receive from this office.

   It looks something like this: 1999-BLA-998 or 1998-INA-795 or
   1987-DBA-250, etc. The first four numbers represent the Fiscal Year in
   which the case was docketed. The three letters inside the hyphens are
   an indicator of the case type. For example, the samples above would be
   Black Lung Benefits Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, and
   Davis-Bacon Act cases respectively. The final numbers represent the
   sequential number of the case in that fiscal year. For example,
   1999-BLA-998 would be the 998th black lung case docketed in Fiscal Year
   1999.

   If you have lost the case number, you may contact the presiding judge's
   office or the Docket section in Washington, and they will look up the
   number. Contact Information.

   Please note that other agencies and Boards within the Department may
   use different case numbers.
                     ___________________________________

   Can I review the case file?

   Your lawyer should have copies of all documents filed with the
   administrative law judge, and should be able to assist you in viewing
   those documents.

   Generally, all documents filed with an administrative law judge are
   public records and are available at the presiding judge's office, or if
   the case is not yet assigned, through the clerk's office. By way of
   exception, some documents are sealed by special court order, and some
   documents are confidential by operation of law, such as trade secrets
   and confidential financial or commercial information.

   Before OALJ can permit a viewing of a case file, the file must be
   reviewed to prevent disclosure of any non-public information. Thus, you
   must make an appointment to review a file.

   Fees are assessed in accordance with the Department of Labor's Freedom
   of Information Act regulations at 29 C.F.R. Part 70.
                     ___________________________________

   How are judges assigned to cases?

   The Administrative Procedure Act requires that administrative law
   judges "shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable."
   5 U.S.C. § 3105. This provision does not require mere mechanical
   rotation. Rather, a "modicum of discretion" is accorded in assignment
   decisions. Factors such as the complexity of the case as well as the
   experience and ability of the judge, may be considered when case
   assignments are made. Also relevant is the particular judge's caseload
   and assignment schedule.
                     ___________________________________

   Will I be contacted when a presiding judge is assigned to my case?

   You may not be notified on the date that a presiding judge is assigned;
   however, that judge generally will contact the parties shortly after
   his or her assignment to begin processing of the case.

   Please note that in ERISA cases, you are required to take affirmative
   action to file an "answer." You should not wait for a contact from OALJ
   before filing this answer. Information on ERISA cases under OALJ's
   jurisdiction is found at OALJ's Law Library ERISA Directory.
                     ___________________________________

   How do I file a complaint against a judges?

   Any motion for recusal and reassignment of an judge should be filed, at
   least initially, with the presiding judge. See Stephenson v. National
   Aeronautics & Space Administration, 1994-TSC-5 (Sec'y Dec. 13, 1995).

   Any person alleging that an administrative law judge has engaged in
   conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of
   the business of the OALJ, or that the judge cannot discharge all the
   duties of the office because of physical or mental disability, may file
   a complaint with the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The complaint
   process is not intended to address complaints on frivolous matters, or
   issues related to the merits of a case or a judges' decision.
   Disagreements with the judge's rulings are more properly addressed to
   the appropriate appellate body, ususally the Benefits Review Board in
   black lung and longshore cases, and the Administrative Review Board in
   other types of cases.
                     ___________________________________

   What rules of practice and procedure will apply to my case?

   Generally, proceedings before OALJ are governed by the Rules of
   Practice and Procedure in Administrative Hearings Before the Office of
   Administrative Law Judges, 29 C.F.R. Part 18. These rules, however,
   yield to rules of special application, that is, to rules dealing with
   special program requirements. For instance, when a program regulation
   instructs a party to file a document within a certain number of
   "calendar" days, the general Part 18 rule that adds days for mailing is
   not applicable. When Part 18 or a rule of special application does not
   provide for the situation, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
   generally apply.
                     ___________________________________

   On whom do I file and serve copies of filings?

   The rules governing service generally are found at 29 C.F.R. § 18.3.
   You should check the regulations governing procedure on your specific
   case type, however, because some rules may vary slightly from the
   section 18.3 requirements.

   You should file a copy of all documents with the presiding judge,
   except that it is generally not necessary to file routine discovery
   documents with OALJ. All parties to the case should be served in
   accordance with the applicable rules. See, e.g., § 18.3(b).
                     ___________________________________

   Can I file by fax or e-mail?

   The rule governing filing by fax is found at 29 C.F.R. § 18.3(f).
   Generally, you may file by fax if explicitly permitted to do so by
   statute or regulation, or if you have received prior permission from
   the presiding judge. OALJ does not presently accept filings by e-mail.
                     ___________________________________

   How do I obtain a subpoena?

   To obtain a subpoena, follow the procedures stated on the Subpoena
   Page. Please note that OALJ subpoenas may only be used in cases before
   the United States Department of Labor in which OALJ has lawful
   authority to issue subpoenas.
                     ___________________________________

   How do I serve subpoenas?

   The rule governing service of subpoenas is found at 29 C.F.R. § 18.34.
                     ___________________________________

   How do I request an extension of time?

   Extensions of time are generally granted or denied at the discretion of
   the presiding administrative law judge, or, if the case is not yet
   assigned, by the Chief Judge or Associate Chief Judge responsible for
   the case area. Whether an extension is granted is dependent on a number
   of factors, such as whether the request is made in a timely fashion
   (prior to expiration of the period in which an action should have been
   completed), whether other parties in the case are opposed to a
   continuance, whether prior continuances have been granted, the nature
   of the case, and the reason for the request. Most judges will require
   that a request for an extension be in writing. Filing such a motion by
   fax is usually permitted, but permission to file by fax must be
   obtained from the presiding judge. If the presiding judge is not
   available, a fax must explain the circumstances requiring that the
   document be filed by fax rather than regular mail. See 20 C.F.R. §
   18.3(f)(1).

   If a case has not yet been assigned to a presiding judge, motions may
   be directed to the following:

     * BALCA (permanent alien labor certification): Chief Administrative
       Law Judge
     * Board of Contract Appeals: Chief Administrative Law Judge
     * Settlement Judge: Chief Administrative Law Judge
     * Black Lung cases: Associate Chief Administrative Law Judge for
       Black Lung
     * Longshore cases: Associate Chief Administrative Law Judge for
       Longshore
     * All other cases: Associate Chief Administrative Law Judge for
       Traditional

   Contact Information.
                     ___________________________________

   Where can I find copies of administrative decisions?

   Many administrative law judge, Secretary of Labor, and Administrative
   Review Board decisions are available on this Web Site in either the
   Archive or the Law Library. The archive is essentially a set of
   "unpublished" decisions. The Law Library contains "reported" decisions.
   Most electronically available decisions are recent in vintage. i.e.,
   issued since the fall of 1997. However, some collections are more
   extensive. The nuclear and environmental whistleblower decisions, for
   example are comprehensive in coverage.

   Other electronic sources of administrative decisions include private
   publishers such as Westlaw and LEXIS, and CD-ROM manufacturers.

   Private publishers also print a Black Lung Reporter, and a Longshore
   Reporter. Selected administrative decisions are found in a number of
   reporter services.

   You may visit the OALJ National Office to read decisions. Office hours
   are 8:00 am to 4:30 pm M-F, except for Federal Holidays.
