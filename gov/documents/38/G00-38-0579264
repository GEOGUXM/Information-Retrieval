                              Fire/Life Safety

     While the safety record of transit has been excellent and few major
     fires have occurred, it cannot be assumed that the many minor fires
     which do occur will not develop into life-threatening events. The
     FTA has recognized the need for transit systems to address the issue
     of fire protection, and has provided assistance by developing a
     variety of documents addressing areas such as threat identification,
     materials selection, and countermeasures.
