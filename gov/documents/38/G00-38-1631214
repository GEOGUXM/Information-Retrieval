      Wildland fire safety begins with clearance around your homes, safe
      camping begins with getting a campfire permit, and keeping your
      children safe begins with important lessons like Stop, Drop, and Roll,
      and that matches are not toys. Is the battery in your smoke detector
      working, has your family practiced a fire drill lately, do the security
      bars on your windows have quick release mechanisms, do you know that
      charcoal gives off lethal amounts of carbon monoxide and should never
      be burned indoors? Information at this site could save you and your
      family. Fire Safety is up to each and every one of us.
