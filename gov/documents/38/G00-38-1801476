   Quality assurance is an integral part of the MODIS production chain.
   Science Team members are responsible for operational product QA. The
   intent is to provide the user community with an indication of the
   product quality. The MODIS Land Data Operational Product Evaluation
   (LDOPE) team has been formed to assist the land P.I.'s with operational
   QA, developing QA tools and procedures, and to provide a coordination
   mechanism for MODLAND's QA activities. The QA activities were
   prototyped using data from AVHRR, SeaWiFS and MODIS Synthetic data.
