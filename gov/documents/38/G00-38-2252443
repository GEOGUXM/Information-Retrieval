                 Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group (CCGG)

   The use of fossil fuels and practice of deforestation to meet the
   world's energy demands has lead to increasing concentrations of carbon
   dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. Both gases absorb terrestrial
   infrared radiation and have the potential to affect earth's climate.
   Before policies can be developed to limit the emissions of these gases
   into the atmosphere, their biogeochemical cycling must be understood.
   The NOAA CMDL Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group makes ongoing
   discrete measurements from land and sea surface sites and aircraft, and
   continuous measurements from baseline observatories and tall towers.
   These measurements document the spatial and temporal distributions of
   carbon-cycle gases and provide essential constraints to our
   understanding of the global carbon cycle.

    Cooperative Air Sampling Network - The NOAA CMDL CCGG cooperative air
     sampling network is an international effort which includes regular
      discrete samples from the four NOAA CMDL baseline observatories,
       cooperative fixed sites, and commercial ships. Air samples are
    collected approximately weekly from a globally distributed network of
                                   sites.
     Observatory Measurements - To obtain detailed understanding of the
   short term as well as long term variations of several greenhouse gases,
       CCGG makes on-site measurements at the four NOAA/CMDL baseline
    observatories, which are far from any pollution sources affecting the
                             gases of interest.
    Tall Tower Measurements - The Measurements of Anthropogenic Gases and
      Natural Emissions from Tall Towers (MAGNETT) program of NOAA CMDL
      utilizes existing tall (>400 m) towers as sampling platforms for
       in-situ and flask sample analyses of atmospheric trace gases.
    Aircraft Measurements - The largest gap in the greenhouse gas global
    monitoring system is the lack of regular measurements of the vertical
     profile of such gases over continental areas. In order to make such
     measurements economically possible CCGG has developed an automated
               system for obtaining air samples from aircraft.
   Standard Gases - CMDL has been designated as the Central CO2 Laboratory
    (CCL) by the World Meteorolgical Organization (WMO) to determine the
    international scale against which CO2 measurements are reported. CCGG
   maintains an independent manometric system for absolute calibration of
   primary CO2 standards. CCGG also prepares and calibrates compressed air
          cylinders for CO2, CH4, and CO standard reference gasses.

     Cooperative Data Products - The Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group
   participates in many cooperative research programs, which result in the
      construction of cooperative data products. The limited number of
    available observations continues to be a major obstacle to advancing
   our understanding of the global carbon cycle. The spatial and temporal
     extent of observations can be improved by compiling high-precision
       measurements made by many international laboratories into more
    extensive data sets. These cooperative data products may then be used
     to constrain carbon cycle models or validate measurements made from
                                   space.
