   The Big Picture of ARS Research
   Introduction

   Agricultural Research Service

   The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the principal in-house
   research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is one
   of the four component agencies of the Research, Education, and
   Economics (REE) mission area. Congress first authorized
   Federally-supported agricultural research in the Organic Act of 1862,
   which established what is now USDA. That statute directed the
   Commissioner of Agriculture "... To acquire and preserve in his
   Department all information he can obtain by means of books and
   correspondence, and by practical and scientific experiments,..." The
   scope of USDA's agricultural research programs has been expanded and
   extended many times since the Department was first created. Today ARS
   has a workforce of approximately 8,000 employees including 2,000
   scientists representing a wide range of disciplines. ARS has about
   1,200 research projects working at over 100 locations across the
   country and at 4 overseas laboratories. The National Agricultural
   Library and the National Arboretum are also part of ARS.

   National Program Staff

   The National Program Staff (NPS) consists of approximately 30 National
   Program Leaders drawn from different scientific disciplines who are
   responsible for managing the overall ARS research program to accomplish
   the agency's mission:

   ARS conducts research to develop and transfer solutions to agricultural
   problems of high national priority and provides information access and
   dissemination to

     Ensure high-quality, safe food and other agricultural products,
     * Assess the nutritional needs of Americans,
     * Sustain a competitive agricultural economy,
     * Enhance the natural resource base and the environment, and
     * Provide economic opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and
       society as a whole.

   To achieve these objectives, NPS identifies critical problems affecting
   American agriculture, plans and executes the strategies needed to
   address these problems by: mobilizing resources (both human and
   financial); fostering multi-disciplinary research; linking research to
   program and policy objectives; and communicating and interacting with
   customers, stakeholders, partners, and beneficiaries to insure program
   relevancy. Currently, NPS has organized ARS research into 22 National
   Programs which are described in detail on this website. NPS also works
   to ensure the timely transfer of new knowledge and technologies to
   potential users. NPS seeks to broaden public understanding of the value
   of agriculture and agricultural research to ensure the continued
   primacy of the U.S. agriculture in the 21st century.
