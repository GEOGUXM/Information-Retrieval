   3.0              DEFINITIONS


   3.1        Assessment Tracking System (ATS) – ATS database tool
   consisting of three levels of information related to an assessment:

               [INS: :INS]

   3.1.1 Assessments:  Any internal or external assessment, investigation,
   or event report.


   3.1.2     Conditions:  Findings, issues, concerns, observations, or
   recommendations found in the assessment.  There may be one or more
   conditions required for a single assessment.


   3.1.3     Actions:  The activities (permanent or interim) taken to
   prevent recurrence of causes associated with a condition.  There may be
   one or more actions required for a single condition.


   3.2        Balance-of-Plant (BOP):  Is one of seven BNL “facility”
   designations in the ORPS database.  The others are Alternating Gradient
   Synchrotron (AGS), Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR), Cold
   Neutron Facility (CNF), High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR), National
   Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), and Plant Engineering (PE).


   3.3        Condition:  Any as-found state, whether or not resulting
   from an event, which may have adverse safety, health, quality
   assurance, security, operational or environmental implications.  A
   condition is more programmatic in nature, for example, an error in
   analysis or calculation; an anomaly associated with design or
   performance; or, an item indicating a weakness in the management
   process are all conditions.


   3.4        Event:  A real-time occurrence (e.g., pipe break, valve
   failure, loss of power, environmental spills, earthquake, tornado,
   flood, etc.).


   3.5        Facility Manager:  That individual, or his or her designee,
   usually but not always a contractor, who had direct line responsibility
   for operation of a facility or group of related facilities, including
   authority to direct physical changes to the facility.


   3.6        Facility Representative (DOE):  For each major facility or
   group of lesser facilities, an individual or his or her designee
   assigned responsibility by the Head of the Field Organization for
   monitoring the performance of the facility and its operations.  This
   individual shall be the primary point of contact with the contractor
   and will be responsible to the appropriate Cognizant Secretarial
   Officer (CSO) and Head of Field Organization for implementing the
   requirements of DOE Order 232.1A, Occurrence Reporting and Processing
   of Operations Information.


   3.7        Notification Report:  The initial documented report of an
   event or condition that meets the reporting criteria defined in the
   Independent Oversight Office's Occurrence Categorizer's Procedure.  The
   Notification Report shall consist of fields 1 through 19 and 25 of the
   Occurrence Report.


   3.8        Occurrence:  An event or a condition that adversely affects,
   or may adversely affect, DOE or contractor personnel, the public,
   property, the environment, or the DOE mission. Events or conditions
   meeting the criteria threshold are identified in the Independent
   Oversight Office's Occurrence Categorizer's Procedure.


   3.9        Occurrence Categorizer:  BNL maintains a team of Occurrence
   Categorizers for categorizing events or conditions. The team is
   composed of individuals who are knowledgeable, experienced, and trained
   in categorization criteria and the categorization process. When
   notified of an event or condition, the Occurrence Categorizer, using
   input from the Department Chair/Division Manager and Subject Matter
   Experts if needed, will categorize the event or condition according to
   the criteria established in the Independent Oversight Office's
   Occurrence Categorizer's Procedure.


   3.10      Occurrence Report:  A documented evaluation of an event or
   condition that is prepared in sufficient detail to enable the reader to
   assess its significance, consequences, or implications and to evaluate
   the actions being proposed or employed to correct the condition or to
   avoid recurrence.


   3.11      ORPS:  Occurrence Reporting and Processing System


   3.12      Program Manager:  The Headquarters individual or designee,
   designated by and under the direction of a Secretarial Officer, who is
   directly involved in the operation of facilities under his or her
   cognizance, and holds signature authority to provide technical
   direction through Field Element/Operations Office Organizations to
   contractors for these facilities.


   3.13      Reportable Occurrence:  Events or conditions to be reported
   in accordance with the criteria defined in the Independent Oversight
   Office's Occurrence Categorizer's Procedure.

   3.1.4          Update Report:  Prepared and issued when intermediate
   reporting is required:  (1) to supply additional information as it
   becomes available prior to issuance of the Final Report; (2) when an
   additional item is added to a Roll-Up Report; (3) any change in
   categorization is documented in an Update Report which is to be
   submitted before the close of the next business day from the time of
   recategorization (not to exceed 80 hours); (4) upon request of DOE; (5)
   and when the Final Report can not be completed within 45 calendar days,
   an Update Report is submitted giving a detailed explanation for the
   delay and the estimated date for submittal of the Final Report.  All
   fields with an asterisk (*) preceding them are required in the Update
   Report.  If the required information is not yet available, this fact is
   so noted.

   6.0              PROCEDURE


   6.1        Occurrence Notifications:


   6.1.1          The ORPS Coordinator receives an initial notification of
   an ORPS reportable event/condition from the on-shift Occurrence
   Categorizer.


   6.1.2          The ORPS Coordinator e-mails a “heads-up” to the Deputy
   Director for Operations, Independent Oversight Office Manager, Price
   Anderson Amendments Act (PAAA) Coordinator, Public Affairs Office, and
   the Occurrence Categorizers.


   6.1.3          The ORPS Coordinator works with the responsible Facility
   Manager to ensure that a Notification Report is submitted to DOE by
   close of business on the following business day, but not to exceed 80
   hours.


   6.1.4          The ORPS Coordinator notifies the Deputy Director for
   Operations when a Balance of Plant Notification Report is ready for
   submission.  Upon approval the Deputy Director for Operations submits
   the Balance of Plant Notification Report.  Non-Balance of Plant
   Notification Reports are submitted by their respective Facility
   Managers.


   6.1.5     The ORPS Coordinator receives notice that a Notification
   Report was submitted.

   The ORPS Coordinator e-mails the Notification Report to the Deputy
   Director for Operations, Independent Oversight Office Manager, Public
   Affairs Office, Price Anderson Amendments Act (PAAA) Coordinator,
   Lessons Learned Coordinator, and the Occurrence Categorizers.


   6.1.6     The Assessment Tracking System (ATS) Administrator, upon
   notification by the ORPS Coordinator, enters the
   assessment/condition/action per exhibits B, C, and D into ATS assigning
   an Update/Final Report due date 40 days from the time of initial
   Categorization.


   6.2        Occurrence Investigation and Reporting:


   6.2.1     The Independent Oversight (IO) Office will assist in
   identifying similar recent BNL occurrences to determine if programmatic
   issues exist and make known that a Laboratory-Level corrective action
   is warranted.  Programmatic findings will be reported to the IO Office
   Manager and the Price Anderson Amendments Act (PAAA) Coordinator.  The
   IO Manager will communicate programmatic findings to the Assistant
   Laboratory Director for Environment, Safety Health & Quality and the
   Deputy Director for Operations.


   6.2.2          The Facility Manager notifies the ORPS Coordinator that
   a draft Update/Final Report is in ORPS for review.


   6.2.3     Upon request, the ORPS Coordinator reviews the Update/Final
   Report and makes recommendations for revision as required.


   6.2.4     The ORPS Coordinator notifies the Deputy Director for
   Operations when a draft Update/Final Report is ready for review and
   submission into ORPS.


   6.2.5          If the Deputy Director for Operations deems the draft
   Update/Final Report not satisfactory, the Facility Manager must revise
   it.


   6.2.6          The Deputy Director for Operations notifies the ORPS
   Coordinator that an Update/Final ORPS Report was approved and submitted
   into ORPS. The ATS Administrator upon notification by the ORPS
   Coordinator will close the “reporting” action and condition.  If there
   are any open corrective actions, the ATS Administrator will add a
   condition and enter any open corrective actions into ATS per exhibits E
   and F.


   6.3        Report Follow-up and Action Close Out:


   6.3.1          The ORPS Coordinator will review the status of
   Occurrence Reports in the ORPS database on a daily basis.


   6.3.2          In the event that either the DOE Facility Representative
   or the DOE Program Manager rejects an Update/Final Report, the ATS
   Administrator will enter a revision due date into ATS via a new
   condition and action per exhibits G and H.  The revised due date shall
   be 16 days from the notice of Report rejection.


   Complete steps 6.2.2 – 6.2.6 as described under Occurrence
   Investigation and Reporting.


   6.3.3     The ATS Administrator receives ORPS action closure forms from
   respective Owners/Delegates of actions and forwards this closure
   request to the ORPS Coordinator for ATS closure approval.


   6.3.4     Upon receiving ORPS Coordinator approval, the ATS
   Administrator closes ORPS actions in ATS and the ORPS Coordinator does
   same in the ORPS database.


   6.3.5     The Facility Manager/Delegate may extend an action due date
   by filling out the “Create/Update Action” form on ATS.


   6.3.6     When all corrective actions are closed and concurrence is
   gained from the Assessment Owner/Delegate, the ATS Administrator will
   close the “Assessment” in ATS.


   6.4        Tracking and Trending:


   6.4.1     On a monthly basis, the ORPS Coordinator will track and graph
   the following, which is presented to the Deputy Director for
   Operations:


   6.4.1.1  ORPS report status to include:

   ·         Status of DOE review

   ·         Number of rejected reports
