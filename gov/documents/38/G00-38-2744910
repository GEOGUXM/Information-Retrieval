   The New Millennium The Center for Space Microelectronics Technology was
   founded in 1987 to develop high-risk, high-payoff concepts and devices
   to enable future space missions and to enhance current and planned
   missions. The center conducts research and development in such fields
   as solid-state devices, photonics, custom micro-circuits and advanced
   computing.

   Find out about other advanced concepts by visiting the Center for Space
