            Frequently Asked Questions About the ACRIMSAT Mission

   What is an ACRIM anyway?
   The Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) is a instrument
   designed to fly in space and measure the total solar irradiance (the
   total light energy from the sun). It is a radiometer because
   radiometers are instruments that interact with light. It is an
   irradiance monitor because it measures light for a long period of time.
   It monitors sun light. The words Active Cavity describe the fact that
   the active cavity radiometer actively maintains the temperature of its
   solar sensing cavity slightly hotter than the rest of the instrument at
   all times using an automatic electronic servosystem. It is Active.

   What does ACRIM measure?
   ACRIM measures the total energy of the light that comes from the sun.

   Why do we make this measurement?
   If we know the total amount of energy that the sun delivers to the
   earth, then we can build scientific models of the earth's climate
   system. The energy from the sun is the key energy input into this
   system.

   What does the ACRIM data look like?

   Total Irradiance This chart shows the daily average of total solar
   irradiance (TSI) for the ACRIM I and ACRIM II experiments. ACRIM I flew
   on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) spacecraft from 1980 to 1989. ACRIM
   II flew on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) from 1991 to
   the present. Each point on the curve is the daily average of the total
   solar irradiance measurements taken by ACRIM on the given day. The
   vertical axis is shown in watts per meter squared (the amount of energy
   that hits a given surface at a certain time). The horizontal axis is
   time shown in days.
