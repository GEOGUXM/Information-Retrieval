   Geologic information about the characteristics of the sea floor and
   sub-sea floor is critical for wise management of the offshore domains
   and multi-use decisions.

   The overall goals are to provide geologic mapping of the coastal and
   EEZ sea-floor environment, to develop and maintain a comprehensive
   description and synthesis of information and knowledge about the
   geologic systems of the American ocean/continental margins, and to be a
   national source of information about the geology of the Nation's marine
   realms that facilitates the wise management and protection of the
   Nation's marine environment and resources.
