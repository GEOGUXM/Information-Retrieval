  What is LAVA?

   "LAVA" is an acronym for Langley's Animation and Video Archive. LAVA
   provides a web-based database of computer-generated animations and
   digitized videos documenting NASA research at Langley Research Center
   (LaRC).
     __________________________________________________________________

  What kinds of animations are available on LAVA?

   All of the animations/movies/videos are in Apple's QuickTime® format.
   Two resolution sizes are generated: one for improved network
   transmission and the other for improved viewing quality.

  What is a QuickTime® animation and how do I view one on my screen?

   QuickTime® is a multi-platform industry-standard multimedia
   architecture developed by Apple Computer and it is used by software
   tool vendors and content creators to create and deliver synchronized
   graphics, sound, video, text and music.

   Free QuickTime® plugins for PCs and Macintoshes are available at
   Apple's QuickTime® Web Site. On UNIX systems, the preferred solution
   has been XAnim but it has been unable to keep pace with the latest
   innovations (specifically the Sorenson codec and QuickTime® 3) so it is
   no longer seen as a viable solution. No other solution, freeware or
   commercial, is known to be available at this time.

  I have a QuickTime® plug-in/player loaded but it does not work with the newer
  animations?

   Be sure that you are using the latest version of QuickTime® (version
   3.0) available at Apple's QuickTime® Web Site.

  How long will it take to download a QuickTime® animation?

   Use the following table as a reference guide for optimal transmission
   rates:

          File Size
          (MBytes)   ISDN                   Modems
                   128 kbps  56 kbps  33.6 kbps 28.8 kbps 9600 bps
             0.5   0.5 min. 1.25 min.  2 min.   2.5 min.   7 min.
             1.0   1.1 min. 2.5 min.  4.2 min.  4.9 min.  14.6 min.
             2.0   2.2 min.  5 min.   8.3 min.  9.7 min.  29.1 min.

   Where kbps is "kilo-bits per second" and min is "minutes".

  If the source for a QuickTime® animation is video, how do I obtain a copy on
  video?

   In general video tapes are only available to legitimate, accredited
   news media by contacting the NASA LaRC Public Affairs Office (757)
   864-6121. Efforts are underway to provide wider distribution in the
   future.
     __________________________________________________________________

  How do I download a QuickTime® animation directly to my local disk drive?

   Click on your preferred video resolution link (e.g. Small, Medium, or
   Large) with:
     * right mouse button on a PC
     * middle mouse button on Unix
     * option key and mouse button on Macintosh

   to display a pop-up menu from which you should select "Save Link As"
   (or "Save Target As" on Internet Explorer). Select an appropriate
   location to save the image on your disk drive and save link as Source.
     __________________________________________________________________

  How do I get my video/animation/movie into LAVA?

   First fill out the online Add Animation form. Next, prepare to be
   contacted by the Video Applications Group (x46749) by collecting your
   source material (e.g. video tapes, films, etc.).
     __________________________________________________________________

  How do I create a collection of animations in the "Browse" library?

   NOTE : Only LaRC employees are allowed to create a collection of
   animations.

   Use the comment form to request the creation of a new Browse category
   include a title for the category and the LAVA animation numbers (i.e.
   LV-yyyy-##### numbers) that pertain to the category. For instance a
   category called "First Animations" could be constructed as follows:
Please create a new Browse category as follows:

First Animations
LV-1997-00001
LV-1997-00002
LV-1997-00003
LV-1997-00004
     __________________________________________________________________

  How do I include a URL to point to my on-line publication?

   URLs can be placed in the publication field on the second page of the
   "Add Animation" form. The URLs must be entered in the HTML format in
   order for them to be recognized and to function as true hyperlinks. The
   following lines demonstrate how a URL should be entered:
   <A HREF="http://sti.larc.nasa.gov/RandT/Contents.html">
   Research and Technology Highlights Report</A>

   The URL appears italicized on the first line and the second line has
   the hypertext link to the URL.
     __________________________________________________________________

  How do I specify subscripts and superscripts in my full description?

   For subscripts, precede the subscripted text with <SUB> and suceed with
   </SUB>.
   For example to write: f[c]
   Enter: f<SUB>c</SUB>

   For superscripts, precede the superscripted text with <SUP> and suceed
   with </SUP>.
   For example to write: 10^6
   Enter: 10<SUP>6</SUP>
     __________________________________________________________________

  Why can't I search for the animation data that I just submitted?

   The database is re-indexed every 24 hours so try again tomorrow or if
   you absolutely cannot wait then submit a comment form to that effect.
