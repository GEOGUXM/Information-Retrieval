   Mission
   The Home Rule Charter of 1952 established the Department of Records to
   ensure that Philadelphia's municipal records are appropriately
   controlled and managed. The Department sets records management
   standards and procedures for all departments, boards, commissions and
   agencies, and it manages key central recordkeeping operations and
   services such as the City Archives, the Records Storage Center, the
   Recorder of Deeds and the Central Reprographics Services.

   The Department also directs public access to municipal records and
   establishes and collects fees to cover the cost of providing copies of
   records. As an agent for the Commonwealth and City Revenue Departments,
   the Records Department also collects realty transfer taxes and document
   recording fees. And, as the official City tax registry, the Department
   maintains the City's real property database and tax maps.

   Department Profile
   The Department consists of five divisions. Information and services
   provided by each division can be found under the following links:

   Records Management Division
