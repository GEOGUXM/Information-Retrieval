         ECT Pacesetter Awards
   (In Reverse Chron Order CY 2001)

   Firewall Implementation -- C. Schmitz

   Cyber Security Improvement Project -- I. Tilbrook & D. Tussing
   Central Surveillance System -- M. Kroll
   Cyber Security -- M. Skwarek
   Data Acquisition System -- P. DeLurgio

   Firewall Implementation


   Cyber Security Improvement Project

   As members of the project team, Ian Tilbrook and Dennis Tussing worked
   long hours and weekends with others to develop and implement the
   methodology and tools used to execute the cyber security project plan,
   assess the Laboratory's risk, and present the results to the University
   of Chicago's Special Advisory Committee (SAC) on Cyber Security.  The
   SAC found Argonne's efforts and results impressive.

   Ian Tilbrook and Dennis Tussing were nominated for an Extraordinary
   Effort Pacesetter Award for their dedication to excellence in assuring
   the effectiveness of the Laboratory's Cyber Security.

   Central Surveillance System

   The Central Surveillance System (CSS) is an environment monitoring and
   alarm system used to protect critical systems at the Laboratory on a
   24x7 basis. Critical exhaust systems, emergency generators, water
   levels, airflow, temperatures and pressures distributed across the
   Laboratory are monitored by the CSS, which controls some 2000 alarms.
   In the event of a CSS system failure, additional manpower, both within
   PFS and each affected Division, is required to replace the automatic
   monitoring and alarm capabilities. Also, in the event of a CSS system
   failure, scientific research that relies upon CSS monitoring and alarm
   capabilities is jeopardized.

   Martin R. Kroll was nominated for an Extraordinary Effort Pacesetter
   Award for his recent emergency repair and return-to-operation of the
   20-year old CSS.  His effort saved the PFS Division significant effort.
   Martys success was achieved, despite increased difficulty identifying
   spare/replacement parts and expertise for this increasingly obsolete
   system.

   Cyber Security

   Michael A. Skwarek was nominated for an Extraordinary Effort pacesetter
   award. In response to the FY00 GAO (03/00) and OA (08/00) reports which
   criticized the Laboratorys cyber security posture, Mike pioneered
   firewall implementation at the Laboratory. This extraordinary effort
   involved moving ANL Operations behind a Cisco PIX firewall. This
   project involved learning new technology and developing procedures for
   implementing firewall protection for each OPS organization, while on an
   extremely challenging schedule. Mike met the initial project
   requirements of moving Bldg. 201 occupants behind the firewall,
   including EQO, ESH, HR, OPA, OPS, OTD, OTT, and PRO. Then, Mike
   exceeded the original scope of this project, by also incorporating
   other organizations, like the ECT-221 Networking Group, University of
   Chicago, ANL Counter-Intelligence and PFS-214. This project involved
   increased job responsibilities and extended hours on Mikes part. The
   knowledge gained will prove invaluable for future firewall activities
   at the Laboratory. As a result of this exceptional effort, the
   Laboratory has been able to preliminarily meet GAO and OA
   recommendations regarding cyber security and reduce risk to Laboratory
   OPS systems and data.

   Michael A. Skwareks technical abilities, professionalism and
   customer-focus came together to assure the success of the recent Ops
   Firewall implementation at the Laboratory. As a result of the Ops
   Firewall project, the Laboratory has preliminarily meet GAO and OA
   recommendations regarding cyber security, thereby improving the
   Laboratorys overall cyber security posture. The Laboratory has also
   benefited by reduced risk to OPS systems and data as a result of the
   OPS Firewall project, lead by the extraordinary efforts of Michael A.
   Skwarek.

   IPNS Data Acquisition System

   Patrick DeLurgio was nominated for extraordinary effort Pacesetter
   award.  Patrick was responsible for leading the effort of the
   evaluation of the IPNS multi-channel data acquisition system and
   proposing improvements. Patrick's involvement was essential for the
   improvement of the performance of the HRMECS preamplifiers and also the
   data acquisition system that will be used in other instruments as well.
   He also helped in servicing the Anger camera detector system on the
   HIPD instrument. Patrick DeLurgio's effort was essential for the
   continuous operation of several IPNS instruments and for future
   upgrades.
