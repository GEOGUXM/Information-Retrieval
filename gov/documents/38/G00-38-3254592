   On October 10, 1999, Governor Gray Davis signed two bills authorizing
   low cost automobile insurance pilot programs available for residents of
   San Francisco and Los Angeles counties only:
     * SB 171 by Senator Martha Escutia, establishing the Los Angeles
       County Low Cost Auto Policy Pilot Program, and
     * SB 527 by Senator Jackie Speier, establishing the City and County
       of San Francisco Low Cost Auto Policy Pilot Program.  Specifics on
       the programs can be reviewed by clicking on the legislation noted
       above.
     * AB 2904 provides access to the Pilot Program for those with driving
       experience outside North America. Specifics on these requirements
       can be reviewed by clicking on this legislation link.

   Under the legislative terms of this four-year Pilot Program, low cost
   automobile policies are available from July, 2000 until January 1, 2004
   to residents of Los Angeles and San Francisco Counties only.  Other
   eligibility criteria and restrictions imposed by state law also apply.

                   Frequently-Asked Questions and Answers

     1. Who's eligible for the new, low cost auto policy?

     By law, only residents of Los Angeles & San Francisco Counties are
     eligible for the pilot programs.

     2. What other criteria besides living in Los Angeles or San
     Francisco County do I have to meet to qualify to buy the policy?

     Besides residence, the new law requires that you meet ALL of the
     following tests:

                                    FIRST:

     You must live in a household that has a gross annual income equal to
     or less than 150% of the federal poverty level;

     What's the "federal poverty level"?

     The federal poverty level is set by the federal government in
     February of each year and varies by the number of family members in
     a household. For 2001, the maximum gross annual income allowed to be
     considered at or below the federal poverty level is:


   Number in Household Income  150% Federal Poverty Level
   One in household    $8,590           $12,885
   Two in household    $11,610          $17,415
   Three in household  $14,630          $21,945
   Four in household   $17,650          $26,475
   Five in household   $20,670          $31,005
   Six in household    $23,690          $35,535
   Seven in household  $26,710          $40,065
   Eight in household  $29,730          $44,595
   For households with more than 8 members, add $3,020 for each additional
   member to the figure shown in the "Income" column of the Poverty
   Guideline.  Multiply the result by either 1.5 or 150%.

     How do I prove I qualify financially by being at or under 150% of
     the federal poverty level?

     The law requires low cost policy applicants to present a copy of
     their federal or state income tax return for the previous year or
     other reliable evidence of the applicant's gross annual household
     income from a governmental agency or governmental means-tested
     program . Once finalized, CAARP rules and Department of Insurance
     regulations will specify what documents may be used to prove
     financial eligibility.

                                     AND

     You must be at least 19 years of age and have been continuously
     licensed to drive for the three years preceding your date of
     application;

                                     AND

     You must have no more than one property-damage-only accident, in
     which you were principally at fault, or one point for a moving
     violation on your driving record within three years preceding your
     date of application;

                                     AND

     You must not have had any at-fault accidents involving bodily injury
     or death, or California Vehicle Code convictions within three years
     preceding your date of application.

                                     AND

     If you meet the residential and income eligibility requirements for
     low cost automobile insurance, the vehicle's value is also
     considered.  For an automobile that is valued at $12,000 or less at
     the time of the purchase of the low cost automobile policy.

     SPECIAL NOTE: If you are a college student claimed as a dependent by
     by anyone for federal or state tax purposes, the law specifically
     excludes you from eligibility for the low cost policy.

     3. When is the program available?

     Policy applications are available from  CAARP-certified agents
     through January 1, 2004.

     4. What does the low cost auto policy cover?

     The policy is required to provide the following coverages:

     * $10,000 liability for bodily injury or death to one person per
       accident caused by you,
     * Up to a maximum of $20,000 liability of bodily injury or death to
       all persons in an accident caused by you; and
     * $3,000 for liability for damage to the personal property of others
       in an accident caused by you.

     NOTE: Buying the low cost policy will satisfy California's financial
     responsibility laws, which require drivers to carry minimum amounts
     of third-party liability coverage. Like other policies designed just
     to satisfy these legal requirements, the low cost auto policy itself
     will not pay you for injury to yourself or damage to your own car
     caused by an accident, regardless of who or what is at fault.
     However, you are allowed to purchase additional types of coverage to
     provide this protection.

     5.  How much will the policy cost?

     The new law sets a single base rate for the low cost policy -- $450
     in Los Angeles County and $410 in San Francisco County. The law also
     requires a surcharge of 25% on unmarried, male drivers in the
     household between the ages of 19-25. The CAARP program may adjust
     the base rates after six months to reflect actual loss experience.

     6. How many cars can be covered?

     The law allows only two low cost policies per household, so only two
     cars can be covered by the program.

     7.  How do I apply for this policy?

     Contact CAARP to find a list of agents who serve your area.

     8.  May I make payments over time?

     Yes. There are two payment plan options. The first optionis to
     submit a $100.00 deposit and pay the balance in six consecutive
     equal monthly payments. The second option is to submit a 25% deposit
     or a minimum of $125.00, and pay the balance in 5 consecutive equal
     monthly payments. The law forbids a service charge and buying the
     low cost policy may not be tied to the purchase of any other product
     or service.

     9.  Does the agent-broker make any money?

     CAARP-certified agent-brokers will make the same commission -- the
     12% that they make on existing CAARP business.

     10.  How long is the policy period?

     As long as the policyholder remains eligible, the policy is good for
     one year and may be renewed annually after that through the four
     years the program is authorized -- unless the law is modified or
     repealed before then.

     11.  Can the insurer to whom my low cost policy is assigned by CAARP
     refuse to renew my policy?

     Insurers may refuse to renew low cost policies for the same reasons
     that insurers are permitted to non-renew other auto policies under
     California Insurance Code Sections 671 and 1861.03 (c). You may be
     refused renewal only if:
     * There is "a substantial increase in the hazard insured against," or
     * You no longer meet the program's eligibility requirements. Under
       the law, CAARP will certify your eligibility the first year; your
       carrier must re-certify you annually after that.

     12.  Can my low cost policy be cancelled for any reason?

     Just as for other auto policies, the low cost policy can be
     cancelled for:

     * Nonpayment of premiums, or
     * Fraud or material misrepresentation affecting the policy or the
       insured.

     Three other possible reasons for cancellation apply only to low cost
     policies.
     * Under the new law, low cost auto policyholders are not allowed to
       purchase additional automobile liability insurance coverage.
       (Buying additional, non-liability coverage -- such as collision or
       uninsured motorist -- at additional cost outside the program is
       allowed.)
     * Also, a low cost auto policyholder cannot purchase liability
       insurance from outside the program to cover any additional vehicles
       in the same household.
     * Finally, qualified households are limited to no more than two
       policies.

     Thus, your low cost auto policy could be cancelled if you break any
     of the five rules listed above.
