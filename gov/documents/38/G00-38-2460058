   Sample Resources for Residential Water Users

   Your water supplier - a water agency, city, or private water service
   company - is one of the first places to look for information. Many
   suppliers provide water conservation tips and offer special programs,
   such as rebates for high-efficiency appliances or plumbing fixtures.
   Below are sample links for three water suppliers.
