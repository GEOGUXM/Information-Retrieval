          [redball.gif] Modeling of possible tsunamis is occurring for
          selected communities in a five-state area. In the Bay Area, the
          San Francisco and San Mateo County coastlines are one of these
          pilot areas. (Other pilot projects in California are being
          conducted in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara
          counties.) The tsunami modeling has been completed for the
          coastlines in San Mateo and San Francisco counties. At this
          point, the cities and counties in the pilot counties are
          conducting further analysis of the modeling to determine how to
          convert the tsunami modeling information into hazard,
          vulnerability and exposure information. When additional
          information is available, including, potentially, maps, links to
          the appropriate sites will be provided.
