                      Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Question:
   11. What is PACER?

   Answer:
   The Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system allows any
   user with a
   personal computer to dial in to a district or bankruptcy court computer
   and retrieve official
   electronic case information and court dockets usually in less than a
   minute. PACER is
   predominately utilized by attorneys and has eliminated the need to
   travel to the courthouse to
   retrieve routine information. Each court controls its own computer
   system and case information
   database; therefore, there are some variations among jurisdictions as
   to the information offered.
   Typically, information currently available through PACER includes basic
   case information,
   docket information, index information, and opinions. Many jurisdictions
   offer 800 telephone
   lines to eliminate long distance toll charges.
