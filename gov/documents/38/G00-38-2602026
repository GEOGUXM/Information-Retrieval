   descriptions

   Many kinds of volcanic activity can endanger the lives of people and
   property both close to and far away from a volcano. Most of the
   activity involves the explosive ejection or flowage of rock fragments
   and molten rock in various combinations of hot or cold, wet or dry, and
   fast or slow. Some hazards are more severe than others depending on the
   size and extent of the event taking place and whether people or
   property are in the way. And although most volcano hazards are
   triggered directly by an eruption, some occur when a volcano is quiet.

   Case studies of volcanic activity listed by country or region, volcano,
   year, and type of hazard.

   Volcanic eruptions are one of Earth's most dramatic and violent agents
   of change. Not only can powerful explosive eruptions drastically alter
   land and water for tens of kilometers around a volcano, but tiny liquid
   droplets of sulfuric acid erupted into the stratosphere can change our
   planet's climate temporarily. Eruptions often force people living near
   volcanoes to abandon their land and homes, sometimes forever. Those
   living farther away are likely to avoid complete destruction, but their
   cities and towns, crops, industrial plants, transportation systems, and
   electrical grids can still be damaged by tephra, lahars, and flooding.

   Volcanic activity since 1700 A.D. has killed more than 260,000 people,
   destroyed entire cities and forests, and severely disrupted local
   economies for months to years. Even with our improved ability to
   identify hazardous areas and warn of impending eruptions, increasing
   numbers of people face certain danger. Scientists have estimated that
   by the year 2000, the population at risk from volcanoes is likely to
   increase to at least 500 million, which is comparable to the entire
   world's population at the beginning of the seventeenth century!
   Clearly, scientists face a formidable challenge in providing reliable
   and timely warnings of eruptions to so many people at risk.
