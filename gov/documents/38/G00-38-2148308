                     Poster Sessions

   to PAC2001 Home
     __________________________________________________________________

   Poster sessions will be held in the Riverside Center on the Exhibition
   Hall Level, which is directly below the Columbus Rooms.

   Posters are split into eight sessions and will take place each morning
   (08:30-12:20) and afternoon (13:30-17:20) except during the opening and
   closing plenary sessions on Monday morning and Friday afternoon. Every
   poster is assigned a code with a 4-letter prefix followed by a 3-digit
   sequence number. The first letter indicates the day [M,T,W,R,F]; the
   second letter, P, indicates Poster presentation; the third letter
   indicates morning or afternoon session [A,P]; and the fourth letter
   indicates location [H=Exhibition Hall].

   Each poster is presented on a 4-ft-high by 8-ft-wide cork board mounted
   on 3-ft-long legs. Poster session managers are available in the poster
   room to assist presenters with mounting their posters. Posters are
   mounted during the half hour preceding the designated session:

                       Morning           Afternoon
   Setup:              08:00-08:30       13:00-13:30
   Presentation:       08:30-12:00       13:30-17:00
   Take Down:          12:00-12:20       17:00-17:20

   To ensure publication, presenter attendance is required during the
   following time periods:

                                Morning           Afternoon
   Odd-numbered posters:        08:30-10:00       13:30-15:00
   Even-numbered posters:       09:30-11:00       14:30-16:00

   Please remove posters immediately at the end of the session.
