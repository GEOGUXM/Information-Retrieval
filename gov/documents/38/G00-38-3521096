       (First meeting on Critical Assessment of techniques for protein
                            Structure Prediction)
     __________________________________________________________________

   This first large-scale experiment to assess protein structure
   prediction methods was held in 1994. It consisted of three parts: the
   collection of targets for prediction from the experimental community,
   the collection of predictions from the modeling community, and the
   assessment and discussion of the results. Information was solicited
   from X-ray crystallographers and NMR spectroscopists on structures
   about to be solved. In all 33 protein prediction targets were obtained
   in three prediction categories: comparative modeling, fold recognition
   or threading, and ab initio folding. Extensive efforts have been made
   to publicize the experiment. In all 35 prediction groups took part
   submitting over 100 predictions, which can be accessed from database at
   CARB, UMBI.

   Assessment of the results was done by three independent teams, one for
   each category. The teams were led by Michael James, University of
   Alberta, for comparative modeling; Shoshana Wodak, Free University of
   Brussels, for fold recognition; and Fred Cohen, University of
   California at San Francisco, for ab initio predictions. The first CASP
   meeting was held at the Asilomar conference center in California in
   December of 1994. A special issue of PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and
   Genetics (Volume 23, Number 3, 1995) has been dedicated to the
   assessment of the prediction experiment. The abstracts from the 1994
   meeting are also available.

   CASP1 organizing team has been led by John Moult, University of
   Maryland Biotechnology Institute, and included Jan Pedersen, UMBI,
   Richard Judson, Sandia National Laboratories, Krzysztof Fidelis,
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Funding was provided by LLNL,
   Sandia, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the
   Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research.
