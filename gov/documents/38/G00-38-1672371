   Georgia in Brief
   "...the transportation, manufacturing, and marketing hub of the Deep
   South... the charm of the South as symbolized by Greek porticos, Doric
   columns, and romantic traditions. Here is a land where modern
   fortresses [Air Force bases] are not far from communities where sacred
   harp singing is still carried on...a land of forested mountains, deep
   lakes, and clear mountain streams, contrasted with miles of sunny
   beaches and sun-drenched isles, with still further contrast in the
   misty swamps where alligators splash and exotic tropical birds preen
   their elaborate plumage."

                                                   -President Jimmy Carter

      "Georgia on my mind"
      words by: Syuart Gorrell
      music by: Hoagy Carmichael
      Melodies bring memories
      That linger in my heart
      Make me think of Georgia
      Why did we ever part?
      Some sweet day when blossoms fall
      And all the world's a song
      I'll go back to Georgia
      'Cause that's where I belong.
      Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
      Just an old sweet song keeps
      Georgia on my mind.
      Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
      Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
      through the pines.
      Other arms reach out to me
      Other eyes smile tenderly
      Still in peaceful dreams I see
      The road leads back to you.
      Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
      Just an old sweet song keeps
      Georgia on my mind.
