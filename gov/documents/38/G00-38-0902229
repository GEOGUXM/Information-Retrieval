   Overview

      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the world's foremost
      centers for biomedical research, and the primary Federal agency that
      supports U.S. efforts to fight disease. The mission of the NIH is to
      discover new information that will lead to better health for everyone.
      The NIH, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services
      (DHHS), accomplishes this mission by funding and conducting basic and
      applied biomedical research.

      Basic research involves fundamental studies of molecules, genes, cells,
      tissues, and organisms that lead to a better understanding of our
      natural world. The studies explore the structure and function of
      biological systems in their natural environments and in the laboratory.
      Scientists engaged in basic research seek to answer questions that may
      have no immediate medical payoff, but can provide the basis for later
      advances in biomedical research. In contrast, applied or
      patient-oriented research focuses on developing and testing new
      approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.
      Together, basic and applied research are our most powerful weapons
      against disability and disease.
