     __________________________________________________________________

   The U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's largest earth-science agency
   and has the principal responsibility within the Federal government for
   providing hydrologic information and for appraising the Nation's water
   resources.

   In Georgia, the U.S. Geological Survey operates 122 streamflow gaging
   stations, 18 reservoir stations, and 87 crest-stage stations to collect
   information on surface-water quantity; 148 stations to collect
   surface-water quality information, and 167 observation wells to collect
   ground-water-level information.

   Water-use information is compiled for the State annually. These
   hydrologic data and other data are used in research and hydrologic
   studies to describe the quantity, quality, and location of Georgia's
   water resources. The collection, analysis, and interpretation of these
   data is performed in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local
   agencies, universities, and research centers.
