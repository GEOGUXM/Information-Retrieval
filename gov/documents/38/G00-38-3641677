   Do You Want to be a
   WEATHER SPOTTER?

   The National Weather Service in Yakutat  is looking for volunteer
   weather spotters!  Volunteer spotters support their community and
   government by  providing the National Weather Service with timely and
   accurate weather reports.  These reports combined with satellite
   imagery,  NWS Doppler Radar signatures and various other data can be
   critical in the issuance of weather warnings and advisories that can
   save lives and property.
   It must be stressed that we are looking for RELIABLE and  OBJECTIVE
   reports as inaccurate information can do more harm than good.   Also
   it  is imperative that volunteers are available to receive calls from
   the National Weather Service in the event we feel that something
   suspicious is happening in their area or to ask further questions
   concerning a submitted report.
   To become an official Weather Spotter, you must attend a 2 hour
   training session conducted by the weather service.  The training
   consists of a video presentation and slides that explain how to
   identify and report significant weather.
   If you are interested in this program, contact us at   907-784-3322.
