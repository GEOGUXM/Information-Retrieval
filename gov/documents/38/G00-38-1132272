   TO: All Holders of Operations Manual

   SUBJECT: Transmittal Memorandum for Operations Manual Issuance 95-2

   1. Material Transmitted:

   WSOM Chapter C-40, Severe Local Storm Watches, Warnings, and
   Statements.

   2. Summary:

   This constitutes a major rewrite of WSOM Chapter C-40. Advancements in
   telecommunications technology have allowed the incorporation of a
   Universal Generic Code (UGC) into the headers of many National Weather
   Service (NWS) public products. Many of these changes are the result of
   technological refinements. For example, use of the PC-based software
   SRWARN has greatly simplified and expedited encoding of necessary
   routing and alerting information for warnings and statements while
   greatly reducing the errors in these codes. Some specific changes
   include:

   a. The term "county" in the WSOM Chapter refers to all

   counties, parishes, politically independent cities, and municipalities
   for which severe local storm warnings are issued.

   b. UGCs are included on examples of all appropriate products.

   c. The text has been refined for ease of readability.

   d. Special and severe weather statements have been restructured to
   emphasize short-term forecast information, making use of observations
   and reports to heighten public perception of personal risk.

   e. Contractions are eliminated in all products, excluding those
   referencing forecast models. Three-digit location identifiers and
   acronyms are retained, however.

   f. Short-Term Forecasts (Product Category NOW) have been introduced
   into the stream of information provided by an expanding number of
   warning offices. Use of the NOW, and its relationship to other
   products, is addressed throughout the Chapter.

   3. Relationship to Other Instructions:

   This Chapter supersedes WSOM Chapter C-40, Transmittal Issuance 86-1,
   dated February 4, 1986, and the following OMLs filed with C-40:

   OML 9-89, dated December 4, 1989;
   OML 10-89, dated December 1, 1989;
   OML 6-91, dated April 1, 1991; and
   OML 5-92, dated September 1, 1992.

   Exhibit:

   C-40-1: Two Ways by which NSSFC Defines Watch Areas

   NOTE: In implementing this Chapter, negotiations between the NWS and
   the National Weather Service Employees Organization have been
   completed. The generic set of proposals for implementing WSOM issuances
   involving new or modified products and/or services apply. Please inform
   the steward assigned to your office about this new Chapter.

   1. Introduction. This Chapter outlines the format and procedures for
   preparing, issuing, and disseminating severe local storm watches,
   warnings, and statements to inform the public of impending significant
   and/or severe convective weather. It should be understood that written
   instructions cannot cover every situation. There may be times when
   routine duties must be temporarily suspended so that urgent products
   can be prepared and disseminated in a timely fashion. Personnel must
   use initiative and professional judgment in specific weather situations
   while appreciating that the National Weather Service (NWS) has no
   greater responsibility than to prepare and disseminate critical
   information about impending severe weather.

   The uniqueness of severe local storm climatology in Alaska, Hawaii, and
   Puerto Rico may make compliance with some of these guidelines
   counterproductive. Consequently, the Alaska, Pacific, and Southern (for
   Puerto Rico) Regions are afforded greater latitude in modifying these
   guidelines for their severe weather warning programs, provided they are
   coordinated with National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH).

   2. Transition to the Modernized and Restructured NWS. The NWS is
   undergoing modernization and associated restructuring (MAR). Office
   designations and responsibilities change during different stages of the
   transition. This Chapter describes functions of each type of office as
   the NWS transitions to modernization: Weather Service Forecast Office
   (WSFO), Weather Service Office (WSO), Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD)
   WSFO (NWSFO), and NEXRAD WSO (NWSO).

   Guidance outlined in this Chapter will be valid through that period of
   the MAR characterized by the introduction of the Weather Surveillance
   Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D), the Automated Surface Observing System,
   and the new series of geostationary satellites. During this period,
   NWSFOs and NWSOs should use their new technology to prepare more
   detailed real-time and short-term forecasts of ongoing severe local
   storm events. This Chapter addresses the severe local storm
   responsibilities of each office (WSFO, WSO, NWSFO, and NWSO) during the
   transition to the modernized and restructured NWS.

   New products or procedures most likely will be introduced during the
   transition. One change is the decentralization of severe local storms
   watches. The effects of the initial phase of the decentralization
   process will be profound. Either a rewrite or amendment, by means of an
   Operations Manual Letter, will accommodate changes as they unfold.

   3. Multi-tier Concept. The NWS severe local storm warning program
   should use, when appropriate, a multi-tier concept of products to
   increase public awareness and promote a proper response. General
   descriptions of these products follow. Greater details and product
   samples are included later in the Chapter.

   Outlook. An outlook is used to indicate that a hazardous weather or
   hydrologic event may develop. It is intended to provide information to
   those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event.

   Watch. A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or
   hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence,
   location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide
   enough lead time so that those who need to set their plans in motion
   can do so.

   Warning. A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic
   event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of
   occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or
   property.

   Short Term Forecast. A product used to convey information regarding
   weather or hydrologic events in the next few hours. The short-term
   forecast, or Nowcast (NOW), eliminates the need for short-term special
   weather statements.

   Statements. Warning offices using the NOW should use the special
   weather statement (Automation of Field Operations and Services [AFOS]
   product category SPS) only to describe long-fuse events, including any
   appropriate meteorological reasoning, and to clear counties from
   watches. Very concise severe weather statements (AFOS product category
   SVS) are used in conjunction with short-term forecasts to describe
   severe weather events.

   Offices not issuing short-term forecasts use a variety of statements to
   give details on convectively active situations. A special weather
   statement amplifies watches and potentially active or active (but not
   presently severe) situations. Severe weather statements should be
   issued during severe weather conditions, i.e., when a warning is in
   progress, to report on severe events and to provide appropriate
   response recommendations.

   4. Definitions.

   a. County Warning Area (CWA). All counties assigned to a WSO, NWSO,
   WSFO, or NWSFO for the purpose of warnings issuance and hazard
   awareness responsibility. Offices with CWA responsibility are
   hereinafter referred to as "warning offices." A complete listing of all
   CWAs is provided in WSOM Chapter C-47, County Warning Areas. Ongoing
   changes to CWAs are announced in AFOS product WSHPNSWSH and in
   transmittal memoranda.

   b. Density/Risk of Severe Thunderstorms. The relative coverage and/or
   threat for severe thunderstorms in a specified area. The following
   describes the possible density/risk of severe thunderstorms in an
   outlook area.

   (1) APPROACHING. A non-severe category that indicates an area of strong
   convection; used to highlight areas where strong thunderstorms are
   anticipated but not expected to become severe.

   (2) SLIGHT risk. Severe thunderstorms are expected; the severe storms
   may not have a mesoscale organization or may be isolated in areal
   extent. Between 2 and 5 percent coverage, or 4-10 manually digitized
   radar (MDR) blocks, of severe thunderstorms per 100,000 square miles. A
   slight risk generally implies that severe weather events are expected
   to be isolated or localized.

   (3) MODERATE risk. Severe thunderstorms are expected and are
   anticipated to be more organized on the mesoscale. They will be more
   numerous or widespread than in the SLIGHT category. The potential for
   personal injury and/or significant property damage is significantly
   enhanced. Between 6 and 10 percent coverage or 11-21 MDR blocks of
   severe thunderstorms per 100,000 square miles. A moderate risk
   indicates the possibility of a significant severe weather episode.

   (4) HIGH risk. Severe thunderstorms are expected and are anticipated to
   be widespread. A dangerous situation exists with the strong potential
   for killer tornadoes, devastating windstorms, and widespread property
   damage. This category generally is confined for use in anticipated
   tornado outbreaks. More than 10 percent coverage or more than 21 MDR
   blocks of severe thunderstorms per 100,000 square miles. A high risk is
   rare and implies the possibility of a major severe weather outbreak.

   c. Call to Action. That part of a warning or statement (sentence or
   paragraph) recommending action that people at risk need to take to
   secure lives and/or property.

   d. Downburst. A strong downdraft that induces an outburst of damaging
   winds on or near the ground. Downbursts are further detailed as either:

   (1) Microburst. A convective downdraft with an affected outflow area of
   less than 2.5 miles wide and peak winds lasting less than 5 minutes.
   Microbursts may induce dangerous horizontal/vertical wind shears, which
   can adversely affect aircraft performance and cause property damage.

   (2) Macroburst. A convective downdraft with an affected outflow area of
   at least 2.5 miles wide and peak winds lasting between 5 and 20
   minutes. Intense macrobursts may cause tornado-force damage of up to F3
   intensity.

   e. Enhanced Risk Perception. Tendency for individuals to seek further
   confirmation of their personal risk before taking action (warnings and
   statements should present critical weather information in a manner that
   fosters this confirmation and more).

   f. Funnel Cloud. A rotating visible extension of cloud pendant to a
   cumulus/cumulonimbus with circulation not reaching the ground.

   g. Preliminary Watch Notification (AFOS Product Category SAW). A
   message prepared by the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC)
   to alert offices that a watch is forthcoming.

   h. Public Severe Weather Outlook (AFOS Product Category PWO). A message
   prepared by NSSFC for consumption by the media, emergency managers, and
   the public when a significant severe weather episode is anticipated.
   The PWO outlines the primary areas to be affected by severe weather,
   the expected timing of the event, and a brief synopsis of the
   meteorological elements that will produce the severe weather. A severe
   weather outlook also may be prepared and disseminated by WSFO/NWSFOs
   for their forecast areas using the product category SPS.

   i. Redefining Statement (Areal Outline) (AFOS Product Category SLS). A
   rewording of the tornado or severe thunderstorm watch area for use in
   mass media dissemination. It is expressed in terms of whole counties
   and, in the case of coastal areas, adjoining lake and/or coastal waters
   between well known landmarks. Cities or well known geographic landmarks
   within a state may be included. Additionally, a computer-generated
   redefining statement, AFOS product category SEV, is issued by NSSFC and
   sent to NWS offices. It is expressed in terms of whole counties and
   adjoining lake/coastal waters.

   j. Severe Local Storm. A convective storm that usually covers a
   relatively small geographic area, or moves in a narrow path, and is
   sufficiently intense to threaten life and/or property. Examples include
   severe thunderstorms with large hail, damaging wind, or tornadoes.
   Although cloud-to-ground lightning is not a criteria for severe local
   storms, it is acknowledged to be highly dangerous and a leading cause
   of deaths, injuries, and damage from thunderstorms. A thunderstorm need
   not be severe to generate frequent cloud-to-ground lightning.
   Additionally, excessive localized convective rains are not classified
   as severe storms but often are the product of severe local storms. Such
   rainfall may result in related phenomena (flash floods) that threaten
   life and property (see WSOM Chapter E-20, Flood/Flash Flood Watch and
   Warning Program).

   k. Mesoscale Discussion (AFOS Product Identifier SWOMCD). A product
   prepared by NSSFC that communicates the current judgment of NSSFC
   concerning severe weather potential or other mesoscale phenomena of
   significance.

   l. Severe Storm Reporting Network. A network of strategically located
   or mobile, often volunteer, spotters or emergency management officials
   (i.e., police, fire, etc.) who promptly report the occurrence or
   sighting of severe local storms (see WSOM Chapter B-21, Severe Storm
   Reporting Networks).

   m. Severe Thunderstorm. A thunderstorm that produces a tornado, winds
   of at least 50 knots (58 mph), and/or hail at least 0.75 inch in
   diameter. Structural wind damage may imply the occurrence of a severe
   thunderstorm. A thunderstorm wind equal to or greater than 35 knots (40
   mph) and/or hail of at least 0.5 inch is defined as approaching severe
   (APCHG).

   n. Convective Outlook Narrative (AFOS Product Identifiers SWODY1 and
   SWODY2). A written outlook by NSSFC containing technical information
   about the possibility and favored areas of severe local storms and
   other thunderstorm occurrences within the conterminous 48 states.

   o. Convective Outlook Graphic (AFOS Product Identifiers NMCGPH940 and
   NMCGPH980). Graphical representations of the SWODY1 and SWODY2 products
   depicting areas of anticipated severe and other thunderstorms for the
   0- to 24- and 24- to 48-hour periods, respectively.

   p. Severe Weather Statement (AFOS Product Category SVS). At warning
   offices issuing NOWs (see "q." below), the SVS is a brief (should be no
   more than three lines of text), concise, unnumbered public release to
   provide specific information on observed severe weather. At warning
   offices not issuing NOWs, the SVS is used to describe existing severe
   weather or to follow up a warning, including combined tornado/severe
   thunderstorm and special marine warnings (see WSOM Chapter D-51, Marine
   Services for Coastal, Offshore, and High Seas), by giving additional
   details concerning the convective situation.

   q. Short-Term Forecast (AFOS Product Category NOW). At warning offices
   issuing NOWs, the NOW eliminates the need for short-term applications
   of special weather statements (see "s." below), most severe weather
   statements (see "p." above), and several other types of public
   products. Issued at frequent intervals, NOWs give the status and a
   short-term forecast of weather conditions. When used frequently during
   active weather, they provide timely and sometimes vital information
   about a potential or existing hazard. See OML 2-93 to WSOM Chapter C-21
   and section 7.5 of this Chapter for further details concerning NOWs.

   r. Special Marine Warning (AFOS Product Category SMW). Unnumbered
   public releases by local warning offices with marine responsibility to
   warn mariners of existing or imminent local convective storms
   possessing sustained winds or frequent gusts of 34 knots or more,
   either confined to coastal waters or no longer affecting land. See also
   WSOM Chapter D-51.

   s. Special Weather Statement (AFOS Product Category SPS). At warning
   offices issuing NOWs (except where local communications constraints
   apply and alternatives are not possible), the SPS should not be used to
   describe short-term convective conditions. See section 7.7 for a
   description of SPSs in modernized offices.

   At warning offices not issuing NOWs, the SPS is an unnumbered public
   release issued at frequent intervals to amplify watches and
   convectively active situations. An SPS is used to provide additional or
   updated information about a watch or an area of nonsevere weather. As
   weather becomes more active, the SPS should be issued more frequently.
   The statement should convey what weather changes are expected in the
   near future and call for appropriate responses.

   Regardless of whether an office uses the NOW, WSFO/NWSFOs and, at
   regional discretion, NWSOs should use the SPS both to issue a severe
   weather outlook and to clear counties from a severe local storm watch.

   t. Squall Line. A solid or broken line of thunderstorms or squalls. The
   line may extend across several hundred miles.

   u. Status Report (AFOS Product Category WWA). A brief message issued by
   NSSFC that describes current evaluation and judgment regarding a watch
   in effect.

   v. Tornado. A violently rotating column of air, usually pendant to a
   cumulonimbus, with circulation reaching the ground. It nearly always
   starts as a funnel cloud and may be accompanied by a loud roaring
   noise. On a local scale, it is the most destructive of all atmospheric
   phenomena.

   w. Tornado/Severe Thunderstorm Warning (AFOS Product Categories
   TOR/SVR). Unnumbered releases issued by local warning offices to warn
   the public of an existing, imminent, or suspected tornado/severe
   thunderstorm.

   x. Tornado/Severe Thunderstorm and Special Marine Warning (AFOS Product
   Categories TOR/SVR). Unnumbered releases issued by local coastal
   warning offices to warn the public and marine interests of existing or
   imminent severe, or suspected severe, local storms affecting adjoining
   coastal land and water areas simultaneously.

   y. Tornado/Severe Thunderstorm Watch (AFOS Product Category SEL). A
   release for the public, marine, and aviation interests prepared by
   NSSFC, indicating that tornadoes/severe thunderstorms are possible. A
   tornado watch implies that both severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are
   possible.

   z. Wall Cloud. A local, usually abrupt, lowering of a rainfree
   cumulonimbus base forming a low hanging accessory cloud that is usually
   1 to 4 miles in diameter. The wall cloud is usually situated in the
   right rear quadrant of the cumulonimbus with respect to storm motion,
   below an intense updraft associated with a strong or severe
   thunderstorm. Rotating wall clouds often precede tornado development.

   aa. Warning Verification Messages (AFOS Product Category WVM). An AFOS
   product sent from NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) up-link sites to a
   warning office documenting the NWWS transmission time of the office's
   warning.

   bb. Waterspout. A violently rotating column of air usually pendant to a
   cumulus/cumulonimbus, over a body of water, with its circulation
   reaching the water.

   5. Responsibilities.

   5.1 Weather Service Headquarters. Responsibility for the severe local
   storm warning service rests with the Assistant Administrator for
   Weather Services. Staff assistance is provided by the Director, Office
   of Meteorology.

   5.2 Regional Headquarters.

   5.2.1 Program Management. Regional Headquarters shall implement
   national policies and develop and implement regional policies in the
   severe local storm warning program. They shall maintain general
   oversight of severe local storm warning services provided by all NWS
   warning offices in their Region, and they shall provide quality control
   over products issued and services rendered. They should provide
   critiques of office performance during significant severe local storm
   events, including the review of and, as needed, the requiring of
   updates to the Station/Office Duty Manual (SDM/ODM). This also includes
   the review of pertinent WSOM Chapters. Regional Headquarters should
   oversee a program of periodic drills designed to test the ability of
   various offices to meet severe local storm threats. Also, Regional
   Headquarters shall ensure that each warning office develops and
   maintains the proper level of public awareness. Community awareness
   plans should be developed according to the Federal Emergency Management
   Agency/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Agreement
   on Community Disaster Preparedness and WSOM Chapter C-49, Warning
   Coordination and Hazard Awareness.

   5.2.2 Report Significant Weather-Related Events to WSH. Regional
   Headquarters should follow guidelines in WSOM Chapter J-02, Special
   Reports on Weather-Related and Other Major Events.

   5.2.3 Survey Areas Damaged by Severe Local Storms. Regional
   Headquarters should follow the NOAA Administrative Order 28-17 and WSOM
   Chapter J-06, Natural Disaster Surveys, and should notify WSH, Warning
   and Forecast Branch (W/OM11), when a Regional survey team is being
   formed.

   5.3 National Severe Storms Forecast Center. The Director, NSSFC, is
   responsible for national severe local storm forecasting and for
   operation of the Center.

   The NSSFC performs four major severe weather activities.

   5.3.1 Issuance, Cancellation, and Coordination of Severe Weather
   Watches. NSSFC's primary responsibility is to issue and cancel severe
   thunderstorm and tornado watches. Section 6 describes these and other
   NSSFC products. Advance coordination, as time permits, between NSSFC,
   WSFO/NWSFOs, the National Meteorological Center (NMC), and the National
   Hurricane Center (NHC) will be with the understanding that the ultimate
   authority for severe local storm watches rests with NSSFC.

   a. NSSFC shall maintain a continuous watch for the possibility of
   severe local storm development in the conterminous United States,
   adjacent coastal waters, and on the U.S. portions of the Great Lakes.
   Any special rawinsondes needed to assist NSSFC in carrying out its
   forecast responsibilities shall be requested according to instructions
   in WSOM Chapter B-90, Special Warning Program Observations. NSSFC
   should furnish WSH, Operations Division (W/OM1), with forecast
   verification reports. See WSOM Chapter C-72, National Watch/Warning
   Verification Program, for NSSFC watch/warning verification
   responsibilities.

   b. NSSFC should coordinate watches with offices having public forecast
   responsibility. On those few occasions when widespread and destructive
   tornadoes are expected, NSSFC should, if time is available, discuss
   with WSFOs the proposed terminology to be used to describe adequately
   the threat to the public. NSSFC shall issue a Public Weather Outlook
   (AFOS product category PWO) when widespread and destructive tornadoes
   and/or widespread and destructive windstorms (derechos) are expected.
   NSSFC should contact WSFO/NWSFOs before canceling a watch in or near
   their areas of forecast responsibility.

   c. NSSFC should coordinate with NHC before issuing a tornado watch if
   tropical cyclone-related tornadoes are anticipated. To assist NHC, this
   coordination should be done about 2 hours before the next scheduled
   tropical cyclone advisory issuance time if possible (also see WSOM
   Chapter C-41, Hurricane Warnings).

   d. NSSFC should coordinate, as needed, with NMC to ensure consistency
   between NSSFC and NMC products.

   5.3.2 Preparation and Issuance of Convective SIGMETs (Significant
   Meteorological Information). NSSFC shall prepare regularly scheduled
   and, as required, special advisories identifying the location,
   intensity, and trend of significant convective weather important to
   aviation interests. (See WSOM Chapter D-22, In-flight Aviation Weather
   Advisories.)

   5.3.3 Communications. NSSFC shall enter all textual messages in AFOS
   for communication to NWS offices and transmit them directly to the
   Weather Message Switching Center (WMSC) via a computer-to-computer link
   for relay on communication circuits. In addition, all messages are
   relayed through the Systems Monitoring and Coordination Center (SMCC)
   and/or NWS Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) for further dissemination.

   NSSFC, or its backup, shall up-link all watches and watch cancellations
   directly onto the NWWS via AFOS. The identifier shall be "MKCSELx,"
   where x = 0 through 9, and corresponds to the last digit in the watch
   number.

   Severe weather outlook narratives, product identifiers SWODY1 and
   SWODY2, also shall be entered directly onto the NWWS by NSSFC or its
   backup.

   5.3.4 Forecast Development. NSSFC shall direct the Techniques
   Development Unit to develop operational techniques for improving
   forecasts of severe weather.

   5.4 Weather Service Forecast Offices/NEXRAD Weather Service Forecast
   Offices. County warning functions of WSFOs are described in section
   5.5.

   5.4.1 Coordination with NSSFC, Adjacent WSFOs/NWSFOs, and WSOs/NWSOs.
   WSFOs/NWSFOs should contact NSSFC, their WSOs/NWSOs, and adjacent
   WSFOs/ NWSFOs, as needed, to discuss severe local storm possibilities
   or to discuss watches/warnings issued.

   5.4.2 Transmission of Safety Messages over NWWS and NOAA Weather Radio
   (NWR). Offices with county warning responsibility should transmit
   safety precautions (AFOS product category PNS), if time permits, prior
   to a watch on potential severe weather days. Otherwise, safety
   precautions should be transmitted over NWWS following the first
   issuance of a watch or after the first warning if a warning precedes a
   watch and 24 hours or more has elapsed since the last watch or warning
   in the state. These messages may be broadcast on NWR if deck space is
   available.

   5.4.3 Preparation of Severe Weather Outlooks. WSFO/NWSFOs and, at
   Regional discretion, NWSOs should issue severe weather outlooks as a
   separate issuance using AFOS product category SPS. This is especially
   important in advance of an expected major outbreak. This outlook should
   explain that it is preliminary and may be revised. The convective
   outlook, as received from NSSFC, shall not be transmitted on NWR but
   should be used as guidance for preparing the severe weather outlook.

   5.4.4 Preparation and Dissemination of Watch Redefining Statements.
   Designated offices shall create and transmit on the regional
   distribution circuit a separate product "CCCSLSXX" (CCC = local node
   identifier and XX = State Identifier) for that portion of a watch in
   their state(s). Selected offices, as designated by regional
   headquarters, also shall create and transmit a product "CCCSLSXX" for
   state(s) containing adjacent WSFO/NWSFO county areas of responsibility.
   This product shall identify the watch number and include only the
   counties affected. This product is intended for transmission on the
   Family of Services and NWWS.

   5.4.5 Amendment of Forecasts. WSFOs/NWSFOs should amend appropriate
   aviation, public, and marine forecasts, as time permits, when a watch
   is issued. (See WSOM Chapters C-10, State Forecasts; C-11, Zone and
   Local Forecasts; D-21, Aviation Terminal Forecasts; and D-22, In-flight
   Aviation Weather Advisories.)

   5.4.6 Assistance for WSOs/NWSOs. WSFOs/NWSFOs should assist their
   WSOs/NWSOs, as needed, in preparing warnings, severe or special weather
   statements, or, if applicable, NOWs.

   5.4.7 Watch Cancellations (AFOS Product Category SEL). NSSFC or its
   designated backup shall enter all watch cancellations directly on NWWS
   via AFOS (see section 5.3.3). Although warning offices are not required
   to take further action, they may disseminate a severe weather statement
   (SVS) giving additional weather information. Offices issuing NOWs may
   convey similar information using the NOW. Watch cancellations also
   should be transmitted over NWR and other appropriate communications
   means. Watch cancellations should be aired on NWR for a period of not
   less than 1 hour.

   5.4.8 Preparation of Draft Text and Data for Storm Data. WSFOs/NWSFOs
   shall furnish Storm Data material in accordance with WSOM Chapters
   F-42, Storm Data and Related Reports, and C-72, National Watch/Warning
   Verification Program.

   5.4.9 WSFOs/NWSFOs in Alaska and Pacific Regions. Severe thunderstorms
   are relatively rare in the Alaska and Pacific Regions. When they are
   imminent or do occur, severe local storm warnings in the Alaska and
   Pacific Regions are issued through appropriate warning products. For
   thunderstorms approaching severe thresholds, special weather statements
   should be issued to provide information on the potential threat. Alaska
   and Pacific Region warning offices using NOWs may convey similar
   information using that product.

   5.5 Weather Service Offices/NEXRAD Weather Service Offices. WSOs/NWSOs
   (and WSFOs with WSO functions) issue warnings and statements for county
   warning areas assigned in WSOM Chapter C-47. These offices shall ensure
   that appropriate warnings, watches, statements (including redefining
   statements), and, as applicable, short-term forecasts are transmitted
   on their NWR and other necessary communication circuits.

   5.5.1 Preparation and Dissemination of Severe Storm Warnings,
   Statements, and Short Term Forecasts. Responsibility for issuing severe
   thunderstorm and tornado warnings cannot be delegated outside the NWS,
   except as stated in WSOM Chapter C-05, Release of Forecasts by Other
   Federal Agencies. WSOs/NWSOs shall prepare and disseminate warnings,
   statements, and, if applicable, short-term forecasts as clearly and
   rapidly as possible following the guidelines in this Chapter and in
   WSOM Chapters C-66, Dissemination of Public Warnings; D-25, Support to
   Air Traffic Facilities; D-26, Aviation Weather Warnings and Pilot
   Briefings; and D-51, Marine Services for Coastal, Offshore and High
   Seas.

   5.5.2 Clearance of Non-threatened Parts of Watch Areas. WSOs/NWSOs may
   issue a special weather statement to clear parts of NSSFC watch areas.
   WSOs/NWSOs first should coordinate with their parent WSFO/NWSFO. By
   Regional Operations Manual Letter, regional Headquarters may restrict
   the authority to clear watch areas to WSFOs/NWSFOs.

   5.5.3 Maintenance of Station Readiness. Each meteorologist in charge or
   official in charge shall maintain a level of office and community
   awareness and preparedness consistent with the risk of on-station
   emergencies, local weather hazards, and available resources.

   Awareness activities shall include but not be limited to:

   a. maintaining an up-to-date Severe Local Storms Action Plan in the
   SDM/ODM (WSOM Chapter A-13, Station/Office Duty Manual). All
   operational station personnel shall review this Plan at least annually.

   b. conducting emergency warning drills as outlined in WSOM Chapter
   A-17, Emergency Drills, before and preferably during each severe storm
   season to ensure all operational staff members are proficient in
   warning procedures. The media and other members of the hazards
   community (e.g., emergency management, law enforcement, fire officials,
   schools, hospitals, volunteer organizations, etc.) should participate
   in selected exercises to test the complete system operation.

   c. maintaining a severe local storm spotter network. Cooperative severe
   local storm spotter networks, such as amateur radio (ham) networks,
   should be established and maintained by appropriate spotter training
   and communications drills each year (see WSOM Chapter C-49, Warning
   Coordination and Hazard Awareness Program).

   d. practice messages. If a practice severe weather warning is
   accidentally released, issue as quickly as possible a retraction under
   the same warning heading as that which was accidentally transmitted.
   Indicate the nature of the error or mistake. All practice messages
   shall contain the word "test" in the text of the message.

   Example:

   LAXSVRLAX
   WUUS1 KLAX 241800
   CAC037-241900-

   BULLETIN - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
   SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING...test...test...test
   NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LOS ANGELES CA
   1000 AM PST MON OCT 24 1994

   THIS IS A manual MESSAGE...NO SEVERE WEATHER EXISTS.

   test...test...test...test

   5.5.4 Disaster Awareness. All warning offices are responsible for
   public safety education, cooperation with outside agencies and
   organizations, and providing assistance to communities and counties in
   their CWA regarding the development of local warning systems and
   spotter networks (see WSOM Chapter C-49).

   5.5.5 Investigate Storm Damage. All warning offices should investigate
   reports of severe local storm damage in their CWA to determine the
   adequacy of warnings issued and to determine any needed improvements in
   warning methodology, the use of spotter networks, terminology, and
   dissemination. Post-storm surveys, when appropriate, should be
   conducted in accordance with WSOM Chapter J-06 and coordinated with
   Regional Headquarters.

   a. Within 1 week after storm-related fatalities, numerous injuries, or
   appreciable property damage in the WSO/WSFO (NWSO/NWSFO) CWA or the
   WSFO/NWSFO county area of forecast responsibility, the affected office
   should prepare a summary of pertinent meteorological data, a discussion
   of office activities during the severe weather situation, and accounts
   of severe storm damage. Include copies of all newspaper articles,
   warnings, watches, and statements pertaining to the event. Include
   distribution and dissemination times of NWS public products. When
   specific acts of individuals or groups are known to have saved lives
   and/or property, these should be included in the report. If a NOAA or
   Regional Headquarters on-site survey is being made, this information
   should be given instead to the survey team for inclusion in its report.
   These reports should be forwarded to Regional Headquarters upon
   request. Regional Headquarters should forward appropriate reports to
   WSH, Attention: Operations Division (W/OM1).

   b. Each warning office should participate in gathering information on
   severe local storms according to WSOM Chapter F-42 and regional
   directives. Evaluations, along with all other pertinent material,
   should be sent to their area manager.

   5.5.6 Special Reports on Significant Weather-Related Events. Special
   reports on significant weather-related events should be prepared and
   transmitted according to WSOM Chapter J-02 and instructions from
   Regional Headquarters.

   5.5.7 Office Records. Record keeping should be kept to a minimum,
   consistent with retaining the essential facts. For such AFOS products
   as warnings, watches, forecasts, short-term forecasts (if applicable),
   and statements, refer to WSOM Chapter D-90, Weather Support for
   Accident Investigations and Litigation, section 4.2.1. For such
   non-AFOS records as severe weather logs, warnings checklists, and notes
   on significant actions, retain at the NWS office for 2 years. The
   transmission time of warnings on NWWS circuits either can be observed,
   obtained from AFOS message logs, or extracted from warnings
   verification messages. Non-AFOS records should be kept when a severe
   weather watch is within the county warning area, when a severe weather
   warning is issued, or when a destructive severe local storm occurs in
   the county warning area.

   5.5.8 Backup for Radar Remotes. WSOs and WSFOs equipped with radar
   remotes should notify: (a) the radar office supplying the remote and
   (b) adjacent radar stations whenever its remote is inoperative. Upon
   notification, radar offices should furnish data to the WSO/WSFO on
   significant weather until the remote (dedicated line) becomes
   operational.

   5.5.9 Backup Warning Communications. Detailed backup procedures are
   outlined in WSOM Chapters B-50, Weather Radar Stations, and J-03,
   Backup Operations and Site Evacuations. If AFOS-related computer
   systems or associated communications lines fail, but the warning office
   otherwise remains capable of monitoring severe weather conditions,
   contact the designated backup office to prepare and disseminate
   time-critical messages before attempting a restart of the failed
   system. Do not delay requesting backup during a warning situation. If
   staff resources are available, both actions should be done
   simultaneously. Plan ahead for this possibility.

   5.6 Radar Offices.

   5.6.1 Radar Surveillance. Radar surveillance is a critical part of the
   severe local storm warning program. Federal Meteorological Handbook
   Numbers 7, Weather Radar Observations, and 11, Doppler Weather Radar
   Observations, describe observations and reporting procedures.

   5.6.2 Notification of Other Offices. WSR-88D-equipped offices should be
   proactive in passing along critical radar information to offices not so
   equipped or to those with a disabled radar. The resolution and
   data-gathering capacity of the WSR-88D are crucial to the provision of
   timely and effective watches, warnings, short-term forecasts, and
   statements.

   When radar indicates potential or existing severe weather in or near
   another office's county warning area, the affected office should be
   notified by the most expedient means. Give special attention to events
   occurring within about 20 nautical miles of another radar since they
   may be in that radar's ground clutter. If AFOS is used, acknowledgment
   should be requested. If acknowledgment is not received within a few
   minutes, another means of communication should be used.

   5.6.3 Warnings. Radar indications of existing, imminent, or potentially
   severe weather, such as those revealed on conventional radar by the
   Lemon or WRIST techniques or on Doppler radar by velocity or
   reflectivity signatures that are generally accepted as severe weather
   indicators, should be brought to the attention of warning offices
   immediately. When a tornadic signature is observed, the responsible
   office shall issue a tornado warning, provided other storm-scale
   meteorological conditions are consistent with tornadogenesis. However,
   there may be times when the warning office cannot be contacted and
   radar indications are such that a warning is imperative. Under these
   conditions, a backup office shall be notified or the radar office shall
   issue the warning for the other office's county warning area in
   accordance with regional guidelines.

   6. NSSFC Products.

   6.1 Convective Outlook (AC). The AC is a forecast of thunderstorms for
   the conterminous 48 states that is prepared as both narrative and
   graphic products and covers periods up to 52 hours in advance. The
   convective outlook serves as guidance to NWS field offices for use in
   the preparation of local forecast products; to advise the public,
   media, and other interests of the possibility of severe weather; and to
   assist with preliminary planning for additional staffing should severe
   weather be anticipated. In addition to a forecast of general
   thunderstorms, the AC delineates areas in which there is a slight,
   moderate, or high risk of severe thunderstorms. Areas where
   thunderstorms may approach severe limits (where "approaching" is
   defined as winds at least 35 knots and/or hail at least 1/2-inch in
   diameter) are also included. The convective outlook narrative message
   is transmitted to NWS forecast offices via AFOS and is entered on the
   Family of Services circuit via NWSTG.

   6.1.1 Convective Outlook Narrative (AFOS Product Identifiers SWODY1 and
   SWODY2). The convective outlook narrative message is written in plain
   language, using two-letter postal state identifiers to specify states
   or parts of states included in areas where there is a slight, moderate,
   or high risk of severe thunderstorms. The text gives the meteorological
   reasoning that supports the forecast and, to the extent possible,
   provides information concerning the timing of the most active severe
   weather during the forecast period.

   A second day convective outlook (AFOS product identifier SWODY2)
   includes a discussion and forecast of severe thunderstorms only.
   General thunderstorm areas are not included and risk categories are not
   assigned.

   6.1.2 Convective Outlook Graphic. A two-panel graphic convective
   outlook is transmitted daily on the Digital Facsimile Circuit (DIFAX).
   The chart is prepared from the 0700 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
   (AFOS Product SWODY1) and 0800 UTC (SWODY2) convective outlook products
   and represents two 24-hour forecast periods. The left-hand panel covers
   the period from 1200 UTC on the day of issuance to 1200 UTC the
   following day. The same two products are transmitted as single-panel
   graphics on AFOS (graphics product identifiers 940 and 980).

   6.1.3 Convective Outlook Issuances (AFOS Product Identifiers SWODY1 and
   SWODY2). A convective outlook (SWODY1) is issued daily at 0700 UTC and
   is valid for a 24-hour period starting at 1200 UTC. This product is
   updated at 1500 UTC and covers the period 1500 UTC to 1200 UTC. At 1930
   UTC, a second update is issued for the period 2000 UTC to 1200 UTC.
   Amendments are issued as required.

   A second day outlook (SWODY2) is issued at 0800 UTC and 1800 UTC and
   covers the 24-hour period beginning at 1200 UTC the following day.

   6.2 Public Severe Weather Outlook (AFOS Product Category PWO). When
   NSSFC anticipates an especially significant and/or widespread outbreak
   of severe weather, it may issue a public severe weather outlook that
   stresses the seriousness of the situation, defines the threat area, and
   provides information on the timing of the outbreak. The lead time on
   this release should be limited to 36 hours. NSSFC, along with its
   backup offices only, shall transmit this statement to the NWWS. NSSFC
   should, if necessary, issue an updated AC before the statement is
   released.

   NATIONAL SEVERE STORMS FORECAST CENTER

   6.3 Severe Local Storm Watch (WW) (AFOS Product Category SEL).

   Tornado and severe thunderstorm watches shall be issued according to
   criteria in section 5.3.1 and transmitted on AFOS. When possible,
   watches should be released early enough to be included in state/area,
   local, zone, and appropriate marine forecasts.

   Watches should be issued as far in advance as possible. They should
   refer to an average area of around 25,000 square miles. Reasonable
   effort should be made to have each public watch independent of any
   previously issued watch. However, subsequent severe storm watches that
   overlap existing watch areas should not alter the valid period of the
   earlier watch, except when specifically stated in the new issuance.

   Each watch shall contain information for the general public, marine,
   and aviation interests in discrete, sequential sections. When a section
   is not applicable, it should be omitted. Watches shall be numbered
   sequentially, beginning with number 1 for the first issuance of each
   calendar year.

   Watches shall use a state identifier [Universal Generic Code (UGC)]
   that will be generated automatically by NSSFC. (See following example
   in section 6.3.1 and decoding instructions in section 7.1.a.)

   The watch text shall begin with the most serious type of severe weather
   expected--tornado/severe thunderstorm--followed by the area(s)
   affected, with subdivisions of each state and the Great Lakes entered
   on a separate line. Funnel clouds will not be mentioned in severe
   weather watches. For major outbreak situations, NSSFC may accentuate
   the watch text as appropriate.

   Watch areas should be delineated in terminology readily visualized by
   the public (i.e., by naming larger cities/towns well known to people in
   the watch area). The term "adjoining lakes/coastal waters" shall be
   included when the watch affects coastal areas. Watch anchor points
   shall lie within the watch area. The day of the week and the valid
   local time of the watch should be mentioned as shown in section 6.3.1.
   Distances from reference points should be expressed to the nearest 5
   statute miles.

   A mean wind vector (5,000 ft. above ground level to tropopause) for the
   watch area should be included for each watch. The format should be
   "Mean Wind Vector DDDFF," where DDD is the direction to the nearest 5
   degrees and FF the wind speed to the nearest 5 knots. The mean wind
   vector may be used to estimate general thunderstorm cell movement
   (except for storms exhibiting deviant storm motion).

   6.3.1 Product Format (AFOS Product Category SEL). The combined public
   and aviation severe storm watch format by section is as follows.

   a. Type of severe weather watch, watch area, valid period, type of
   severe weather possible, watch axis, meaning of a watch, and a call to
   action.

   b. Other watch information that identifies other watches in the same
   geographical area that are being replaced or canceled by the new watch.

   c. Type of severe weather expected and intensities. This includes hail
   size (in inches, except in tornado watches associated with hurricanes),
   turbulence, surface wind speed in knots, maximum height of thunderstorm
   tops (in hundreds of feet), and mean wind vector that approximates cell
   movement.

   d. Discussion of the meteorological reasoning (parameters and factors)
   that support the watch issuance and forecast for severe weather.

   e. "Other thunderstorms" refers to other watches in effect and
   identifies area(s) where additional watches may be required later.

   6.3.2 Watch Graphic. Watches should be delineated using one of the two
   methods shown in exhibit C-40-1. The terminology used should be easily
   visualized by the public, including the names of cities or large towns
   known to people in the state and within the watch area. Anchor points
   shall lie within the watch area.

   Method A: Define area as a rectangle, usually 50 to 70 miles either
   side of a line from point A to point B.

   Method B: Define area as a parallelogram, usually 50 to 70 miles north
   and south or east and west of a line from point A to point B.

   See exhibit C-40-1 for illustrations of each type of description.

   6.4 Preliminary Notification of Forthcoming Watch (AWW) (AFOS Product
   Category SAW). The SAW is an alerting message that a severe weather
   watch is about to be issued. NSSFC shall enter the SAW onto AFOS and
   uplink it to NWWS. If section B of the forthcoming watch is to be used
   to cancel or replace a previous watch, an additional statement
   containing the appropriate information should be added to the message.

   Distances of the axis coordinates should be given in statute miles,
   while the aviation coordinates should be stated in nautical miles.
   Valid times should be in UTC. The watch half-width always should be
   given. The AWW also should contain hail size (except tornado watches
   associated with hurricanes), surface and aloft, surface wind gusts in
   knots, maximum tops, and the mean wind vector.

   Example:

   MKCSAW3
   :450, 0770 445, 0731 415, 0733 420, 0765:WWUS40 KMKC 041913

   MAX TOPS TO 450. MEAN WIND VECTOR 270/30.

   6.5 Watch Cancellation (WW) (AFOS Product Category SEL). NSSFC shall
   issue an unnumbered watch cancellation message whenever it cancels a
   watch. The text shall specify the number and the area of the canceled
   watch. An AWW (AFOS product category SAW) also shall be issued for a
   watch cancellation.

   6.6 Status Reports (WWA) (AFOS Product Category WWA). The Severe

   Local Storms Unit (SELS) of NSSFC should issue periodic watch status
   reports while a watch is in effect. A WWA should be issued at least 1
   hour prior to watch expiration. The status report should describe, in
   plain language, current evaluation of the severe weather situation and
   whether the watch will expire or be reissued. A status report is not
   issued if a cancellation or replacement has been issued at least 1 hour
   prior to the expiration time of the original watch. The status report
   also may include guidance information on where the severe weather
   threat has ended within the watch.

   Example:

   6.7 SELS Mesoscale Discussion (AFOS Product Identifier SWOMCD). A
   mesoscale discussion is issued as a routine/daily, but nonscheduled,
   short-term (0-6 hours) product to communicate the current judgment of
   SELS to the user community. It also provides guidance on other
   short-term mesoscale phenomena that may be of significance (e.g., heavy
   snow potential, formation/dissipation of dense fog, etc.).

   7. WSFO/WSO (NWSFO/NWSO) Severe Storm Products.

   7.1 Communications Headers for Severe Storm Products.

   a. Communications Heading and Generic Codes. Computers automatically
   disseminate products verbatim to a variety of users, including the
   general public. This is accomplished by using a combination of UGCs,
   Mass News Disseminators (MND), and World Meteorological Organization
   (WMO) headers. Any deviation from proper format will result in
   erroneous or incomplete dissemination. In backup operations, the AFOS
   product identifier of the warning must be the same as the office with
   primary responsibility. The following describes the encoding procedures
   for warnings, statements, and the decoding of watches automatically
   generated by NSSFC.

   In the future, the dummy WMO header (TTAAOO on the second line of the
   header) will not be used. Instead, authentic WMO headers will be used.
   A list of authentic WMO headers is given below. Future hardware and
   software development may result in changes to some of these WMO
   headers.


   Product                           WMO Header

   Tornado Warning (TOR)             WFUS1
   Flash Flood Warning (FFW)         WRUS1
   Severe Thunderstorm Warning (SVR) WUUS1
   Short-Term Forecast (NOW)         FXUS21
   Severe Weather Statement (SVS)    WWUS34
   Special Weather Statement (SPS)   WWUS35
   Redefining Statement (SLS)        WWUS32
   Local Storm Report (LSR)          WWUS30

   The UGC (for warnings, watches, statements, etc.) consists of six
   alphanumeric characters followed by an expiration date/time in UTC.
   Each code group (including date/time) is terminated with a dash (-).

   There are two minor variations to the code: one version, using a "C,"
   is for products issued on a county-by-county basis (short-fused
   warnings only); the other, using a "Z," is for products issued by zone
   or for part or all of a state (watches, statements, etc.). Warnings
   issued for basic marine areas utilize the zone format. See WSOM
   Chapters D-51 and D-52, Marine Services for the Great Lakes.

   Explanation of Code Elements:

   SSCNNN-DDHHMM (for warnings)

   or SSZNNN-DDHHMM- (for statements, watches, warnings for basic marine
   areas, etc.)

   where:

   SS          = Two letter state identifier
   C             = The number NNN that follows represents a county
   or
   Z                           = The number NNN that follows represents a
   zone or part or all of a state
     NNN = (After "C") the number of the county#
   or
         = (After "Z") the number of the zone or part or all of the
   state##
    DD               = Expiration date (UTC)
   HH  = Expiration hour (UTC)
   MM   = Expiration minute (UTC)
      - = Code separator/end of address
      > = Identifies multiple, consecutively numbered counties or zones.
   For example, ALZ002>006 implies  Alabama zones 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

   # The county is represented by a Federal Information Processing
   Standard (FIPS) number issued by the Census Bureau. Each county within
   a state has a unique FIPS number (001, 003, etc.) although the numbers
   are repeated from state to state. The FIPS numbers and corresponding
   counties are found in WSOM Chapter C-47.

   ## The zone numbers are identical to those defined in Appendix A of
   WSOM Chapter C-11. For the initial stages of implementation of the UGC
   in watches, the NNN should be set to 000 (see examples of watches for
   details).

   Examples of UGCs in Warnings:

   1. Examples for Individual Counties

           Code              County

   MEC003-        Aroostook County, Maine
   KYC101-        Henderson County, Kentucky
   COC041-        El Paso County, Colorado
   VAC760-        Richmond, Virginia (politically independent city)
   MOC510-        St. Louis, Missouri (politically independent city)

   2. More Than One County in the Same State

   If a warning is for more than one county in the same state, add the
   appropriate county number(s) (with each group separated by a dash).
   Note that the "SSC" does not need to precede each county number set
   after the first grouping. Also, the county number sets do not have to
   be in numerical sequence.

   Example:

   ILC043-089-191650- Warning for DuPage and Kane Counties, Illinois,
   expires on the 19th of the month at 1650 UTC.

   3. Counties in More Than One state

   If a warning is for counties in more than one state, add the
   appropriate state identifier and county names.

   Example:

   SDC127-NEC043-173-IAC193-040030- Warning for Union County, South
   Dakota; Dakota and Thurston Counties,

   Nebraska; and Woodbury County, Iowa; expiring on the 4th of the month
   at

   0030 UTC.

   4. Coastal or Great Lakes Environments

   A UGC has been developed to direct products affecting coastal or Great
   Lakes marine environments.

   Example:

   TXZ511-310030- Warning for the Texas coastal waters between High Island
   and Port O'Connor.

   WIZ502-150100- Warning for Wisconsin/Lake Michigan nearshore waters
   between Kenosha and Sheboygan.

   Examples of UGCs in Statements:

   NEZ001>004-019>022-054>056-231800- Statement coded for the Nebraska
   Panhandle

   TXZ103-104-118>120-133-134-150500- Statement coded for the Dallas-Fort
   Worth, Texas, area

   MEZ023>030-501-071100- Statement coded for the coastal areas of Maine
   and adjacent coastal waters

   Examples of UGCs for Watches:

   Severe storm watches issued by NSSFC cover large areas, frequently
   containing all or parts of several states. Watches use the "Z" form of
   the UGC. The "NNN" following the "Z" shall consist of three zeros
   (000). The SSZ000 is used to indicate that a part or all of a state
   falls within the watch area.

   1. Examples of UGCs for Individual States

   CAZ000- (a part of) California
   TXZ000- (a part of) Texas
   VAZ000- (a part of) Virginia

   2. Example of UGCs for More Than One State

   SCZ000-GAZ000-FLZ000-160200- Watch area encompasses (all or parts of)
   South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida
                                                                   and
   expires on the 16th of the month at 0200 UTC (10 p.m., EDT, on the
   15th).


   Although the code does not refer specifically to coastal waters, the
   phrase "AND

   ADJOINING LAKE/COASTAL WATERS" shall be used in the text of the watch
                                                                   to
   designate those affected lake or marine areas.

   3. UGCs for the Great Lakes

     LSZ000-         (a part of) Lake Superior
     LMZ000-        (a part of) Lake Michigan
     LHZ000-         (a part of) Lake Huron
     LEZ000-     (a part of) Lake Erie
     LOZ000-         (a part of) Lake Ontario

   Example including Great Lakes

   WIZ000-MIZ000-LSZ000-LMZ000-022315- Watch area encompasses (all or
   parts of) Wisconsin, Michigan, and

             (all or parts of) Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. I t is
   valid through the

            second of the month at 2315 UTC (6:15 p.m., CDT).

   b. Mass News Disseminator Heading. The MND heading is plain-language
   information that appears beneath the WMO/UGC headings. It denotes the
   type of product that has been issued, the issuing office, and the
   date/time of product issuance. See WSOM Chapter C-63, NOAA Weather Wire
   Service Dissemination. The issuance time shall be the time the product
   is entered into the first communications system for dissemination
   [(i.e., NWR, AFOS, NWWS, Auxiliary Backup Terminal (ABT), Remote
   Terminal for AFOS, etc.)]. The issue time shall be a three- or
   four-digit number, such as 730 PM (not 0730 PM) or 1030 PM. A space
   shall exist between the time and AM or PM.

   When a warning is issued by a backup office, the name of the office
   with primary warning responsibility shall be provided in the second
   line of the MND heading. The three-letter identifier of the issuing
   office appears in the dummy WMO header but also should be spelled out
   following the primary warning office in the MND (see example below).
   Guidelines regarding corrected and amended products are given in the
   following sections.

   (1) Corrections. Although no effort should be spared to eliminate
   mistakes when composing a product, errors will still occur on occasion.
   Minor typographical errors, which do not affect the message of the
   product, should not be corrected. Numerous retransmissions of products
   with such minor corrections may adversely affect communications systems
   already operating near capacity. When significant errors are detected,
   a corrected product shall be transmitted as soon as possible. The
   correction shall contain the same time in the MND heading as in the
   original product. Besides reducing confusion among the users, this
   practice will also prevent duplicate warnings from contaminating the
   NSSFC data base.

   When a correction is transmitted, include a word or two explaining the
   correction. Do not simply add "CORRECTED" to the line containing the
   product title. Usually, adding a brief explanation will reduce
   broadcaster/user anxiety caused by trying to find out what was
   corrected. The word "...CORRECTED" shall be added to the line
   containing the product title. A line containing an explanation for the
   correction shall be added below the MND heading (also see WSOM Chapter
   C-11). The following terms should be used when explaining corrections.

   Product Element in Error      Term in COR Explanation
   Type of product issued        STATEMENT/WARNING TYPE
   UGC, WMO, MND Heading         HEADER INFO

   Call to action statements     CALL TO ACTION
   Other                         Free Text, as needed

   (2) Amendments. Amendments to short-fused convective warnings and their
   accompanying statements shall not be issued. A new warning or statement
   should be issued whenever updated information is received. Forecasts
   that are updated for the issuance or cancellation of a watch shall
   contain the same format as shown above. See section 8.2 for examples of
   MND headings for updated forecasts.

   NOTE: The single ampersand (&) after the text is an SRWARN delimiter
   indicating to NSSFC that a severe weather report is in the text of the
   message. When using softwAre other than SRWARN, this delimiter should
   be inserted manually. Use this symbol only if the message includes a
   SEVERE weather report, i.e., a tornado, hail larger than 3/4 inch
   diameter, wind gust 58 mph or stronger. In segmented NOWs, the
   ampersand must follow the "$$" at the end of the message.

   The single ampersand is used in all warning office short-fuse products
   that include a severe weather report, i.e., warnings, statements, and
   the NOW. Some NOWs also include a double ampersand (&&) as a delimiter
   for cable television use.

   7.2 Severe Weather Outlooks. Severe weather outlooks are issued using
   the AFOS product category SPS by WSFOs/NWSFOs and, at Regional
   Headquarters discretion, by NWSOs. A severe weather outlook is used to
   inform the public about expected severe weather for the forthcoming
   convective period, i.e., beginning about 6 hours from issuance time. As
   such, technical terminology not generally used or understood by the
   local public and media should not be included. Severe weather outlooks,
   when required, should be issued roughly in conjunction with the routine
   and updated forecast package.

   Example:

   SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK
   NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OKLAHOMA CITY OK
   630 AM CDT TUE APR 5 1994

   THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WESTERN
   OKLAHOMA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE MODERATE RISK AREA IS WEST OF
   A LINE FROM ENID TO CALUMET TO LAWTON.

   EARLY THIS MORNING A DRYLINE WAS LOCATED IN THE EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND
   TEXAS PANHANDLES. AHEAD OF THE DRYLINE...MOIST UNSTABLE AIR WAS
   SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE FROM THE SOUTH. A VIGOROUS UPPER LEVEL
   DISTURBANCE IN CENTRAL NEW MEXICO WAS MOVING EAST.

   DURING THE MORNING THE DRYLINE WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST TO NEAR THE
   TEXAS/OKLAHOMA BORDER. AFTERNOON HEATING WILL COMBINE WITH THE UPPER
   LEVEL SYSTEM TO PRODUCE SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE
   DRYLINE BY MID AFTERNOON. THE STORMS WILL MOVE AND SPREAD EAST DURING
   THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS.

   LATEST SURFACE AND UPPER AIR DATA SUGGEST THAT LARGE DAMAGING TORNADOES
   WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON. LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE
   WINDS WILL BE LIKELY AS WELL.

   PEOPLE IN WESTERN OKLAHOMA ARE ADVISED TO KEEP A HIGH STATE OF
   READINESS THIS AFTERNOON. SPOTTER GROUPS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
   OFFICIALS IN THE MODERATE RISK AREA SHOULD BE READY FOR ACTIVATION BY
   MID AFTERNOON.

   STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO OR LOCAL RADIO OR TV FOR THE LATEST
   INFORMATION ON THIS DEVELOPING SEVERE WEATHER EVENT.

   7.3 Severe Weather Watch Products.

   7.3.1 Redefining Statement (AFOS Product Category SLS). Each
   WSFO/NWSFO, unless otherwise designated by Regional Headquarters, shall
   prepare the redefining statement or areal outline. The SLS may be
   composed using the automated SEV from NSSFC or one generated by a local
   applications program. The use of either automated product does not
   remove the WSFO/NWSFO's responsibility for the content of the SLS that
   is disseminated to the public. If the WSFOs/NWSFO is unable to prepare
   and issue the SLS for NWWS transmission, then, through coordination,
   either the paired NWWS up-link site or the designated service backup
   office should prepare the SLS for NWWS transmission.

   a. The redefining statement shall be called (STATE) AREAL OUTLINE FOR
   TORNADO (or SEVERE THUNDERSTORM) WATCH NUMBER ###, where ### is the
   appropriate watch number and "STATE" represents the appropriate state
   name. The issuance time (i.e., the time appearing in the MND header)
   should be the same for the watch and the redefining statement. A
   conversion to the time zone of the affected areas is desirable. The
   redefining statement should not change the watch area; however, minor
   changes may be made by the WSFO/NWSFO to reflect local needs (e.g.,
   addition or deletion of counties).

   A special redefining statement for the Great Lakes or adjoining coastal
   areas shall not be issued. When necessary, a phrase, such as "AND
   ADJOINING LAKE/COASTAL WATERS BETWEEN ________ AND ________," as
   delimited by marine break points (see WSOM Chapter D-51 for a listing
   of marine break points), should be included in redefining and
   special/severe weather statements.

   b. The redefining statement should describe the parts of the state
   affected by the watch in terms of whole counties or, in the case of
   watches affecting coastal waters, marine break points. Very large
   counties may be subdivided to allow a more precise definition of the
   watch area. The WSFO/NWSFO has the final responsibility for making
   minor adjustments, if appropriate, in the boundaries of the basic watch
   to account for zone forecast boundaries, large cities, metropolitan
   areas, or other significant geographical features on the periphery of a
   watch area. As a general policy, all of a large city or forecast zone
   on or near the boundary of a watch should either be included in the
   watch or left out completely. A multicounty metropolitan area/zone
   forecast may be divided by a watch boundary if the watch is issued when
   storms are already present in the area, and it is obvious that the
   storms will not enter some of the counties or have already moved
   through a part of the area and are not expected to redevelop. Splitting
   a metropolitan area or forecast zone also may be considered appropriate
   when a watch follows a warning already in effect for one or more
   counties in the area/zone but not all counties, and no severe weather
   is expected to redevelop in the warned counties.

   When forecast zones, large cities, or bodies of water that straddle
   state boundaries are affected by a watch, WSFOs/NWSFOs should assure
   their respective state redefining statements are coordinated. If any
   disagreement cannot be resolved concerning a cross-border zone, large
   city, or body of water, the WSFO/NWSFO with forecast responsibility
   shall have authority either to include or exclude the area in question.
