      When the United States government began minting coins in 1792, the
      original Mint facility in Philadelphia was hard-pressed to produce
      enough currency for our small country.

      As the country grew and the demand for coins increased, it became
      necessary to expand Mint facilities. This expansion was further fueled
      by the discovery of gold, first in the Southeast and later in the West,
      and by the need for hard currency which caused people to mint their own
      gold coins. In the mid-nineteenth century, additional mints were opened
      in Charlotte, NC; Dahlonega, GA; New Orleans, LA; and San Francisco,
      CA. In 1870, the Carson City, NV Mint opened, and in 1904 the Denver,
      CO Assay Office became a Mint facility. Today, in order to keep our
      economy flowing smoothly, the U.S. Mint maintains facilities in
      Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point, and a bullion
      depository in Fort Knox, KY.

      The number of coins minted today is astounding. Denver and Philadelphia
      alone produce 65 to 80 million coins a day. The stories behind each of
      the Mint facilities are fascinating, too. To learn more, click a Mint
