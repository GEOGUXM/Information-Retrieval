   Here is a Sensor Web experiment kids can try with their friends. It
   requires no special equipment, only the desire to learn more about the
   techniques Sensor Webs use to collect information:

   Get a group of friends and have them scatter around in a large area, a
   school yard works well for this. Have some stand under trees with
   others in the shadows of buildings or in an open area. Then have each
   call a report about the conditions where they are standing. Relay this
   information, hopping it from kid-to-kid the way a Sensor Web hops data
   pod-to-pod. It might be hot and sunny in one spot while it is breezy
   and cool in another. One person creates an imaginary uplink point where
   the information is gathered and compared.
