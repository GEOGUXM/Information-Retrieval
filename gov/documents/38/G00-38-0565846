   The Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) leads
   Department of Energy (DOE) e-government initiatives for disseminating
   R&D information.  Located within the Office of Advanced Scientific
   Computing Research (OASCR) in the DOE Office of Science (SC), it is
   responsible for leading the Department's Technical Information Program
   (TIMP) and for providing direction and coordination for the
   dissemination of scientific and technical information (STI) resulting
   from DOE research and development (R&D) programs. In efforts to
   effectively disseminate STI, OSTI has produced EnergyFiles: The Virtual
   Library of Energy Science and Technology, which provides a vast array
   of information and resources pertaining to energy science and
   technology. The DOE Information Bridge, which allows access to
   full-text STI reports, PubSCIENCE, which provides access to scientific
   journal literature, and OSTI's newest product, the PrePRINT Network ,
   which provides a searchable gateway to preprint servers, are all
   components of EnergyFiles.

   OSTI also coordinates the Department-wide Scientific and Technical
   Information Program (STIP), a complex-wide collaboration to lead the
   Department in the Information Age.
