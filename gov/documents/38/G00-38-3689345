        Research Findings: Dynamic Evidence in Cancer Control (DECC)

      Dynamic Evidence in Cancer Control (DECC) includes an overview of
    evidence based cancer control, a window on grantee and other relevant
      projects and products, and access to the growing evidence base in
      cancer control, especially interventions. Building the DECC is an
                         ongoing, iterative process.

   Come out on the DECC and talk about ideas and issues on evidence based
   cancer control. This feature will be a lively and interactive forum for
                           the research community.
