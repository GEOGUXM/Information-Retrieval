   Introduction

   The Meson Test Beam Facility is a versatile beamline in which users can
   test equipment or detectors in a beam of moderate energy particles
   (5-120 GeV) at moderate intensities (<1 MHz).  Beamtime is available to
   qualified users as discussed below.

   Beamline Details

   MTest is the westermost beamline at Fermilab.  The user accessible
   areas for this beam are located in the Meson Lab.  A layout of the
   Meson Lab, MTest beamline elements and MTest user areas can be found
   here:
     * MTest Beamline Elements (ps, pdf)
     * MTest User Areas  (ps, pdf)
     * Meson Lab Autocad file (dxf)

   The MTest beamline was operated in 1999 for test purposes with an 800
   GeV primary energy and a description of the operation of that run is in
   this memo:
     * A New MTest Beamline for the 1999 Fixed Target Run
       T. Kobilarcik, C. Brown    (ps, pdf)

   An early outline for operation of MTest with Main Injector beam can be
   found here:

   A spreadsheet has been made by the beamline physicist, Tom Kobilarcik.
   Here is the latest version of this spreadsheet and the resulting
   predicted rates as a function of momentum.  (ps, html pdf)

   The Computing Division's Online Data Support group has made a proposal
   for the DAQ architecture:.  (ps, pdf)

   Request for Beamtime

   Fermilab will review requests from users through a test beam review
   committee, which will approve or reject the request.  Approved requests
   will be asked to make a more detailed plan resulting in a Memorandum of
   Understanding between the user and the laboratory. The test beam user
   will then obtain a test beam experiment number associated with that
   request.  Users will have to obtain a Fermilab User ID and pass various
   safety classes before using the beamline.
