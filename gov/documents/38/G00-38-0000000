                    Experimental and Parallel Model Runs



   This page links to graphics and other data from model experiments for
   the different branches of the EMC.  In no way do they represent
   operational forecasts, but we offer them so that meteorologists in the
   field may give us feedback on the results.  Diagnostic tools are used
   to analyze the date at EMC, and the results of this analysis are what
   appear as links below.

   Before going to the data, however, we suggest you read the following
   section, which discusses the experimental process, from how EMC
   uncovers a problem to the final "parallel" run, performed to remove the
   final "bugs" prior to operational implementation.


                How model changes get tested and implemented

   How do we determine what experiments to perform to improved the
   numerical weather prediction (NWP) model?

     * Through examination of existing model biases or error patterns, or
     * Through research done at NCEP or elsewhere which might improve an
       existing NWP model, using

     * new physical parameterizations,
     * new data assimilation methods, or
     * better resolution,

     Through anticipated increases in computer resources which drive
   decisions on what improvements can be implemented.

   Terms typically used for model experiments before model changes become
   operational include, in roughly chronological order from problem
   identification to pre-implementation:

     * case study (examine one weather event to diagnose model perfomance,
       for example)
     * sensitivity study (low-resolution model runs to see if a model
       change will have a significant positive or negative impact on model
       climate)
     * experimental runs (low-resolution forecasts without data
       assimilation, to check the changed model climate)
     * retrospective (usually in conjunction with model climate testing)
     * parallel (full data assimilation system at expected operational
       model resolution, with 'bundles' of experimental changes which have
       passed previous tests above)

     * How do all the planned changes interact together?
     * Assessment done by NCEP and field office Science and Operations
       Officers (SOOs)

     * Forecast impact of:

     * Amplification of changes and errors through the data assimilation
       system
     * Changes in old biases and errors
     * Effects on vertical motion (model spin-up)

     Accumulate vertification statistics for an objective comparison to
   existing operational model configuration Once these steps have been
   taken there are additional approvals required for NWP model changes to
   be made operational, at both EMC, NCEP, and NWS headquarters.

   A schematic of the full model change cycle can be found here [link will
   be activated to flowchart "Path to Operations" soon!].

Global modeling branch experimental runs:

     AVN/MRF:
     * Pete Caplan's near-realtime T170 parallel run diagnostics

     * Suru Saha's web page

     * Experiments to solve the AVN warm bias problem


       Each of these experiments are 45 day model runs, with the first 15
       days thrown away to account for model spin-up ("adjustment") to the
       model change.  Observations are NOT incorporated into the
       experiment except to determine the initial condition.  The
       experiments either involve the treatment of short and long-wave
       radiation in the atmosphere or the parameterization of surface
       processes like albedo or vegetation control over
       evapotranspiration.
       Diagnostic comparisons of model bias are made to the NCEP
       Reanalysis product for both experiment and  operational AVN (the
       control).  Graphics of both time series of regional area averaged
       model bias, and regional spatial distribution of model bias are
       shown.

     T170 parallel run test diagnostics (summer  1998 retrospective and
   winter 1998-99 concurrent experiments)
     * Climate parallel runs (climate version of the AVN/MRF run at coarse
       resolution)

     * Yuejian Zhu's experimental web page  (Comparison of AVN output grid
       data to observations)

   Includes comparisons from summer 1998 retrospective run, winter
       parallel runs for T170L42, and North American Observing System
       (NAOS) global experiments.


     Glenn White's systematic  differences and errors in the parallel test
   of T170/L42 in Feb. 1999

   Also includes diagnostics for parallel test from August 1998 (for
       summer comparison in addition to winter comparison).  Zonal means
       and regional differences are displayed.



      Glenn White's diagnostic comparison of old and new orography during
   February-March 1999

   This is a low-resolution (T62) set of experiments using a new
       orography.  The effect of the new orography is most marked on
       gravity waves and topographically forced long waves.



Mesoscale Modeling Branch experimental runs:

                                      Eta:


     * Experimental Eta runs

     * Parallel Eta-X.
     * Parallel Eta runs at 48-km resolution, including Kain-Fritch
       convection scheme test, and assimilated precipitation from
       multisensor analyses.
     * Kain-Fritch convective scheme

     * NSSL runs

   postprocessing Eta model data)
