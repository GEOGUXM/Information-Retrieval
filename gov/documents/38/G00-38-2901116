        Policy for adding and removing links on NN/LM National Web pages

   As a resource for our users, NN/LM maintains a variety of pages which
   list links to other Web sites. These lists include topics such as
   Internet search and discovery tools, NLM and other federal resources,
   network references, and links of general interest to library
   management. These lists are intended to be representative but not
   exhaustive, useful but not authoritative, fair but not necessarily
   impartial.

   We attempt to feature links to governmental, educational, and
   not-for-profit sites which in our judgment will have value for those
   who visit the NN/LM Web Site and use our lists. Recognizing that some
   valuable services are available exclusively from commercial sites
   (e.g., Web search tools, database vendor information, etc.), links to
   selected commercial sites are included to provide access to useful,
   free, educational resources. However, under no circumstances will we
   endorse commercial services or link to a site that is primarily
   fee-based. Links are selected based on: (a) the quality of the
   information found at the site; (b) the relevance of this information to
   the NN/LM program mission; and (c) the organization sponsoring the
   site.

   All links being considered for addition to or removal from existing and
   new NN/LM pages should be proposed to the NN/LM Web Team for
   consideration. Links may be nominated by any member of the NN/LM Web
   team. Nominations should include a brief statement describing the value
   of the link. Similarly, any member of the NN/LM Web team may propose
   removal of an existing link. All additions and removals are subject to
   comment and discussion among the NN/LM Web team for a minimum of two
   working days. Decisions are reached by team consensus.

   A link to this policy will be maintained on the affected "national"
   pages.
