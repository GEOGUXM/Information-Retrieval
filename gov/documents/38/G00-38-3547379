     Special Note: The World Wide Web contains many, many sites for
     Astronomy, many of which may be of interest to amateur astronomers.
     The ADC primarily serves the professional astronomy community.
     However, amateurs can find many of the ADC's catalogs useful for
     their hobby. This page includes information on using ADC resources
     for amateur astronomy and links to selected external resources that
     may be of interest. We are not responsible for the content of the
     external pages. If you have suggestions for additional links, please
     send them to the curators at the e-mail addresses listed at the
     bottom of the page. We regret that we may not be able to accommodate
     every such request. THE ADC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF
     EXTERNAL SITES LINKED FROM THIS PAGE.

   Amateur Astronomy Uses of ADC

  What type of stuff can I find here?

   The Astronomical Data Center specializes in archiving and distributing
   collections of data that have been published by professional
   astronomers. Most of these data sets are in the form of
   computer-readable tables of numbers, rather than images.

   Amateur astronomers can find these data collections useful in looking
   up the properties and locations of celestial objects. This can help
   amateurs plan for observing sessions, and help them to better
   understand what they've observed. Please see our Science Data page for
   information on accessing our data sets. Check out our ADC CD-ROMs which
   contain hundreds of astronomical catalogs.
   Where can I find:
     * The positions of the 100 brightest stars?
     * Stars identified by their Bayer, Flamsteed, or common
       (navigational) names?
     * The stars within 50 light years?
     * The twenty nearest stars?
     * Accurate modern positions for stars?
     * Information about Hipparcos catalogs?
     * Information about the Copernicus Atlases?
     * Information about the Messier Catalog?
