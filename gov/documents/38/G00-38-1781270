                       Reanalysis PSFC problem 1948-1967

   [new_btn.gif] Evaluation - Reruns for Jan, Jul 1953

   By pure serendipitity, a problem has been uncovered with the encoding
   of surface and mean sea level pressure that affect the period
   1948-1967. The problem originated in the erroneous conversion of a
   portion of the TD13 dataset into the bufr ADPSFC type messages. Surface
   pressures in the past have suffured from a "Y2K" like problem in that
   values were stored with 3 digits ,pp.p, and a flag that inicated which
   hundreds units should be added (700,800,900,1000,etc). The discovery
   arose from a case study of the Reanalysis handling of the North Sea
   Gale of Jan 31:Feb 2, 1953 In addition to the forecast and verication
   grids, Suru made observation plots where the data rejected by the Reanl
   were plotted in red. The PSFC 03Z Feb 1, 1953 revealed the problem.
   Most of the obs within the 1000mb contour were rejected for being
   unphysically high pressure values. The increment plots revealed they
   were ~100 mb too large. If one mentally replaces the leading "10" with
   a "9", the values create a reasonable picture of the cyclone.

   Once we saw that pattern, we told Jack Woollen what we had found, so
   that he could research the origin of these reports and the decoding
   procedures. Jack called back the next day and said he had found a
   tell-tail error in translating dataset TD13. Furthermore, it apeared
   that 4-6% of the surface obs in the set were affected.

   In order to assess the geographical distribution over time, I have made
   two sequences maps. I had created grib files of the obs with surface
   pressures greater than 1050mb. I then used these in conjuction with the
   files Wesley has made available for plot and for download, and computed
   the percentages of obs <1050mb. This approach gives a sense of the
   location and volume of obs that were miscoded.
   I sampled all the January files for each year 1948-1968. Dataset TD13
   ended in 1967. To see that the problem ended there see the file for Jan
   1968.

   This error has good news and bad news. The good news is that the "bad
   data" were omitted. The analyses are not contaminated. The error is one
   of omission, not comission.

   The bad news is that the omission of data is correlated with Northern
   Hemispere extratropical cyclones, thereby requiring the dynamics of the
   data assimilation process to completely determine the details of the
   surface pressure without the benefit of direct measurement when the
   pressure lowered below 1000 mb. In addition (and the source of the
   serendipity) European obs seems to bear the brunt of the problem,
   unlike US obs which were unaffected. Evaluation - Reruns for Jan, Jul

   A methodology to identify the miscoded sfc press and mslp obs proved
   more involved that I first thought.
    1. Read all sfc obs for all synoptic times
    2. Store sfc obs sorted by observed hour and location
    3. Do a time series analysis of locations that reported either
       pressure value over 1049.9 mb.
    4. Look for tendencies of adjacent times (restricted to no more than
       24 hrs) of 75mb. This kept cold Siberian highs from being viewed as
       mis-coded.
    5. Flag the "excesive" sequence.
    6. When flagged mslp/ unflagged sfc press found, check the mslp
       d-value minus sfcp d-value difference.
         a. Small (<25mb): flag psfc for correction
         b. Large (>75mb, usually ~100mb) psfc is ok
         c. Indeterminate (>25 and <75): flag for rejection.
    7. Write a synoptically time sorted file for the assimilation bufr
       editor to read and apply

   In order assess the impact of encoding error, a winter and summer month
   were rerun with corrected values of surface pressure. We chose Jan 1953
   and July 1953 arbitrarily. An assessment of the impact on the monthly
   mean surface presure fields is given here. It is my opinion that the
   error does not warrant a rerun.
