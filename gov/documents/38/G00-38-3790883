   Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about you
   from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of utmost
   importance to NASA.

      If you visit a NASA site...
        * To read or download information:
          We may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For
          example, we may count the number of visitors to the different
          sections of our site to help us make them more useful to visitors.
          Similar information is gathered for anonymous ftp, remote account
          login, or for other comparable types of connections.

        * To send us an E-mail:
          By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
          personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as in
          an official Freedom of Information Act request. We may store the
          name and address of the requester in order to respond to the
          request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your E-mail.

        * To register:
          Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information to
          fill out a registration form. For example, vendors looking for
          marketing opportunities by visiting our Electronic Grants or NASA
          Acquisition Internet Service sites may be asked to "register" to
          obtain copies of Requests for Proposals or other NASA
          opportunities. Other information which may be collected at these
          sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means,
          enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of
          providing better service to our customers.

   Accessibility Statement

      NASA Langley Research Center is dedicated to compliance with
      accessibility standards developed under Section 508 of the
      Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 794d). However, technical
      limitations occasionally prevent some information or data from being
      presented in a manner that is readily accessible to persons with
      certain disabilities. If you cannot access the information at a NASA
      Langley Research Center site, please contact the NASA Official or
      Curator responsible for the site and request an accessible format of
