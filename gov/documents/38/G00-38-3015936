Directors' Retreat Sets Course for Scientific Future

   By Ron Kolb

   As the new millennium approaches, Berkeley Lab's scientific future will
   be contingent upon how successfully it develops and nurtures new
   scientific programs with connections--linkages within the Laboratory as
   well as with partner institutions and facilities throughout the world.

   That was the theme that dominated discussions about the Laboratory's
   strategic scientific directions at the Division Directors' Annual
   Retreat, led by Laboratory Director Charles Shank on Aug. 16-18 in
   Bodega Bay.

   Emerging from the discussions was a set of actions that will help form
   the basis for updating Berkeley Lab's strategic plan.

   "Sometimes it's difficult to see the future beyond one year, given our
   preoccupation with urgent and immediate needs," Shank said. "But we
   have to know where we're going long-term if we want to continue our
   national leadership role in the research community. It is important to
   think about what we want to look like in 10 years, and what we have to
   do to get there."

   Shank said that the meeting produced a valuable framework and specific
   tasks for the coming year that build on the Lab's strongest
   capabilities for the future. While further work is needed to complete
   the long range vision, the meeting defined the areas to be developed
   and the task forces needed to take the essential next steps.

   Within the Lab's four core scientific areas, the following efforts will
   be pursued as part of a tactical plan over the next year:
     * Energy Sciences: 1. Developing an environmental beamline at the
       Advanced Light Source; 2. Organizing a Center for Actinides (heavy
       elements 90 to 104) with thrusts in chemical, environmental and
       nuclear sciences; 3. Building a research program on global climate
       change science; 4. Becoming a research center on national
       electricity reliability to address a deregulated environment.
     * General Sciences: 1. Pursuing a fusion Integrated Research
       Experiment (IRE) as a DOE effort for studying heavy ion drivers for
       inertial confinement fusion; 2. Encouraging a data analysis center
       for major international projects in physics and nuclear sciences;
       3. Initiating a task force for developing a strategy for Berkeley
       Lab to be a major leader in neutrino science.
     * Biosciences: 1. Encouraging a high-throughput protein
       crystallography program; 2. Establishing a task force for
       bioimaging opportunities at the Laboratory; 3. Initiating a task
       force on a Lab strategy for genome data management and data mining,
       especially in the post-sequencing period.
     * Computing Sciences: 1. Encouraging computational science of scale
       in climate change and combustion, as well as computational biology
       and computational materials sciences; 2. Evaluating the potential
       for a new scientific visualization initiative at Berkeley Lab.

   Two initiatives impacting x-ray science and the Advanced Light Source
   were also forwarded. A task force will be formed to develop a strategy
   and scientific case for a fourth generation light source. And the Lab
   will make a major investment to install three new "superbend" magnets
   at the ALS by 2001, contingent on a scientific review. These high-field
   superconducting dipole magnets will generate high-brightness x-rays for
   special applications in protein crystallography and for users in fields
   such as materials and earth sciences.

   Shank said these and other elements of the meeting discussions will be
   incorporated over the next few months into a new Laboratory Strategic
   Plan that will provide major directions for scientific program
   development and operational infrastructure for the next five years.

   "We have to think about life after Vision 2000," he said, referring to
   the title of the 1993 Strategic Plan. "We have made great progress over
   the last five years; in fact, we achieved most of our goals identified
   in that plan. Now it's time to create new initiatives, exploit our
   special capabilities and take advantage of our opportunities. I
   encourage our scientific staff to comment to division directors and to
   me on the directions we are undertaking."

Catching Gamma-Ray Bursters in the Act

   By Paul Preuss

   The universe is filled with mysterious events, none more awesome or
   enigmatic than gamma-ray bursts.

   "For a few hundredths of a second, gamma-ray bursters produce the most
   extreme flash of any astronomical object," says Bruce Grossan of the
   Physics Division. "A gamma-ray burst is likely to occur somewhere in
   the sky perhaps once a day, but until recently detectors have been
   primitive; the best they could do was point to a few degrees of sky and
   tell you, `it was somewhere over there.'"

   Accidentally discovered in 1967 by satellites looking for nuclear
   tests, gamma-ray bursts are so unpredictable, so evanescent, and so
   hard to pinpoint that nobody knows what causes them. Only on rare
   occasions have astronomers using the most powerful telescopes been able
   to associate gamma-ray bursts with optical emissions persisting a few
   days or more.

   Quicker response time should make it possible to catch dozens of
   bursters in the act and match more of them with objects that shine in
   wavelengths visible to the human eye. Using the Automated Patrol
   Telescope (APT) located at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia and
   operated by the University of New South Wales, Grossan and his
   colleagues, including Saul Perlmutter, have devised a rapid-response
   system that, within a few seconds, can train the telescope on the
   region of sky where sentinel satellites have detected a burst.

   "The APT is a modest-looking instrument, very squat," Grossan says,
   "but it combines a wide field of view with a wide CCD camera," which
   can presently cover a region of sky two by three degrees wide--roughly
   30 times the area of the moon.

   Three seconds after a burst, the APT receives a signal from one or more
   satellites and interrupts its regular observation program; within half
   a minute it fixes on the portion of sky where the trigger event
   occurred. Observations continue up to four days.

   "The operation is 90 percent automatic," says Grossan. "In fact, the
   most interesting gamma-ray bursts the APT observed on my last trip to
   Australia took place while I was at dinner."

   Those included two of the most unusual gamma-ray bursts astrono-mers
   have ever witnessed. An astonishingly bright burst last December was
   more than three-fourths as old as the universe itself--visible 12
   billion light years away.

   But the gamma-ray burster seen this year on April 25 in the southern
   constellation Telescopium was stranger by far, producing hundreds of
   thousands of times less peak gamma-ray energy. At only 140 million
   light years away, the event was much more recent. Shortly after it was
   detected a supernova bloomed at virtually the same spot.

   No gamma-ray burster has ever been identified with a supernova before.
   No supernova has ever produced more radio energy. The odds against a
   coincidence have been conservatively estimated at one in 10,000.

   One scenario calls for the highly asymmetric explosion of a star 35
   times as massive as the sun, which emits a jet of matter moving at a
   significant fraction of the speed of light--the source of the gamma-ray
   burst--while the remainder collapses into a black hole.

   "It's too soon to say what caused this event," Grossan says. "It could
   be completely new physics, something that comes along maybe once in the
   lifetime of a satellite like BeppoSAX," the Dutch-Italian satellite
   that detected the burst. "But our rapid-response system, working with
   NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, could find as many as two to five
   such events a year. Berkeley Lab is really poised to investigate this
   new kind of gamma-ray-bursting supernova and to find more
   optically-emitting gamma-ray bursters of all kinds than ever before."

   Photos: A gamma-ray burster seen April 25 was followed by a super-nova
   in the same spot (above). A new rapid-response system using Australia's
   Automated Patrol Telescope (below) may find up to five such rare events
   a year. (telescope.jpeg & supernova.jpeg)

New Technique Reveals Identity of Neighboring Atoms

   By Lynn Yarris

   In a development that holds much promise for future studies of surfaces
   and interfaces in solid materials--including magnetic, environmental,
   and biological systems--researchers at Berkeley Lab have successfully
   tested a method that not only directly determines the identity of a
   specific atom in a sample, but also directly determines the identities
   of its neighbors. Called MARPE, for Multi-Atom Resonant Photo Emission,
   this new technique was developed at the Advanced Light Source.

   "This is one of those rare occasions where you go after something and
   it turns out much better than you expected," says the leader of the
   MARPE research, Charles Fadley, a physicist affiliated with the
   Materials Sciences Division (MSD) and a professor of physics with UC
   Davis.

   Fadley is one of the world's foremost practitioners of photoelectron
   spectroscopy (PES), a technique in which an element in a sample is
   identified through the energies of the electrons it emits when excited
   by a beam of photons. PES is one of several soft x-ray-based
   spectroscopy or diffraction methods, that are element-specific, meaning
   they can be used to determine the identity of a central atom in an
   atomic structure. None of these methods, however, can be used to
   directly determine the types of atoms that neighbor this central atom.

   "MARPE is an effect in soft x-ray absorption that provides a direct
   probe of near-neighbor atoms," says Fadley. "It also gives scientists a
   new way of studying the chemical bonds between two or more different
   types of atoms."

   Like PES and other x-ray-based spectroscopy techniques, MARPE works
   because all atoms have characteristic energies that bind electrons to
   their inner or core levels (as opposed to their outer or valence
   levels). These energies, the minimum needed to excite a core electron,
   serve as "fingerprints" that can be used to identify the atom. The
   MARPE effect occurs when the energy of an incoming photon beam matches
   a specific core-level excitation energy of a neighbor atom to the atom
   being directly excited by the photons. The photons "resonate" with the
   core level of this neighbor atom, sharply intensifying the observed
   photoelectron signal emitted from the central atom. This neighbor atom
   resonance reveals the presence and identity of the neighboring atom.

   "It is like a chorus effect in which the neighboring atoms begin
   singing in tune and pass their collective excitement to the central
   atom," explains Fadley. "A preliminary theoretical analysis told us we
   would see this effect, but our theoretical predictions were about four
   times smaller than the experimental results."

   The MARPE effect was first observed in solid compounds containing metal
   oxides, with the measurements being made at what may be the world's
   most extensive surface science experimental station ever to be linked
   to a synchrotron radiation beamline. Designed and assembled under the
   leadership of Fadley and ALS scientist Zahid Hussain, this station
   contains, among other features, a photoelectron spectrometer that can
   be rotated through a 60 degree angle so as to record signal intensities
   above a surface for a choice of photon polarizations and sample
   orientations. The station is located at ALS beamline 9.3.2, a
   bend-magnet that produces photons between 30 and 1500 electron volts in
   energy.

   "This is an experiment that could only have been done with soft
   x-rays," says Fadley. The flux of the ALS beam, in combination with the
   unique capabilities of his experimental station, was also essential to
   the success of the project. "Without the rotational component of our
   spectrometer, we could not have recorded the two sets of data that
   confirmed the reality of the effect we observed."

   The metal-oxide results, which were reported in the July 31 issue of
   Science, indicated that MARPE should be sensitive to chemical bond
   types and distances and to magnetic order. Since the Science paper,
   Fadley's group has demonstrated that the effects should also be
   observable through x-ray fluorescence and Auger decay, which means
   MARPE should be applicable to a broad range of samples. Though tested
   so far on single crystals, MARPE should also be observable in
   non-crystalline materials. New measurements at the ALS by researchers
   from the University of Nevada also show that similar effects occur in
   gas-phase molecules.

   "MARPE should be applicable to any solid surface or interface
   containing elements that have a decent core level," Fadley says, "which
   means any element from beryllium on up the periodic table."

   Collaborating with Fadley on this project, in addition to Hussain, were
   Alexander Kay and Simon Mun, both with UC Davis and MSD, Elke Arenholz
   of UC Berkeley's Miller Foundation, Francisco Garcia de Abajo, a
   visiting scientist from the University of San Sebastian in Spain, MSD's
   Michel Van Hove, and Reinhard Denecke, now with Lund University in
   Sweden.

New Parking Permits and Enforcement Rules Will Be Implemented Starting Next
Month

   By Monica Friedlander

   Put yourself in the shoes of the security people waving you in at the
   gates each morning. To know who belongs and who doesn't they need to do
   a bit of detective work for each passing vehicle. Some of us have
   stickers plastered somewhere on our cars. Others have tags dangling
   from the rear-view mirror. Yet others shove a piece of cardboard
   somewhere on the dashboard. All this is about to change, however--and
   soon.

   Starting on Thursday, Oct. 15, new parking permits will be issued to
   all Lab employees, with the exception of motorcycle and bike riders.
   Effective Nov. 1, all current permits (except for motorcycle decals)
   will be invalid, according to Sue Bowen of the Lab's Site Access
   Office. And along with the new permits, strict enforcement of parking
   regulations will be implemented as well.

   The changes, Bowen says, are the result of recommendations made on July
   7 by the Parking Advisory Committee, an ad hoc group of Lab employees
   representing various Lab organizations. The recommendations were
   approved by Lab management.

   "We are working with the Facilities Department in an effort to reduce
   congestion and improve parking," said Bowen. The recommendations are
   part of a two-year phased approach, which also includes new incentives
   for carpooling and plans to improve shuttle service both on and
   offsite.

   "This will allow Site Access to establish a new baseline for eligible
   parking permit holders and determine the impact on parking
   availability," Bowen adds. "Once this baseline has been established, we
   will use this tool to look at the possibility of extending parking
   permits to employees not currently eligible."

   A more global assessment of parking needs and possible changes in
   permit eligibility will follow after the Site Access Office has had a
   chance to assess the impact of the first round of changes.

   Employees will have an opportunity to participate in two meetings--to
   be held at noon on Sept. 29 (Bldg. 66 auditorium) and Oct. 2 (Bldg. 50
   auditorium)--in which they will learn more about how to obtain the new
   permits and about the future direction of parking enforcement at
   Berkeley Lab.

  Obtaining Parking Permits

   Along with the new permits, a new, automated web-based system of
   applying for them is being inaugurated. Employees who do not have web
   access will have to contact their division administrator, business
   manager or other administrative support personnel, who will submit the
   form for them. (They may also visit the Badge Office on the lower level
   of Bldg. 65.) Computers will be set up for this purpose in the Lab
   cafeteria at noon the week of Oct. 12. But Site Access urges everyone
   with web access to apply using their own computer terminals.

   The online parking application form--to be completed no later than Oct.
   15--can be found on the Site Access website at
   http://www.lbl.gov/Workplace/site-access/parking/index.html. All fields
   on the form must be completed for each vehicle. To submit the
   application, click on the "save" button. Employees will be notified by
   the Site Access Office when the new permit is available for
   distribution through their division or at a designated location. More
   information will be provided in the next issue of Currents. A valid Lab
   ID, driver's license or old parking permit will be required for
   identification purposes.

   Eligible parking permit holders include (among others) career
   employees, UC faculty with dual employment on campus and Berkeley Lab,
   disabled persons working onsite, certain guests and national facility
   users, Department of Energy personnel, retired Laboratory staff, and
   visitors.

   A detailed description of the Lab's current eligibility rules and an
   explanation of the different parking categories can be found on the
   Laboratory's website at http://www.lbl.gov/Workplace/RPM/R1.04.html.

   A Parking Policy Committee was also established to review exceptions to
   the parking policy. All individuals who have been granted an exception
   to the parking policy will need to resubmit their request in writing to
   Sue Bowen. The requests will be reviewed by the committee, says Kent
   Ryden, a member of the Parking Policy Committee, and will be based on
   "extreme hardship or compelling business reasons."

  New Parking Enforcement

   According to Bowen, a new parking violation point system will be
   implemented starting Nov. 1. An accumulation of points will result in
   disciplinary actions up to and including loss of parking privileges
   and/or booting and towing of vehicles parked on the Hill. The Site
   Security Manager will continue to monitor and record parking violation
   notices and point accumulations.

   "We want to ensure that the parking policy is enforced equitably
   throughout the Lab's parking areas," said Don Bell, the Lab's security
   manager. "This program is similar to programs followed by the Lawrence
   Livermore Lab and SLAC at Stanford."

   All employees will receive a copy of the point system policy when they
   are issued their new parking permit. Notices explaining the policy will
   also be placed on bulletin boards throughout the Laboratory.

  Carpool incentives

   In an effort to reduce traffic onsite, the Laboratory is introducing
   new parking incentives for groups of three or more employees
   participating in a carpool. A special permit will be issued that will
   allow carpoolers to park in spaces designated for them. By requesting a
   carpool permit, however, employees forfeit individual parking
   eligibility. Only one permit will be issued to the group.

   Carpools for two or more employees will be allowed to park in a blue
   triangle spaces. Carpool members must live within the same geographic
   location and have the same working hours.

   "When circumstances arise that require you to drive alone," Bowen
   added, "you must notify Burns Security to avoid notice of parking
   violation. Abuse of the rules will result in loss of carpooling
   permit."

  Guaranteed Ride Home Program

   A representative from the Alameda Guaranteed Ride Home Program will be
   available at the Lab cafeteria on Sept. 28 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The
   program, available to employees who do not have parking privileges or
   carpool, guarantees public transit users a ride home from work when
   unexpected circumstances arise. Participants must be permanent
   employees, live within 100 miles of the Lab, and must preregister.

   Information on qualifying for the program and applications will be
   available in the cafeteria.

   For more information about parking regulations look up the Site Access
   website at http://www.lbl.gov/Workplace/site-access/parking/ or send an
   e-mail to Site Access manager Sue Bowen (ssbowen@lbl.gov).

   Parking website note:

   The parking permit application form, which is posted on line, is not a
   web form. It is linked to the HRIS (Peoplesoft database). The form
   takes a while to load and requires specific formatting. You will not
   receive a confirmation. Please read the instructions carefully and make
   sure not to click on "save" until all fields are complete, since saving
   is the same as submitting.

  House Science Panel Considering Merger of Three DOE Divisions

   Inside Energy has reported that House Science Committee Chairman F.
   James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), is working with panel Democrats on a
   bill that would merge DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
   division with the Fossil Energy and Nuclear Energy divisions, creating
   a new Office of Energy Technologies.

  Lab Operations Board Foresees Shortage of Research Managers

   A draft report from DOE's Laboratory Operations Board says the
   department faces an imminent shortage of qualified technical managers
   for its R&D programs.

   The report says a combination of factors, including the Strategic
   Alignment Initiative (SAI), are responsible for the shortage. SAI,
   which began in 1995 under former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, is a
   department-wide effort to reduce staff by 30 percent by FY2000.

   The report, "A Critical Analysis of Research and Development Technical
   Manager Positions," said DOE's assistant secretaries should play a
   greater role in developing plans to address the shortfall. But Energy
   Research Director Martha Krebs said such an approach would be
   insufficient. "R&D management is an important issue that needs to be
   addressed at the secretarial level," she said.

   LOB is a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board,
   created in 1995 by O'Leary to provide strategic direction to the labs.
   In this new report, the LOB says SAI-related reductions have affected
   the morale of many R&D managers in DOE. R&D managers are responsible
   for managing technical research, budget planning and program
   development.

   "The [R&D] corps has been left depleted and extremely discouraged about
   the future," the report said. "Due to continued downsizing...those who
   have remained are overwhelmed with work and often exhausted."

   The report found 41 percent of DOE's R&D managers will be eligible for
   retirement within the next five years. At the same time, the supply of
   qualified replacements "is virtually empty."

   To illustrate this point, there are 88 R&D managers within ER, of whom
   33 are eligible to retire by the end of the year. If many of the
   managers chose to retire, "the situation would become a crisis,"
   according to the LOB report.

Human Genome Project Two Years Ahead of Schedule

   The Department of Energy and other agencies involved in the federal
   effort to sequence and map the human genome say the project will be
   completed by 2003, two years ahead of schedule.

   Ari Patrinos, associate director of DOE's Office of Biological and
   Environmental Research, says the department will meet the goals of the
   Human Genome Project (HGP) without having to change its long-term
   funding requests. DOE is seeking $85.3 million in Fiscal Year 1999 for
   HGP, as compared to $84.9 million in FY98.

   The project, which began in 1990, is a 15-year, $3-billion
   collaboration among several federal agencies, including DOE and the
   National Institutes of Health, to decipher the human genetic code. This
   entails sequencing the three billion pairs of human DNA and mapping the
   location of genes. Scientists would use this data from the mapping to
   better understand the nature of diseases and develop new therapies.

   Critics say the HGP is moving too slowly, but Patrinos says the
   scientific and technological advances made in the last 18 months mean
   DOE will meet its part of the project within its funding targets and
   ahead of schedule. According to Patrinos, the department has mapped
   about four percent of the genome, a 15-fold increase from last year,
   and will have a working draft of the genome by 2001.

   "This draft will consist of 90 percent of the genome," Patrinos said.
   "The remaining portion would be completed by 2003."

   Several private companies concerned about HGP's timetable have started
   their own mapping efforts. Patrinos says DOE is well aware of the
   private sector's decoding efforts, but these efforts are not the
   determining factor in accelerating the timetable.

   "We're are not in a reactive mode to what is occurring around us," he
   said. "Science proceeds at its best when competition, as long as it's
   not destructive, is present."

Koshland Wins Lasker Award

   Daniel E. Koshland, Jr., former long-time editor of Science magazine
   and now a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology at UC
   Berkeley, who also holds an appointment with Berkeley Lab's Materials
   Sciences Division, has won this year's Albert Lasker Award for Special
   Achievement in Medical Science.

   The prestigious Lasker Awards are called "America's Nobels," and many
   of its recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. This award is
   presented in honor of Koshland's lifelong contributions to the field of
   medical science.

   "It's a good award and I am very pleased. It's nice to know that people
   think what you did was important," Koshland said.

   Koshland, 78, continues to teach and conduct research at the university
   where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1941. He also serves on the
   council for the National Academy of Sciences.

   In the 1980s Koshland headed up a decade long campaign to modernize UC
   Berkeley's biological sciences. This included combining the campus' 12
   small biology departments into three large ones, raising funds for two
   new biology buildings (including Koshland Hall, named for him in 1992),
   and completely renovating a third.

   From 1985 to 1995 he served as editor of Science magazine, the
   country's largest circulation scientific journal. During his editorship
   he made several major changes--such as the appointment of scientists
   with Ph.Ds, rather than writers, to the editorial board. This meant
   that published articles were chosen for their scientific excitement
   rather than verbal perfection.

   When he started as editor Koshland often relied on his friends for
   article submissions; by the time he left the magazine, nine articles
   were rejected for each one printed.

   In 1995, Koshland left Science to return to his UC Berkeley laboratory.
   In his 33 years as a UC Berkeley researcher and professor, Koshland has
   produced major advances in the understanding of enzymes and protein
   chemistry. Best known is his "induced fit theory," which postulates
   that enzymes change shape (like a glove when a hand is shoved into it)
   as they react with other molecules.

   For this and other research, he received the National Medal of Science
   in 1990.

   Currently, Koshland is studying the chemical reactions involved in
   Alzheimer's disease by analyzing changes in brain cells. He is also
   trying to make better catalysts by modifying enzymes.

   Calendar Migration

   A series of brown-bag seminars and training classes have been scheduled
   to familiarize employees with the new Netscape Calendar application,
   which debuts Wednesday, Oct. 14.

   The new electronic scheduling system will replace Meeting Maker, which
   will be shut down on Nov. 16. The new system is part of the Mercury
   Project, an overall upgrade of messaging and calendaring applications
   used by Lab employees. The Computer Infrastructure Technology Group in
   the Information and Computing Sciences Division is leading the project.

   Netscape Calendar will be rolled out to the Lab on Oct. 14 for all
   users who currently have Meeting Maker accounts to move their Meeting
   Maker schedules to the new system. All Meeting Maker entries scheduled
   to occur after Nov. 15 will have to be rescheduled in Calendar as new
   entries.

   Everyone with a Meeting Maker account will automatically receive a
   Nescape Calendar account. Anyone who wishes to have a Calendar account
   and is not currently on Meeting Maker can request one after Oct. 14 at
   http://www.lbl.gov/mercury/calacctform.htm.

   General information regarding the Calendaring portion of the Mercury
   Project can be found on the web at http://www.lbl.gov/mercury/
   calendar.htm.

   An overview of the new system will be offered at each of six noontime
   brown-bag seminars to be held in the Bldg. 50 auditorium starting
   Wednesday, Oct. 7, and continuing each Thursday through Nov. 12.

   A free 10-page reference guide is also available for either PC or
   Macintosh users. Copies will be distributed at brown-bag seminars, at
   the cafeteria, and to anyone requesting a copy. (Call X5834 or use the
   web form at http://www.lbl.gov/mercury/reqquickref.htm.)

   More extensive training will also be given in four-hour classes
   presented by AIM at the Laboratory. Users of PCs can see the current
   class schedule or sign up for AIM classes via the Employee Development
   and Training web page at
   http://www.lbl.gov/Workplace/EDT/computers/PC_Classes.html.

   Several Macintosh-based Calendaring classes are also planned, with the
   dates being currently finalized. That schedule will be available on
   Netscape Calendaring web page.

   For more information employees may also call the IMAP4/Calendaring
   Hotline at 486-5834 or the help desk at 486-HELP (486-4357).

Exploration Camp Makes Science Fun

   By Eli Kintisch

   "Whenever I think of oatmeal cookies, I think of metamorphic rocks,"
   says Debra Jockisch, a sixth grade science teacher at Orinda
   Intermediate School, as she pours a cup of flour into a bowl. The kids
   react with ooh's and ahhs.

   "So if this was a yellow rock and we mix it in, what happens?" she
   asks. Campers manning the bowl pour in the butter and sugar mixture.

   Nate Levin, a budding geologist at the age of nine, offers an
   explanation. "See under the earth, the rocks get heated up, get soft
   and gooey," he says. "When they harden the shape is permanent."

   And so goes another lesson at the annual Science Exploration Camp.
   Founded four summers ago, the camp's purpose is to provide an
   educational summer camp alternative for children of Laboratory
   employees. Thirty children in second-through-sixth grade took part
   during each of the six weeks.

   This summer's sessions were held from July 27 through Sept. 4 at
   Berkeley Lab and the Lawrence Hall of Science. In the afternoons, the
   campers enjoyed swimming at Strawberry Canyon, hiking in Tilden Park,
   and excursions to the UC Botanical Gardens and Volcanic Park in Sibley.
   The most popular activity was building forts at Berkeley Marina's
   Adventure Playground.

   Whether building circuits with batteries or streaking agar plates to
   learn about bacteria, the children at SEC are learning by doing. The
   underlying philosophy of the camp is to use hands-on demonstrations and
   outdoor camp activities to turn kids on to science.

   The week's theme for Jockisch's cookie & geology session was "The Earth
   Rocks," and judging from the giggles and steady eyes, the youngsters
   would never admit they were learning. Heavens no! It's the activities
   that kept them coming--as creative and tasty as baking
   oatmeal/metamorphic rocks.

   "We have a lot of fun together," says Jockisch. "You're much freer with
   the kids over the summer since there are no tests."

   Instead of a strict curriculum, the summer brims with a potpourri of
   activities. Jockisch follows a loose program that keeps the kids
   engaged in each session's scientific theme. Weekly themes this summer
   included topics such as chemistry, energy, light and matter, microbes,
   and water world.

   Moreover, the camp is a summer treat for parents, too. "For me it's
   great," said Environmental Health and Safety's Carla Garbis, mother of
   MacKenzie Turner. "It's an opportunity to have her with you at lunch
   time. Normally you don't get a chance to do that. Also, it's a chance
   for them to see what mommies and daddies do at work."

   While the camp is primarily intended for Lab families, about one third
   of the children are from the community. Lab parents have priority in
   registering their children, with UC parents and members of the public
   able to sign up their children later on a space-available basis.

   The cost for this year's camp was $160 to $175 (depending on
   registration time) and included field trips and activities. Camp
   organizers urge parents at the Lab to get involved as volunteers for
   next year's program.

   The camp was founded by Lab employees Dianna Attia, Margaret Carroll,
   Tammy Campbell, Glen Dahlbacka, Jil Geller, Janet Jacobsen, and Jim
   Lutz. For more information or to volunteer send e-mail to sciencecamp@
   lbl.gov. n

Slogan Contest Determines Safety Themes for Lab Posters

   To help kick off EH&S Safety Awareness Month, the division conducted a
   safety slogan contest soliciting creative slogans to be used for Lab
   safety posters. The effort is the result of a collaboration between
   TEID and the EH&S Training Support staff. Eleven winning slogans were
   chose from nearly 100 entries. Prizes included restaurant gift
   certificates, parking permits, Lab shirts, and an oil and lube from
   Honda of El Cerrito.

   Below are the winning slogans and their authors. The first two slogans,
   selected as top choices, will appear alternately on every poster. The
   other nine slogans will be featured on individual posters accompanied
   by related photos of staff safety scenes.

   [Sep-25-19982.gif]

   Slogans were received from 14 other Lab employees. EH&S would like to
   congratulate everyone for their participation and enthusiasm.

Flea Market ad policy

   Due to the large volume of ads received each week, ads are accepted
   only from LBNL employees, retirees, and on-site DOE personnel. No other
   ads will be accepted. We encourage past contributors to the Flea Market
   to use other local services, such as LBNL's online housing listing
   (call X6198 for information), and the UC Housing Office.

   Please note also:
     * The deadline for ads is 5 p.m. Friday for the following week's
       issue.
     * Ads must be submitted in writing, via e-mail (fleamarket@lbl.gov),
       fax (X6641), or delivery/mail to Bldg. 65B. No ads will be taken
       over the phone.
     * No ads will be accepted without your name, affiliation, Lab
       extension, and home telephone number. You may ask that only one
       number appear in the ad.
     * Only items of your own personal property may be offered for sale.
     * Ads for material for resale in connection with a business will not
       be accepted.
     * No ads for services will be taken.
     * Ads will run one week only unless resubmitted in writing. Ads will
       be repeated only as space permits, and at the discretion of
       Currents. If an item does not sell in a reasonable time period, we
       retain the right to terminate the ad.
