                               On August 21, 1920, a divisional form of organization for the
   Bureau of Investigation was adopted to meet the needs of the United
   States Attorneys.

       As a result, Atlanta, Georgia, was designated as one of nine
   Division Headquarters with Mr. Billups Harris serving as Division
   Superintendent.  The territory covered by the office included Alabama,
   Florida, Georgia, the Eastern Judicial District of Louisiana,
   Mississippi, the Western District of North Carolina, Puerto Rico, and
   South Carolina.

       Today, under the leadership of Special Agent in Charge, Theodore
   Jackson, the Atlanta Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
   continues its commitment to public service.  The Atlanta Division has
   demonstrated exceptional success in its primary charge, combating
   criminal activity through the BureauÂ’s investigations, programs, and
   law enforcement services.  Press releases regarding some of these
   successes are available.  Beyond its investigative responsibilities,
   the Atlanta Division provides valuable services to victims and
   witnesses of federal crimes.  Finally, Atlanta Division employees are
   committed to volunteering significant time and resources through
   community outreach programs.
