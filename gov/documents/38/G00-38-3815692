Cervical Cancer and Pap Test Information



     Find out where you can get a free or low-cost mammogram and Pap test.

   Cervical cancer is nearly 100 percent preventable, yet according to the
   American Cancer Society, an estimated 13,000 new cases of invasive
   cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 2002 and about 4,100 women will
   die of the disease. The good news is that cervical cancer is
   preventable and curable if it is detected early; in fact, the
   occurrence of deaths from cervical cancer has declined significantly
   over the last 20 to 30 years.

   Cervical cancer rates are higher among older women; however, cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia (or CIN), the precursor lesion to cervical
   cancer, most often occurs among younger women. Screening younger women
   using the Papanicolaou (Pap) test is an important strategy that can
   actually prevent cervical cancer from developing almost 100 percent of
   the time.

   Studies that have identified risk factors associated with cervical
   cancer have shown that cervical cancer is closely linked to
     * failure to receive regular Pap test screening
     * human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
     * certain sexual behaviors (see paragraph below)
     * immunosuppressive disorders such as HIV/AIDS

   Experts agree that infection with certain strains of the HPV is one of
   the strongest risk factors for cervical cancer. The sexual behaviors
   specifically associated with greater risk are intercourse at an early
   age, multiple male sexual partners, and sex with a male partner who has
   had multiple sexual partners. Experts also agree that one of the most
   important things women can do to reduce their risk of cervical cancer
   is to receive regular screening with a Pap test.

   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has in place an
   independent panel of experts in primary care and disease prevention
   called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (1996). This task force
   systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness and develops
   recommendations for clinical preventive services. Currently, the task
   force recommends routine screening for cervical cancer for all women
   who are or have been sexually active and who have a cervix:
     * Pap testing should begin with the onset of sexual activity.
     * Pap testing should be repeated at least every 3 years.

   There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against an upper age
   limit for Pap testing, but recommendations can be made on other grounds
   to discontinue regular testing after age 65 in women who have had
   regular previous screenings in which the smears have been consistently
   normal.

   There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine
   screening with cervicography, routine screening with colposcopy, and
   screening for human papilloma virus infection, although recommendations
   against such screening can be made on other grounds.

   Many organizations, including the American Cancer Society, National
   Cancer Institute, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
   American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians,
   and others also recommend that Pap testing should
     * begin annually at the onset of sexual activity or at age 18 and
     * continue less frequently at the discretion of the doctor and
       patient after three or more annual tests have been normal.

   Women who are past menopause (change of life) still need to have
   regular Pap tests. However, women who have undergone a hysterectomy in
   which the cervix was removed do not require Pap testing, unless the
   hysterectomy was performed because of cervical cancer or its
   precursors.
