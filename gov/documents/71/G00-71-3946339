   Interconnection Contacts

   Western accepts requests from electric utilities, firm-power customers,
   private power developers, and independent power generators to
   interconnect with its transmission system. Interconnection is a
   separate but parallel process to the transmission service request
   process detailed in Westerns Open Access Transmission Service Tariff
   (63 FR 521), the environmental review process outlined in the U.S.
   Department of Energys National Environmental Policy Act Implementing
   Procedures and Westerns land acquisition process. These processes may
   share steps in order to ensure an efficient interconnection. Western
   tries to make the separate processes as seamless as possible.

   We evaluate each request for interconnection separately and were
   subject to meeting reasonable needs of the requesting entity. Western
   assumes responsibilities to operate and maintain its interconnected
   facilities.

   Direct interconnection to Westerns facilities does not involve nor
   guarantee transmission capacity on Westerns system. Transmission
   service requests must be made following Westerns Open Access
   Transmission Service Tariff.

   For detailed information on the interconnection process, see the
   General Requirements for Interconnections booklet.
