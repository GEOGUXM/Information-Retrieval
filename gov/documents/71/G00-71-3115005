                              The tkbiff Home Page

   tkbiff is yet another program to alert you to incoming mail. tkbiff
   allows arbitrary commands to be executed upon mail reception. If you
   like programs like xbiff++ but wish they were more flexible, then
   you'll like tkbiff. For example, suppose you want to play your favorite
   song when you get mail that mentions "windsurfing" but play a groan
   when you get mail from your manager unless you're mentioned in the cc
   in which case don't play anything. This kind of thing is easy to do
   with tkbiff. [tkbiff.gif] tkbiff also doesn't waste your valuable
   screen space with icons - instead, it shows you the mail itself. (If
   this image were live, clicking on a message in the graphic would bring
   up that message.)

   tkbiff is fully customizable. If you want to change the appearance of
   tkbiff or the way it behaves, it is easy to do.

   tkbiff runs on Windows, NT, MacOS, and UNIX and supports IMAP, POP,
   APOP, SSL, TLS and UNIX-style mail files and directories.

   tkbiff comes with a very pleasant default configuration. The default
   configuration is aimed at three things:
     * Speed and Convenience
       tkbiff lets you browse mail with a single mouse click -
       particularly convenient if you normally use heavy-duty mail readers
       (such as Outlook Express, Messenger, and Emacs VM) which can be
       slow and in states where it is inconvenient to rearrange window
       configurations just to peek to see if a mail message is worth
       spending more time looking at.
     * Feedback and Flexibility
       Playing a sound is traditional - providing a fast way of finding
       out who mail is from without having to shuffle through windows or
       look at the screen in the first place. But tkbiff can do other
       things on receipt of a message: pop it up automatically, display
       the sender's icon, or even order pizza.
       tkbiff can also decide what to do based on the sender, whether you
       were listed in the To: line (versus Cc:), or how many times the
       word "pizza" was mentioned (and if it was cheese or pepperoni).
     * Minimal screen real-estate
       tkbiff avoids unnecessary frills such as mailbox icons or postage
       stamp icons or borders inside of borders inside of borders. All you
       see is your mail and in a clear, obvious, and accessible way. Of
       course, if you really want glorious 3d highlights, huge fonts, lots
       of borders, animations, etc., tkbiff can provide that too.

   The current version of tkbiff is 3.11

Technical Hype

     * tkbiff runs on UNIX, Windows, and MacOS.
     * tkbiff supports SSL/TLS (encryption and certification) connections.
     * tkbiff supports IMAP and POP. Sockets are not left idle.
     * tkbiff supports (but does not require) the optional POP commands:
       UIDL, TOP (for efficiency) and APOP (for security).
     * tkbiff supports (but does not require) the optional IMAP command:
       STARTTLS.
     * tkbiff supports UNIX mail formats (Maildir, mbox, mboxrd, mboxo,
       mboxcl, mboxcl2) and interoperates with all known mail clients.
     * tkbiff is fully event-driven and includes an easy to use trace
       facility. So if tkbiff seemingly hangs, you can ask what it's
       waiting for and it will tell you. (Great for giving your ISP clear
       and constructive suggestions about their flakey network or
       misbehaving IMAP server!)
     * tkbiff requires no special permissions to install or run.
     * tkbiff needs no compilation.
     * tkbiff won't interfere with other biffs. You can let your old biff
       continue running if you want to compare them side by side.
     * tkbiff understands problematic mail such as missing or duplicate
       message ids, bare From lines, directories that live on caching NFS
       servers, etc.
     * tkbiff understands mail clients such as elm which do creative
       things with file access times or temporarily remove messages and
       then put them back.
     * tkbiff can be used to monitor multiple mail files simultaneously.
     * tkbiff can monitor new or old mail files. (Some people find tkbiff
       so convenient that they use it as a fast browser on static mail
       files or folders.)
     * tkbiff's configuration file is portable. So your configuration will
       work the same way on all platforms (unless, of course, you
       configure it not to :-)
     * tkbiff can take advantage of any system-specific features. (If you
       want to have tkbiff control your proprietary audio player, tkbiff
       will be happy to do so.)
     * If you design a nifty configuration, you can redistribute tkbiff
       with your configuration.
     * tkbiff understands all the usual X arguments (-display, etc) and
       has built-in support to redirect audios back to the client when
       running remotely.
     * tkbiff can be used in public environments - where the OS doesn't
       know who you are. In such situations, tkbiff records no identifying
       information and will prompt for it by default.
     * For most sites, tkbiff takes about 1 minute to install.
     * tkbiff can run with or without a GUI - or totally without a
       user-interface (i.e., as an autonomous agent).

Technical Anti-Hype

   Here are some things about tkbiff that some people might not like.
     * tkbiff does not presently support IMAP's AUTHENTICATE command.
       (tkbiff does however support IMAP's STARTTLS command as well as
       pre-secured SSL/TLS channels (a la SSLwrap) for either IMAP or
       POP.)
     * tkbiff does not presently support MH (a mail format specific to
       UNIX). MH users are welcome to send me patches for tkbiff. They
       appear to be pretty easy, although I figure all mh users use exmh
       already which gives complete control of the GUI in the same way
       that tkbiff does.
     * Fully customizing tkbiff requires an editor rather than a GUI. GUIs
       are great for simple configurations but people often hit a wall
       with GUIs, finding that:
          + they can't configure a tool the way they want
          + they can't understand why their configuration doesn't work
          + they can't switch or cut/paste between different
            configurations easily
          + they can't share configurations with other users
          + they can't view the configuration GUI while they test out
            their new configuration
          + etc.
       Compared to other mail notification tools, you'll find that tkbiff
       is more flexible and understandable because tkbiff uses a
       configuration script rather than forcing everything through a GUI.
     * tkbiff requires Tcl and Tk. They are freely available from
       Scriptics.

If you're already using an older version of tkbiff

   This version of tkbiff (version 3) does not support configuration files
   created for tkbiff 2. For most people, it will only take 1 minute to
   cut and paste their preferences from the old config file to their new
   one. If you're not sure which tkbiff you've been running, don't worry -
   tkbiff will autodetect which version your configuration file expects
   and warn you only if there's a problem.

Downloading tkbiff

  . . . for UNIX

Get tkbiff.tar.Z or tkbiff.tar.gz. The gz file is preferrable simply because it
is quicker to download. However, if you have no idea what to do with a gz file
once you've got it, just transfer the Z version of the distribution. Then, at
the command line, type:

 uncompress < tkbiff.tar.Z | tar xvf -

   This will create a directory containing the tkbiff distribution. Change
   to that directory and read the INSTALL file.

. . . for Windows and MacOS

   tkbiff works well on Windows and MacOS, but a nice package for shipping
   it has not yet been constructed. For now, grab the files one at a time.
   (Fortunately, there aren't that many required files - in fact, there's
   only one!)

   tkbiff.tcl THIS IS IT - the file to download for Windows or MacOS.
   Note: if you've got the Tcl plugin loaded in your browser, you'll have
   to shift-click when fetching to avoid it being executed!
   INSTALL After downloading (see above), read these installation
   instructions.
   example audios Audios used in the example tkbiff configuration - you
   needn't take any - but they're supplied for completeness sake.
   documentation No need to get these files manually - they will be
   downloaded automatically as necessary. But you can browse them now if
   you like.

   Once you've downloaded the file(s), read the installation instructions.

Reasons to upgrade - recent improvements for old users

     * The main window bindings now work in message windows, too. So if a
       message window pops up under your cursor, you can get rid of it
       without going back to the main window (or keyboard).
     * You can now scroll message windows from the keyboard (even if you
       are already holding down the temporary popup button) - space to go
       forwards a page, backspace (and delete) to go back. (Scrollbar or
       panning still works, of course.)
     * Other bug fixes and improvements. See History for details.

Documentation

   There's a lot of documentation for tkbiff. Fortunately, most people
   will be able to use tkbiff without looking at any of it!

Support

   Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
   interested to hear about your experiences using it (good or bad). I'm
   also interested in hearing bug reports and suggestions for improvement
   even though I can't promise to implement them.

   If you send me a bug, fix, or question, include the version of tkbiff
   (as reported by <?>), version of Tcl and Tk, and name and version of
   the OS that you are using. Before sending mail, it may be helpful to
   verify that your problem still exists in the latest version.

   Awards, love letters, and bug reports may be sent to:
