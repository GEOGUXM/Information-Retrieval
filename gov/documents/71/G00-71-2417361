   In the latest release of ePAVE 4.0, the USPTO is proud to announce the
    introduction of two brand new features! First, applicants will now be
   able to use ePAVE 4.0 to file provisional patent applications. Second,
   the new release enables the applicant to file multiple assignments with
   or without a new patent application filing. We thank you for continuing
    to use the ePAVE software for your submissions. >> Download the ePAVE
                                   4.0 <<

   Check the System Alerts for announcements of all planned and unplanned
                     outages of Online Business systems.

What is EFS?

   EFS is electronic system for submitting patent applications, computer
   readable format (CRF) biosequence listings, and pre-grant publication
   submissions to the USPTO via the Internet.

   It includes

     * authoring tools to help the applicant prepare a patent
       specification in XML format
     * a software package called ePAVE (electronic packaging and
       validation engine) to assemble the various parts of the application
       and transmit the application to USPTO over the Internet
     * a digital certificate to secure the transmission of the application
       to the USPTO

What type of submissions can be filed with EFS?

   EFS can be used to submit
     * New utility patent applications
     * Biosequence listings for applications previously filed in paper
     * Pre-grant publication resubmissions for previously filed
       applications, where the applicant wants an amended, redacted,
       voluntary, or republication specification to be published rather
       than the application as originally filed
     * Provisional applications
     * Multiple assignments

   At this time EFS does not accept

     * Design applications
     * New plant applications
     * Reissue applications
     * International Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications
     * Reexamination requests
