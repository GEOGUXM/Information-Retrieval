      Anthrax (posted 10/16/01)
      _____________________________________________________

      This "Special Notice" is from NASA Headquarters.
      Point of Contact: Catherine Angotti, Code AM, 202-358-1794.
      ---------------------------------------------------------

      What Is Anthrax?
      Anthrax is a rare disease that occurs usually in animals in most
      continents. The bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, can infect humans through
      physical contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Because of the bacteria's
      ability to form spores (like dormant seeds), anthrax is one of the
      agents that could be used for Biological warfare.

      What Are the Symptoms of Anthrax?
      Between 1-6 days after exposure, symptoms can occur. Contact symptoms
      initially start out as bump like an insect bite, which develops within
      1-2 days into a vesicle or blister and then a painless ulcer 1-3 cm in
      diameter. Similar to some spider bites, a black dry necrotic area then
      develops and can be associated with local lymph gland swelling.
      Ingestion symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, fever,
      then abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea. Inhalation
      symptoms are those similar to a common cold (fever, fatigue,
      occasionally a dry cough and chest discomfort) that can initially
      improve. Symptoms can progress to abrupt development of severe
      respiratory distress with shortness of breath, sweating, and cyanosis.
      Survival--if untreated--after symptoms range from 75% for skin
      infections to only about 10% for pulmonary infections. Exposure to a
      minimum number of Anthrax spores is necessary for infection to occur.
      Experts think about 8,000 spores are necessary for infection to occur.
      Anthrax is NOT contagious. Anthrax CANNOT be passed from one person to
      another.

      Prevention/Prophylaxis/Treatment
      The best way to treat Anthrax is to prevent exposure. If a package or
      postal mail looks abnormal, then think twice about handling it or
      opening it. It may be helpful to have gallon size zip-lock bags
      available in areas where mail is opened. If something contains a
      powdery substance that might possibly be Anthrax, then avoid handling
      it and slip it into the plastic bag and seal it. Avoid touching your
      eyes, or mouth, and wash your hands well with soap and water as soon as
      possible. Notify the appropriate authorities immediately.

      If a possible exposure occurs, then testing for the presence of Anthrax
      is accomplished by nasal swabs and, if possible, by blood test.
      Following testing, a common antibiotic--usually 500 mg. of
      Cyprofloxacin twice a day--is prescribed. This prophylactic therapy is
      very effective in preventing development of disease. Once prophylactic
      antibiotic therapy is begun, current convention requires continuing for
      60 days. Antibiotics should NOT be taken unless there is credible
      indication of exposure to Anthrax because of potential side effects and
      development of resistance in many bacteria currently sensitive to these
      drugs.

      NASA health care officials will update employees with further
      information, as it becomes available.
