   May 14, 1999 New Mars rover FIDO works like a dog By MARY HARDIN It is
   the ultimate test drive for the newest otherworldly vehicle. A few
   practice spins around an ancient lake bed in the Mojave Desert late
   last month with the next-generation Mars rover are helping JPL and NASA
   scien- tists and engineers learn more about driving the real thing on
   Mars. "It's pretty exciting out here. We want to rack up a lot of miles
   and see how far this rover can go," said Dr. Raymond Arvidson, a geolo-
   gist from Washington University in St. Louis and mission director for
   the `end-to-end' field tests, which used systems similar to what will
   be used on Mars. "These test drives will help ensure that we will have
   a successful Mars rover mission," he said. Future robotic rovers on
   Mars-which are being built and tested by JPL-will need to find the best
   rocks to bring back to Earth, samples that are likely to contain the
   evidence scientists need to prove that life once existed on the red
   planet. To find the best sample, scientists need a good retriever. In
   late April they tested the work horse, er, dog, named FIDO-Field BOB
