      Patient Advocate, Martin Gallegos

      As the Patient Advocate, it is my job to take the steps necessary to
      inform and assist consumers who are enrolled in a Health Maintenance
      Organization (HMO). I would like you, as an enrollee, to learn about
      your rights and responsibilities as an HMO health plan member. Also, I
      would like you to learn how to best exercise your health care rights to
      ensure that you receive the health care to which you are entitled under
      California law.

      The inspired leadership of Governor Gray Davis, California legislators,
      consumer advocates, and many other committed individuals has assured
      that the health care of Californians' is protected. Many laws have been
      written to ensure patients' health care rights. It is for this reason
      that, as the Patient Advocate, I call upon all HMO plan enrollees to
      help in our efforts to protect your health care rights and the rights
      of your loved ones. In order for us to best assist you, you need to be
      aware of your health care rights under the law. You must become an
      active participant in obtaining the health care you deserve.
