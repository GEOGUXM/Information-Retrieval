      The USGS-funded WEBB program is aimed at improving understanding of
      processes controlling terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical
      fluxes, their interactions, and their relations to climatic variables;
      and the ability to predict continental water, energy, and
      biogeochemical budgets over a range of spatial and temporal scales
      (Lins, 1994, Hirsch, 1998). The Luquillo WEBB research project is a
      cooperative effort led by USGS Caribbean District and USGS National
      Research Program researchers. Other WEBB research sites are located in
      Colorado, Georgia, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

      The Luquillo WEBB research project is presently calculating water,
      energy, carbon, nutrient, dissolved-constituent, and sediment
      (suspended and bed load) budgets in four watersheds located in eastern
      Puerto Rico. Two of the watersheds are in tropical rain forest in the
      Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), an 11,300 hectare forest preserve
      administered by the U.S Forest Service. Two additional watersheds are
      located in the agriculturally-developed and partially urbanized Rio
      Grande de Loiza basin. See location map.

      The four watersheds are being compared and contrasted according to
      dominant land use (forested versus developed) and lithology (intrusive
      bedrock versus volcaniclastic bedrock) Click here to see watershed
      photographs . The sites are instrumented with streamflow,
      meteorological, soil, and ground-water monitoring and sampling
      equipment. Some of the principal study objectives are the comparison of
      chemical weathering, erosion, and mass wasting processes in an
      environment with a history of anthropogenic modification and periodic
      extreme hydrologic events associated with the passage of hurricanes.
      Luquillo WEBB publications describe a variety of topics including
      watershed-scale water and sediment budgets, surface runoff, hillslope
      processes and sources of fluvial sediment, slopewash, soil creep, tree
      throw, and landsliding. In addition, budgets of all aqueous
      constituents are being developed.

      The Luquillo WEBB project welcomes interested researchers and has
      collaborated with university and government scientists as well as
      graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
      Further details regarding volunteering with the Luquillo WEBB project
      are available through the internet.

      The LEF is the site of a National Science Foundation funded Long Term
      Ecological Research (LTER) program as well. Additional information
      about the LEF can be found through the U.S. Forest Service
      International Institute of Tropical Forestry and at the University of
      Puerto Rico Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies.
