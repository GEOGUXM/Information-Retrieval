   Cloud Surf

   These reflectivity (top) and radial velocity (bottom) RHI images were
   obtained over the western slope of Mount Washington, NH, with the
   NOAA/K 35-GHz cloud radar during the Mount Washington Icing Sensors
   Project (MWISP). The 6228-foot mountain summit is located to the right
   in these images at an elevation angle of about 15 degrees and 4 km
   range; the mountainside blocks out radar data to the right of the line
   that is the sloping surface of the mountain. The images show the radar
   echoes from a stratiform cloud. Wave patterns clearly visible in the
   cloud near 1 km AGL are Kelvin-Helmholtz instability waves caused by
   shear across a stabily stratified flow boundary. The waves become more
   pronounced and begin to break as the westerly flow approaches and is
   blocked by the mountain slope. Although the physics is somewhat
   different, these cloud waves bear a remarkable resemblance to shoaling
   ocean waves, which become increasingly stretched and curl over as they
   cross shallower water on their approach to the beach.
