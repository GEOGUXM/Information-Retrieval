                         PLANT “FREEDOM GARDENS”
                              IN MEMORY OF THE
                           SEPTEMBER 11TH VICTIMS

   In response to the tragedy of September 11th, America the Beautiful
   Fund is providing $1,000,000 worth of flower, vegetable and herb seeds
   to plant “Freedom Gardens” all across America. America the Beautiful
   Fund President, Nanine Bilski, said, “Just as Victory Gardens helped us
   to win World War II, and Memorial Day was started to plant flowers for
   the Civil War casualties, Freedom Gardens can give people something
   practical to do in their own community in the wake of this tragedy. No
   one is too young or too old, too rich or too poor to plant a living
   memorial to the innocent Americans who were attacked so viciously, and
   these gardens of hope and beauty will show that American freedom is
   alive and growing, block by block, town by town, from sea to shining
   sea.”

   Anyone who wants to sponsor or start a Freedom Garden in their
   community can receive a grant of 100 to1,000 free seed packets.
   Information and applications can be found at www.freeseeds.org , or by
   sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to America the Beautiful
   Fund, Department 911, 1730 K Street, NW, Suite 1002, Washington, DC
   20006.

   America the Beautiful Fund is a national non-profit organization
   started in 1965 to encourage volunteer citizen efforts to protect the
   natural and historic beauty of America. Over 50,000 projects in all 50
   states have been developed and assisted with ABF’s help. America the
   Beautiful Fund is supported by private donations and grants, including
   contributions from Federal workers and members of the Armed Service
   through the Combined Federal Campaign.
