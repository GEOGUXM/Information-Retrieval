     GFO Altimeter Engineering Assessment Report,
   NASA/TM-2002-209984/Version 1/Volume 3 (Adobe PDF Format)
   D.W. Lockwood/Raytheon, D.W. Hancock III/NASA GSFC, G.S. Hayne/NASA
       GSFC and R.L. Brooks/Raytheon ITSS, January 2002
       Abstract: The U.S. Navy's Geosat Follow-On (GFO) Mission, launched
       on February 10, 1998, is one of a series of altimetric satellites
       which include Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, and TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P). The
       purpose of this report is to document the GFO altimeter performance
       determined from the analyses and results performed by the
       NASA/GSFC/Wallops altimeter calibration team. It is the second of
       an anticipated series of NASA/GSFC/Wallops' GFO performance
       documents, each of which will update assessment results. This
       report covers the performance from instrument acceptance by the
       Navy on November 29, 2000 to the end of Cycle 20 on November 21,
       2001. Data derived from GFO will lead to improvements in the
       knowledge of ocean circulation, ice sheet topography, and climate
       change. In order to capture the maximum amount of information from
       the GFO data, accurate altimeter calibrations are required for the
       civilian data set which NOAA will produce. Wallops Flight Facility
       has provided similar products for the Geosat and T/P missions and
       is doing the same for GFO.

     GFO On-Orbit Altimeter Noise Assessment, NASA/TM-2001-209984/Volume 2
   (PDF, 920K)
   Mavis L. Driscoll and Richard V. Sailor/Litton TASC, January 8, 2001
       Abstract: The purpose of this report is to present the results of
       an analysis of the white noise level in Geosat Follow-On (GFO)
       altimeter data. The Repeat-Track Method was used to determine noise
       level. This approach was developed at TASC and has been used to
       quantify noise levels of all previous satellite altimeter missions
       (Refs. 1-6). The GFO altimeter was designed to have an RMS white
       noise level of less than 3.5 centimeters for significant wave
       height less than 2 meters. The results of the analysis presented
       here show that the GFO altimeter meets this specification.

     Geosat Follow-On Altimeter Height Loop and AGC Loop Step Responses
   from Ground Testing (Adobe PDF Format)
   G. S. Hayne, April 09 1996
       Abstract: This paper reports analysis of special loop transient
       test data from recent Geosat Follow-On (GFO) altimeter testing at
       E-Systems, ECI Division, in St. Petersburg, Florida. These data
       show the response of the GFO altimeter to step-changes in the
       simulated range and simulated backscattered return power.

     GFO Altimeter Height Noise Comparison with TOPEX
   D. W. Hancock, III, April 10, 1996
       Abstract: As part of our investigation of GFO altimeter height
       performance we studied the tracker response to transit height step
       and determined the effective alpha/ beta tracker constants. The
       results were consistent with expected response.
