                         ISS: A Home in Microgravity

      Why are we building the International Space Station? What are the
   benefits to us on Earth? What is different about living and working in
                                   space?

       Join us this year for another adventure surrounding human space
      exploration. We will seek to understand the unique challenges of
    designing for life and work in microgravity and how the construction
     the International Space Station will benefit life on Earth. We will
   travel to various NASA Centers to follow the progress of the design and
     construction of the ISS and visit with scientists who are preparing
                           experiments for space.

   What is Microgravity?

   Join us on an expedition to the world of microgravity. Often
   misperceived as weightlessness or zero gravity, microgravity is the
   unique gravitational environment astronauts experience on a spacecraft
   orbiting the earth. Joining us will be John Charles, who specializes in
   the effects of spaceflight on the heart and blood vessels.
