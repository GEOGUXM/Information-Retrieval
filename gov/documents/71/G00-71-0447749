   Formal and Memorandum Opinions

                  Franchise and Income Tax Formal Legal Opinions

      Corporate and individual taxpayers who dispute a final determination by
       the Franchise Tax board may appeal that determination to the Board of
       Equalization (the Board). The Board issues Formal Opinions as a means
      of resolving selected cases. Taxpayers may look to Formal Opinions for
       guidance as to the Board's position on the legal issues discussed in
      those opinions. If a Formal Opinion presents facts and/or legal issues
      similar to those in a pending appeal, the Board will generally rely on
      the Formal Opinion to make its determination in the pending appeal. The
       more recent Formal Opinions are now available on this Website, and we
          anticipate that all Formal Opinions issued by the Board will be
                        available in the very near future.

                   New Business Taxes Board Memorandum Opinions

      Taxpayers and feepayers who disagree with denials of claims for refund
        or determinations issued by the Sales and Use Tax Department or the
         Special Taxes Department of the Board of Equalization (Board) may
        appeal such actions to the elected members of the Board. The Board
        issues Memorandum Opinions as a means of resolving selected cases,
      which are appealed to the elected members. Taxpayers and feepayers may
      look to the Memorandum Opinions for guidance as to the Board's position
         on the legal issues discussed in those opinions. If a Memorandum
         Opinion presents facts and/or legal issues similar to those in a
         pending appeal, the Board will generally rely on that Memorandum
         Opinion to make its determination in the pending appeal. Recently
        adopted Memorandum Opinions will be available on this Website until
             they are incorporated into the Business Taxes Law Guide.
