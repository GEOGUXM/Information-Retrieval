             ACTIVITIES OF FDAS MEDICAL PRODUCT CENTERS IN 2001

   In the year 2001, the three centers of the Food and Drug Administration
   that regulate human medical products continued their usual high-level
   performance in reviewing marketing applications and monitoring the
   safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological medications and medical
   devices.

   The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for
   Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Devices and
   Radiological Health (CDRH) assured the availability to patients of a
   total of 136 innovative health care products. Some of the most
   important FDA approvals included a breakthrough drug for cancer, the
   first biological treatment for the most serious type of sepsis, and an
   advanced device for monitoring sugar in blood.

   The agency significantly enhanced the protections for thousands of
   patients, including those who participate in clinical trials, by acting
   to reduce or better manage risks involved in testing and using new
   therapies. And in one of its major achievements last year, the FDA once
   again met all of the demanding application review goals of the
   Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), despite the programs severe
   resource constraints.

   But however effective, routine operations are not the sole hallmark of
   a year that witnessed the terrorist attacks on and after September 11.
   The brutal assaults challenged the FDA to rise to the defense of the
   Nations consumers, and the agencyin close cooperation with other
   federal, state and local authoritieshas responded with its traditional
   vigor, initiative and scientific expertise.

                       FDAs Counter-terrorism Actions

   FDA developed strategies to strengthen the protection of all regulated
   products against willful contamination, and to improve the availability
   of medical products for the prevention or treatment of injuries caused
   by biological, chemical or nuclear agents.

   For example, CDER took the initiative to clarify that the antibiotics
   doxycycline and penicillin G procaine are effective and approved for
   use in treating all forms of anthrax infections. This notice included
   explicit dosing based on FDAs review of scientific literature and data
   from the same rhesus monkey study that had been used to support the
   August 2000 approval of ciprofloxacin for anthrax. The assurance that
   the three drugs are effective against all forms of anthrax infection
   eased the publics concerns about a potential shortage of medication for
   the victims of the mailed anthrax powder.

   CDER also stepped up its work on measures to encourage the development
   of new drugs to counter the toxic effects of chemical, biological,
   radiological and nuclear weapons. CBER worked closely with industry and
   other government agencies in an effort to assure adequate supply of
   products for immunization against anthrax, botulinum, smallpox and
   other substances that might be used by terrorists, and to evaluate
   adverse experiences reported after administration of anthrax vaccine in
   order to optimize the safe use of this vaccine.

   CDRH has contributed to the development of methodology for the
   detection of biological agents with bioterrorism potential, and
   cooperated with CDER and the National Institutes of Health in
   developing a guidance on the use of potassium iodide to reduce the risk
   of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies.

                              Product Approvals

   In addition to doing its part in protecting the Nations public health
   against terrorism, FDA last year evaluated many new pharmaceutical
   products and medical devices that advanced the frontier of modern
   medicine.

   In 2001, CDER approved 66 new drugs, 24 of which were new molecular
   entities (NMEs) with ingredients never before marketed in the U.S. Ten
   of the 66 new drugs (7 of the NMEs) received priority status and were
   reviewed and approved in the median time of 6 months. The other 56
   approvals were reviewed under a standard status. Their median review
   time was 12 months (15.7 months for the 17 standard NMEs), and their
   median total approval time was 14 months (19 months for the NMEs).

   CBER reviewed a total of 16 complex biological license applications
   (BLAs) in the median time of 13.8 months and approved them in the
   median time of 20.3 months. Two of the BLAs, which were classified as
   priority products, were reviewed in the median time of 11.5 months and
   approved in the median approval of 13.2 months. Approvals of 10 of the
   BLAs, 6 BLA supplements for new or expanded uses, and 3 premarket
   approval applications (PMAs) were considered major actions. Most of the
   products approved by CBER were designed to detect or treat infectious
   diseases.

   CDRH approved 54 premarket approvals (PMAs), of which 24 were for
   devices with novel technologies or new uses. The median total approval
   time for the 54 products was 11.3 months.

   Some examples of FDAs major product approvals last year for the benefit
   of various groups of patients follow:

   Cancer patients: One of FDAs most important approvals last year was for
   Gleevec (imatinib mesylate or STI-571), a new oral treatment for
   patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, a rare life-threatening form of
   cancer. FDA reviewed the drug in two- and-a-half months and approved it
   under a special procedure that permits the marketing of important
   therapies on the basis of their effect on surrogate markers. The
   sponsor is committed to carry out additional studies demonstrating
   Gleevecs long-term safety and effectiveness.

   Gleevec was developed for use in a U.S. patient population below
   200,000, and was therefore designated by FDA as an orphan drug.
   Sponsors of such products receive inducements that include seven-year
   marketing exclusivity, tax credit for the product-associated clinical
   research, research design assistance by FDA, and grants of up to
   $200,000 per year.

   In addition to two cancer drugs for women which are described below,
   FDA approved Campath (alemtuzumab), a new biological product for the
   treatment of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have
   been treated with alkylating agents and have failed fludarabine
   therapy.

   FDA also cleared a new device that can facilitate early detection of
   colon cancer. The Given Diagnostic Imaging System is a swallowable
   capsule containing a tiny camera that snaps pictures twice a second as
   it is moved by natural muscular waves of the digestive track trough the
   small intestine. The device enables the physician to see areas that are
   not reachable by endoscope.

   Women and children: FDA approved two cancer products for women. One of
   them, a combination of Xeloda (capecitabine) and Taxotere (docetaxel),
   was approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that has not
   responded to an anthracycline-containing cancer therapy.

   The other approval was a new indication for Femara (letrozole) as a
   first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer in
   postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or unknown disease.
   Femara had been approved for treatment of breast cancer in women whose
   cancer had not responded to antiestrogen drugs.

   FDA also approved two contraceptive devices that deliver continuous
   doses of progestin and estrogen hormones to prevent pregnancy.

   One of the devices, Ortho Evra, is the first skin patch approved for
   birth control. The patch, which has to be changed each week, releases
   the hormones through the skin into the blood stream. The other device,
   NuvaRing, delivers the hormones through a flexible, transparent polymer
   ring that is inserted in the vagina. Both the patch and the ring have
   to be removed one week each month when the woman menstruates.

   FDA also approved one important device for children. AED is the first
   automatic external defibrillator system for use on infants and young
   children who experience cardiac arrest. The device is designed to
   restore normal heart rhythm by using conductive adhesive pads to
   administer an electric shock through the chest wall.

   Heart patients: In addition to the above-described (AED) system for use
   on infants and young children, FDA approved four highly advanced
   medical devices for heart patients:

   One of them is Biotronik Home Monitoring System, the first implanted
   pacemaker that includes a tiny transmitter capable of automatic, remote
   data transmission. The device can be programmed to collect data on the
   patients heart condition and at certain intervals automatically send
   them to the patients physician.

   Another first-of-a-kind product is the WCD System, a vest- like device
   that is worn under clothing to monitor and treat abnormal heart rhythms
   in people at risk of dying from sudden cardiac arrest. The device,
   which is suitable for patients who cannot have or do not want an
   implanted defibrillator, senses heart malfunction and automatically
   delivers an electrical shock when needed to restore normal heart
   rhythm.

   InSync Biventricular Cardiac Pacing System, which was also cleared for
   marketing in 2001, is a new type of pacemaker that sends specially
   timed electrical impulses to the hearts lower chambers to treat the
   symptoms of moderate to severe congestive heart failure. The impulses
   are generated by an implanted pulse generator and delivered to the
   heart by three wires.

   FDA also approved PercuSurge, a device consisting of balloon and
   aspiration catheters. The device is used to collect and remove blood
   clots and other debris created by angioplasty and stenting of a blocked
   bypass vein graft.

   One important new drug approved last year for cardiac patients is
   Natrecor (nesiritide) injection for the treatment of acute congestive
   heart failure. The medication, which was developed with the use of
   recombinant DNA technology, is a synthetic version of a human hormone
   that dilates veins and arteries.

   Infectious diseases: FDA approved Xigris, the first biologic treatment
   for the most serious forms of life-threatening sepsis, which claims
   225,000 lives in the U.S. each year. The new treatment is a genetically
   engineered version of a naturally occurring human protein, Activated
   Protein C, which interferes with some of the bodys harmful responses to
   severe infection.

   PEG-Intron (peginteferon alfa 2b) injection was approved for the
   treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C, an infectious disease
   responsible for as many as 10,000 deaths per year in the U.S.
   PEG-Intron is a longer acting form of interferon than Intron A (an
   earlier approved form of interferon), and requires only one injection
   per week for one year compared to three per week for Intron A. FDA also
   approved a supplemental application for the use of PEG-Intron with
   Rebetol (ribavirin) capsules, which was shown to be somewhat more
   effective than Intron A with Rebetol.

   FDA approved a new combination vaccine that protects adults against
   diseases caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the hepatitis B
   virus (HBV). The vaccine, called Twinrix, combines two already approved
   vaccines, Havrix (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated) and Engerix-B
   [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] so that people at high risk for
   exposure to both viruses can be immunized against both at the same
   time. Twinrix is recommended for travelers who are at high risk for
   HBV, and who are visiting countries where there is a substantial
   incidence of both HAV and HBV disease.

   The agencys approvals also included Cancidas (caspofungin acetate)
   intravenous infusion, a new anti-fungal medication for patients not
   responsive to or unable to tolerate standard therapies for the invasive
   form of aspergillosis. This is the first approval in a new class of
   drugs called echinocandins, which are believed to work by disrupting
   the formation of fungal cell walls.

   Another novel product approved last year is Viread (tenofovir
   disoproxil fumarate), a new anti-viral drug for the treatment of HIV-1
   infection in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. Viread is
   the first nucleotide analog approved for HIV-1 treatment.

   Other important approvals: Lumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution)
   and Travatan (travoprost ophthalmic solution) are new medications to
   treat elevated intraocular pressure often associated with glaucoma. The
   solutions are indicated for use in patients who are intolerant of other
   intraocular pressure- lowering medications.

   Novel devices approved in 2001 included GlucoWatch Biographer, a
   wristwatch-like device that provides adult diabetics with more
   information for managing their disease. The gadget extracts the wearers
   fluid every 20 minutes by sending out tiny electric currents, and
   sounds an alarm if the glucose level reaches dangerous levels.

   Another advanced device approved last year is the Lap-Band Adjustable
   Gastric Banding System, an inflatable device that is surgically placed
   around the upper stomach to limit food consumption and create an
   earlier feeling of fullness. It is intended for people at least 100 lbs
   overweight who have failed to reduce weight by dieting and other
   methods, and who are at greater risk for serious diseases such as
   hypertension, gall bladder disease and diabetes.

   Aranesp (darbepoetin), another new biologic, was approved for treatment
   of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including both
   patients on dialysis and not on dialysis.

   The agency approved the first HIV drug resistance test for use as an
   aid in monitoring and treating HIV infected patients. The test detects
   mutations in HIV that confer resistance to - drugs used to treat HIV
   infections.

                        New Protections for Patients

   An important focus of FDAs activities in 2001 was the strengthening of
   patient protections through programs and measures designed to enhance
   the ethical standards of clinical trials and the safety and
   effectiveness of approved health care products.

   For example, FDA last year issued an interim rule to provide additional
   safeguards for children participating in clinical studies. The new rule
   provides specific criteria, such as an assurance of informed consent by
   the children and their parents, that have to be maintained by the
   Institutional Review Boards that supervise the trials.

   FDA also proposed a rule that would make publicly available information
   on all new or ongoing clinical trials involving gene therapy or
   xenotransplantation. Access to most of the trial designs and safety
   data should contribute to the assurance of their ethical conduct as
   well as the publics confidence in advanced product studies. The rule
   would continue safeguarding commercial information and the identity of
   the study participants.

   In addition, FDA proposed and a regulation covering the methods,
   facilities and controls used to manufacture human cellular and
   tissue-based products. This was the last of three FDA proposals of a
   comprehensive risk-based regulatory framework to help ensure the safety
   and quality of new technologies and products. The first of the proposed
   rules, requiring establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues
   and cellular and tissue-based products to register with FDA and list
   their products, was finalized.

   Another new measure, which is of particular significance for people
   with AIDS, is an agreement between FDA and the Veterans Administration
   (VA) to improve clinical knowledge of adverse effects of drugs used to
   treat HIV infections. Under the agreement, FDA and VA are jointly
   conducting an epidemiological study to determine whether avascular
   necrosisthe destruction of bone cells due to deficient blood supply
   that affects people with AIDSis linked to the use of certain drugs to
   treat HIV.

   Cancer patients will benefit from a new joint research program
   announced in July by FDA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The
   three-year, $1.1 million-a-year Clinical Proteomics Program utilizes
   new technologies that generate protein fingerprints that may provide
   early warnings of drug side effects. The pioneering research combines
   the study of proteins in living cells with clinical care for patients.

   Recipients of blood products will be better protected thanks to FDAs
   licensing of the first nucleic acid test systems intended for screening
   of plasma donors. These systems are expected to further ensure the
   safety of plasma-derived products by permitting earlier detection of
   HIV and HCV infections in donors.

   The safety of hospital patients has been improved by two new measures.
   One of them is FDAs requirement of evidence that all but the
   lowest-risk reprocessed single-use devicessuch instruments as
   laparoscopy scissors and balloon angioplasty cathetersare as safe and
   effective as the original products. The other new measure is an FDA
   guidance for the safe use of bed rails, which have been involved in
   nearly 400 reported accidents in hospitals, nursing homes and home use.

   In 2001, FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of
   Womens Health awarded two contracts to study labetalol and atenolol,
   medications that are used by pregnant women to treat high blood
   pressure despite scant clinical data on the use of these products in
   this patient population. The studies are to determine appropriate
   dosages of greatest benefit and least risk for pregnant women and their
   babies.

   FDA proposed guidance on the establishment and operation of clinical
   trial data monitoring committees, which play a critical role in
   safeguarding patients interests and contribute to their protection.

   In addition, FDA awarded several contracts to enable it to access
   commercial databases on the actual use of marketed prescription drugs
   in adults and children. The information, which does not reveal the
   identity of patients, helps FDA to determine the public health
   significance of reports it receives through its Adverse Event Reporting
   System.

   Finally, the FDA last year announced the creation of a new Drug Safety
   and Risk Management Subcommittee to the Advisory Committee for
   Pharmaceutical Science. The new subcommittee, which consists of
   nationally-recognized experts in areas related to risk perception and
   management, pharmacology and other related disciplines, will advise FDA
   on general and product- specific safety issues.

                            FDAs User Fee Program

   FDAs human drug program once again met all of the demanding review
   goals of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) as reauthorized in
   1997. For applications submitted In fiscal year (FY) 2000, the latest
   year for which meaningful review statistics can be reported, CDER and
   CBER reviewed 33 priority applications and 101 standard applications.
   The projected median approval times for FY 2000 submissions are 6
   months for priority applications and 12.5 months for standard
   applications.

   Notwithstanding these successes, the agency has encountered challenges
   in trying to meet the PDUFA II goals. The fees the FDA has collected
   have been significantly less than expected due to a reduced number of
   new drug applications and an increased proportion of submission whose
   fees were waived. At the same time, the number of goal-driven tasks for
   which FDA collects no fees has increased substantially under PDUFA II.
   Although so far the FDA has been able to meet most of its performance
   goals, the agency does not foresee increasing or even maintaining
   performance levels until resources are available to meet the increased
   workload.

   The agency's efforts to meet the PDUFA II goals may have had an
   unintended impact on approval times of standard new drug and biologics
   applications. These approval times have begun to increase because more
   applications require multiple review cycles to reach approval. This may
   be due to the fact that reviewers, pressed to meet the new PDUFA II
   goals for drug development (e.g., meetings, special protocol
   assessments, and responses to clinical holds), have had less time for
   resolving last minute problems with these standard applications before
   the action goal date. Such applications must undergo an additional
   review cycle with its attendant timeframes and goals. Statistics on
   this trend are preliminary and the agency is watching it closely.
   However, if the user fee program is to continue, it must be on a sound
   financial footing and based on reliable estimates of workload and
   resources.

   The Agency will continue to work with the industry, the Congress, and
   all other stakeholders on a reauthorization of the PDUFA program that
   will continue to bring benefits to American consumers by bringing
   important new therapies to market quickly without compromising
   scientific review standards.

   FDA is also concerned about the safety of new drugs and biologics
   following approval and marketing. In recent years fully 50% of all new
   drugs world-wide have been launched in the U.S., and American patients
   have had access to 78% of the world's new drugs within the first year
   of their introduction. More rigorous safety monitoring of newly
   approved drugs in the first few years after a product is on the market
   could help to detect unanticipated problems earlier. The current system
   for detecting adverse drug and biologics events does not provide
   sufficient data on the actual incidence of problems.

   To protect American patients, FDA urgently needs to strengthen its
   ability to carry out post-market drug surveillance and other non-user
   fee functions it carries out in conjunction with PDUFA.
