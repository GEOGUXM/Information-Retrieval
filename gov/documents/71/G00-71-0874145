                            About CAM on PubMed

     CAM on PubMed allows you to easily find journal citations related to
     complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The National Center
     for Complementary and Alternative Medicine  (NCCAM) and The National
     Library of Medicine (NLM) have partnered to create CAM on PubMed, a
     special subset of the NLM's PubMed.

     When you click on the CAM on PubMed logo, your literature search
     will automatically be limited to the CAM subset of PubMed. Your
     searches are free.
