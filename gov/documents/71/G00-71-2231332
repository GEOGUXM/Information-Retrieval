   Search Search Features
   Many of the documents available through our web page are reached
   through templates. For example, when you click of the Guidelines button
   you are taken to the Guidelines template. There you will see the names
   of the various documents stored there for viewing.
   Some templates contain several documents, and you may want to use the
   SEARCH function for a Full Text Search to find the particular document
   posted in that template that you need. To do this, simply CLICK on one
   of the SEARCH buttons at the top or bottom of the page. Then enter the
   word or words your are looking for and press SEARCH. You will be given
   the title of the documents in that template that contain the word(s)
   you looked for. Please note that some of our templates are not full
   text searchable.
   Once you select a document to review you can do a word search by
   clicking on EDIT, then Find and Replace, or Find in Document (or
   pressing Ctrl+F), and entering the word(s) you wish to locate in the
   document. For documents in PDF format (viewable via Adobe Acrobat
   Reader) search by clicking on TOOLS, then FIND (or Ctrl+F), and proceed
   the same way.
   Site Map
   The site map is a list of all the documents in the court's website. The
   links in this page are grouped in a logical order, e.g., by judge,
   division, et cetera. The site map's links are also color-coded for
   navigational purposes. The color representation are as follows:

   Blue =   active, unvisited link;
   Red =    appears when the user hovers the mouse over a link. This feature
            makes the the selected link stand out from the list; and
   Purple = visited link.

   Please note due to browser limitations, the color-coded feature is only
   available on Netscape 6 and Internet Explorer 5 and above.
   A new browser window will automatically open for links to outside
   websites. This option is namely available in the Links section. This
   feature allows the user to access both the court's and outside websites
   at the same time.
   Using Links
   When you see a word or phrase that is blue/underlined in blue, that
   usually tells you there is a LINK to another place on our web site or
   to another website. For example, if you CLICK on PACER on the home page
   you will be taken to page containing information regarding this
   program.
   Calendar Updates
   In each division of our court the Judges' Calendars are posted on a
   weekly basis. Select the judge, then CLICK on the calendar you want.
   Once in a calendar you can search the document for the name you want
   (see above). Some of our divisions are also posting the ยง341 Meetings
   of Creditors calendars each week.
   Feedback
   Please tell us how to improve our website. Tell us what you like and
   what you don't like, what you want and what you don't want. Just CLICK
   on the e mail address at the bottom of the home page and send us your
   comments. Don't be bashful - we need to hear from you. By the way, you
   can also comment the old fashioned way - U.S. Mail.
   Expand Collapse Expand/Collapse
   Some of our templates list all of the documents they contain. An
   example is Judges' Procedures. Others only list the authors. An example
   is Judges' Decisions. To see the titles of all documents on a template,
   just CLICK on one of the EXPAND buttons at the top or bottom of the
   page. To eliminate the items and see only the authors or sources, CLICK
   on one of the COLLAPSE buttons.
   Page Up Page Down Page Up/Page Down
   CLICK on the PG UP or PG DN to move a page up or a page down on a
   template. For example, too many documents normally appear on the
   Judges' Calendar template to see their titles all at once, so you need
   to move down one page to see the rest of them.
   Using Adobe Acrobat Reader
   Some of our documents are stored in Portable Document File (PDF)
   format. PDF permits us to keep the look of the document the way it was
   created. To view our PDF files you need to have an Adobe Reader, which
   you may download free from the Adobe Systems Internet website. Once you
   install the Reader you do not have to do anything more. You can view
   our documents the way they were created and you may save and print them
   in that format. Some of the court's pdf documents are also interactive,
   which means you can complete the form using Reader.
