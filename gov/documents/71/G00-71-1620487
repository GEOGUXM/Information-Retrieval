   DATA

   Our goal is to make some useful observations and assimilated data
   available. This page will contain links to the data or descriptions of
   the data.
   For now, be sure to see the LDAS WWW page, which contains real time
   high resolution forecasts of the land surface over North America.

   Some data is available for online download, while some may need special
                                arrangement.
