   Mr. Bradford

   I want to thank all of our grant recipient users, awarding agency
   customers, and the Division of Payment Management staff for their
   cooperation in our successful efforts to get back on schedule with the
   PSC Federal Cash Transaction Report (PSC 272) reporting process. Timely
   completion of the PSC 272 is essential to meeting financial reporting
   requirements for our grant awarding agencies. The grant expenditure
   information from the PSC 272's and data from the grant payment
   processes are material parts of the financial statements for many of
   these agencies. As we head toward the close of another Federal fiscal
   year, it is extremely important that grant recipients complete and
   return their June 30, 2001 PSC 272 reports to us as soon as possible.
   In addition to being used to build agency financial statements as noted
   above, grant expenditure data from these reports is used to develop an
   estimated final grant expense amount for the fiscal year end financial
   statements. Timely and accurate reporting on the PSC 272 will greatly
   facilitate this process.

   While we have been concentrating many of our resources on the PSC 272
   reporting process, we have also continued to enhance the Payment
   Management System. Two new capabilities of note are: Grant Recipient
   "Inquiry Only" accounts and multiple user access to Payee Accounts.
   These features will be highlighted in articles in our next issue. In
   addition to system enhancements, we have launched an extremely
   successful grant recipient user training program. Response to the
   training has been overwhelmingly positive. Since April, almost 200
   grant recipient users have attended these sessions. We will continue to
   offer these classes each month, as well as develop a regional training
   program whereby we will conduct periodic training sessions at sites
   throughout the country.

   In closing, I again want to thank all of our users and customers for
   making 2001 a great year and truly a year to remember. We have made
   significant progress since implementation of the new system!
