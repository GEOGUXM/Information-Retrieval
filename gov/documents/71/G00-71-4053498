   Quick Tips and Examples
   It's easy to search with Ultraseek Server. Just type in a few words or
   phrases. Try to use discriminating terms that are likely to be found
   only in the documents you seek. The more words you give, the better
   results you'll get. Here are some examples:

   Search by typing words and phrases.

     Pentium computer with 8x CD-ROM for sale

   Ultraseek Server will find documents containing as many of these words
   and phrases as possible, ranked so that the documents most relevant to
   your query are presented first. Don't worry about missing a document
   because it doesn't have one of the words in your search -- Ultraseek
   Server returns relevant results even if they don't contain all query
   terms.

   Identify phrases with quotation marks, separate with commas.

     Pentium computer with "8x CD-ROM", "for sale"

   A phrase is entered using double quotation marks, and only matches
   those words which appear adjacent to each other. Separate multiple
   phrases or proper names with a comma.

   Use UPPER case to indicate exact match.

     Steve Jobs, NeXT

   Search terms in lowercase will match words in any case, otherwise, an
   exact case match is used. For example, next will find matches for Next,
   next, and NeXT, whereas a query for NeXT will only match NeXT.
