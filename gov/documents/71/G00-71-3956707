   Technologies > Overview


   As part of NASA's Cross Enterprise Technology Development Program
   (CETDP), the Space Communications Program (SCP) has successfully
   proposed and has been approved for fiscal year 2000 funding for 13
   technology product development tasks in the High Rate Data Delivery
   (HRDD) Thrust Area.

   The diversity of technology products proposed ranges from software to
   hardware, digital to analog, and components to subsystems, all from
   Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1 to 4. These technology development
   tasks are a collaboration of Intra-agency, academia, and industry
   partnerships.  The duration of the technology product development
   ranges from one to three years.

   The program is developing technologies within the following areas:
     * Applied Radio Frequency (RF)

     * Electron Device

     * Satellite Networks & Architectures

     * Digital Communications
