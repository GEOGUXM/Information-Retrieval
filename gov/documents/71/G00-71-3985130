A Universe Before Stars: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Earliest Moments in
                                    Time

   Can you imagine a Universe without stars? You'll need to go way back in
                                    time.

    The Universe is now about 15 billion years old. During the Universe's
      preschool years -- the first billion years or so -- there were no
    twinkling jewels to see in the night sky; no galaxies swirling about
           like pinwheels nor comets streaking across the heavens.

     In fact, for the first 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the entire
    Universe was one great fog of protons, electrons, and radiation. You
                           couldn't see anything.

        Sound boring? On one level, the scene does seem to be like an
     astronomer's worst nightmare: no stars, no visibility. Yet nothing
      could be further from the truth. This fog is actually one of the
    hottest topics in science, for hidden within the fog are clues to the
                  most pressing questions of our existence:

     * What is the shape of the Universe?
     * What kind of strange matter is in the Universe?
     * How did the Universe grow from a fireball to the vast structure of
       galaxies and galaxy clusters we see today?
     * Does a mysterious force acting like anti-gravity dominate the
       Universe?

   For the "big" questions, the fog is where it's at. But how does one go
          about studying a fog that existed billions of years ago?

   About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the fog lifted and light broke
    through. This light -- essentially the afterglow of the Big Bang, the
     very first light to shine in the Universe -- carries the history of
     what went on during those first years. As fate would have it, this
     fossil light is still shining today in the form of microwaves. The
                   entire Universe is bathed in the stuff.

      showing the difference before and after the lifting of the "fog".

     In summer 2001, NASA plans to launch the Microwave Anisotropy Probe
   (MAP) to survey this ancient radiation in unprecedented detail. Just as
    we can study dinosaur bones and reconstruct their lives from millions
      of years ago, we can probe this ancient light and reconstruct the
   Universe as it was about 15 billions years ago. MAP will be looking at
    a cosmic glow far older than anything that the Hubble Space Telescope
   or Chandra X-ray Observatory can see. MAP will "map" slight temperature
   fluctuations within the microwave background that vary by only 0.00001°
   C across a chilly light that now averages 2.73° C above absolute zero.
   The temperature differences today point back to density differences in
    the fiery baby universe, in which there was a little more matter here
   and a little less matter there. Areas of slightly enhanced density had
   stronger gravity than low-density areas. The high-density areas "pulled
   back" on the background radiation, making it appear slightly cooler in
    those directions. The slight difference in density led to our current
    structure of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and voids of seemingly empty
                                   space.

    So MAP is a cosmologist's dream come true, supplying the long-sought
   data needed to test the crazy theories we have of how it all began and
    how we got from there to here. By comparing the earliest structure of
   the universe to what we see today, MAP will help determine how and when
      the first galaxies formed. MAP will also address the more trippy
     questions: Is the universe's geometry flat or curved around in some
    funky way? Is the stuff we're made of really an anomaly in a universe
     dominated by dark matter and dark energy? Is inflation correct, the
    theory that the universe expanded from the atomic scale to the cosmic
           scale in a fraction of a second, far faster than light?

    Join us on this special exhibit, as we explore the questions that MAP
                            will seek to answer:

     * The Foggy Universe (The origin of the Microwave Background)
     * The Anisotropy of the Microwave Background
     * Testing Inflation Theory
     * The Shape of the Universe
     * Weighing the Universe: Dark Matter and Dark Energy
     * Formation of Structure in the Universe
     * How Old is the Universe?
     * What is the fate of the Universe?
