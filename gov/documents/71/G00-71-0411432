   Visual Sample Plan (VSP)


                                                                 [vsp.gif]

                                                                       VSP

   VSP provides statistical solutions to sampling design, world-class
   mathematical and statistical algorithms, and a user-friendly visual
   interface, while answering two important questions in sample planning.
     * How many samples are needed?
       The algorithms involved in determining the number of samples needed
       can be quite involved and intimidating to the non-expert. VSP can
       quickly calculate the number of samples needed for various
       scenarios at different costs.
     * Where should the samples be taken?
       Sample placement based on personal judgment is prone to bias. VSP
       instantly provides random or gridded sampling locations overlaid on
       the site map.
