                                   What's New

          Current Changes | New Stations/Sensors | Previous Changes

  Winter 2001

   Executive Update: Executive summary report for Hydrologic Conditions in
   California has been added. The latest version of the report can be
   accessed through the CDEC Quick Search pull-down menu on the home page.

   New CDEC pages: Several new pages have been added including Alternative
   Access to CDEC (accessed through CDEC Information on the home page),
   CDEC Mailing List (accessed through home page), and California Snow
   Survey Measurement Schedule (accessed through Snowpack Status on the
   home page).

   CDEC Station lists: A new station list have been added for USGS River
   Flow data stations. This list can be accessed through Station
   Information on the home page. Other lists added to the Station
   Information page include precipitation station lists, reservoir station
   lists, and river stage station lists previously available only from
   other sections of the CDEC site.

   Modifications to CDEC pages: New stations and river basins have been
   added to the Daily Water Temperature page (accessed through Current
   River Conditions) for Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin.
   The Current River Conditions page has been updated for Central Coast
   Region (Salinas, Estrella, San Benito and Pajaro) and for South Coast
   Region (Santa Ynez, Santa Clara and San Diego R). A new Current River
   Conditions page has been added for Sacramento River Region (North Fork
   Cache Creek).

   USGS rating tables: We are now using rating tables directly from the
   USGS for river flow computations. The rating tables are updated on a
   regular basis so that they portray the most current ratings. Check the
   new USGS River Flow data stations list for the stations affected by
   this change. This list can be accessed through the Station Information
   page.

   Printer-friendly version of reports: Many reports now have the option
   to display without CDEC page headers/footers for better printing.

   Plot Display: Graphs retrieved through CDEC's query tools now display
   additional labels for easier delimitation of data points.

   New Sensor definitions: Several new sensor definitions have been added
   including ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVITY MS*1000, TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON, ELECTRIC
   COND. BOTTOM MS*1000, CANAL DIVERSION FLOW (CFS), and IRRIG &
   CONSUMPTION FLOW (CFS). See the Sensor Definitions page (accessed
   through Station Information on the home page) for more information.

  Summer 2000

   New CDEC query tools: Several new tools have been added including a
   tool to retrieve the Latest Real-Time Data By Station, the Latest
   Real-Time Data By Sensor, the Latest Real-Time Temperature Data, the
   Latest Real-Time Snow Data, the Latest Real-Time Stage Data, the Latest
   Real-Time Flow Data, and the Latest Real-Time Storage Data. These tools
   can be accessed through the CDEC Quick Search pull-down menu on the
   home page, or through the CDEC Quick Search pull-down menu on the Data
   Query Tools page.

   Modifications to existing CDEC query tools: The Bulk Historic Data tool
   (selectQuery) has been modified to allow for new queries based on
   previous selected criteria. The Monthly Data tool (queryMonthly) has
   been modified to redirect users to the Snow Course Data tool
   (snowQuery) if the CDEC Station ID used is one for a snow course. The
   Stage Data tool (stageF) has been renamed to Selected-Level Stage Data
   to avoid confusion.

   Date Display: Data retrieved through CDEC's query tools now displays
   dates in MM/DD/YYYY format for easier import into spreadsheet
   applications such as MS Excel.

   Query Tools page: Links have been added for the Real-Time Plots, Daily
   Plots, Group of Real-Time Plots, and Group of Daily Plots tools.

   Precipitation/Snow page: Searchable links have been added to find
   previous versions of the Daily Precipitation Totals (PAGE5), Daily Snow
   Water Equivalents (PAGE6), and Summary of Daily Snow Water Equivalents
   (DLYSWEQ) reports.

   Reservoir Data/Reports page: Report for the Most Recent Scheduled
   Releases has been added. This reports queries the database for the
   latest information.

   Station Information page: Two new station lists have been added to the
   Station Information page. One is for Active Snow Courses and the other
   is for Active Snow Sensors.
