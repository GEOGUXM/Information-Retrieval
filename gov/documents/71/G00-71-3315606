      Most HUD positions are filled as permanent career civil service jobs.
   Job listings are available at USAJOBS, where you can search by state
   and program area.

   USAJOBS has general information on working for the Federal Government,
   including salaries and benefits, special programs and the application
   process as well as listings for other agencies. If you are familiar
   with the process, you can go directly to the HUD job listings.

Internships

   HUD participates in OPM's Presidential Management Intern Program.
   Graduate students who apply for the federal program and are accepted
   may interview at HUD. If you are already a PMI and would like to
   interview at HUD, contact Jeffrey McArthur at 202-708-2871 for
