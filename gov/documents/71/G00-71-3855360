Division Profile

   Colocated in the FHWA Missouri Division Office is the Federal Aid
   Highway Program Office and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
   Administration.

   bullet Federal Aid Highway Program Office.  We are responsible for
   administering the return of the Federal Highway Trust Fund (about $650
   million per year most of which are Federal gasoline taxes) back to the
   State of Missouri through the Missouri Department of Transportation.
   In essence, this money is directed to the design and construction of
   major capital additions and improvements to Missouri's highway system
   and intermodal connectors.  However, the delivery of this design and
   construction program requires FHWA's active involvement in many facets
   of administration and oversight.  These facets include funding
   reimbursement, innovative financing, civil rights, statewide and
   metropolitan planning, research, technology development and transfer,
   major investment studies, environmental evaluations, rights of way
   acquisition, safety programs, highway and bridge design reviews,
   construction inspections, maintenance reviews, quality improvement
   reviews, and technical assistance.


   bullet Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.   Our primary
   mission is to prevent commercial motor vehicle-related fatalities and
   injuries.  Our office is here to answer your questions and to provide
   you with guidance concerning the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
   Regulations.
