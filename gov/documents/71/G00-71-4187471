   Shutdown Concluding Remarks * The capability now exists to produce and
   control fusion plasmas for detailed investigation in the laboratory.
   However, fusion reactors based on the present state of knowledge are
   large and innovations are needed for an attractive reactor concept. *
   Recent developments in plasma diagnostics and computer simulation of
   three-dimensional non-linear phenomena now allow detailed comparison of
   theory and experiment. * New insight into the physical processes
   causing plasma transport could lead to an advanced toroidal
   configuration that would have a significant impact on the
   attractiveness of magnetic fusion. * The FIRE compact high field
   tokamak could address many of the generic fusion science issues
   including: self-heated plasma physics, many of the long pulse advanced
   tokamak issues and could begin the study of self-heated self-organized
   plasmas in a $1B class experimental facility. http://fire.pppl.gov
