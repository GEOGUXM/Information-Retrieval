                 Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE)

   [lite.gif] September 1994, aboard the shuttle Discovery, the Lidar
   In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) provided the first lidar (devoted
   to atmospheric measurements) to fly in space. This mission was the
   precursor to the upcoming PICASSO-CENA satellite. To assist in the
   validation of LITE data, an aircraft correlative measurement program
   was initiated. The NASA Wallops Flight Facility P3-B, carrying a sensor
   suite consisting of a raster scanning lidar (LASAL), 3 infrared
   radiometers, a microwave scatterometer, and [liteplan.gif] a microwave
   long-wave spectrometer (ROWS), underflew shuttle ground tracks for a
   total of over 50 hours. An enormous amount of high quality data was
   acquired related to the near ocean surface coupling between the
   atmospheric boundary layer and wind-induced sea surface roughness.
   Completely coincident boundary layer characteristics, sea surface
   temperature, scatterometer and altimeter surface wind speed and
   direction, and directional swell spectrum are presently being derived
   from the P-3B sensor data. Example data and flight map are available at
   this time.
