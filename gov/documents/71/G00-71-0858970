                               Contacting the
                           FBI-San Diego Division

       All urgent requests for assistance require contact with the San Diego
     Division by telephone (858-565-1255). We recommend making routine contact
    with us by telephone because email messages are checked on a limited basis
    and a large number of email messages are reviewed at one time.  Please note
    that the geographic boundaries for the San Diego Division are San Diego and
    Imperial counties in California, U.S.A.  We will review email messages that
    involve matters within the Division's geographic boundaries and fall within
                                 FBI jurisdiction.

   If you desire to contact us on a routine matter through email, the following
                           information must be included:

       1. Your full name, street address, and call-back telephone number;
       2. A descriptive summary of the issue you are contacting us on; and
       3. A full description of all individuals or entities that are the
          subject of your inquiry.
