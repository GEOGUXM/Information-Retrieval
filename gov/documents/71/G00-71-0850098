  »»» The mission of Transportation Programs at the AQMD is to reduce air
    pollution from on-road mobile sources. On-road mobile sources of air
     pollution are the cars and trucks we see every day on the road, the
               largest source of air pollution in our region.
   »»» Transportation Programs focus is the reduction of air pollution
      through the promotion of ridesharing, use of alternative forms of
      transportation (buses, trains, etc.), the use of alternative fuel
                vehicles or other clean engine technologies.
    »»» This is accomplished through educational programs, outreach to
     encourage voluntary efforts, and the implementation of Rule 2202 -
                  On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options.
