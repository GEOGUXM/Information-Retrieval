   High School Teachers --

   Join our Research Study on New Methods of Professional Development!

   Register online for HOU courses to be offered in the summer of 2002,
   with online courses contining into the fall.

   With Hands-On Universe (HOU), teachers and students at all ability
   levels use high quality astronomical images to explore central concepts
   in science, math, and technology. By analyzing real astronomical images
   with HOU image processing software, similar to the software
   professional astronomers use, students become more engaged and more
   excited about math and science.

   HOU is conducting a study of the relative effectiveness of different
   professional development strategies. If you join our study, you will be
   in one of our HOU courses to learn to implement the HOU curriculum in
   your classroom. The key measure of effectiveness will be student
   performance, so you will be required to administer assessments to your
   students.
   Our assessor/evaluator partner is Third International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS) team who made headlines with their
   ground-breaking findings on how U.S. students compare in math and
   science education to their global counterparts.
