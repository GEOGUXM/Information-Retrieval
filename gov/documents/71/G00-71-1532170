               Capital Dome Washington State Auditor's Office

                             2001 Annual Report
   __________________________________________________________________

   Brian Sonntag, State Auditor December 2001

   At the beginning of this year, the State Auditor's Office was asked to
   make recommendations regarding a comprehensive statewide performance
   review.

   That proposal, delivered to key Democrat and Republican lawmakers in
   March, laid out a plan to measure state agencies' compliance with laws
   pertaining to financial and performance accountability and with
   measures the agencies have developed to gauge their own operations.

   Unfortunately, the Legislature's performance audit pilot project was
   not enacted. What I hope to present in this annual report are
   compelling reasons why such a review is needed and why our Office is
   uniquely positioned to do it.

   State agencies are working hard to improve the quality, efficiency and
   effectiveness of the services they provide. Performance measures are
   now an inherent part of state agency strategic planning and budgeting.

   So why the need for a performance review? Currently, there is no
   overall, comprehensive review of whether state government is meeting
   performance goals or measures designed to ensure programs are efficient
   and effective. And, although itâ€™s been asked for decades, no one has
   stepped forward to answer the question: "What core services should
   government provide and how can it do so in the most effective and
   efficient way?"

   At this time in our state, we should come together and look for
   solutions.

   Our Office was created in the State Constitution as the "auditor of all
   public accounts." Our auditors are out there, every day, looking at
   agency operations, recommending improvements and working with agencies
   to find efficient ways to ensure accountability. That puts us in a
   great position to take an independent, across-the-board look at how
   agencies are measuring up to expectations.

   I encourage you to read this report, study our suggestions, and offer
   any constructive ideas that you may have for ensuring government
   accountability.

   Sincerely,

   BRIAN SONNTAG, CGFM
   STATE AUDITOR

2001 Highlights

                                                            How to find us

    For those of you who are used to dropping in to say hello, we've moved
             from the Capitol Building to the Sunset Building in Tumwater.

      To get to our new offices from the Capitol, go south on Capitol Way.
        After you cross a bridge over Interstate 5, go to the light at the
    intersection and turn left. Turn right into the parking lot behind the
                                         building and go to the south end.

                                                    The street address is:

     3200 Capitol Blvd S.
     South Wing
     Olympia, WA
     98501-3304

             We plan to be in this location until the Legislative Building
                                         renovation project is completed.

   Like most of you, we've had an interesting year.

   A major event, at least for the Olympia staff, was the February 28
   Nisqually Earthquake, which displaced our headquarters staff from the
   Capitol Building. After three moves, we decided they would relocate in
   the Sunset Building in Tumwater until the Capitol renovation project is
   completed.

   I can't say enough about the perseverance our of staff members during
   this time, particularly those in Western Washington most directly
   affected by the quake. Most, if not all, went back to work the next
   day.
   I also need to compliment all of our staff for the outstanding work
   they have done this year. In particular:
     * Our Lynnwood Team spent several months and countless hours working
       on a very complicated audit of a bond sale by a sewer district. We
       reported that the sale was illegal, and made our first-ever
       referral to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     * At the behest of the Legislature, we continued our research on a
       statewide performance review/audit, and made recommendations on how
       to accomplish that.
     * We continued to refine our audit and reporting processes to make
       them more efficient and effective.
     * In 2001, we received one formal appeal of our audit costs, which
       has been resolved. The Holmes Harbor Sewer District appealed a
       portion of the costs of reviewing a bond transaction. However,
       after going through the resolution process required by state law,
       it was determined that the District would pay the bill. We continue
       to work with the District on a payment schedule.
     * Made organizational changes designed to streamline our management
       team and give our front-line managers and other employees more
       decision-making authority.
     * Worked with legislators, government associations and others to pass
       a bill clarifying the state's Open Public Meetings Act.

   We look forward to 2002, and to continuing to work with our audit
   clients to promote open and accountable government.

Performance Review

    A statewide performance review should focus on the executive branch of
                                                         state government.

                                        It should look at state government
    from the perspective of the clients we are trying to serve. We need to
    continue to take advantage of new technology to deliver more goods and
                                           better service at a lower cost.

         This review should be conducted using existing state expertise in
      collaboration with business and community volunteers. The leadership
               and management of this review should not be contracted out.

   It also is critical that front-line state employees be given incentives
        and opportunities to provide suggestions and to participate in the
                                            review effort. State employees
                            know where opportunities for improvements are.
                                           The Alliance for Accountability
     * Would be composed of Washington's top leaders and best thinkers,
       including citizens, business, labor, front-line state employees,
       college and university students and faculty, and elected leaders.
     * Could address fundamental and far-reaching questions such as what
       services state government should provide, how they should be
       delivered and how we should finance those services.
     * The Alliance proposal is in House Bill 1276, which was considered,
       but not adopted, by the 2001 Legislature.

                                                    The Legislature's role

       As program and funding policies are discussed, it is very useful to
   consider the effect a particular program or funding decision would have
                                                           on performance.

         Performance measures provide a tool that can be used to make this
                                                               assessment.

           Legislative hearings also afford the opportunity to examine the
         baseline performance indicators that have been established by the
   agency and the degree to which citizens and policy makers were involved
          in the adoption of those measures. In other words, is the agency
                               measuring the right thing in the right way?

   The Legislature, other public officials,
   state employees and citizens need to know the extent to which state
   agencies and programs are achieving the purposes for which they were
   created.  It is essential to compare the conditions, problems and
   priorities that led to the creation of state agencies and programs with
   current conditions, problems and priorities and to examine the need for
   those agencies and programs in the current environment.

   Along with examining the performance of state agencies and programs,
   policy makers and citizens also must consider the effect that state
   government programs have on people's lives.  They must regularly
   compare the level of programs and services of Washington state
   government to that of other comparable entities.  Much can be done to
   improve state government in tangible, nonpartisan ways.
   Believing that an overall look at state government was a way to collect
   this information, legislators in early 2001 requested our
   recommendations in three areas:
     * Reconnecting citizens to state government.
     * Conducting a comprehensive statewide performance review, including
       a look at laws that have been enacted to promote financial and
       performance accountability and the roles of those charged with
       providing oversight.
     * Ways to take further advantage of new technology to deliver more
       goods and better service at a lower cost.

   Based on this request and our research, we suggested the Governor and
   the Legislature:
     * Authorize a comprehensive review of state government. The review
       would build on the nature of the work currently being performed by
       the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee, but would take a
       big picture, rather than individual program approach.
     * Examine current laws designed to promote financial and performance
       accountability to ensure that they reflect public expectations and
       sound financial management principles and make changes as deemed
       appropriate.
     * Take a fresh look at the roles of each of the agencies and
       committees charged with promoting accountability and performance
       and make adjustments as deemed necessary.
     * Consider setting up the Alliance for Accountability as a means of
       reconnecting citizens to government. House Bill 1276, which did not
       pass the 2001 Legislature, would have created this alliance.
     * Give favorable consideration to legislation calling for independent
       reviews of selected agency performance measurement efforts.

   We also recommended that the state Information Service Board (ISB) and
   the Department of Information Services (DIS):
     * Should be authorized and funded to provide greater assistance to
       state agencies and programs in their efforts to increase efficiency
       and to demonstrate results.
     * Annually evaluate and provide recommendations to the Governor and
       Legislature relative to the state's use of information technology
       and electronic commerce from a statewide perspective.

   These recommendations build on strong efforts that have been made to
   strengthen accountability. New laws and policies seek to make state
   officials and agencies good stewards of the financial resources
   entrusted to us and to hold state officials accountable for results. In
   other words, in addition to making legally appropriate expenditures, we
   also need to hold state officials responsible for the value received.

   These performance-related laws and initiatives focus on individual
   agencies and programs. They do not create a structure for the overall
   management of state government and the resources entrusted to it.
   Hence, there is a risk that we are building and sustaining unneeded,
   overlapping bureaucracies and administrative costs.

   Another way to look at this issue is by asking a fundamental question.
   If we were to build an organization from scratch today to deliver the
   programs, services and activities that state government is committed
   to, what would state government look like?

   Strengthening the Performance and Accountability of State Government

   Three initiatives are critical to strengthening the performance and
   accountability of state government and are fundamental to improving
   citizen respect for and confidence in government.

   First, we need to devise strategies for reconnecting citizens and
   government.

   Second, we need to take advantage of rapid technological advances in
   focusing attention on government responsiveness, coordination of
   services, results orientation and accountability.

   Third, we have an opportunity and obligation to take a comprehensive
   look at what state government should be doing and how it should be
   doing it. We must demonstrate, on a regular basis, that state
   government is a prudent steward of public resources and that it is
   delivering services that Washington citizens want, need and can afford.
   We need to ensure that we have the management framework to ensure we
   are accomplishing this.

   We all know that increasing citizen frustration has led to the passage
   of initiatives limiting the growth in spending. At the same time, the
   state is attempting to address an increasing demand for services
   brought about by population growth and other circumstances. A slowing
   economy and another set of initiatives that provide automatic
   cost-of-living increases for teachers and the reduction of classroom
   sizes are placing significant new demands on the state's budget.
   Therefore, it is imperative that state government gets the maximum
   value for every public dollar entrusted to it. That is what the public
   expects.

   We must not shrink from our responsibility to listen. We must welcome
   it as an opportunity to reassess whether the way we do business aligns
   with the desires and expectations of Washington citizens. We must deal
   with policies for tomorrow, not yesterday's politics. The issue of
   governance is just too important.

Fraud and Whistleblower Programs

      In the past year, we have reported on more than $500,000 in fraud in
       state agencies and local governments. In the past 14 years, we have
           investigated almost 450 frauds totaling $8.4 million in losses.
        During fiscal year 2001 the Whistleblower Program substantiated 38
          percent of all assertions filed and sought recovery of more than
                                                                $265,000.
        Additional information on the programs will be in separate reports
                                                published later this year.

   We place a high priority
   on our fraud and whistleblower investigations.

   We have made fraud prevention and detection an integral part of our
   risk-based approach to auditing. This approach provides meaningful
   information to citizens, legislators and other policymakers interested
   in state and local government operations.

   We take great pride in the two aspects of the fraud program: The
   Special Investigations Team, which monitors all fraud cases throughout
   the state and our fraud prevention training for the financial managers
   of state agencies and local governments. Annually, we reach more than
   2,500 employees.

   The State Employee Whistleblower Protection Program authorizes the
   Office to investigate and report on assertions of improper governmental
   action that result from violations of federal or state law or rule; a
   gross waste of public funds; or actions which are of substantial and
   specific danger to public health or safety. The law also provides
   remedies to state employees who believe that workplace reprisal or
   retaliatory action has occurred as a result of having filed, or
   provided information in connection with, a report of improper
   governmental action.

   We work hard to complete our investigations in a timely manner. In
   calendar year 2001 the average time for a Whistleblower investigation
   declined by 33 percent, dropping from an average of 217 days to 146
   days. Investigations resulting in substantiated assertions were reduced
   by an average of 42 fewer days and investigations of non-substantiated
   assertions achieved a 60 percent reduction, declining from an average
   of 100 days to only 40 days.

Schools

      The results of our work can be found on our website, www.sao.wa.gov.
       To find the schools sections, click on the Local Government button.
       Also, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee has done its own
     assessment of special education programs. You can find that report at

                                                  http://jlarc.leg.wa.gov/

   The state's 296 school
   districts, which spend $6.1 billion in state and federal dollars each
   year, have proven to be good stewards of public dollars.

   In fact, our work over the past several years has shown that nearly 100
   percent of the money the education system receives is spent for
   appropriate purposes. In addition to our regular audits of districts,
   the Legislature asked us to pay special attention to special education
   programs and how districts spend and report on the dollars they receive
   for student transportation, teacher education and experience and
   enrollment.

   Based on what we've found, we have recommended that the Legislature
   take back the more than $1 million in general fund money that we
   receive to do these audits.

   Also in 2001, we continued work under our Single Audit of Schools Pilot
   Project. School districts spending more than $300,000 in federal funds
   are required to have an audit of those funds. This pilot provides for a
   cycled approach to this audit, as opposed to an annual single audit for
   each district, adding efficiencies to our audits and saving districts
   money.

   However, it is likely that this project will be discontinued after
   audits are completed in 2002. While we strongly believe that the
   increased coverage of federal programs is a benefit to the federal
   government, and that the audit cost savings associated with the
   centralized approach are important to all parties, we have been unable
   to reach a consensus with the education community about what would be
   needed to continue this innovative approach to auditing.
   __________________________________________________________________

Local Government

   Our Local Government Finance Project continues to collect and report on
                         information from the state's counties and cities.
   The information is easily accessed on our web site, www.sao.wa.gov, and
                reports can be customized, depending on what a user needs.
   Policymakers, legislators, citizens and local government officials find
                                                    the data very helpful.

   The local governments
   we audit range from tiny mosquito districts to the largest, most
   complex organizations, such as King County.

   But no matter what the size, we view these audit clients as partners in
   our efforts to promote accountability over public dollars.

   We know that local governments are facing some challenges as they
   respond to voter passed initiatives limiting tax increases. We want to
   assist them in developing efficient and innovative approaches to
   effective internal controls that protect tax dollars from loss,
   misappropriation or misuse.

   We also appreciate the partnerships we have with associations
   representing local governments. These associations work with us on
   complex issues ranging from the provision of Internet delivery systems
   to compliance with new federal regulations on reporting.
   __________________________________________________________________

Recommendations

                                            Common internal control issues
     * A lack of oversight over payroll processing and timesheets.
     * Grants that are improperly charged for unallowable costs.
     * A lack of policies and procedures on Internet and E-mail use.
     * A lack of documentation that public funds were spent for public
       purpose, i.e. travel, meals, etc.

   One of the most
   valuable services we provide is recommendations on how agency
   operations can be improved.

   In the past year, we closely examined the internal controls of many
   local governments and state agencies.

   Internal controls are those policies and processes that are used to
   safeguard resources against misappropriation, loss or misuse and to
   ensure compliance with laws, regulations, contracts and management
   directives. Internal controls also enable organizations to develop and
   maintain timely and reliable financial information needed to help
   citizens make informed decisions about government operations.

   An effective system of internal controls can give managers the means to
   provide accountability for programs, and a way to determine whether the
   programs they direct meet established goals and objectives.

   As organizations become more complex and introduce new processes and
   automated systems, the need for strong internal controls increases.

   Our experience with many types of governments and internal control
   systems helps us make recommendations for improvements. We view this
   constructive, proactive process as one of the most important elements
   of our work.

About Our Office

    We are a large, professional organization. We operate on a $40 million
                      two-year budget with a staff of about 300 employees.
             We have 19 teams located in Olympia and throughout the state.
                                            Our website is www.sao.wa.gov

   The Washington State Auditor's Office was created in the Constitution
   and is responsible for auditing every public dollar spent by state and
   local government in the state.

   We audit more than 2,600 governments annually or every two and three
   years depending on the size and complexity of their operations. This
   includes all state agencies, colleges and universities, counties,
   cities and towns, school districts and various taxing districts.

   While we audit financial statements, much of our work focuses on
   compliance with state laws and regulations and the entities' own
   policies and ordinances.

   We also concentrate on areas in which public resources are most at
   risk. These areas include cash handling operations, vendor payments,
   payroll, bidding and travel.

   We actively report our work. Because citizens need information to
   assess how well government is operating, we widely disseminate our
   audit reports as reporting tools to the public. We also report our work
   to government entities as management tools to help them improve their
   operations.
