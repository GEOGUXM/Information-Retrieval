   DECEMBER 2001 WATER CONDITIONS STATEMENT

   URGENT NOTICE TO MASSACHUSETTS DATA USERS

   Due to recent delays in funding from the Massachusetts Metropolitan
   District Commission (MDC), real-time data access is unavailable for 15
   of the 16 stations listed below. Although the  MDC is unable to provide
   their share of funding for the gage, Connecticut River at Montague
   City, the USGS cooperative and federal programs provide more than 50
   percent of annual operational funds, so data for this station will
   continue to be provided on the web. The USGS and MDC are actively
   seeking reinstatement of cooperative funds by the MDC and regret any
   inconvenience this may cause. If, however, funding cannot be restored
   by the end of January 2002, it will be necessary to permanently
   decommission and discontinue these stations. Discontinuation of
   long-term monitoring stations results in gaps in the historical records
   and diminishes the statistical significance of the data.
