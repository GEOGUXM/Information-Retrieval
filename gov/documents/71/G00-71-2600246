         Thank you for visiting the TMU web page. The Traffic Management Unit
         (TMU) at Fort Worth ARTCC is responsible for balancing air traffic
         demand with system capacity in the national airspace system. To achieve
         this, Fort Worth ARTCC TMU is proactively involved in national traffic
         management initiatives that affect airports and airspace across the
         country and occasionally on the international level. Traffic management
         coordinators implement these initiatives in consideration of such
         factors as weather, traffic volume, traffic complexity, military
         special use airspace and certain major sports events that warrant
         traffic management programs. With that in mind, a simplified mission
         statement for TMU might be "minimize impact, maximize efficiency."

         All users of Fort Worth ARTCC airspace are invited to call me to
         address any concerns or questions regarding traffic management issues.
         My telephone number is (817) 858-7593, and, again, thank you for
         visiting our web page.
