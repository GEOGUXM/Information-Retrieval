         Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 (Prop. 36)

   FACT SHEET

   On November 7, 2000, California voters approved Proposition 36 -- The
   Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 (the Act). The Act is
   the most significant state law change since "three strikes," and
   substantially changes California's judicial processes and substance
   abuse treatment systems.

   What the Act Does

   Under the Act, certain non-violent adult offenders who use or possess
   illegal drugs would receive drug treatment in the community rather than
   incarceration. It was designed to:
     * Preserve jail and prison cells for serious and violent offenders.
     * Enhance public safety by reducing drug-related crime.
     * Improve public health by reducing drug abuse through proven and
       effective treatment strategies.

   Eligible offenders receive up to one year of drug treatment and six
   months of after-care. The courts may sanction offenders who are not
   amenable to treatment. Vocational training, family counseling, literacy
   training, and other services may also be provided.
     * The Act also requires that participating treatment programs be
       licensed or certified.
     * Use of Proposition 36 funds for drug testing is specifically
       prohibited by the Act.

   Funding

   Effective July 1, 2001, the Act appropriates $120 million annually for
   distribution to counties to operate drug treatment programs and to
   provide probation administration and supervision, court monitoring, and
   other services. Start-up funds of $60 million were made available for
   fiscal year 2000-2001. The provisions of the Act have no sunset date,
   but funding ends after fiscal year 2005-2006.

   The Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs (ADP) is to allocate funds
   each year to county governments to cover the cost of implementing this
   measure. Funds are allocated on a formula that distributes 50% on a
   base allocation, 25% on number of drug arrests, and 25% on drug
   treatment caseload.

   Planning and Collaboration

   Regulations (Title 9, California Code of Regulations) implementing the
   Act require counties to designate a County Lead Agency to administer
   the Act locally and to receive funds. As a condition of receiving
   funds, counties must annually submit a county plan describing the
   processes and services that they will employ to implement the Act, as
   well as proposed expenditures. The plans must be developed in
   collaboration with all county agencies and any other entities
   responsible for administering the Act and with input from impacted
   community parties and federally recognized American Indian tribes.

   Reports and Evaluation

   Counties are required to submit reports to ADP. Currently-available
   data collection systems will be utilized whenever possible and
   effective. The Act requires ADP to annually evaluate the effectiveness
   and fiscal impact of the programs funded, including the implementation
   process, review of incarceration costs and changes in the crime rate,
   prison and jail construction, and welfare costs.

   The Act also provides up to $3.3 million for a mandated, long-term
   study on the effectiveness of the Act and the fiscal impact of the
   programs authorized by the Act to be conducted by a California public
   university. The study will include the implementation process, a review
   of lower incarceration costs, reductions in crime, reduced prison and
   jail construction, reduced welfare costs, the adequacy of funds
   appropriated, and any other impact or issues that can be identified by
   ADP.
