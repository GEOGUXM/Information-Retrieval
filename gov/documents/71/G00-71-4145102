     A Quick Quotes enabler would be assigned a personal customer space,
   similar to a shopping cart. The Quick Quotes would consist of multiple
   commodity departments (e.g., PCs, printers, scanners, etc.). The buyer
   could peruse each commodity department and search for products by first
      developing a commodity specification profile (e.g., chip type and
    speed, and RAM) or by make and model. The resulting search would list
    "hits" from lowest price to highest price. The make and model search
   will result in the best "apple to apples" hits. The buyer might select
   one or more products based on a review of commodity specifications from
    one or more suppliers and move them into its personal customer space.

        Note: Quick Quotes will be an operational pilot to facilitate
   procurement within the Government. Please check back often for news and
                                information.
