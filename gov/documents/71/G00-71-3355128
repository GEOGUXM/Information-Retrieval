   The US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate
   Variability and Change divided the country into regions (listed to the
   left), each with its own Assessment Group.  In most cases, the
   Assessment Groups organized "regional scoping workshops" and generated
   reports for each region (see workshops page for additional information
   on the workshops).

   A separate "Synthesis Team" consolidated many of these regions to form
   larger "mega-regions" (listed above) around which its Overview and
   Foundation reports are organized.  In most cases, if you want
   information on a particular area of the country, you should start with
   the Mega-Regions.  Note that 2 of the regions (Alaska and Pacific
   Northwest) are not consolidated with other regions and are considered
   stand-alone mega-regions in the Synthesis Team's reports.
