   Washington, D.C. Gentlemen: In accordance with the provisions of
   section 305(a)(1)(B) and (a)(6) of Public Law No. 105-119, the
   Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals
   herewith submits the final report of its recommendations for changes
   concerning structure and circuit boundaries in the federal appellate
   system appropriate for expeditious and effective disposition of
   appellate caseloads, consistent with fundamental concepts of fairness
   and due process. Respectfully submitted, Byron R. White Chair cc:
   William H. Rehnquist Chief Justice of the United States appellate
   structure: findings and recommendations in brief Here in brief outline
   is our key structural recommendation and its basic pre- mises. All of
   the Commission's recommendations are listed in the Foreword and
   Summary, and in Chapter 6. About the Ninth Circuit * Splitting the
   Ninth Circuit itself would be impractical and is unnecessary. As an
   administrative entity, the circuit should be preserved without statu-
   tory change. * The circuit's court of appeals should continue to
   provide the West a single body of federal decisional law. To improve
   the consistency and coherence of that court's decisions, however,
   Congress should restructure it into smaller, regionally based
   divisions-adjudicative divisions-each division to decide appeals
   arising within its region. * Each regional division should have from 7
   to 11 active circuit judges. A majority should reside in the division,
   but some should serve for a term in a division other than where they
   reside to enhance interdivisional consis- tency. * Each regional
   division should perform an en banc function as if it were a court of
   appeals. The circuit-wide en banc process should be abolished. * A
   "Circuit Division," with 13 judges from all regional divisions, serving
   for limited terms in addition to their regular assignments, should
   resolve conflicts between the regional divisions. * Recourse from
   decisions of regional divisions, except when the Circuit Division
   exercises its discretion to resolve interdivisional conflicts, and from
   Circuit Division decisions, should be to the Supreme Court. About the
   circuits and courts of appeals in general * Although other courts of
   appeals may become large enough to require restructuring,
   circuit-splitting as a means to that end will rarely be fea- sible
   without extensive and undesirable circuit reconfiguration. * To avoid
   the costs and disruptions of creating new circuits, Congress should
   authorize courts with more than 15 judgeships to restructure themselves
   into smaller adjudicative divisions. * The need to restructure will
   vary among the circuits, but as courts reach 18 to 20 judgeships, the
   need for restructuring becomes especially com- pelling, in order to
   maintain consistency and coherence. iii Contents Foreword and Summary,

   and Summary Congress created this Commission on Structural Alternatives
   for the Federal Courts of Appeals in late 1997. It did so in the wake
   of controversy over whether the court of appeals for the Ninth
   Circuit-the largest federal court of appeals- has grown to a point that
   it cannot function effectively and whether, in re- sponse, Congress
   should split the Ninth Circuit to create two or more smaller courts.
   The statute directed the Commission to study the present circuit con-
   figuration and the structure and alignment of the courts of appeals,
   with par- ticular reference to the Ninth Circuit. It further directed
   it to submit by Decem- ber 18, 1998, recommendations to the President
   and Congress on changes in circuit boundaries or structure as may be
   appropriate for the expeditious and effective disposition of the
   appellate caseload, consistent with fundamental con- cepts of fairness
   and due process. We have, as directed, given particular attention to
   the Ninth Circuit and its court of appeals but have done so as part of
   our examination of the nationwide system of appellate courts. The
   thirteen United States courts of appeals are in practical effect courts
   of last resort: the Supreme Court reviews but a small fraction of their
   decisions. If we are to have a rule of law, those courts must function
   effectively, rendering decisions promptly and consistently and through
   a process that accords to every case the deliberative attention of the
   judges. Those courts are operating under the pressure of caseload
   increases that have transformed them into different judicial entities
   from what they were at mid- century. The pressures continue, and there
   is little likelihood that caseloads and work burdens on the judges will
   lessen in the years ahead. Fundamental to the Commission's analysis is
   the distinction between a cir- cuit as a territorial-administrative
   unit of the federal judiciary and the circuit's court of appeals, an
   adjudicative body, the highest of numerous courts in each circuit. Our
   study has revealed that the administration of the Ninth Circuit is, at
   the least, on a par with that of other circuits, and innovative in many
   respects. We see no good reason to split the circuit solely out of
   concern for its size or administration. Neither do we see a need to
   split the Ninth Circuit in order to solve prob- lems having to do with
   the consistency, predictability, and coherence of circuit law. The
   quality of a circuit's decisional law is a function of its court of
   appeals as an adjudicative body, and is largely unrelated to the
   administration of the circuit. Some who believe that high quality
   decisional law is best achieved in a decisional unit that is smaller
   than the number of judgeships now authorized or needed in the future
   for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have argued that the circuit
   should be split, because splitting circuits has been the way that
   courts of appeals, deemed too large, have been reduced to optimal
   levels in the past. But to split the Ninth Circuit in an effort to
   correct these and other condi- tions would deprive the courts now in
   the Ninth Circuit of the administrative ix Report of the Commission on
   Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals advantages
   afforded by the present circuit configuration and deprive the West and
   the Pacific seaboard of a means for maintaining uniform federal law in
   that area. We conclude that such a step should not be taken unless
   there is no other means of responding to perceived problems in the
   court of appeals and of creating an effective adjudicative structure
   within the existing circuit bound- aries. We believe there is an
   effective alternative for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that
   should also be made available to all courts of appeals as they grow,
   through the organization of the court into divisions, thereby creating
   smaller decisional units. Therefore, we recommend that Congress enact a
   statute organizing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals into three
   regionally based adjudicative divisions- the Northern, Middle, and
   Southern-each division with a majority of its judges resident in its
   region, and each having exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the
   judicial districts within its region (Chap. 3, sec. D). Each division
   would function as a semi-autonomous decisional unit. To resolve
   conflicts that might develop between regional divisions, we recommend a
   Circuit Division for con- flict correction, which would replace the
   current limited en banc system. With from seven to eleven judges
   serving together on each regional division over an extended period of
   time, this plan would increase the consistency and coher- ence of the
   law, maximize the likelihood of genuine collegiality, establish an
   effective procedure for maintaining uniform decisional law within the
   circuit, and relate the appellate forum more closely to the region it
   serves. The circuit would remain intact as an administrative unit,
   functioning as it now does. If Congress were to reject our
   recommendation to restructure the court of appeals and decide instead
   to split the circuit, the challenge of finding a work- able solution is
   daunting. We examined over a dozen proposals and found each without
   merit. We describe the only plans that are even arguable in Chap. 3,
   sec. E, but each is flawed and we endorse none of them. Mindful of the
   Commission's charge relating to the federal appellate system
   nationwide, we have developed the concept of divisional organization
   not only as a solution to the immediate Ninth Circuit situation but
   also as an alternative to circuit splitting for all other courts of
   appeals as their size increases. Many of the reasons offered for
   splitting the Ninth Circuit would counsel the imme- diate or near-term
   splitting of several other circuits as well. Circuit splitting is not a
   feasible long-range means of creating smaller appellate courts,
   however. We agree with our predecessor body, the Commission on Revision
   of the Fed- eral Court Appellate System, which in 1973 concluded that
   no regional circuit should consist of fewer than three states. Courts
   of appeals in regional circuits of only one or two states are unlikely
   to be able to fulfill the federalizing func- tion that the nation
   expects of its intermediate courts of appeals. Applying that principle,
   there are now eight circuits (not counting the D.C. Circuit) that
   cannot be split. Yet the courts of appeals in those circuits are likely
   to continue to expand. Enactment of our recommended divisional
   organization of the Ninth Cir- x Foreword & Summary cuit Court of
   Appeals would create a model that could be copied or adapted in later
   years by courts of appeals in other circuits. With that in view, we
   also recommend that Congress enact a statute of general applicability
   authorizing any court of appeals with more than fifteen judgeships to
   organize itself into adjudicative divisions (Chap. 4, sec. A). The
   statute that we recommend would leave much leeway to each court in
   designing a divisional structure, and there are various ways that can
   be done. The Ninth Circuit regional plan that we describe here is only
   one model. Apart from authorizing a divisional structure in the large
   appellate courts, Congress can best equip those courts to cope with
   future, unforeseen condi- tions by according them a flexibility they do
   not now have. Rather than impose a fixed set of structures or
   procedures for all courts of appeals, we recommend statutes that would
   give the courts of appeals and the circuit councils a flexibil- ity,
   within a prescribed framework, to shape structure and process to fit
   the particular needs of each court as they emerge over time.
   Specifically, we recom- mend that Congress authorize each court of
   appeals to decide some cases through panels of two rather than three
   judges (Chap. 4, sec. B) and authorize circuits to establish district
   court appellate panels (DCAPs) to provide appellate review in
   designated categories of cases with panels of two district judges and
   one circuit judge, with discretionary review available thereafter in
   the court of appeals (Chap. 4, sec. C). Collectively, the options that
   our recommended measures would provide to the appellate courts-to
   organize themselves into adjudicative divisions, to function
   selectively through two-judge panels, to establish district court
   appel- late panels-should equip the courts of appeals with an ability,
   structurally and procedurally, to accommodate continued caseload growth
   into the indefinite future, while maintaining the quality of the
   appellate process and delivering consistent decisions-assuming, of
   course, that the system has the necessary number of judges and other
   resources. Given its statutory charge, a majority of the Commission
   does not address overall federal jurisdiction. We did, however,
   consider the structural implica- tions of some specific aspects of
   appellate jurisdiction. We recommend that Congress not authorize direct
   court of appeals review of bankruptcy decisions, pending further study
   by the Judicial Conference. We also analyze the proposal that court of
   appeals jurisdiction be made generally discretionary but make no
   specific recommendation (Chap. 5, sec. B), and discuss the place of the
   U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the federal appellate
   system, indi- cating certain categories of cases that have been
   suggested for that appellate resource, again without making any
   specific recommendations (Chap. 5, sec. C). We submit this report to
   the President and Congress to discharge our statu- tory responsibility,
   and to provide alternative structures for the federal courts of appeals
   that we believe will further the administration of justice in our
   country for years to come. xi Chapter 1 The Commission: Creation,
   Mission, and Activities Congress created the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals in Pub. L. No. 105-119,
   signed by the President on November 26, 1997. Appendix A contains the
   text of the statute. This is the final report that sections (a)(1) and
   (6) of the statute directed the Commission to submit to the President
   and Congress within a year after the appointment of a quorum of
   Commission members. A. Background Congress created the Commission in
   the wake of disagreement within the Congress and the country over the
   desirability of splitting the Ninth Circuit into two or more separate
   circuits, and if it were to be split, how best to do so. In 1973, the
   Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System
   recommended splitting both the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits.1 More
   recent proposals to split the Ninth Circuit have been introduced in
   Congress, and at the same time, others proposed instead creation of a
   study commission.2 In 1997, the Senate approved a bill that would have
   split the Ninth Circuit, but the House of Representatives did not
   concur. The result was passage of the Act creating this Commission. B.
   Commission Structure and Activities 1. Creation and composition On
   December 19, 1997, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist appointed the
   Commission's five members pursuant to the statute's directive that he
   do so within thirty days of its enactment.3 The Chief Justice appointed
   as commis- sioners Retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, Judge
   Gilbert S. Merritt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
   Judge Pamela Ann Rymer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
   Circuit, Judge William D. Browning of the District of Arizona, and N.
   Lee Cooper, Esq., a member of the Alabama bar and past president of the
   American Bar Association. The statute directed the Commission to elect
   "a chair and vice chair." At its first meeting, on January 16, 1998,
   the Commission elected Justice White as chair and Mr. Cooper as vice
   chair. The statute also authorized the Commission 1. Commission on
   Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, The Geographical Bound-
   aries of the Several Judicial Circuits: Recommendations for Change
   (1973). 2. See, e.g., S. Rep. 104-197, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 1617
   (1995). 3. The statute is silent on the branch of government, if any,
   of which the Commission is a part. 1 Report of the Commission on
   Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals to appoint an
   Executive Director, and the Commission at its first meeting voted to
   ask Professor Daniel J. Meador to assume that post, an assignment he
   ac- cepted. Brief biographies of the Commission members and the
   Executive Di- rector are in Appendix B. Pursuant to another provision
   in the statute, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO)
   provided the Commission "administrative services" and the Federal
   Judicial Center (FJC) provided it "research services." The only other
   Commission staff consisted of one full-time secretary in the Commission
   office and a research assistant at the University of Virginia Law
   School. In light of the small size and limited authorized life of the
   Commission, it decided not to create formal advisory groups or
   subgroups or to retain officially designated reporters, as some earlier
   commissions have done. The AO created an office for the Commission in
   the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, and the AO's Office
   of Public Affairs provided its services to the Commission. 2.
   Activities in pursuit of statutory charge Although the need to study
   the Ninth Circuit was the major impetus for the Commission's creation,
   the statute charged it with a broader task. First, Con- gress directed
   it to "study the present division of the United States into the several
   judicial circuits" and "study the structure and alignment of the
   Federal Court of Appeals system, with particular reference to the Ninth
   Circuit."4 Second, Congress told the Commission to "report to the
   President and the Congress its recommendations for such changes in
   circuit boundaries or struc- ture as may be appropriate for the
   expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the Federal
   Courts of Appeals, consistent with fundamental con- cepts of fairness
   and due process."5 The statute directed the Commission to conduct its
   studies during the ten months following its appointment and to file its
   report with the President and Congress two months later.6 a. Hearings
   and other means of receiving information Pursuant to its study
   function, the Commission, in its first month, reviewed previous studies
   of the appellate system, workload information developed by the FJC, and
   some other statistical data provided by the AO. At its second meeting,
   on February 17, the Commission scheduled and announced nationwide
   through 4. Sec. 305(a)(1)(B)(i, ii), Pub. L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat.
   2491. 5. Sec. 305(a)(1)(B)(iii), Pub. L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2491.
   Our statutory recommendations, throughout the report, are directed to
   the President and the Congress, although for convenience the text may
   often say only "We recommend that Congress" or words to that effect. 6.
   Sec. 305(a)(6), Pub. L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2491. 2 Chapter 1. The
   Commission: Creation, Mission & Activities correspondence and press
   releases six public hearings, starting in Atlanta on March 23, and
   subsequently in Dallas, Chicago, New York, Seattle, and finally, on May
   29, in San Francisco. Pursuant to the statute,7 at least two
   commission- ers were present at each hearing. Tape recordings of the
   hearings were provided to commissioners not able to be present. A total
   of eighty-nine witnesses testified at the six hearings. Sixty-four of
   those appeared at the Seattle and San Francisco hearings. The
   Commission also invited anyone not testifying to submit a written
   state- ment, and received ninety-two such statements. The AO created a
   website for the Commission (http://app.comm.uscourts.gov) and placed on
   it verbatim transcripts of the hearings and statements of witnesses who
   testified or submit- ted written comments in lieu of testifying. The
   Executive Director wrote to each judge of the courts of appeals closest
   to the respective hearing sites, in- forming them of the hearing and
   inviting their testimony. For the two hearings in the Ninth Circuit, he
   likewise wrote to all chief district judges in the circuit and to all
   members of Congress from states within the circuit. Justice White wrote
   to each member of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, to each
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and to each circuit chief judge, inviting
   comments and suggestions regarding the Commission's work. Because the
   Commission held no public hearing in Washington, D.C., the Chair and
   the Executive Director met with judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
   the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
   Colum- bia Circuit to obtain their views. For a similar purpose, the
   entire Commission met with representatives from the Department of
   Justice and the White House Counsel's office. Early in its life, the
   Commission also convened a meeting with a small number of law
   professors in order to learn more about pertinent re- search and
   writings on the federal appellate system. At the request of the Ex-
   ecutive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the
   Com- mission gave status reports on its work to the Conference through
   the Conference's Committees on Court Administration and Case
   Management, and on FederalState Jurisdiction. The Executive Director
   kept the staff counsel for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
   and their pertinent subcommit- tees advised of the Commission's work
   and made himself available to them for consultation. b. Research Upon
   appointment, commissioners and the Executive Director presented the FJC
   with preliminary discrete research requests, most of which could be an-
   swered by assembling information already available. At its April 9
   meeting, the Commission endorsed the outlines of a limited research
   agenda to gather ad- ditional information about areas of analysis the
   Commission identified as high 7. Sec. 305(a)(2)(E), Pub. L. No.
   105-119, 111 Stat. 2491. 3 Report of the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals priorities for its work.
   Pursuant to this and later requests, FJC personnel pre- pared numerous
   special analyses of appellate workload and related informa- tion for
   the Commission's use, only a small part of which is set out in this
   report.8 In consultation with the Commission, the FJC also prepared and
   adminis- tered separate surveys of circuit and district judges, both
   active and senior. Completed surveys were received from 207 circuit
   judges (an 85% response rate) and 726 district judges (an 81% response
   rate). A third survey was sent to a national sample of more than 5,600
   lawyers who had handled appeals in the federal courts in the preceding
   twelve months. Completed surveys were received from 3,017 lawyers (for
   a response rate of 54%). The responses from all three surveys form an
   important part of the Commission's analysis. To facilitate meaningful
   comparisons of the courts of appeals, the FJC also prepared profiles of
   the case-management procedures that each court of ap- peals uses;
   differences in procedures can affect the comparability of statistical
   information about each court's performance. Justice White wrote to the
   chief circuit judges to enlist their cooperation and that of their
   courts and court staffs in the development of these profiles. FJC staff
   analyzed similarities and differences in the courts' procedures for the
   Commission.9 The AO provided the Commission with additional statistical
   reports on the work of the courts of appeals and with other information
   concerning the fed- eral judiciary. c. Draft report and final report
   The Commission determined at its April 9 meeting to prepare and
   disseminate a draft report of its tentative recommendations, so as to
   receive public com- ment before submitting its final report. On October
   7, 1998, the Commission made the draft report available on its website.
   Written copies were distributed to more than 1,200 interested parties,
   including all who testified or submitted written statements to the
   Commission. The Commission invited written com- ments on the tentative
   report, to be received by November 6, 1998. It received 76 comments,
   all of which were posted for review on the Commission's website. 8. The
   statistical data that bear most directly on the arguments that have
   been made to us come from information regularly reported by the courts
   of appeals to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Federal
   Judicial Center periodically converts the court-submitted AO
   information into an integrated database and makes it available through
   the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research

   relied are set out in the Commission's Working Papers, along with
   directions on how to obtain the underlying data from ICPSR to verify or
   extend the analyses. 9. A summary of this analysis is included in the
   Commission's Working Papers, as are results of the surveys. 4 Chapter

   authorized an appropriation of $900,000 for Commission activi- ties,10
   which amount Congress appropriated in the same statute creating the
   Commission. At the date of this final report, the Commission estimates
   it will incur total direct costs of approximately $500,000 chargeable
   to its appropria- tion. D. Considerations Informing Deliberations and
   Recommendations Before proceeding with our analysis and the development
   of our recommen- dations concerning the federal appellate system, we
   think it appropriate to state several matters that have guided and
   influenced our deliberations. 1. Sources of information and analysis We
   have described above and in Chapter 3 the different means by which we
   have gone about our work. Throughout that work, we have benefited also
   from the analyses in previous studies of the federal appellate courts
   specifically or the federal judicial system generally. These include
   the Judicial Conference's 1995 Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts,
   and the 1990 Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee. We are
   particularly in the debt of the Commission on Revi- sion of the Federal
   Court Appellate System, chaired by Senator Roman Hruska (thus
   informally known as the Hruska Commission). Like this Commission, the
   Hruska Commission had as a major concern the Ninth Circuit. That Com-
   mission submitted its first report, The Geographical Boundaries of the
   Several Judicial Circuits: Recommendations for Change, exactly
   twenty-five years ago. That report provided valuable analysis and
   criteria that have informed our work and sharpened our perspective.
   However, during the quarter century since that report, vast changes
   have occurred in the federal appellate system and particu- larly the
   Ninth Circuit, which lead us to a different conclusion. We have also
   given special attention to the views of judges in the Ninth Circuit and
   elsewhere. In our system, judges are both producers and consumers of
   the products of the courts of appeals, and they have unique insights
   from both perspectives. Reports of their experiences have been an
   important source of information for the Commission, as have their
   opinions about proposed structural alternatives for the federal
   appellate system. At the same time, the Commission does not regard the
   preferences of judges as dispositive, and has not treated them as such
   in developing its recommendations. 10. Sec. 305(b), Pub. L. No.
   105-119, 111 Stat. 2491. 5 Report of the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals 2. Jurisdiction and
   structure Structure and circuit alignment in the federal appellate
   system are profoundly affected by the volume of appeals. That volume,
   in turn, is significantly driven by the jurisdiction of the federal
   district courts. The Commission recognizes that significant changes
   need to be made in the jurisdiction of the federal dis- trict courts,
   but because of our statutory charge, the majority of the Commis- sion
   makes no recommendations in that regard. But we do note that restraint
   in conferring new jurisdiction on the federal courts, particularly in
   areas tra- ditionally covered by state law and served by state courts,
   should not be over- looked. Maintaining an appropriate balance of
   federalstate jurisdiction is an important way to keep the federal
   caseload at a level that enables the federal courts, including the
   courts of appeals, to perform their core constitutional functions
   within our federal system. Nor should the possibility of curtailing
   diversity of citizenship jurisdiction be overlooked, at least to the
   extent that it has outlived its historic justifications. On these
   points, see the additional views of Judge Merritt, joined by Justice
   White, following Chapter 6. Chief Justice Rehnquist, in commenting on
   the Commission's Tentative Draft Report, noted not only his agreement
   with our statement on the need for significant changes in the
   jurisdiction of the federal courts, but his agreement as well with the
   separate statement of Judge Merritt and Justice White that changes in
   diversity jurisdiction are needed, in particular the elimination of
   in-state plaintiffs' di- versity jurisdiction. 3. Considerations of
   judicial independence and judicial administration There is one
   principle that we regard as undebatable: It is wrong to realign
   circuits (or not realign them) and to restructure courts (or leave them
   alone) because of particular judicial decisions or particular judges.
   This rule must be faithfully honored, for the independence of the
   judiciary is of constitutional dimension and requires no less. In
   conducting our analysis and developing our recommendations, we have
   proceeded on the premise that decisions about judicial structure and
   circuit alignment should be based on objective and principled
   considerations of sound judicial administration. Moreover, such
   decisions should be made with a long- range perspective and not be
   motivated by short-range, temporary circum- stances. Views about the
   merits or correctness of specific judicial decisions or about
   individual judges currently serving on a court are transient matters
   and are inappropriate bases for constructing long-range institutional
   arrangements. 6 Chapter 2 The Federal Appellate System: Past and
   Present This chapter sketches the history and evolution of "the present
   division of the United States into the several judicial circuits" and
   "the structure and align- ment of the Federal Court of Appeals
   system."11 The number, boundaries, and functions of judicial circuits
   have changed over time, as have the functions and operations of those
   circuits and the appellate courts in each. A. Creating the Geographic
   Design of the System The Judiciary Act of 178912 implemented the
   Constitutional provision that "The judicial power of the United States
   shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as
   the Congress may from time to time ordain and es- tablish."13 It
   created a federal judicial district and a one-judge district court in
   each of the then-eleven states, largely for admiralty, forfeitures and
   penalties, and minor federal crimes and U.S. plaintiff cases. The Act
   arrayed the districts into an eastern, a middle, and a southern
   circuit. Circuit courts sat twice each year in each district of the
   respective circuits to hear diversity of citizenship cases, major
   federal crimes, and larger U.S. plaintiff cases. They also had a lim-
   ited appellate function for some of the larger civil and admiralty
   cases in the district courts.14 Rather than create separate judgeships
   for the system's major trial courts, Congress directed Supreme Court
   justices to travel around each circuit to con- vene circuit courts with
   the respective district judges. This approach saved the money a
   separate corps of judges would require, exposed the justices to the
   state laws and legal practices that affected the Supreme Court docket,
   and pro- moted familiarity with the government in the country's far
   reaches. The circuits, thus, were a means of allocating the trial work
   of Supreme Court justices. Each circuit was served by two of the six
   justices. By 1802, Con- gress had realigned the three circuits into six
   (see Figure 2-A), each served by one justice. Then, as states joined
   the Union, Congress created new circuits and gradually enlarged the
   Supreme Court to provide justices for their circuit courts. 11. Pub. L.

   Ky. District of Albemarle W.D. E.D. District of Pamptico Tenn. Tenn.
   District of Cape Fear Indian Lands Territories 6 Between 1789 and 1866,
   Congress realigned the circuits thirteen times, in each case to adjust
   the Supreme Court Justices' trial court assignments. The number of
   circuits reached its nineteenth century high point in 1855 (see Fig-
   ure 2-B), when Congress added to the nine numbered circuits a separate
   Cali- fornia circuit for the large number of land claims stemming from
   the gold rush.15 As a harbinger of future judgeship arrangements,
   Congress also created the position of circuit judge for the California
   circuit. It did so in part because as the Court's docket grew, the
   Justices spent less time riding circuit. President Lincoln's 1861 state
   of the union message reflected an emerging consensus when it warned
   that "the country has outgrown our present judicial system."16 The 1855
   configuration shown in Figure 2-B, for example, left out- side of the
   circuit system districts in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Texas,
   and Wisconsin. Lincoln knew that the circuit system could not
   accommodate the western territories that would become states without
   making the Supreme Court "altogether too numerous for a judicial body
   of any sort." Equally unac- ceptable was leaving some states out of the
   circuit system. 15. Act of Mar. 2, 1855, 10 Stat. 631. 16. Message to
   Congress (Dec. 3, 1861), in 5 The Works of Abraham Lincoln 4142 (R.

   Fla. S.D. Fla. A partial solution was in place by the end of the
   decade. Lincoln had pro- posed fixing the Supreme Court at a
   "convenient number," irrespective of the number of circuits, and then
   dividing the country "into circuits of convenient size," to be served
   by the Supreme Court justices or by separate circuit judges, or both.
   Although Congress created a tenth seat on the Court in 1863 to accom-
   modate the reconfigured Tenth Circuit of California and Oregon,17 it
   soon un- did that step, reducing the number of justices from ten to
   eight and then, by 1870, fixed the number at nine, where it has been
   ever since.18 Also, in 1869 Congress created nine circuit
   judgeships-one in each circuit-because the Supreme Court justices could
   attend only a fraction of the circuit court ses- sions. Finally, an
   1866 statute19 redrew most of the circuit boundaries (see Fig- ure
   2-C), creating boundaries that are largely still in existence. Since
   1866, Congress has accommodated new states by adding them to existing
   circuits rather than creating new circuits. 17. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, 12

   System Although the system's geographic contours were largely set by
   1866, it would be more than two decades before Congress created
   separate intermediate ap- pellate courts for each circuit. A
   near-breakdown of the judicial system brought that design into
   existence. After the Civil War, statutes promoting economic growth and
   enforcing the Reconstruction Amendments fueled a vast expansion of
   judicial business. The Judiciary Act of 187520 authorized a general
   federal question jurisdiction for cases involving $500 or more, thereby
   making the federal trial courts "the primary and powerful reliances for
   vindicating every right given by the Constitution, the laws, and
   treaties of the United States."21 This large increase in work, almost
   no increase in judgeships, and a struc- ture designed for a different
   era, resulted in "the nadir of federal judicial ad- 20. Act of Mar. 3,

   of the Supreme Court 6465 (1928). 10 Chapter 2. The Federal Appellate
   System: Past & Present ministration."22 By the 1880s, district judges
   sitting alone handled close to 90% of the circuit court caseload and
   often sat on appeals from their own deci- sions.23 Appellate review was
   statutorily foreclosed in many cases-almost all criminal cases and in
   all civil cases involving less than $5,000.24 Even so, the Supreme
   Court's docket grew steeply. From 310 cases in 1860, the Court's docket
   increased to 1,816 in 1890.25 The Court, obliged to decide almost all
   cases brought to it, fell years behind. The search for a solution was
   compounded by conflict between Northern and Eastern interests that
   wanted a strengthened federal court system and Southern and Western
   interests that did not. Congress considered numerous proposals to
   expand federal appellate capacity, such as an interme- diate court of
   appeals and an enlarged Supreme Court, sitting in divisions. The
   culmination of this controversy was the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of
   1891,26 fashioned by Senate Judiciary Committee chairman William Evarts
   of New York. It created a new court-the circuit court of appeals-in
   each of the nine circuits and shifted to these new courts much of the
   Supreme Court's appellate caseload. In doing so, it made the federal
   district courts the system's primary trial courts.27 As a result of the
   Act, circuit boundaries no longer allo- cated Supreme Court justices'
   trial court duties; rather circuit boundaries defined the territorial
   reach of appellate court jurisdiction. Each court of appeals consisted
   of the circuit judgeship created in 1869 and another created by the
   1891 Act, with either a district judge or a Supreme Court justice as
   the third judge. It provided direct Supreme Court review as of right
   from the district courts in some categories of cases and from circuit
   courts of appeals in others. The Act routed all other cases-notably
   criminal, diversity, admiralty, revenue, and patent cases-to the courts
   of appeals for final dispo- sition. The appellate court could certify
   questions to the Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court could grant review
   by certiorari. The Act's effect on the Su- preme Court was
   immediate-filings dropped from 623 in 1890 to 275 in 1892.28 22. Paul

   for the Federal Courts of Appeals C. Evolution of the Supreme Court's
   Discretionary Docket Twentieth-century changes in the appellate system
   have in the main been func- tional, not structural. One such change
   occurred in the first half of the century: the Supreme Court's
   transformation from a law-declaring and error-correcting court into a
   court almost exclusively for law declaring. Under the Evarts Act, the
   forum for direct review of trial-level decisions shifted from the
   Supreme Court to new circuit courts of appeals, and the 1925 "Judges'
   Bill"29 significantly enhanced the Court's discretionary jurisdiction
   through the writ of certiorari. The 1925 statute thus helped the Court
   to serve the objectives that Chief Justice Taft enunciated in arguing
   for its passage: "expounding and stabilizing prin- ciples of law . . .
   , passing upon constitutional questions and other important questions
   of law for the public benefit [and preserving] uniformity of decision
   among the intermediate courts of appeals."30 The culmination of this
   extension of discretionary jurisdiction came in 1988, when Congress
   removed almost all vestiges of the Court's obligatory jurisdiction.31
   Table 2-1 shows that the Court's plenary docket has remained relatively
   steady, but courts of appeals' merits dispositions have grown by
   1,000%. The result is a greatly reduced percentage of courts of appeals
   decisions reviewed by the Supreme Court. The Court has been able to
   develop as a national law-declaring court, while the courts of appeals
   have become the only federal error-correcting courts, for practical
   purposes, the federal appellate courts of last resort. Table 2-1

   Appellate System: Past & Present D. Transformation of the Courts of
   Appeals and Their Work The courts of appeals of 1998 are very different
   bodies from what they were 100 years ago. Changes in the nature and
   size of their workloads required courts to request more judges and to
   adapt their procedures to the changed circumstances. 1. Growth in
   judgeships and workload The intermediate appellate courts grew
   gradually during the first part of the 1900s and more rapidly since
   then.33 As displayed in Table 2-2, four decades after their creation,
   the modal number of judgeships in the courts of appeals had risen to
   four. As they grew, the courts began to sit in more than one panel of
   three, convening occasionally en banc, a practice approved by the
   Supreme Court and then codified in the 1940s.34 By 1950, the modal
   number of judge- ships had risen to six. By 1984, the modal number had
   risen to twelve. Table 2-2 Summary of Authorized Circuit Judgeships for

   2-2, are from Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, History of
   Federal Judgeships, Table K (1991, rev. 1998). 34. As more courts grew
   larger than three judgeships in the 1930s, some of them provided by
   rule for convening en banc for some cases. The Supreme Court upheld
   this practice in 1941, Textile Mills Secs. Corp. v. Commissioner of
   IRS, 314 U.S. 272, 278 (1941), clarifying ambiguities left over from
   the Evarts Act, and in the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, Congress
   specifically authorized the courts of appeals to order hearings or
   rehearings en banc (currently codified as 28 U.S.C. § 46(c)). 13 Report
   of the Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of
   Appeals The work assigned to these courts, however, has increased
   disproportion- ately to the increase in judgeships, as shown in Table
   2-3. Over the last 100 years, filings per appellate judgeship have
   increased by almost a factor of six. By contrast, filings per judgeship
   in the district courts have not even doubled. Table 2-3 35 Authorized

   Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and Court of Claims; appellate
   filings and judgeships for 19841997 include the Court of Appeals for
   the Federal Circuit. By any measure, the courts of appeals of today are
   handling more cases, and more work, than their predecessor courts. With
   only brief respites after new judgeship bills took effect, circuit
   judges have been faced with relentlessly in- creasing caseloads since
   the beginning of the upswing in appeals in the 1960s. Although
   increases in judgeships have been substantial, judgeships have not
   increased as rapidly as raw appellate filings. Since 1960, circuit
   judgeships have grown by roughly 160%, but appeals per judgeship have
   grown by 450%. Figure 2-D plots the increase in total filings and
   filings per judgeship since 1960. 35. Table 2-3 is derived from Annual
   Report of the Attorney General of the United States (1930); Richard

   important as the increase in the numbers of appeals is the change in
   the nature of those appeals over time. As Table 2-4 shows, appeals of
   all types have increased, but the proportion of the courts' dockets
   accounted for by each type has changed. Most striking is the overall
   effect of the increase in appeals associated with the growth in
   criminal prosecutions. There has been substantial growth in direct
   criminal appeals over the past few decades, most dramatically since
   November 1987, the effective date of the sentencing guidelines
   developed and promulgated pursuant to the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act.36
   After a slight decline in the 1970s and early 1980s, criminal appeals
   rose precipitously-from 4,377 in 1981 to 10,740 in 1997. There were
   several apparent causes-stepped- up prosecutorial efforts, the
   sentencing guidelines themselves, the mandatory minimum sentences that
   became increasingly common in the 1980s,37 and the availability of
   appellate review of sentences even after a guilty plea.38 Along with
   the increase in direct criminal appeals came the growth in civil suits
   by incarcerated prisoners, including motions to vacate sentence and
   petitions for writs of habeas corpus (both technically considered civil
   actions), as well as suits alleging civil rights violations and
   unconstitutional conditions of confinement. Civil suits by prisoners
   made up about 8% of the docket in 1960, but more than 30% by 1997. All
   told, the "criminal-related" portion of the appellate docket grew from
   about 24% in 1960 to about 53% in 1997. 36. See U.S. Sentencing

   ending June 30, 1997 (on file with the Commission). During the same
   time, the courts of appeals began to see increasing num- bers of
   appeals brought by unrepresented litigants, as Table 2-5 reveals. In
   1997, fully half of the filings in the courts of appeals that were not
   direct criminal appeals were appeals by unrepresented parties. Although
   we cannot tell how much pro se litigation went on in the courts of
   appeals in earlier decades, it was probably relatively uncommon until
   the growth in prisoner litigation described above. Much of the pro se
   docket is still accounted for by prisoners, but it is not uncommon for
   other litigants to lack legal counsel-about one-quarter to one- third
   of nonprisoner civil appeals from the district courts in 1997 were
   filed by unrepresented litigants. Table 2-5 Estimated Percentage of

   are the number of civil appeals by prisoners as a percentage of the
   national appellate caseload. Reliable information about pro se status
   is available only for the last few years, so only the figures for the
   year ending Sept. 30, 1997, reflect a direct count of pro se cases.
   Like many prisoner cases, appeals filed by unrepresented parties who
   are not incarcerated pose special challenges for the courts, but they
   generally do not involve as much work for judges as fully counseled
   cases because they typi- cally are controlled by well-settled precedent
   or require a highly deferential 16 Chapter 2. The Federal Appellate
   System: Past & Present standard of review.39 In most courts, central
   staff attorneys prepare these cases for decision by a three-judge
   panel. Many such appeals, even when meritorious, do not require
   extensive legal research or conference time, and often they do not
   yield published opinions that take a lot of judicial time to craft.
   Accord- ingly, the number of filings, while important, is not a
   sufficient measure of judicial workload, and should not be taken alone
   as a sign that the courts are overwhelmed. Rather, the nature of the
   work done by the courts of appeals must be considered; it is likely
   that the above described changes in the nature of appeals at least
   partially account for the ability of the courts of appeals to cope with
   much larger caseloads without a commensurate increase in judge- ships.
   2. Responses to growth in judgeships and workload a. Creating new
   circuits and courts of appeals Since 1891, Congress has faced
   "insistent pressure for further subdivision"40 of the circuits. It has
   twice split circuits so as to create smaller courts of appeals that
   proponents of division said would be more effective. These actions
   reflected a view that the only way to deal with a court of appeals
   deemed to have grown too large was to reconfigure the circuit of which
   it was a part. Indeed, for the same reason, the current debate about
   the Ninth Circuit has centered on the question of whether the circuit
   should be split, even though in reality, the primary concern is about a
   court of appeals thought to be growing too large. We offer in Chapter 3
   a new approach-restructuring the court of appeals, but retaining the
   circuit. In this chapter, however, we review briefly the two circuit
   reconfigurations in this century. (1) 1929: Creation of the Tenth
   Circuit and its court of appeals A 1925 American Bar Association
   resolution proposed re-examination of the nine-circuit configuration,
   citing both that year's "Judges' Bill," which expanded the Supreme
   Court's certiorari jurisdiction and regularized the jurisdiction of the
   circuit courts, and the "unequal distribution of the work" of the
   appellate courts.41 39. The current formula used in the assessment of
   circuit judgeship needs discounts pro se cases by two-thirds to reflect
   the generally lower judicial time requirements associated with such
   cases.40. Frankfurter & Landis, supra note 21, at 107. 41. To Change
   the Judicial Circuits of the United States and to Create a Tenth
   Judicial Circuit: Hearing on H.R. 5690 before the Committee on the
   Judiciary, House of Representatives, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., 38 (1928)
   (resolution of the ABA was entered into the record) [hereinafter
   Hearing]. 17 Report of the Commission on Structural Alternatives for
   the Federal Courts of Appeals In February 1928, the House of
   Representatives took up a bill to create an Eighth Circuit of Colorado,
   Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Oklahoma and a new Ninth Circuit of
   Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming
   (renaming the current Ninth as the Tenth Circuit). Others fa- vored a
   three-way split: a five-state Eighth Circuit of the upper midwest (the
   Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska) and two four-state circuits: a
   new Tenth Circuit of the lower midwestern states of Arkansas, Kansas,
   Missouri, and Oklahoma, and a new Eleventh Circuit of Colorado, New
   Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Another provision to make New York a
   single-state Second Circuit was soon dropped in the face of opposition
   from judges and lawyers in that circuit, as were other specific
   changes, such as placing Arkansas in the Fifth Circuit. Little Rock
   lawyer George Rose protested that "Arkansas does most business with St.
   Louis . . . and has almost no business with New Orleans;" furthermore,
   "[i]f Arkansas is put into the fifth circuit, the judges there will
   have to learn Arkansas law, and in the learning will no doubt make many
   mistakes."42 Debate over the Eighth Circuit, however, persisted into
   the next Congress, driven by the circuit's vast geographic expanse and
   its perceived effect on the court's work. Citing tables on caseloads
   and the distances between the principal cities of the Eighth Circuit,
   the ABA argued that an appellate court sitting over so large a
   jurisdiction "can not hope to transact as much business as a station-
   ary court."43 Furthermore, complained Chief Justice Taft (in the days
   before appellate courts sat en banc), such a large circuit creates a
   need for a large court: "The six Circuit judges in the Circuit . . .
   make up two Supreme Courts . . . in the 8th circuit. And this prevents
   the uniformity of decision that is very nec- essary in one Circuit
   having theoretically only one Circuit Court of Appeals."44 The judges
   of the Eighth Circuit conceded a need for some realignment but differed
   over the best way to do it. For example, Kimbrough Stone of Kansas
   City, then the senior (chief) circuit judge, objected to any
   characterization of the Eighth Circuit as backlogged, to which lawyers
   responded that the court avoided backlog only by heavy reliance on
   visiting judges ("I do not remember ever having been in that court for
   a long time and finding three circuit judges on the bench").45 Hearings
   in 1929 ended with near unanimous support for a new Tenth Circuit cut
   from the westernmost states of the existing Eighth Circuit and with the
   addition of some new judgeships for those two appellate courts and
   others. 42. Id. at 21. 43. Id. at 40. 44. Quoted in Denise Bonn, The

   Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals
   The Judicial Conference in March 1964 had recommended splitting the
   Fifth Circuit in order to provide its six states with additional
   federal appellate judge- ships without creating a court of appeals of
   more than nine judgeships.49 That September, however, the Conference
   approved a compromise solution, creating temporary judgeships to assist
   the Court, pending legislative action on the Conference's circuit
   reconfiguration proposal.50 Mississippi Senator James Eastland, chair
   of the Judiciary Committee, wanted to split the Fifth Circuit between
   Louisiana and Mississippi, but his House counterpart, Representative
   Emanuel Celler, feared that a circuit of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and
   Missis- sippi "might not be so sanguine" in enforcing the Supreme
   Court's civil rights decisions as would the judges from Texas and
   Louisiana.51 He opposed any circuit division until the Conference
   undertook "a survey of the geographical organization of the entire
   federal judicial system in the light of population increases and
   economic changes."52 Disappointed with the inconclusiveness of seven
   years of appellate proce- dural innovation, and frustrated with the
   pervasive controversy over Fifth Cir- cuit judgeships and attendant
   circuit splitting recommendations, the Judicial Conference recommended
   in 1971 the creation of the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court
   Appellate System. Congress thus created the sixteen-per- son Hruska
   Commission to study the circuit alignment and the appellate courts'
   internal operating procedures and to submit recommendations to the
   Presi- dent, the Congress, and the Chief Justice.53 After extensive
   hearings, the Hruska Commission filed its report on circuit
   restructuring in December 1973,54 rec- ommending splitting both the
   Fifth and Ninth Circuits,55 but Congress de- clined to implement either
   recommendation. 49. Id. at 83. 50. Id. at 34, 11617. The Conference

   such additional changes in structure or internal procedure as may be

   System: Past & Present In 1978, as part of the Omnibus Judgeship Act,
   Congress authorized any court of appeals with more than fifteen active
   judges to use divisions for some court administration tasks and to
   perform its en banc functions with fewer than all of its judges.56 This
   was a compromise that secured passage of the Act, which increased the
   size of the Fifth Circuit's Court of Appeals from fifteen to twenty-six
   judgeships (and the Ninth Circuit's Court of Appeals from eighteen to
   twenty-three judgeships). However, after the newly enlarged Fifth
   Circuit court held its first en banc hearing-having declined to use the
   limited en banc function authorized by the Act-and as the judges
   attempted to stay current with the law of the circuit, all the judges
   agreed that a division was necessary. (The court also briefly employed
   the administrative division option that the 1978 statute provided.) The
   judges petitioned Congress to create an Eleventh Circuit of Alabama,
   Florida, and Georgia, and a reconfigured Fifth Circuit of Texas,
   Louisiana, and Mississippi. That proposal attracted wide support, and
   Congress enacted it after opposition from civil rights organizations
   ebbed. President Carter signed the bill to create the Eleventh Circuit
   on October 15, 1980. (3) 1982: Creation of the Federal Circuit A
   significant innovation in the organization of the courts of appeals
   system was introduced in 1982, when Congress created the U.S. Court of
   Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court's appellate jurisdiction is
   not regionally determined; it has jurisdiction over certain types of
   appeals from all district courts and over all types of appeals from
   specified trial courts and administrative agencies. It is discussed
   later in Chapter 5. b. New procedures and supporting personnel The
   growth in the volume of appeals, in addition to necessitating more
   judges on each court, has wrought two other far-reaching, and related,
   innovations in the federal appellate courts in the last third of this
   century. One is the adoption of differentiated decisional processes,
   and the other is the employment of cen- tral staff attorneys. Both were
   inventions of necessity, pioneered by the courts to keep abreast of
   rising caseloads, but both have proven to be-for part of the
   docket-more efficient ways to deliver appellate justice regardless of
   docket pressures. Differentiated decisional processes were adopted when
   courts recognized that not every appeal needs the same amount of
   judicial attention. Some ap- peals present difficult questions, or
   questions of great significance to the legal order, while other appeals
   present routine issues that are relatively easy to de- 56. Pub. L. No.
   95-486, 92 Stat. 1633 (1978). 21 Report of the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals cide because the
   controlling law is well settled. For the latter, many courts began to
   find oral argument unnecessary or unhelpful, and the time spent in
   produc- ing the traditional fully reasoned published opinion greater
   than judicial economy warranted. As cases of this type grew to
   represent a larger and larger proportion of appellate dockets, courts
   developed screening or tracking proce- dures to review appeals at an
   early stage and route them through the decisional process tailored to
   their difficulty and precedential significance. Under such tracking
   systems, some appeals continue to receive the traditional process- oral
   argument, conference by the panel, and fully reasoned opinion. Some are
   routed to a settlement procedure aimed at achieving an acceptable
   resolution of the dispute without expenditure of substantial judicial
   time. Still others are decided without oral argument and with a short,
   often per curiam, memoran- dum disposition or brief order, typically
   unpublished. The result, as Table 2-6 shows, is that in several of the
   courts fewer than a third of the cases decided on the merits are argued
   orally; in only three regional courts of appeals was the argument rate
   higher than 50% in 1997. Table 2-6 Percentage of Cases Decided on the
   Merits in Which Oral Argument Was Heard in the Regional Courts of

   caseloads changed, so did the likelihood that an appellate court would
   publish an opinion explaining its de- cision, to the point where today,
   most courts issue published opinions in only a small percentage of the
   appeals they decide on the merits, as Table 2-7 reveals. Table 2-7

   The Federal Appellate System: Past & Present For the most part, the
   decline in oral argument and publication is attribut- able to the
   influx of cases involving unrepresented litigants pursuing relatively
   simple appeals, many of which present the same issues. As the tables
   show, the percentage of cases with counsel that receive argument or
   published opinion is generally considerably higher. Because of changes
   in the nature of the caseload and in the significance of publication,
   lower rates of oral argument or opinion publication cannot
   automatically be interpreted as a sign of dysfunction in a court.57
   Concurrently with the adoption of these abbreviated internal processes
   came the employment of central staff attorneys to help implement the
   new processes. Although judges have long had personal ("elbow") law
   clerks, the use of a cen- tral staff working for the court as a whole
   was genuinely new. Starting in the early 1970s with a handful of such
   attorneys, the courts of appeals have greatly increased their numbers.
   Although central staff attorneys were originally employed primarily to
   help the courts process cases filed by unrepresented prisoners, in most
   courts their duties now extend to other types of cases. In most (but
   not all) courts, staff attorneys perform a screening function,
   reviewing appeals as they become ready for the court's attention and
   routing them into either an oral argument track or a non-argument
   track. In all courts, any judge on the panel responsible for deciding
   the case may choose to schedule a case for argument, and the panel may
   unanimously determine that a case scheduled for argument does not need
   it. In addition to preliminarily determining whether a case will be
   decided with or without argument, staff attorneys generally review the
   briefs and records and prepare memoranda to assist the judges; in some
   courts they also recom- mend dispositions and draft proposed opinions,
   usually in the non-argued cases. The number of central staff attorney
   "work units" allocated to each court of appeals, for the fiscal year
   beginning October 1, 1998, is shown in Table 2-8. The number of work
   units allocated is based primarily on raw filings, so courts with
   higher caseloads are entitled to more staff attorneys. However, the
   alloca- tions do not precisely reflect the number of staff attorneys
   actually employed, because courts have considerable flexibility in how
   they use the funds allocated for this purpose. 57. Opinion publication
   rates declined when the federal judiciary began a deliberate effort to
   reduce the cost of law practice and legal services by refraining from
   publishing opinions that do not add anything new to the law or help
   attorneys better predict appellate outcomes. Although court publication
   and citation practices vary, "unpublished" opinions are increasingly
   accessible by elec- tronic means and in some courts may be cited if no
   better precedent exists. 23 Report of the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals Table 2-8 Central Staff

   22 29 46 23 15 19 48 17 32 13 As central staffs grew, the number of
   personal law clerks for circuit judges also grew, and their functions
   expanded. At mid-century, each circuit judge had a single law clerk.
   Today an active judge may employ three law clerks and two secretaries
   or four law clerks and one secretary. Collectively, this transformation
   of process and personnel in the courts of appeals over the last three
   decades has given rise to concerns among judges, lawyers, and legal
   scholars that the quality of appellate decision making may have been
   eroded and that there has been undue delegation of judicial work to
   non-judges. As to appeals decided without oral argument, the process
   has be- come less visible and, when combined with a less than fully
   reasoned opinion or cryptic judgment order, raises apprehensions as to
   the degree of attention those appeals actually receive from judges
   themselves. The apprehensions are intensified when the court uses staff
   attorneys to draft proposed dispositions, prompting claims by some
   critics of an "invisible judiciary," in addition to as- sertions of an
   invisible process, sometimes summarized in the claim that appel- late
   courts have become "bureaucratized." The Commission has been made aware
   of these concerns through published writings, testimony at its public
   hearings, and written submissions. We have received suggestions that,
   to meet these concerns, the appellate courts hear oral argument in
   larger percentages of cases, issue a greater number of reasoned
   opinions, limit the number of staff attorneys they employ, and be
   supplied with a sufficient number of judges to minimize the likelihood
   of over-reliance on staff attorneys and law clerks. At the same time,
   responses to our survey of practicing appellate lawyers nationwide do
   not reveal a widespread discontent with current practices within the
   federal appellate courts. We do not minimize the seriousness of these
   concerns and suggestions. Indeed, assertions about the decline of the
   appellate process were among the reasons Justice White enlisted the
   cooperation of chief circuit judges in the preparation of profiles of
   each court of appeals' case-management procedures.59 After reviewing
   these profiles and survey results, we conclude that, in general, the
   courts have successfully accommodated their increased caseloads by
   stream- 58. Information supplied by the Administrative Office of the
   U.S. Courts. The Court of Ap- peals for the Federal Circuit, which
   receives its own appropriation, separate from that of the other courts
   of appeals, generally employs a central staff of four staff attorneys
   and four technical advi- sors.59. These profiles will be published
   separately by the Federal Judicial Center in 1999. 24 Chapter 2. The
   Federal Appellate System: Past & Present lining their processes and
   developing efficient methods of appellate case man- agement. We
   believe, however, that most courts have streamlined their proce- dures
   as much as they can without unacceptably compromising their essential
   functions.60 The use of nonjudicial staff, nonargument decision-making
   pro- cedures, summary orders or unelaborated dispositions, and other
   procedural accommodations to caseload volume have made the courts more
   efficient, but at some cost to the appearance of legitimacy of the
   appellate process, and at some risk to the quality of appellate
   justice. Some courts have adopted these procedures in an effort to
   avoid requesting new judgeships, because their judges believe the
   deleterious effects of expanding the appellate bench outweigh its
   benefits. Courts can absorb caseload growth without large judgeship
   increases when that growth occurs largely in the types of cases that
   take little judicial time to resolve. There is no guarantee-and history
   does not support the as- sumption-that caseload growth will be
   restricted to these areas. We suggest in this report structural
   alternatives to address the effects of growth, when growth becomes
   necessary, that will avoid circuit reconfiguration while maintaining
   appellate decisional units of acceptable size and enable the courts to
   continue to render decisions in a fair, timely, and reasoned manner. E.
   The Emergence of the Circuit as an Entity of Federal Judicial
   Administration A final piece in the evolution of "the present division
   of the United States into the several judicial circuits" is the
   emergence of the circuit itself as an impor- tant administrative entity
   of the federal judicial system. During the nineteenth century, circuits
   were the mechanism for arranging the trial court obligations of
   itinerant Supreme Court justices and, after 1869, of separate circuit
   judges. Circuits exhibited rudimentary governance elements as circuit
   justices watched over the activities of district judges,61 but the cre-
   ation of a court of appeals for each circuit strengthened their
   administrative functions. Congress formalized that function in 1922,
   when it created the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, now the
   Judicial Conference of the United States. Supervision of the courts'
   budget and personnel resided in the Depart- ment of Justice, but during
   their annual gathering the circuits' senior judges (in effect the chief
   judges) reported on the state of their circuits' appellate and district
   dockets and developed suggestions for "uniformity and expedition of
   business."62 The 1922 Act also modified policies on temporary inter-
   and intra- 60. More than half of the 188 circuit judges who responded
   to a 1992 FJC survey agreed strongly or moderately with this view (see
   Planning for the Future: Results of a 1992 Federal Judicial Center
   Survey of United States Judges at 17). 61. Russell Wheeler, The Future
   of the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit-Until 1939, in Long Range
   Planning for Circuit Councils 1, 1113 (Federal Judicial Center 1992).
   62. An Act for the Appointment of an Additional Circuit Judge for the
   Fourth Judicial Circuit, 25 Report of the Commission on Structural
   Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals circuit assignments by
   authorizing the senior circuit judge to assign district or appellate
   judges of the circuit to temporary duty on other courts within the
   circuit, and to petition the Chief Justice for an inter-circuit
   assignment.63 In 1939, Congress formalized circuit governance by
   constituting each circuit's appellate judges into a judicial council
   "[t]o the end that the work of the district courts shall be effectively
   and expeditiously transacted." The councils reviewed district court
   workload statistics, and "district judges [were] promptly to carry out
   the directions of the council."64 The 1939 law also transferred
   responsibility for the national administration of the federal courts,
   including budget manage- ment, from the Justice Department to the newly
   created Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, to function under the
   direction and supervision of the Con- ference of Senior Circuit Judges.
   To the judicial sponsors of the 1939 legislation, however, this was "a
   very small part of the bill." Its major feature: "unifying the
   administration of justice in the hands of the chief judicial officers
   of the courts . . . [who] shall be furnished the facts with respect to
   the administration of justice in their circuits . . . in quarterly
   reports by the [Director of the Admin- istrative Office]."65 Congress
   also mandated an annual conference in each cir- cuit to include circuit
   and district judges and members of the bar under rules prescribed by
   each court of appeals, "for the purpose of consideration of the state
   of the business of the courts and advising ways and means of improving
   the administration of justice within the circuit."66 For several
   decades, however, the councils and circuit conferences were not major
   participants in federal judicial administration. Then-Circuit Judge
   War- ren Burger in 1958 challenged the councils to "be managers, not
   just spectators, of how the courts are run,"67 and a leading student of
   the federal courts referred to them in 1970 as "rusty hinges of federal
   judicial administration."68 But in the last third of the century,
   Congress and the courts have expanded their mission ("the effective and
   expeditious administration of justice within [the respective]

   membership of their circuit conferences to create gatherings more in
   line with the statutory mission. Congress has also regularized the
   tenure of both circuit and district chief judges, to avoid very brief
   or very long service. Under a 1982 statute,70 a va- cancy in a chief
   judgeship is filled by the senior active judge of the court under the
   age of 65 and chief judges may serve for no more than seven years, or
   until the age of 70. This change derived from a Hruska Commission call
   to "mini- mize the impact of a chief judge who lacks administrative
   abilities, while allow- ing the chief judges who are good
   administrators sufficient time to have a beneficent effect on the
   functioning of their circuits."71 Table 2-9 and Figure 2-F display

   Chapter 3 The Ninth Circuit and Its Court of Appeals Our statute
   charges us to make recommendations about the structure of the federal
   appellate system and circuit boundaries, "with particular reference to
   the Ninth Circuit." We focus on the Ninth Circuit first, for that
   reason and because our views about the future structure of the federal
   appellate system as a whole are informed by our study of the Ninth, the
   nation's largest circuit and court of appeals. With respect to the
   Ninth Circuit, we conclude that circuit realignment is not indicated,
   but that restructuring of the court of appeals is. Circuits do not
   decide cases; they are administrative, not adjudicative, en- tities
   with responsibilities for governance that are broader than-and have
   little to do with-the court of appeals itself. There is no persuasive
   evidence that the Ninth Circuit (or any other circuit, for that matter)
   is not working effectively, or that creating new circuits will improve
   the administration of justice in any circuit or overall. Furthermore,
   splitting the circuit would impose substantial costs of administrative
   disruption, not to mention the monetary costs of cre- ating a new
   circuit. Accordingly, we do not recommend to Congress and the President
   that they consider legislation to split the circuit. Nevertheless,
   there is consensus among appellate judges throughout the country
   (including about one-third of the appellate judges in the Ninth Cir-
   cuit) that a court of appeals, being a court whose members must work
   collegially
