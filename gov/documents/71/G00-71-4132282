   James William Kilgore is wanted for his involvement in extremist
   activities in the 1970's. Kilgore was allegedly associated with the
   Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), the group responsible for the
   abduction of Patricia Hearst on February 4, 1974, in Berkeley,
   California, and the takeover robbery of the Hibernia Bank in San
   Francisco, California, on April 15, 1974.

   On September 21, 1975, an unregistered pipe bomb was found at Kilgore's
   residence in San Francisco, California. As a result, Kilgore was
   subsequently charged with the unlawful possession of an unregistered
   bomb device in a one count indictment in the Northern District of
   California on August 25, 1976.

                                   REWARD

   The FBI is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading
   directly to the arrest of James William Kilgore.
