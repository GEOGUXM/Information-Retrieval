  INTRODUCTION

   The Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives
   is the legislative drafting service of the House of Representatives.
   Our clients are the committees and Members of the House.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HISTORY OF THE OFFICE

   The Office had its origins in the Legislative Drafting Research Fund
   established at Columbia University in 1911 through the work of Joseph
   P. Chamberlain, Professor of Public Law at the University.

   In 1916, Middleton Beaman, the Law Librarian of the Library of
   Congress, was requested by the Fund to conduct a demonstration of the
   usefulness of a legislative drafting service to the Congress. The
   success of Mr. Beaman's work on various pieces of legislation resulted
   in the establishment of a Legislative Drafting Service by section 1303
   of the Revenue Act of 1918, which was enacted on February 24, 1919.

   On October 26, 1970, the President signed into law the Legislative
   Reorganization Act of 1970, title V of which set forth a separate
   charter for the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House of
   Representatives. Section 502 of the Act provides that the purpose of
   the Office is ``to advise and assist the House of Representatives, and
   its committees and Members, in the achievement of a clear, faithful,
   and coherent expression of legislative policies''.

  STRUCTURE OF THE OFFICE

   The Office consists of approximately 35 attorneys and a support staff
   of about 15 individuals, and is headed by the Legislative Counsel of
   the House. The Legislative Counsel is appointed by the Speaker of the
   House and, subject to the approval of the Speaker, appoints and fixes
   the compensation of the Office's personnel.

   The operation of the Office is in many ways unique among governmental
   offices. There are no formal committees or departments. Attorneys in
   the Office naturally develop special expertise in certain areas of the
   law. However, all attorneys are expected to cooperate with, and assist,
   each other in handling the workload of the Office. Many attorneys work
   in informal groups or teams of two or more to address a general 'zone'
   of Federal law.

   The Office is impartial as to issues of legislative policy and does not
   advocate the adoption or rejection of any proposal or policy. In
   providing services to committees and Members, the Office will assist
   the committees, Members, and their staffs in analyzing the effects of
   legislative proposals, but will not advocate any position.

   The Office has traditionally been career-oriented, with unusually low
   turnover among the legal staff. Experienced attorneys in the Office
   specialize in one or more areas of law and will normally handle
   requests for assistance in those areas.

  WORK OF THE OFFICE

   The Office provides drafting and related assistance to the Members of
   the House, the House committees, and the conference committees between
   the House and the Senate. Although the Members and committees are not
   required to use the Office, most legislation in the House is worked on
   by attorneys in the Office.

   The typical legislative proposal starts on its way because someone
   believes that there is a problem about which something can be done by
   legislation. The attorney who drafts the proposal must gain a clear
   understanding of the problem, including the factual and legal setting
   in which it arises, and the intended policy of the Member or committee.
   This process ordinarily involves consultation with Members and their
   assistants, and with committee, departmental, and other expert
   advisers. Work being performed for a committee on a bill often involves
   attendance at committee markups, at sessions of the House during floor
   consideration, and at meetings of the conference committee between the
   House and the Senate to resolve the differences between the two Houses.

   In preparing a draft for a Member or committee, it is the goal of the
   Office that the draft accurately reflect the legislative policy of the
   Member or committee and that the draft be legally sufficient to carry
   out that policy. The Office tries to meet this goal in a form and style
   consistent with good legislative drafting and strives for clarity of
   expression while addressing all necessary aspects of what are often
   highly complex policy matters.

   In rendering this drafting and other legal assistance, the attorney
   must at all times maintain an impartial attitude with respect to the
   policies which are to be incorporated in the legislative proposal.
   Thus, the attorney is concerned with the legislative policy only for
   the purpose of making sure that the bill, resolution, or amendment
   accurately reflects the policy of the Member or committee for whom it
   is being drafted.

   All communications with the Office are confidential and subject to the
   attorney-client relationship. Unless otherwise indicated by the Member
   or staff, no information concerning a request for assistance (including
   the fact that the request was made) will be disclosed outside the
   Office.

   The Office has a long history of successfully working with opposing
   sides of legislative policy issues while maintaining confidentiality
   with respect to communications with each Member. It is, for example,
   routine for an attorney in the Office who has drafted a bill for a
   committee to then draft floor amendments for individual Members on all
   sides of issues raised by the bill.

   The pace of the Office varies enormously with the schedule of Congress.
   A typical week might involve discussions on legislative proposals with
   Members and their staffs, attendance at committee consideration of a
   bill and amendments, discussions with counterparts in the Senate and
   the Executive Branch regarding legislative proposals of common
   interest, review of the Congressional Record and other legal services
   and materials regarding matters within the subject areas of the
   attorney, and the drafting of bills and amendments.
