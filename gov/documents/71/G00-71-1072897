         The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Service Unit assists the
         Department's Regions and Divisions with the collection, documentation,
         and analysis of spatial data needed to support good conservation
         decisions.

         Within the Section, the GIS Service Unit is responsible for developing
         GIS products of widespread benefit to the Department; this unit also
         provides GIS infrastructure support, such as cataloging spatial data
         and developing spatial data standards. Other members of the GIS Section
         work closely with internal clients, primarily in the Habitat
         Conservation Division, Wildlife and Inland Fisheries Division, Office
         of Spill Prevention and Response, and Marine Region.
