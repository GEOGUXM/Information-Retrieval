Synopsis

     Shortly after World War II, and before 1952, the brown tree snake
     was accidentally transported from its native range in the South
     Pacific to Guam, probably as a stowaway in ship cargo.  As a result
     of abnormally abundant prey resources on Guam and the absence of
     natural predators and other population controls, brown tree snake
     populations reached unprecedented numbers.  Snakes caused the
     extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species;
     thousands of power outages affecting private, commercial, and
     military activities; widespread loss of domestic birds and pets; and
     considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when
     snakes invaded human habitats with the potential for severe
     envenomation of small children.  Since Guam is a major
     transportation hub in the Pacific, numerous opportunities exist for
     the brown tree snakes on Guam to be introduced accidentally to other
     Pacific islands as passive stowaways in ship and air traffic from
     Guam.  Numerous sightings of this species have been reported on
     other islands, and an incipient population is probably established
     on Saipan.  It is important that people who may come in contact with
     the brown tree snake, particularly on neighboring islands and other
     high-risk sites, understand the scope of this problem and how to
     identify the snake so proper action can be taken.

     This resource has been developed to provide source materials on the
     history of the invasion, continuing threats, research results, and
     containment and management of the brown tree snake (Boiga
     irregularis) in Guam and its relevance to other islands and mild
     continental environments.
