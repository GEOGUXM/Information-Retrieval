   NOAA's Hurricane Awareness site is designed to educate the public about
   the hazards associated with hurricanes and provide information which
   can be used to help reduce risk.   This web site is an excellent
   resource for hurricane information ranging from hurricane basics to
   disaster preparedness. The information is organized into six modules:

     Intro:       Hurricane Basics
     Module 1:   Storm Surge & Marine Safety
     Module 2:   High Winds & Tornadoes
     Module 3:   Inland Flooding
     Module 4:   The Forecast Process
     Module 5:   Disaster Prevention

   The Hurricane Awareness Web Site is a cooperative effort between NOAA's
   National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
   participating states and regional hurricane authorities.
