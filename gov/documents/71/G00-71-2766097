   The SPC maintains a severe weather event database of all storm reports
   received by the National Weather Service. The database covers the years
   1950 through 1998 and contains data on tornadoes, large hail, and wind
     reports (both wind damage and wind gusts). There are separate pages
    devoted to hail, wind, and tornadoes where you can download the data.
   There is also an online archive of SPC products for the last few years
                                  as well.

   Daily severe weather archive maintained by John Hart is available from

     SeverePlot v2.0 is a graphical database of severe thunderstorm and
    tornado occurrences in the United States. The latest version contains
   data from 1950 to 1999. This software is created and maintained by John
                        Hart and is free to download.
