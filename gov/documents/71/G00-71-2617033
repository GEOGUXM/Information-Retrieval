   You too can get involved in KIST!

   The KIST Collaborative is always looking for new resources, programs,
   equipment, and people. We are specifically looking for:
     * Mentor Programs
     * Science and Math education programs (grades K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
     * Equipment Donation programs
     * Grants
     * Technical experts to assist with school computer installation and
       repair
     * Science Fair judges

   Your organization can have your resource listed in our database by
   clicking on the "Educator Resources" button at the top and entering the
   "Add A New Resource" area. You may then submit your program, equipment,
   mentors or other resource in our database. All submissions to the
   database will be screened for applicability to K-12 science and math
   education.

   KIST would like your help. We welcome new volunteers to help with the
   growth of our collaborative. There are many ways an individual or an
   organization can contribute, from serving on a Task Force team,
   providing a meeting space, funding a specific project, to a direct
   donation of time.
   We have many opportunities available, large as well as small. Please
   contact our Director at LizBrain@kist.org.
