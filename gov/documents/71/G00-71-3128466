   The primary mission of the California Complete Count Campaign  is to
   maximize the number of Californians counted in Census 2000 by
   encouraging them to fill out and mail back their census forms. Campaign
   outreach will focus particularly on communities prone to be
   undercounted according to the 1990 Census  in order to increase the
   accuracy and completeness of the count  in  the 2000 census.

   Based on 1990 undercount data, the California Complete Count Campaign
   has identified several populations for targeted outreach efforts:
     * African-Americans
     * Latinos
     * Native Americans
     * Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders
     * Children (infant-17 years)
     * Males aged 18 to 28
     * Homeless
     * Migrant and seasonal farm workers

   As part of an aggressive outreach strategy, the CCC Campaign has
   contracted with Administrative CBOs to identify and work with local
   community organizations to tap their expertise in working with specific
   targeted populations as an effective method of reaching these
   undercounted groups. The community organizations will operate
   Questionnaire Assistance Centers.

   The primary role of the community based organizations will be:
     * Outreach in hard to enumerate communities
     * Operate Questionnaire Assistance Center
     * Publicize QAC location - Get Help Here
     * Publicize Advance Letter/Notice
     * Motivate completion and Return of Census Questionnaire
     * Publicize enumeration process/non-response follow-up - Open Your
       Door

   A guiding theme of the CCC Campaign at all levels is to Educate,
   Motivate, and Involve.
