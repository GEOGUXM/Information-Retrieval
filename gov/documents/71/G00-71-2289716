   Integrated Noise Model

   The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA), Office of Environment and
   Energy (AEE-100) has developed the Integrated Noise Model (INM) for
   evaluating aircraft noise impacts in the vicinity of airports. INM has
   many analytical uses, such as assessing changes in noise impact
   resulting from new or extended runways or runway configurations,
   assessing new traffic demand and fleet mix, evaluating other
   operational procedures. The INM has been the FAA's standard tool since
   1978 for determining the predicted noise impact in the vicinity of
   airports. Statutory requirements for INM use are defined in FAA Order
   1050.1D, Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts;
   Order 5050.4A, Airport Environmental Handbook; and Federal Aviation
   Regulations (FAR) Part 150, Airport Noise Compatibility Planning.

   The Model Utilizes flight track information, aircraft fleet mix,
   standard and user defined aircraft profiles and terrain as inputs. The
   INM model produces noise exposure contours that are used for land use
   compatibility maps. The INM program includes built in tools for
   comparing contours and utilities that facilitate easy export to
   commercial Geographic Information Systems. The model also calculates
   predicted noise at specific sites such as hospitals, schools or other
   sensitive locations. For these grid points, the model reports detailed
   information for the analyst to determine which events contribute most
   significantly to the noise at that location. The model supports 16
   predefined noise metrics that include cumulative sound exposure,
   maximum sound level and time above metrics from both the A-Weighted,
   C-Weighted and the Effective Perceived noise level families. The user
   may also create the Australian version of the Noise Exposure Forecast
   (NEF).

   The INM aircraft profile and noise calculation algorithms are based on
   several guidance documents published by the Society of Automotive
   Engineers (SAE). These include the SAE-AIR-1845 report titled
   "Procedure for the Calculation of Airplane Noise in the Vicinity of
   Airports" as well as others which address atmospheric absorption and
   noise attenuation. The INM is an average-value-model and is designed to
   estimate long-term average effects using average annual input
   conditions. Because of this, differences between predicated and
   measured values can occur because certain local acoustical variable are
   not averaged, or because they may not be explicitly modeled in INM.
   Examples of detailed local acoustical variables include temperature
   profiles, wind gradients, humidity effects, ground absorption,
   individual aircraft directivity patterns and sound diffraction terrain,
   buildings, barriers, etc. Difference may also occur due to errors or
   improper procedures employed during the collection of the measured
   data.
