   Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program

        The Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program is a voluntary program for
   people who want to develop and improve wildlife habitat primarily on
   private lands. It provides both technical assistance and cost share
   payments to help establish and improve fish and wildlife habitat.
       Participants who own or control land agree to prepare and implement
   a wildlife habitat development plan . The Natural Resources
   Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical and financial assistance
   for the establishment of wildlife habitat development practices. In
   addition, if the landowner agrees, cooperating State wildlife agencies
   and nonprofit or private organizations may provide expertise or
   additional funding to help complete a project.
       Participants work with NRCS to prepare a wildlife habitat
   development plan in cooperation with the local conservation district.
   The plan describes the participant’s goals for improving wildlife
   habitat, includes a list of practices and a schedule for installing
   them, and details the steps necessary to maintain the habitat for the
   life of the agreement. This plan may or may not be part of a larger
   conservation plan that addresses other resource needs such as water
   quality and soil erosion.
       NRCS and the participant enter into a cost-share agreement for
   wildlife habitat development. This agreement generally lasts from 5 to
   10 years from the date the agreement is signed.
       Cost-share payments may be used to establish new practices or
   replace practices that fail for reasons beyond the participant’s
   control.

       All lands are eligible for WHIP, except for:
       q Federal lands;
       q land currently enrolled in Waterbank, Conservation Reserve
   Program, Wetlands Reserve Program or other similar programs;
       q lands where the expected impacts from on-site or off-site
   conditions make the success of habitat improvement unlikely.

       WHIP is currently budgeted for $50 million through the year 2002.
       WHIP funds are distributed to states based on state wildlife
   habitat priorities which may include: wildlife habitat areas; targeted
   species and their habitats; and specific practices.
       WHIP may be implemented in cooperation with other Federal, State,
   or local agencies, conservation districts, or private conservation
   groups. State priorities are developed through a locally led process to
   identify wildlife resource needs and finalized in consultation with the
   State Technical Committee.
       For more information about WHIP, contact your local USDA Service
   Center, the Cooperative Extension Service, or your local conservation
   district.
