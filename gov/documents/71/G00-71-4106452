                         2001 Recommendations of the
                     United States Public Health Service
                        Food and Drug Administration

           HHS logo: Department of Health and Human Services, USA

   The Food Code is a model for safeguarding public health and ensuring
   food is unadulterated and honestly presented when offered to the
   consumer. It represents FDA's best advice for a uniform system of
   provisions that address the safety and protection of food offered at
   retail and in food service.

   This model is offered for adoption by local, state, and federal
   governmental jurisdictions for administration by the various
   departments, agencies, bureaus, divisions, and other units within each
   jurisdiction that have been delegated compliance responsibilities for
   food service, retail food stores, or food vending operations.
   Alternatives that offer an equivalent level of public health protection
   to ensure that food at retail and foodservice is safe are recognized in
   this model.

   This guidance represents FDA's current thinking on safeguarding public
   health and ensuring food is unadulterated and honestly presented when
   offered to the consumer. It does not create or confer any rights for or
   on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. This
   guidance is being issued in accordance with FDA's Good Guidance
   Practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115; 65 FR 56468; September 19, 2000).
