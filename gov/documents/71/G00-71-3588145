                  LASER GUIDE STAR ADAPTIVE OPTICS PROGRAM

   The focus of the Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics Program at Lawrence
   Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is the development of integrated
   adaptive optics (AO) and sodium-layer laser guide star (LGS) systems
   for use on large astronomical telescopes. LLNL has pioneered the use of
   pulsed dye laser technology for the production sodium-layer laser guide
   star systems. This technology was developed by the LLNL Atomic Vapor
   Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) Program.

   The first project performed under the LLNL LGS AO program was a
   sodium-layer laser guide star feasibility demonstration at LLNL. The
   highlight of this project was the propagation of 1100 watts of laser
   power, from the world's highest-average-power optical laser, into the
   sky to form a sodium-layer laser guide star visible from the ground
   with the naked eye.

   Current projects include the commissioning of a laser guide star
   adaptive optics system for the 3 meter Shane Telescope at Lick
   Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California and the development of a laser
   guide star adaptive optics system for the 10 meter Keck II Telescope on
   Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
