                  Equal Employment Opportunity Information

               Pam Herd, Equal Employment Opportunity Manager
                                916-262-2417

   The CYA is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) for all. The
   CYA is also committed to taking immediate and appropriate action on any
   EEO issues. This is especially important in those situations where the
   safety of the public, CYA staff, or youthful offenders may be involved.
   Therefore, the CYA has provided a method for persons to electronically
   submit a Discrimination Complaint. This will enable CYA EEO staff to
   receive prompt notice of discrimination complaints and begin addressing
   the matter. You may access the On-line version discrimination complaint
   form here. In accordance with all state and federal laws, we have
   enacted EEO policies to provide equal employment opportunity in every
   aspect of personnel policy and practices in employment, development,
   advancement and treatment of employees, volunteers and members of the
   public.

   The CYA EEO Program places the highest priority on staff safety. It
   must be recognized that employee safety is compromised when staff
   engage in, or witness inappropriate behavior, including those
   behaviors, which may violate EEO policies. When employees witness such
   behavior, they are distracted from their obligation to follow all
   safety procedures. They are also distracted from our primary program
   duties of education, training, and treatment of youthful offenders.
   However, employees will be resistant to EEO policies if their only
   experience with EEO is in corrective or disciplinary actions.
   Therefore, the CYA EEO program is implemented in a positive, supportive
   and proactive manner. For example, the EEO policies and training
   emphasize:
    1. the important support which EEO policies provide to the safety of
       staff, and
    2. that inappropriate behaviors adversely affect our commitment to the
       education, training, and treatment of youthful offenders.

   Therefore, our best course of action is prevention of behaviors, which
   violate EEO policies.

   Please review the CYA EEO resources. We have made them available to you
   through the links that follow. We welcome your comments on how we can
   improve our webpage and EEO Program. Please contact me with your
   comments. I can be reached via email at pherd@cya.ca.gov.
