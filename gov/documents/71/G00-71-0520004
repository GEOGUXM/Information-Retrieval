   Plasma Sources for Window Coatings

   [LinearDiagonal72.jpg]

   Deposition processes for low-emittance and solar control coatings can
   be improved through the use of advanced plasma technology developed at
   LBNL. A new type of constricted glow-discharge plasma source was
   selected for the 1997 R&D 100 Award. Invented by LBNL researchers Andre
   Anders, Mike Rubin, and Mike Dickinson, the source was designed to be
   compatible with industrial vacuum deposition equipment and practice.
   Construction is simple, rugged and inexpensive. It can operate
   indefinitely over a wide range of chamber pressure without any
   consumable parts such as filaments or grids. Several different gases
   including Argon, Oxygen and Nitrogen have been tested successfully.

   Among the potential uses of the source are densification of coatings
   for greater durability, crystallization at low temperatures for
   increased reflectivity or electrical conductivity, enhancement of
   reactivity to produce an otherwise unstable phase or increase
   deposition rate, and control over composition. Several of these sources
   have been fabricated for specific uses by glazing manufacturers. LBNL
   will assist these manufacturers to optimize the source characteristics
   and to develop new coating types. Recently, a linear configuration was
   successfully tested. Consisting of an array of miniaturized versions of
   the original source this linear source is extendible to a deposition
   system of any width.
