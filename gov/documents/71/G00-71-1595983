   ABSTRACT This Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reprint is a
   reduction of a poster presentation from the Cosmology Display Session
   #85 on 9 January 1998 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in
   Washington D.C. It is also available on the World Wide Web at
   http://www-supernova.LBL.gov/ This work has also been referenced in the
   literature by the pre-meeting abstract citation: Perlmutter et al.,
   B.A.A.S., volume 29, page 1351 (1997). This presentation reports on
   first evidence for a low-mass-density/positive-cosmologicalconstant
   universe that will expand forever, based on observations of a set of 40
   high-redshift supernovae. The experimental strategy, data sets, and
   analysis techniques are described. More extensive analyses of these
   results with some additional methods and data are presented in the more
   recent LBNL report #41801 (Perlmutter et al., 1998; Ap.J., in press),
   astro-ph/9812133. - 2 - Perlmutter, et al., in Thermonuclear

   Lab Keck WIYN Cerro Tololo Isaac Newton Hubble Strategy We developed a
   strategy to guarantee a group of supernova discoveries on a certain
   date. Just after a new moon, we observe some 50 to 100 high-galactic
   lattitute fields--each containing almost a thousand high-redshift
   galaxies--in two nights on the Cerro Tololo 4-meter telescope with
   Tyson & Bernstein's wide-field camera. We return three weeks later to
   observe the same fields, and then examine the images of all of the tens
   of thousands of galaxies. On average, some two dozen Type Ia supernovae
   will thus be discovered just before new moon--and while still
   brightening, since the three week time baseline is less than the rise
   time of a Type Ia supernova. We follow the supernovae, with
   spectroscopy at maximum light at the Keck telescope, and with
   photometry over the following two months at the CTIO, WIYN, INT, and
   (particularly for the highest redshifts) the Hubble Space Telescope. fl

   (corresponding approximately to the restframe B and V bands for the
   median redshift). At high redshifts, a significant fraction of this
   host galaxy light is within the seeing disk of the supernova, so final
   observations about one year later are usually necessary to observe (and
   subtract) the host galaxy light after the supernova has faded. The

   about half of the 40 supernovae that have been completely observed and

   PROJECTflfl As a Type Ia supernova brightens and fades, its spectrum
   changes, showing on each day which elements in the expanding atmosphere
   are passing through the photosphere. This provides a rather tight
   constraint on the high-redshift supernova spectra: they must show all
   of the same features on the same day of the explosion as nearby Type Ia
   supernovae, or else we have evidence that the Type Ia supernovae have
   evolved over the 4-to-7 billion years that we are studying So far, we
   have seen no indications of evolution, even as far back in time as the
   highest redshift Type Ia supernova spectrum, shown on the right plot
   above in its place in the time sequence of "nearby" Type Ia supernova
   spectra. Note that the spectra are almost all observed with the Keck
   10-m Telescope, a necessity for these very faintest supernovae. - 5 -

   high redshift Type Ia supernovae so far. Of these, approximately 50
   have been followed with spectroscopy and photometry over two months of
   the light curve. The redshifts shown in this histogram are color coded
   to show the increasing depth of the search with each new "batch" of
   supernova discoveries. The most recent supernovae, discovered the last
   week of 1997, are now being followed over their lightcurves with
   ground-based and (for those labeled "HST") with the Hubble Space
   Telescope. Type Ia supernovae observed "nearby" show a relationship
   between their peak absolute luminosity and the timescale of their light
   curve: the brighter supernovae are slower and the fainter supernovae
   are faster (see Phillips, Ap.J.Lett., 1993 and Riess, Press, &
   Kirshner, Ap.J.Lett., 1995). We have found that a simple linear
   relation between the absolute magnitude and a "stretch factor"
   multiplying the lightcurve timescale fits the data quite well until
   over 45 restframe days past peak. The lower plot shows the "nearby"
   supernovae from the upper plot, after fitting and removing the stretch
   factor, and "correcting" peak magnitude with this simple calibration
   relation. Ma r. 1 997 SN e Dec. 1997 SNe Jan . 19 97 SN e Firs t 7 SN e

   are analyzed in the following three steps: F irst, the final image of
   the host galaxy alone is subtracted from the many images of each supe
   rnova spanning its lightcurve. The resulting R- and I-band photometry
   points are then fit to K-corrected (see Kim, Goobar, & Perlmutter,
   P.A.S.P. 1996) and (1+ z)-time-dilated B- and V-band template SN Ia
   lightcurves. This fit yields the apparent magnitude at peak and the
   best fit "stretch factor" that indicates the timescale (and hence the
   intrinsic luminosity) of each super nova. Finally, all of the supernova
   magnitudes--corrected for the stretch-luminosity relation--are plotted
   on the Hubble diagram as a function of their host galaxy redshift (when
   available, or supernova redshift, when not). The magnitudes vs.
   redshifts can then be fit to various alte rnative cosmologies. We fit
   the two "favorite" one-dimensional cases, the flat ( \Omega M + \Omega
   \Lambda = 1) universe, and the \Lambda = 0 universe, as well as solving
   for a confidence region in the \Omega M-vs-\Omega \Lambda plane. - 7 -

   Results: \Omega vs \Lambda flfrom 40 supernovaefl flfl fl These two
   plots show the best-fit confidence regions on the \Omega M-vs-\Omega
   \Lambda plane for the 6-supernova fit presented in the Nature (1998)
   paper and for a more extensive 40-supernova fit (preliminary analysis).
   The left plot demonstrates that with a range of redshifts from 0.4 to
   0.85, the approximately straight slope of the confidence region at a
   given redshift begins to rotate, allowing an intersection region (shown
   in green) to isolate measurements of \Omega M and \Omega \Lambda
   separately, not just in linear combination (see Goobar & Perlmutter,
   Ap.J. 1995). With the larger sample of supernovae shown on the right
   plot, the statistical uncertainty is now small enough--and the
   confidence regions narrow enough--that the systematic uncertainty is
   the dominant source of error. The dashed-line confidence region on the
   right plot shows our preliminary estimate of this systematic
   uncertainty (shown in the direction of 0.2 lower apparent magnitudes
   for the high redshift supernovae). Further analysis should reduce this
   uncertainty. The best-fit confidence region (in green on the right
   plot) is centered at \Omega M = 0.5, \Omega \Lambda = 1.0. This
   confidence region lies along the line of \Omega \Lambda = \Omega M +
   0.5, which is not parallel to the lines of constant deceleration q0 =
   \Omega M/2 - \Omega \Lambda . Note that the confidence regions do not
   include the "standard model" inflationary universe with no cosmological
   constant (shown as a green circle at the intersection of the
   flat-universe line and the \Lambda = 0 line). The confidence regions do
   suggest that we live in a universe that will expand forever.fl fl

   for a variety of possible systematic errors, including Malmquist bias
   and host-galaxy extinction (see Perlmutter et al, Ap.J. 1997 for a more
   extensive list and a discussion of techniques for cross-checking). By
   separating our supernovae into subsamples according to different
   parameters, we can test to see if that parameter is biasing our
   measurement. For example, to test for Malmquist bias, we plot the
   distribution of measurements of \Omega M for the intrinsically brighter
   supernovae in our sample--those with broader stretched lightcurves--and
   compare it to the distribution found for the intrinsically fainter
   supernovae in our sample--those with narrow lightcurves. The two
   distributions are not significantly shifted from each other, indicating
   that Malmquist bias is not a statistically significant error for this
   sample. (We assign a 0.15 systematic error as a conservative upper
   bound on any shift between the means of these distributions.)
   Similarly, there is no statistically significant shift between the
   redder and bluer supernovae in our sample, and we assign a 0.2
   systematic error as an upper bound for extinction bias. Note that the
   very reddest of supernovae of our sample do show evidence of
   extinction, as they fall on the faint (low \Omega M side of the
   distribution), and are excluded in this study. Preliminary Analysis 0 5
