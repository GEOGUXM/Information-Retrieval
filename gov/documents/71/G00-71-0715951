   Field The revolutionary ScarletTM arrays employ a patented refractive
   Fresnel lens system, which concentrates sunlight onto the solar cells.
   Because of this, less solar cell area is required, providing tremendous
   weight and cost savings. Additionally, using fewer and smaller cells
   allowed the cost-effective implementation of high efficiency
   multi-junction GaInP2/GaAs/Ge photovoltaic cells aboard DS1. The DS1
   mission is part of The New Millennium Program, NASA's most aggressive
   technology demonstration program. According to Ray Garza, ABLE's DS1
   ScarletTM Program Manager, "This high technology mission challenged us
   to build the most advanced solar array in the world." Such strides were
   made with this new technology that ABLE was recognized in 1999 with a
   NASA Group Achievement Award and by the University of New Mexico's
   Institute for Space and Nuclear Power with their Schreiber-Spence
   Achievement Award. The performance of the ScarletTM arrays on DS1
   validated all aspects of the novel structural platform, optics, and
   electrical design as well as the analytical models used to characterize
   the array. The ScarletTM technology proven on DS1 will continue to be
   refined to benefit future science mission as well as commercial
