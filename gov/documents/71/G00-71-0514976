   A critically important region of the astrophysical spectrum is the hard
     X-ray band (~ 5-600 keV), which connects the predominantly thermal
    (x-ray) and non-thermal (gamma-ray) universe. The proposed Energetic
   X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) mission, which was approved for
     study in the 1994 NASA solicitation for New Mission Concepts, would
     conduct the first highsensitivity all-sky imaging survey (5-600keV)
              with a wide-field coded aperture telescope array.
    EXIST has been studied for a range of mission implementations, from a
    free-flyer Explorer class (EXIST-MIDEX) through a balloon-borne ULDB
    prototype survey (EXIST-LITE). However the increased sensitivity and
   coverage needed for a deep hard x-ray (HX) survey mission to follow on
   the possible deep medium energy (2-10 keV) survey from ABRIXAS and the
       limited hard x-ray survey from Swift demand a very large area,
   wide-field mission concept. EXIST was recommended by the 2000 Report of
    the Decadal Survey to carry out the high priority science for both a
   Hard X-ray Survey and a Next Generation Gamma Ray Burst mission. EXIST
     could best be implemented as a Free Flyer mission, though a backup
   implementation on the International Space Station is also possible, as
   originally recommended by the 1999 Report of the NASA Gamma-ray Program
                               Working Group.
