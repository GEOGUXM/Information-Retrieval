   Sandia "Detective" Solves Strange Case

   Sandia National Laboratories scientist's finding of a key detail leads to new
   interpretation of water-solid interactionsreported in the January 4, 2002,
   issue of Science.


   Molecules

      January 14 2002It was a small problem: a layer of water lying flat
      instead of slightly bumpy as it froze on a solid.

      It became a larger problem when no one could explain why that might
      happen.

      The slight difference between experimental results and established
      expectations might have meant nothing. But possibly it was signaling a
      basic scientific misunderstanding concerning the interaction of water
      with solidsan area of major industrial and scientific concern.

   Molecular Structure of Cancer-Related Proteins Identified

   Research published in the December 20, 2001, issue of Nature describes the
   molecular structure of two cancer-related proteins binding to one another.


   c-protein

      January 7, 2002Scientists have identified the biochemical and
      signaling properties of two cancer-related proteins using a process
      called X-ray crystallography. The technique yielded the first-ever
      detailed pictures of the proteins interacting with each other,
      indicating which areas are most essential for the development of
      cancer.

      The X-ray crystallography of the proteins was conducted at the National
      Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Department of Energy's
      Brookhaven National Laboratory and at the Cornell University High
      Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The light sources generate powerful
      X-rays, key to capturing the first detailed images of the proteins.

   New Magnetic Refrigerator

   An Ames Laboratory researcher has discovered a new class of magnetic
   refrigeration materials that could revolutionize air conditioning and
   refrigeration.


                                                         Karl Gschneider
   Karl Gschneider pushes the boundaries of new refrigeration technology.

      January 7, 2002Using materials developed at the U.S. Department of
      Energy's Ames Laboratory, researchers have successfully demonstrated
      the world's first room temperature, permanent-magnet, magnetic
      refrigerator. The refrigerator was developed by Milwaukee-based
      Astronautics Corporation of America as part of a cooperative research
      and development agreement with Ames Laboratory.

      Instead of ozone-depleting refrigerants and energy-consuming
      compressors found in conventional vapor-cycle refrigerators, this new
      style of refrigerator uses gadolinium metal that heats up when exposed
      to a magnetic field, then cools down when the magnetic field is
      removed.
