                           U.S.Â– China Commission

Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert Byrd, West Virginia
U.S.-China Commission's Organizational Meeting
Room 128 of the U.S. Capitol
April 24, 2001

   SENATOR BYRD: Gentlemen, if you will forgive me. I want to use the
   lectern. I hope you won't misunderstand, but from my standpoint it's
   better for me to be standing.
   I subscribe one thousand percent to what Senator Sarbanes has said. I'm
   pleased to welcome the Members of the Commission. When we first met you
   had a special responsibility and unique opportunity to provide fresh
   eyes and independent judgment on the volatile emerging relationship
   between the United States and China.
   The relationship that we're developing with China is surely the most
   delicate, bilateral relationship for our country in the foreseeable
   future. This arises from at least two widely recognized phenomena.
   First, America's primary center of strategic interest is shifting away
   from Europe and the North Pacific. Second, China has enormous untapped
   economic resources. Consequently, while mutual perceptions and policies
   are evolving, we face a complex amalgam of opportunity and danger.
   This Commission has a difficult job because of a host of unknowns in
   both the economic and security spheres that need serious investigation.
   The guiding principle from each Member of this Commission must be to
   discern what is in the best long-term national security interest of the
   United States. Your conclusions will be invaluable and will help to
   guide debates and influence legislation in the Congress.
   The mandate that you've been given in the legislation that created the
   Commission was intentionally broad in both the economic and securities
   sphere. Little of vital importance has been vetted off the table. The
   enabling statute and I think we all should read it again and I want to
   touch upon it just for a moment. The enabling statute provides you the
   time and the resources to explore all productive avenues and broad
   spheres of inquiry. There are many unknowns such as the full range of
   transactions that link the Chinese and American economies and the
   extent to which such transactions help maintain the vitality of the
   Chinese leadership. The USSC enabling legislation requires that the
   Commission's report include a full discussion of the PRC's acquisition
   of dual use and military high technology from the United States. The
   PRC is concentrating from technology acquisition from the United States
   and the West in lieu of Chinese research and development as a means of
   accelerating its military build up.
   Obviously, much time can be saved by leap frogging the R & D process if
   the work that the United States has already performed at great cost to
   the taxpayers, does not have to be duplicated by and for the PRC
   military. Equally important is China's acquisition of older and cheaper
   technologies that can circumvent our military systems precisely because
   they are so primitive.
   Besides the direct acquisition of technology by contract or use of
   technology offset requirements as the cost of doing business in China,
   the PRC is utilizing the Peoples Liberation Army and the Defense
   Ministry-owned front companies operating in the United States to
   procure advanced dual use and military technology and high tech items
   such as high performance computers and navigation and communication
   equipment for the Chinese military.
   Some sources estimate that there are as many as 3,000 PRC front
   companies in the United States. They typically have non-Chinese
   American-sounding names and some even have stock traded on our stock
   exchanges. Similarly, in our tech markets which the Chinese are fully
   utilizing to borrow tens of billions of dollars for military purposes,
   U.S. investors may also be unknowingly helping to accelerate the
   Chinese military build up.
   On the trade side there are other issues, but we as a nation have not
   really formulated a coherent approach to Chinese trade and balances. We
   must recognize that the Chinese leadership refuses in many instances to
   play the trade game according to the understandings that have long
   formed the basis of America's bilateral relationships.
   The Commission, which preceded you, did some preliminary work on these
   issues and I encourage you to review their work. It is clear that the
   Chinese regime is testing the mettle of this Administration on the
   security side and here, we as a nation, face real danger because there
   is the possibility that the Chinese have miscalculated our resolve to
   protect our interests and our commitments, particularly toward Taiwan
   and your organization can help to ensure that such miscalculations can
   be avoided or minimized.
   The Chinese has written openly about new forms of warfare such as
   cyber-warfare that they feel could offset America's military and
   strategic advantage and traditional military forces. This is another
   example of refusing to play ball in the customary manner. I expect that
   you will examine China's intentions and programs in this area. The
   incident with our EP-3 reconnaissance plane was unfortunate, but it has
   had the salutary benefit of broadening the view that the Chinese-U.S.
   relationship must be approached as a coherent whole. We cannot
   compartmentalize the relationship and the economic factors on one side,
   unconnected and unaffected by our military and strategic relationship
   on the other. Chinese perceptions and intentions on security matters
   and the overall military balance are certainly affected by the range
   and type of our economic connection.
   Indeed, the mandate of the Commission arose from the need to develop
   such an integrated assessment that has been likened in U.S.-PRC
   contacts for too long. There is obviously a very broad range of topics
   that you can find to investigate. For your initial effort, your initial
   report, you will have to choose the most important aspects of your
   mandate. You would serve our country well and you would serve the
   Senate well if you could first determine the magnitude of the economic
   resources China has accumulated through trade and investment flows and
   to what extent they are being used to fuel a growing military
   establishment.
   Secondly, there's a need to know what military useful technologies the
   Chinese are acquiring and why and finally, we must try to deduce
   China's apparent intentions and behaviors from their leaders' stated
   remarks. You certainly have support for your on-going efforts. I look
   forward to conferring with you from time to time. The Commission's
   first required report is due next March and I expect that it will be
   the first of many regular exigencies about the nature and the dangers
   and the opportunities of this relationship. You are charged with
   providing an overall assessment of the state of our bilateral security
   relationship, which necessarily includes economic and military
   variables.
   In the interim period, however, if events of the same important nature
   arise and compel you to provide advice or recommendations on a specific
   matter, I would encourage you to do so even in an open or confidential
   manner.
   China's military officials have openly stated that war with U.S. early
   in this century is to be expected. We should take these statements
   seriously. I urge the Commission to fully investigate it from all
   aspects of PRC's security-related activities in strict compliance with
   the mandates set forth in USCC administration. It is in our national
   security interest to do so.
   If you'll forgive me, but having lived a long time, longer than any of
   you, I feel it important, I feel it important to emphasize what we say
   in this legislation. We have a lot to do with what's in there. And so
   if you'll forgive me, you've read this time and time again, perhaps
   more times than I have by far, but let's think about it together. The
   purposes, the purposes of this are to establish the U.S.-China Security
   Commission to review the national security implications of trade and
   economic ties between the United States and the Peoples Republic of
   China.
   I voted against the legislation, the trade legislation for many
   reasons. It was my feeling that if we're going to have it, we ought to
   have a way of monitoring an assessment what we're trading with China,
   what effect, what impact it is having on our national security
   certainly in the long run. And this wasn't easy to sell, you know. We
   had some people who were against it, at least in the beginning. But it
   was the right thing to do. It was in the interest of the United States.
   You can hardly argue with that.
   Dropping down the page, the purpose of the Commission is to monitor and
   investigate and report to Congress on the national security
   implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationships between
   the United States and the Peoples Republic of China. Let me say that
   again. Report to Congress on the national security implications of the
   bilateral trade and economic relationships.
   Now skipping over in the legislation -- I'm on page 3 now and I'm going
   to page 4, I'm passing that. I'm going to page 5, go to page next.
   Contents of the report. Each report under paragraph 1 shall include at
   a minimum a full discussion of the following: (a) the portion of trade
   of goods and services with the United States and Peoples Republic of
   China dedicated to military systems or systems of the dual nature that
   could be used for military purposes.
   (b) The acquisition by the Peoples Republic of China of advanced
   military or dual use technologies from the United States by trade to
   include, procure and other technology transfers, especially those
   transfers, if any, that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of
   mass destruction or the delivery systems or that undermine
   international agreements of United States laws with respect to
   nonproliferation. These are pretty heavy assignments. (c) Any transfers
   as those identified under subparagraph (b) to the military assessment
   of the Peoples Republic of China made by U.S. firms and U.S.-based
   multinational corporations.
   (d) An analysis of the statements and writings of the Peoples Republic
   of China officials and officially sanctioned writings that bear on the
   intentions of any of the government of the Peoples Republic of China
   regarding the pursuit of military competition with and leverage over
   all or incorporated with United States or our allies.
   (e) The military actions taken by the government of the Peoples
   Republic during the preceding year that bears on national security of
   the United States and the reasonable stability of the Asian allies to
   the Union.
   (f) The effects, if any, on the national security interest of the
   United States of the use by the Peoples Republic of China of financial
   transactions and capital flow and currency manipulations.
   (g) Any action taken by the government of the Peoples Republic of China
   in the context of the World Trade Organizations that is adverse or
   favorable to the United States national security interest.
   (h) Patterns of trade and investment between the Peoples Republic of
   China and its major trading partners other than the U.S. that appear to
   be substantively different from trade and investment patterns with the
   U.S. and whether the differences have national security implications
   for the U.S.
   (i) The extent to which the trade surplus in the Peoples Republic of
   China with the U.S. enhances the military budget of the Peoples
   Republic of China.
   (j) And finally, an overall assessment of the state of the security
   challenges presented by the Peoples Republic of China to the U.S. and
   whether the security challenges are increasing or decreasing from
   previous years.
   Now this is a big order. This is a tough assignment that you have. And
   to undermine the importance that Senator Sarbanes and others who have
   signed this authorization of appropriation, in general, it is
   authorized to be appropriated a Commission for the year 2001 and for
   each fiscal year thereafter a set sum as may be necessary to enable the
   Commission to carry out its function under this section. That's a
   pretty impressive underwriting of the work you have before you. Amounts
   appropriated to the Commission shall remain available until expended.
   As an appropriations Committee Member, I fully subscribe to this and
   support. I don't know of anything more important for the future of our
   country.
   I'm not against trade. I'm not against trade. But I'm been in the
   Congress now for 49 years and as long as Strom Thurmond has been here.
   (Laughter.)
   But I haven't seen an Administration yet, Democratic or Republican,
   that I felt viewed trade negotiations with others in the State
   Department complex. We would always come out on the short end. Go to
   West Virginia. Talk to those people down there. Steel is heading out
   the door now. We used to have 14,000 workers in steel. Now we have
   about 400. The same thing can be said about pottery, leather goods,
   shoes and on and on and on. We used to have 125,000 coal miners in West
   Virginia when I first started out in politics. Today we have 18,000 or
   19,000 and with machines they're getting as much coal as 125,000 could.
   But I still would like to say this. Trade is important, but this is a
   different problem here than we've had before. We're talking about a
   country that already has a magnitude in size and population beyond the
   comprehension of the average person, a country that's growing and a
   country that has an agenda, leaders that have an agenda and they're
   still communist leaders and you can bet your boots that they'll be
   working when you're sleeping and I'm sleeping. They'll be working to
   get ahead. And so that's why I thought we ought to have a Commission. I
   thought it was important that if we open the trade doors with China,
   let's see -- we have to be sure that our own manufacturing goods, our
   own money is not going to be used to enhance their national security. I
   wish you success in your endeavors. If you'll excuse me, I've got to
   go. I appreciate it.
   (Applause.)
   Thank you, gentlemen. You certainly have my support. Ladies.
   COMMISSIONER DREYER: We'll try to be worthy of it.
   SENATOR BYRD: I'm sure you will and I'll say a closing word about Dick
   D'Amato. He was on my staff for many years. He was my specialist in
   arms relations, China affairs, national defense and national security
   and these important subjects. I've been in many parts of the world with
   him. He has a fine mind, highly dedicated. He's smart and I have great
   confidence that he and you will be justified in the confidence that
   Congress has invested in him.
