   The Washington Rules of Court found on the Washington State Court's
   Internet site are current as of December 2001. Local Court rules,
   maintained online by the Washington State Courts, were updated in
   September 2001.

   NOTE: Some of the local courts maintain their court rules on their own
   website. While links are provided to these local sites, the Washington
   State Courts website does not have the responsibility for updating
   these local court links and therefore, does not know if these sites are
   kept current. Questions about rule accuracy or whether the rules are
   current should be directed to the local court. Contact information for
   the local courts can be found in the Court Directory.

   The Washington Reports Official Advance Sheets should be examined to
   determine if any later adoptions, amendments, or rescissions have been
   made to the rules of court. For local court rules, contact the local
   court.

   Neither the State of Washington nor any of its agencies and officials
   (1) makes any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or
   completeness of this Internet site containing the Washington rules of
   court or any local court rules and (2) shall be held liable for any
   loss or damage whatsoever resulting from any use made of the Washington
   rules of court or local court rules.
