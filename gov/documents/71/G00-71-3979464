   Advanced Nuclear
   Technology
   (NIS-6)

      Larry Ussery
      Group Leader

      Nancy J. Nicholas
      Deputy Group Leader

      The Advanced Nuclear Technology group (NIS-6) uses a large array of
      radioactive nuclear materials to undertake projects in nuclear
      criticality research and training and to develop and validate nuclear
      radiation detection equipment. These primary endeavors, in turn,
      support basic research in nuclear chain-reacting systems along with
      programs in arms control and treaty verification, waste assay,
      safeguards and accountability, and environmental restoration. NIS-6's
      inventory of active nuclear materials ranges from small alpha-, beta-,
      gamma-, and neutron-emitting sources for use in radiation detector
      development and calibration to larger quantities of special nuclear
      materials, such as plutonium and uranium, which are used in criticality
      experiments.
