   corrective measures needed to avoid the harmful impact of those
   activities.

   SETTLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION: WDNR conducted a survey to accurately define
   the boundaries of the restoration project parcels. The Trustees will

   SETTLEMENT ELEMENTS: The settlement recognized the work done by Simpson
   and Champion in creating new intertidal habitat in connection with the
   remediation of a 17-acre area of the St. Paul Waterway. The area had
   been contaminated by past releases of hazardous substances from the
   Tacoma Kraft Mill. In addition, the companies agreed to provide:

     $500,000 for an additional habitat restoration project (to be
       developed in cooperation with the Trustees)
     $100,000 for future costs in conducting a Bay-wide natural resource
       damage assessment

   make aquatic lands with a value of up to $200,000 available to be used
   for habitat restoration projects

   The Trustees used the future damage assessment funds to initiate the
   Commencement Bay-wide natural resource damage assessment process, and
   to complete the assessment of the companies' Bay-wide natural resource
   damage liabilities that led to the subsequent Bay-wide settlement with
   the companies (see below).
