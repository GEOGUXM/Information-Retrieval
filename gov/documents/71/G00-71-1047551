About SRUs

   NERSC uses SRUs to help manage HPSS storage. The goal is to provide a
   balanced computing environment with appropriate amounts of storage and
   adequate bandwidth to keep the compute engines fed with data.
   Performance and usage tracking allows NERSC to anticipate demand and
   maintain a responsive storage environment. Storage management also
   recognizes storage as a distinct resource, in support of an increasing
   amount of data intensive computing. Finally, storage management and the
   quota system are intended to encourage efficient usage by the user
   community.

Calculating SRUs

   Three measures of use are included in computing Storage Resource Units
   (SRUs):
    1. the the number of files stored (files)
    2. GB of space used in the archive (space)
    3. GB of I/O transferred (I/O).

   SRUs are monitored on a monthly basis. The formula used to compute the
   number of SRUs each month is:

     SRUs = 0.0012 x files + 0.4 x space (GB) + 4.0 x I/O (GB)

   Yearly usage is the sum of monthly usage.

SRU Allocations

   The allocation process for storage quotas is very similar to the
   allocation process for CPU time: in every fiscal year DOE's Office of
   Science provides NERSC with storage allocations for each project funded
   through the ERCAP process. In addition to a storage allocation, each
   project may also have an associated MPP repository and/or an associated
   PVP repository.

SRU management and tracking

   Monitoring SRU usage is available only through this web interface.

   Each month a SRU charge is calculated for each user using the formula
   given above. The SRUs used by each user in a repo are subtracted from
   that repo's allocation.

   If a single username belongs to more than one repo, that user's monthly
   SRU charge is apportioned among the repos. Each user can assign a
   percentage of his or her SRU usage to each of his or her repos. To do
   so, first enter a username in the "Usage for username" box above and
   click "Get User Info." Changes apply only to future SRU calculations.
   At the start of every fiscal year default percentages are assigned
   based on the size of each repo's storage allocation.

   If a user exhausts his or her quota, s/he receives an email to that
   effect. After two monthly email warnings the user's access to HPSS may
   be turned off. NERSC reviews repos that are over their yearly SRU
   allocation and handles them on a case-by-case basis.

   If a user belongs to multiple repos, and one or more of the repos has
   exhausted its SRU quota, the user's SRUs will be charged against the
   remaining repositories.

   Each user has access to 100% of the SRUs allocated to each of his or
   her repositories.
