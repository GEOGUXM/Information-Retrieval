                          Exports and Reexports to
                   Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan Under the
              Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act
     __________________________________________________________________

    Summary: On July 12, 2001, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
    and the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
     (OFAC) published regulations implementing certain provisions of the
      Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancements Act of 2000 (TSRA)
    (Title IX of Public Law 106-387). The regulations went into effect on
    July 26, 2001 and both agencies have instituted procedures that will
    allow U.S. exporters and reexporters in other countries to engage in
     certain transactions that are subject to TSRA. BXA implemented the
       requirements of TSRA for exports and reexports of agricultural
       commodities to Cuba. BXA created License Exception Agricultural
   Commodities (AGR) to permit such exports and reexports to Cuba. Exports
   and reexports of medicines and medical devices to Cuba are not eligible
       for AGR, but are eligible for existing BXA license application
       procedures. OFAC regulates exports of agricultural commodities,
          medicines, and medical devices to Iran, Libya, and Sudan.

              License Exception Agricultural Commodities (AGR):

   The Bureau has created a new License Exception Agricultural Commodities
   (AGR) in section 740.18 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
                                      .

     License Exception AGR authorizes exports and certain reexports of
     eligible agricultural commodities that are classified as EAR99
     (i.e., not listed on the Commerce Control List) to Cuba, subject to
     certain criteria and restrictions.

     License Exception AGR does not authorize exports or reexports of
     medicines or medical devices to Cuba.

     Exporters must notify BXA and obtain confirmation from BXA that no
     agency of the U.S. Government that reviews these notifications
     objects to use of License Exception AGR prior to any export or
     reexport under authority of License Exception AGR. The proposed
     export must meet all of the criteria and restrictions listed below.

     Exports and reexports must be made pursuant to a written contract
     and must take place within 12 months of the signing of the contract,
     unless the shipment is a commercial sample or a donation, in which
     case the contract requirement does not apply.

     No exports may be made to a terrorist entity, including a Specially
     Designated Terrorist (SDT) or Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO),
     a person denied export privileges by the Department of Commerce if
     the export would violate the terms of the denial order, or for use
     in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs (i.e., biological,
     chemical, nuclear warfare or missile proliferations activities). The
     Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control lists of SDTs
     and FTOs as part of the list of Specially Designated Nationals and
     Blocked Persons

     No U.S. owned or controlled foreign firm may export or reexport from
     a third country to Cuba a foreign produced agricultural commodity.
       _______________________________________________________________

                   TSRA Eligible Agricultural Commodities

   Agricultural commodities are defined in Section 102 of the Agricultural
                      Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 02).

     For purposes of License Exception AGR, agricultural commodities
     include, but are not limited to, food, feed, fish, shellfish and
     fish products; beer, wine and spirits; soft drinks; livestock;
     fiber, including cotton, wool and other fibers; tobacco and tobacco
     products; wood and wood products, including lumber and utility
     poles; seeds; and reproductive materials such as fertilized eggs,
     embryos, and semen.

     A list of eligible agricultural commodities [pdf] is available for
     review at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Web site. If you have
     questions regarding whether an item is eligible, you should consult
     Ms. Emiko Purdy at the Department of Agriculture, Foreign
     Agricultural Service,
     phone: 202-720-0762, fax: 202-720-0069.

     Vitamins, minerals, food additives and dietary supplements, and
     bottled water are also considered to be agricultural commodities for
     the purposes of License Exception AGR.

     Some organic and inorganic fertilizers are eligible and some are
     not. The distinction is as follows:

     Dry fertilizers containing 15% or less ammonium nitrate are eligible
     for License Exception AGR.

     Dry fertilizers containing more than 15% ammonium nitrate are
     classified as Export Commodity Classification Number (ECCN) 1C997
     and are not eligible for License Exception AGR.

     Liquid fertilizers are eligible for License Exception AGR regardless
     of the concentration of ammonium nitrate they contain.

     Some agricultural commodities are not eligible, such as:

     items on the Commerce Control List (CCL), including western red
     cedar and live horses;

     items on the U.S. Munitions List;

     items for use in weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

     Agricultural commodities do not include furniture even if made from
     wood; clothing; agricultural equipment (whether hand tools or
     motorized equipment); pesticides, insecticides, or herbicides; or
     cosmetics (unless derived entirely from plant materials).
       _______________________________________________________________

                 TSRA Eligible Medicines and Medical Devices

   Medicines are drugs as defined in Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug
                      and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321).

   Medicines include prescription medicines and over the counter medicines
                           for humans and animals.

      Medical devices include medical supplies, instruments, equipment,
       equipped ambulances, institutional washing machines capable of
   sterilizing hospital clothing and bedding, and vehicles with installed
                         medical testing equipment.

   If you have questions regarding whether an item meets the definition of
    medicine or medical device under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, you
    should consult the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For medicines,
        contact the FDA's Office of Drug Information at 301-827-4570
     (telephone); 301-827-4577 (fax); or by email. For medical devices,
      contact the FDA's Division of Small Manufacturers' Assistance at
         800-638-2041 (telephone); 301-443-8818 (fax); or by email.

          Medicines on the Commerce Control List are not eligible.

   Medical devices do not include general purpose furniture such as desks,
        tables, or lamps used in hospital offices and waiting rooms.

     For Cuba, medicines and medical items are not eligible for License
   Exception AGR. These may be authorized for export to Cuba according to
      the provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act under an export license
         issued by BXA. A BXA export license is valid for two years.

                     BXA's Prior Notification Procedures
                        under License Exception AGR:

   Before making any shipment under License Exception AGR, exporters must
   submit a notification to BXA and obtain confirmation that no agency has
       raised an objection to the use of License Exception AGR for the
   transaction described in the notification. BXA informs exporters within
      12 business days from the date the notice is registered in BXA's
     electronic database whether such objections have been raised. BXA's
      confirmation that no objections have been raised does not relieve
   parties to the transaction from the obligation to assure that they meet
   all of the requirements of License Exception AGR, other requirements of
    the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and any other applicable
          law. The procedures for using this license exception are:

     -Exporters must notify BXA prior to any export or reexport.

     -Exporters provide this prior notification by submitting a completed
     BXA Multi-purpose Application Form (BXA-748P) or electronically
     through BXA's Simplified Network Application Process (SNAP).

    Within two business days of the notification's registration in BXA's
         electronic database system, BXA will refer the notification
       electronically to the Departments of State, Defense, and other
                    agencies, as appropriate, for review.

    Any reviewing agency that objects to the use of License Exception AGR
   must provide notice of such objection to BXA within nine business days
                              of the referral.

     -An agency may object for one or more of the following reasons:

     the commodity is not an agricultural commodity;

     the items are not EAR99;

     the export would violate the terms of a denial order;

     the recipient may promote international terrorism; or

     the transaction raises nonproliferation concerns.

   If any agency objects, BXA will convert the notification into a license
    application and process it under standard export license application
                                 procedures.

   An exporter may ship the goods after 12 days if no agency has raised an
     objection. Applicants may check the status of their notification or
    application via BXA's System for Tracking Export License Applications
      (STELA) at 202-482-2752 using the "Z" number on the 748-P form or
   provided by SNAP. Applicants may not make the export without confirming
              via STELA that no agency has raised an objection.

     BXA also will notify the applicant in writing of the outcome of the
                             interagency review.
     __________________________________________________________________

                   Commodity Classification Requirements:

      Exporters must be sure that they are not attempting to use AGR as
      authority to export any item that is on the Commerce Control List
    (CCL). Only items classified as EAR99 are eligible for BXA's License
    Exception AGR or OFAC's expedited review procedures. EAR99 items are
    items that are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, but
                they are not specifically listed on the CCL.

   Exporters may need to include, with their notification or application,
   an official BXA commodity classification to confirm the classification
         of an item as EAR99, as specified in greater detail below.

    BXA is responsible for providing commodity classifications. Exporters
    may obtain a commodity classification by submitting a completed BXA's
     Multipurpose Application Form (BXA-748P) or electronically through
     BXA's Simplified Network Application Process (SNAP) indicating that
    they wish a commodity classification. See Section 748.3 of the Export
              Administration Regulations for more information.

   BXA has already determined that most items that meet the definition of
    agricultural commodity are classified as EAR99. This includes most of
   the items on the Department of Agriculture's Eligible Commodities List
    (pdf) available from its Economic and Trade Sanctions Web page. This
   means that items on this list do not require a commodity classification
   with three exceptions: live horses; western red cedar; and fertilizers.

   For these three types of agricultural commodities, BXA and OFAC require
   a BXA commodity classification for fertilizers, live horses or western
     red cedar prior to submission of a notification to BXA or a license
    application to OFAC, as these agricultural commodities may be on the
                           Commerce Control List.

    Medicines do not require a BXA commodity classification prior to OFAC
    review, unless you are unsure whether your item is a medicine (e.g.,
     vaccines and immunotoxins) that BXA has identified on the Commerce
        Control List and thus on BXA's list of ineligible medicines.

      Medical supplies (e.g., syringes, bandages and gauze) and devices
   require a BXA commodity classification prior to OFAC review, unless BXA
     has listed the item on the list of EAR99 medical supplies found on
                               BXA's Web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

              Exports and Reexports to Iran, Libya, and Sudan:

         OFAC is responsible for authorizing exports of agricultural
   commodities, medicines, and medical devices to Iran, Libya, and Sudan.
   It is also responsible for authorizing reexport of these items by U.S.
                      persons to Iran, Libya and Sudan.

     BXA has licensing responsibility for reexports to Libya by U.S. or
    foreign persons of items requiring a license to Libya under the EAR,
     e.g., foreign produced medical equipment containing U.S. controlled
   content, reexports of U.S. origin medical equipment (see section 746.4
                                of the EAR).

    If OFAC authorization is needed, exporters must submit an application
    in writing to OFAC identifying the item they would like to export and
     the purchaser, any intermediaries, and the end-user involved in the
                            proposed transaction.

     OFAC also has expedited procedures for reviewing such applications.

    Exporters should check OFAC's Web site for additional information on
                            OFAC's requirements.

    Exporters can check the status of their OFAC applications by calling
   the OFAC Licensing Division at (202) 622-2480 between 9:00 AM and 5:30
                              PM Eastern time.

      As described in the Commodity Classification Requirements summary
      above, to comply with OFAC regulations, exporters may need a BXA
                          commodity classification.
