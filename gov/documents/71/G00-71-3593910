   Puget Sound Energy's request for electricity and natural gas rate
   increases
      The Washington UTC will hold a public hearing regarding Puget Sound
      Energy's request for interim rate relief. The hearing will be held
      Thursday, February 21, 2002 at 6:30 p.m. in the UTC hearing room in
      Olympia(directions).
      The hearing will focus on the company's request for a 21.6 percent rate
      increase to run from March 1 through October 2002. The company seeks
      the temporary increase to cover excess power costs. This filing is
      separate from the company's request for emergency relief.
      The Commission authorized PSE to defer certain power costs, based on
      actual net power supply costs experienced by PSE during the period
      January 1, 2002, through March 31, 2002. The deferred costs will be
      examined in the context of the company's interim and general rate case.
      For permanent rates, Puget Sound Energy has requested a 16.5 percent
      increase in electricity rates and a 14.5 percent increase in natural
      gas rates. The proposal, if approved as filed, would raise the
      company's gas and electricity annual revenues by $313 million.
      According to the company's Nov. 27, 2001, press release the company's
      proposal would allow customers to choose an "adjustable rate option"
      which would result in customers who choose the option to pay rates that
      varied (daily for electricity and monthly for natural gas) based on
      wholesale market prices for those resources.

      The commission has denied and reaffirmed the decision to deny Puget
      Sound Energy's request for an emergency rate increase. List of
      documents related to the emergency rate increase (Docket No.
      UE-011163).
      On Oct. 4, 2001, the WUTC dismissed the utility's previous request
      saying the company had failed to demonstrate that its financial
      condition warranted emergency action.
      "We deny PSE's petition for reconsideration or rehearing, but in the
      same breath we repeat that our decision to dismiss its request for
      extraordinary rate relief is based solely on PSE's failure to provide
      sufficient evidence showing that its actual financial condition
      warrants any kind of rate relief, let alone a power cost adjustment
      applied on an extraordinary basis."
      On October 12, 2001, Puget Sound Energy filed a petition asking the
      Commission to reconsider the utility's request for an emergency rate
      increase. PSE pointed to recent comments and actions from financial
      analysts in its petition. However, the company provided no additional
      company information to substantiate its actual financial condition.
      "We are concerned about the volatility of the environment in which
      Washington's electric utilities must operate," said the Commission
      order. "If PSE has presented financial information to the ratings
      agencies that would support its position, we invite PSE to share that
      information with the Commission in a new filing so that we may consider
      it."
      Bellevue-based Puget Sound Energy is the state's largest electricity
      provider, serving 930,000 customers in nine Western Washington counties
      and Kittitas County in Eastern Washington.
