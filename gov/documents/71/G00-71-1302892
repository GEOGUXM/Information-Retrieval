                  Environmental Research With LongEZ (N3R)

                       LongEZ at First Flight Airport

   N3R is a safe and reliable personally owned airplane with exceptional
   performance and aerodynamic characteristics for efficient environmental
   research. Because of its low operational cost, impressive flight
   capabilities and sophisticated instrument system, it is efficient for
   the study of a wide range of environmental issues. It has proven
   especially powerful in studying the spatial variability of air-surface
   exchange. In remote areas, we routinely measure turbulent exchange of
   momentum, energy and trace gases, such as CO[2], H[2]O, and O[3], in
   flights as close as 15 m to the surface. The Best Aircraft Turbulence
   (BAT) probe measures mean and turbulent wind parameters with exciting
   fidelity. N3R's long endurance at low altitude and airspeed allows the
   spatial variability of exchange to be documented in detail never before
   possible. Many remote sensing and in situ instruments are available.
   The nominal sensor suite includes the BAT probe, an infrared H[2]O and
   CO[2] gas analyzer, a net radiometer, upward and downward PAR
   (photosynthetically active radiation) radiometers, and sensors for dew
   point, and surface temperature. Other sensors can be carried including
   lasers, laser arrays, Ka-band radar, visible light cameras, and a
   multi-band radiometer.

   The following offers detailed descriptions of N3R, its instruments and
   operation. The outline is link-listed so that you can choose subjects

                                 The LongEZ

   Early in the 1980's, a revolutionary high-performance sport aircraft
   design called the LongEZ was introduced by Burt Rutan, who later
   designed the Voyager, the first airplane to fly around the world
   unrefueled. Intended to be built at home, the LongEZ is a safe and
   reliable aircraft with exceptional performance. It is built entirely
   from a composite structure of fiberglass and epoxy over rigid foam. Its
   unique shape results from careful aerodynamic optimization. The forward
   lifting surface (called a canard) is designed to prevent the aircraft
   from stalling and spinning. The combination of small vertical winglets
   on the wing tips, Eppler 1230 laminar flow wings, and pusher engine all
   contribute to its high aerodynamic efficiency. Further, N3R
   incorporates many enhancements over Rutan's original design. Its
   airframe is strengthened to withstand +9, -6 G's and is certified for
   aerobatics. This fatigue-resistant, high-strength structure allows safe
   operation in the extreme turbulence we often encounter in operation.
   Larger by 20% than a standard LongEZ, N3R is powered by the highly
   reliable Lycoming O-320 160 horsepower aircraft engine. Its empty
   weight is 950 pounds, while its maximum gross take-off weight reaches
   1800 pounds. Its various hard points, windows and external pods
   accommodate a wide array of scientific research instrumentation.

   [LEInstThumb.jpg] In its non-instrumented configuration, N3R carries
   two people with limited baggage. An expanded 73-gallon fuel capacity
   gives it 10-hour endurance at 200 MPH. With its optional long-range
   fuel tank, N3R has a 3,500 mile range, sufficient for ferry to anywhere
   in the world. It is well equipped for operation under instrument flight
   rules (IFR), and thus can be flown in almost any kind of weather.

   The LongEZ's aerodynamic and structural design features make it one of
   the safest and most efficient light airplanes flying today. Our
   modifications suit it especially well for low-and-slow high-fidelity
   turbulence measurements. The following table summarizes N3R's

                               Instrumentation

   With its clean aerodynamics, pusher configuration, and sport-aircraft
   handling, N3R has become well known for its low-and-slow
   air-surface-exchange measurement capabilities. The advantage of the
   pusher configuration is the freeing of the nose for mounting of
   instruments, uncontaminated by propeller-induced disturbances, engine
   vibration and exhaust. An important asset is the BAT probe, an
   innovative turbulence probe designed and built in collaboration with
   Airborne Research Australia (ARA). Mounted foreward of the nose on a
   boom, the BAT probe senses vertical and horizontal wind components with
   high fidelity at high frequency. Integral to the accurate measurement
   of turbulent winds is the accurate, high-frequency determination of the
   velocity and attitude of the airplane. Modern GPS receivers, extended
   to high frequency by acceleration measurements, provide the required
   information. A high-frequency open-path infrared gas analyzer, also
   designed and built at ATDD, measures water vapor and carbon dioxide
   fluctuations. Additional instruments measure net radiation, upward and
   downward PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), air pressure, air
   temperature, dew point temperature, and surface temperature. This
   sensor suite allows the following mean and turbulent-flux parameters to
   be determined.

                      Ozone                   Ozone
                    Radiation

   In addition to turbulence and radiation measurements, the N3R can be
   configured for a number of remote sensing applications. A pod can be
   mounted below the airplane in which a Ka-band radar and a laser
   altimeter can be fitted. With two additional laser altimeters under the
   wings, the height and slope of the surface beneath can be measured.
   This is especially useful for measuring the amplitude and slope of
   ocean waves for relation to air-surface exchange studies or for study
   of the waves themselves. Various types of digital cameras can be
   mounted, as can radiometers that sense visible and infrared light,
   simulating Thematic Mapper, SPOT or other satellite measurements. The
   precision of the GPS-based measurements of position, velocity, and
   attitude of the airplane, required for turbulence measurement, also
   allows accurate registration of remotely sensed information.

   Recent work has led to the development of a program to utilize the
   LongEZ for measuring the physical and optical properties of atmospheric
   particulates. Aerosol size distributions are provided at a Particle
   Measuring Systems (PMS) Passive-Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe-100X
   (PCASP). This instrument provides aerosol concentrations for 15 size
   channels for particles with diameters between 0.1 and 3.0 um. We are
   currently working to acquire additional instruments to provide
   concentrations for aerosols both larger and smaller than the cutoff for
   the PCASP. Total and/or back scattering coefficient at 3 wavelengths
   (450, 550, & 700 nm) is provided by a TSI model 3563 integrating
   nephelometer. These instruments may be used in tandem with the standard
   met. package to better understand particle transport and flux. Further,
   these instruments, when combined with radiometric measurements from the
   LongEZ, may provide direct measures of aerosol radiative forcing.

                         Location of sensors on N3R.

   The custom data system is built around a fast Pentium mother board and
   remote analog-to-digital conversion (A/D) modules called REM's. Each
   REM interrogates 16 channels at 1 kHz then block average the data to 50
   Hz before transferring the data to the computer through a serial
   connection. Once the 50 Hz data is transferred to the computer, it is
   further block averaged, if necessary, and stored to a binary data file
   on a Zip disk. The nominal LongEZ configuration has 32 analog input
   channels available on 2 REM modules. One module is mounted in the BAT
   probe housing the other in the main computer. If more than 32 channels
   are required, additional REM modules are installed. Our design
   philosophy is to keep the data conversion as close to the sensors as
   possible.

   We use advanced differential GPS techniques to measure aircraft
   position to a few millimeters, velocity to less than +-1 cm/s and
   attitude angles (pitch, roll, and heading) to +-0.05 degrees all at 50
   Hz. Winds and many other parameters cannot be directly measured but
   must be computed from multiple inputs. With the aircraft motion
   measured with such high fidelity, and the aerodynamic characteristics
   of the BAT probe well understood, the accuracy of the final wind
   measurement is very good.

                         Planning Your Field Program

   Development of a research program begins with clearly defining the
   research issue or problem. If the LongEZ's capabilities and measurement
   system can provide data relevant to your problem, then we would be
   excited to get a phone call or e-mail expressing interest -- especially
   if we too can share scientific interest in your issue. If you have a
   special measurement requirement, we are clever at designing, building
   and flying special purpose instrument systems. However, this requires
   additional lead time. Once mission scenarios and program strategy are
   developed, we can help with field deployment details. The field phase
   requires cooperation with FRD staff to make arrangements for approvals,
   shipping, travel, facilities, etc. Although it takes surprisingly
   little time or money to deploy N3R, it takes a lot of time and effort
   to reduce, interpret and report the massive quantities of data that are
   collected. This part of the project is often underestimated. The
   following offers additional guidelines.

Facilities

   N3R can be operated in remote regions or complex airspace with minimal
   on-site support. Small, low-traffic airport near the research site
   enhance data efficiency by minimizing takeoff and ferry time. At least
   a three thousand-foot hard-surface runway is required. If necessary,
   N3R can run on automobile fuel. During field experiments, a field
   office should be established. Using a nearby hotel, this office
   consists of a guest room with telephone service, electric power, and
   access to the roof or other open space for the GPS and VHF antennas.
   There, we setup data processing computers, internet access, a GPS
   ground station, VHF two way radio communications, etc. From the field
   office, the PI and scientist/pilot evaluate weather, plan missions,
   file flight plans and reserve airspace. After flights, data are
   processed and evaluated.

Cost

   Costs are much less than normally expected in airborne research
   programs. This is because N3R can be operated for $150 per flight hour.
   Because of the low flight hour cost, programs requiring 50 to 100
   flight hours are inexpensive. There are many specific details that make
   up the cost of an airborne experiment. Typical program costs run from
   40 to 150 thousand dollars depending on complexity. Usually, about half
   the costs go to processing and reporting the large quantities of data.
   Programs with significant sponsor or student involvement cost less.
   Programs requiring lots of meetings, extensive data reduction and
   analysis with follow on reporting are more expensive.

Performance

   N3R's performance (altitude, duration and range) can easily fatigue a
   single pilot. If daily flight scenarios routinely exceed six hours, two
   pilots are required.

Operation

   The operation of the LongEZ is quite straightforward. When fully
   instrumented, the rear seat is occupied by a computer and instruments.
   Since only one pilot will fly the airplane and collect data, the data
   acquisition system is highly automated. Low altitude flights vary from
   10-50m AGL (above ground level), and duration can be as long as eight
   hours. High altitude flights can be easily flown up to 18000 feet and
   higher, if necessary. Typical flight paths are straight lines
   (transects) up to 100 km long, repeatedly flown in as many as eight
   passes a day. Local flights around similarly instrumented towers are
   also conducted to provide a necessary linkage between aircraft and
   towers for assessment of air-surface exchange over heterogeneous
   surfaces.

Scheduling

   Logically, the LongEZ is simple to deploy. Deployments have been
   arranged within one month. But such quick response requires use of
   standard instrumentation and no schedule conflict. The below table
   shows the upcoming research experiment schedule.

                            Air-Surface Exchange

   Air-surface exchange at the earth's surface occurs by several means:
   biological, chemical, and physical. It profoundly influences the global
   climate. The exchange rate can be expressed per unit area per time in a
   particular direction. For example, CO[2] flux is typically expressed in
   mg-m^-3s^-1 positive upward. Vegetation removes carbon dioxide from the
   air in photosynthesis. This produces a carbon dioxide deficit near the
   leaves, relative to the rest of the atmosphere. Turbulent air currents,
   called eddies, replace this depleted air with air containing more
   carbon dioxide. Downward-moving eddies typically bring air that has
   been away from the ground and is relatively rich in carbon dioxide.
   Upward-moving eddies usually carry air that has passed near the leaves
   and has been depleted. On average then, more carbon dioxide is coming
   down than going up. Fluxes are measured experimentally using a
   statistical technique called eddy correlation which involves
   simultaneous measurement of the vertical wind velocity with respect to
   the Earth and appropriate scalar quantities (gas concentrations,
   temperature, etc.). These measurements can be combined over a period of
   time at a single location (such as measurements made at a stationary
   location from a tower) or over a wide area (as with measurements made
   with aircraft) to yield a better understanding of the role surface
   characteristics, such as vegetation, play in the exchange of mass,
   momentum, and energy at the Earth's surface.

   To measure this phenomenon, one takes a representative sample of the
   turbulent eddies to determine where air is rising and sinking, and how
   much carbon dioxide, or other constituent, is present. The eddies may
   be only a few meters in size. Therefore, airborne sampling requires
   careful observation of wind velocity and scalar quantities
   (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration) as often as 50
   times per second. With the aircraft ground speed around 50 m/s, the
   horizontal distance between data samples can be as low as 1 m. The
   exchange is the sum of products of vertical wind component with
   constituent concentration. For example, if sinking parcels tend to have
   a greater concentration of carbon dioxide than rising parcels, then the
   negative sign will prevail in the sum, indicating a downward flux of
   carbon dioxide.

   There are two significant advantages of making flux measurements from
   aircraft. First, because of the significant airspeed, airborne data are
   compressed (eddies are encountered 10 times more frequently than from a
   tower) and rich in information. Secondly, because of spatial freedom,
   spatial variability of exchange can be observed at any location. The
   first advantage is only achieved if the aircraft flies low -- typically
   about 10 m. Ten meter flights above the ground are easy and safe in the
   LongEZ because it is aerodynamically clean and very controllable.

   The advanced wind measurements used on the LongEZ is not adversely
   affected by turns. As a result, a variety of flight plans including
   circles are feasible. However, air-surface exchange research usually
   requires straight line transects which may be as long as 100 km in
   length and may be flown back and forth as many as eight times in a
   single day.

                            Flight Safety Issues

   Flight Safety Issues

   Flight safety is no accident, but is achieved by planning, thought, and
   continued effort. Safety is always the first issue addressed in program
   planning, deployment, and daily operations. Special safety
   considerations are necessary for the long research hours we carry out
   at altitudes between 10 and 30 m. Fortunately, the LongEZ has many
   inherent safety features not found in other aircraft. Devices such as a
   ballistic parachute make the low level operation of the LongEZ safe and
   practical. The following discusses further aspects of flight safety.

   The LongEZ's modern composite structure airframe is certified for
   aerobatic maneuvers (+9G, -6G) and is significantly stronger than
   normal or utility category aircraft. This is important in severe
   turbulence because composite structures do not fatigue and even extreme
   turbulence will not exceed design loads. As a result, airframe failure
   is highly unlikely. N3R also carries a BRS (Ballistic Recovery System)
   ballistic parachute. This parachute is tied to the airframe and can be
   deployed in 0.9 s for emergency recovery of the pilot, airplane, and
   instrumentation. If an emergency occurs over water, the solid foam-core
   airframe floats. However, should the unbelievable happen, composite
   structures are noted for their "crash-worthiness." We take advantage of
   this by flying slow (50m/s), using a 4-point 40G pilot restraint
   harness and safety-foam crash seats noted for their energy absorption.
   However, in the final analysis what really makes the LongEZ safe is its
   pilot.

   Moreover, the canard's flight characteristics significantly enhance
   flight safety. First, this forward lifting wing prevents stalls and
   spins. As the angle of attack of the airplane is increased, the canard
   stalls before the main wing. This causes the nose to drop, which
   decreases the angle-of-attack, providing automatic stall recovery
   without ever allowing the main wing to stall. Therefore, the pilot
   cannot inadvertently lose control of the aircraft. Second, canard
   aircraft penetrate turbulence far better than conventional aircraft of
   the same wing loading (weight per unit wing area). Since the canard
   contributes both lift and stability, it can be heavily loaded, relative
   to the main wing. Therefore, an up gust striking the wings causes more
   lift on the far aft main wing. The pitch response is down which damps
   response to the up-gust. If an up-gust strikes the rear-mounted
   elevator on a conventional airplane, control surface deflection imparts
   upward pitch response. This increases the lift generated by the wings
   and amplifies the response to gust. Canard airplanes, in contrast, have
   their elevators forward of the CG. Upward deflection of the elevator by
   an up-gust thus imparts a compensating downward pitch response. The
   pitch response to either up- or down-gust is opposed to the gust
   direction, giving canard aircraft their superior turbulent penetration
   characteristics. The flexibility and damping of the fiber/foam
   composite structure used in these modern designs also soften the impact
   of the turbulence on the airframe.

   Weather Safety

   LongEZ N3R is certified for operation under both VFR/VMC (Visual Flight
   Rules/Visual Meteorological Conditions) and IFR/IMC (Instrument Flight
   Rules/Instrument Meteorological Conditions). Ferry and IFR flight
   capabilities are enhanced by a two-axis auto pilot, an instrument
   landing system (ILS), twin navigation and communication radios, an IFR
   GPS, a Storm scope and an oxygen system. The airplane and its research
   instruments are not adversely affected by rain. However, N3R is not
   certified for flight into known icing conditions. Single-engine,
   single-pilot operation does impose practical safety constraints.
   Although the BRS mitigates many concerns, operations during "Hard" IFR
   or marginal night VFR are avoided if possible.

   Operational Safety

   N3R is always flown by a highly experienced commercial pilot with an
   instrument rating. The pilot is the final authority on any flight
   safety issue. The scientific efficiency of research with N3R is high
   because the pilot is also a scientist and a member of the science team.
   To enhance safety, all flight operations are monitored and managed by
   an onsite NOAA field operations and safety office. As necessary, low
   flight wavers are obtained, and DVFR or IFR flight plans filed. When
   operations are necessary within military operations, restricted or
   warning areas, appropriate coordination and communications is
   maintained with the controlling agency of the airspace. Before every
   flight, a operational research flight plan is established which defines
   the aircraft's position in time and space. Further, a routine two-way
   radio communication schedule is also established. Not only does this
   communication procedure enhance safety, it also allows the PI or pilot
   to change the flight plan if either has a scientific or safety concern.

   The LongEZ also caries one of the new 406 MHz Emergency Locator
   Transmitter (ELT). In emergency, this new generation ELT broadcast not
   only on standard civilian and military emergency frequencies but it
   also sends the aircraft's ID to NOAA's stationary GOES satellites. From
   the GOES down link, search and rescue immediately knows the LongEZ's
   ELT has alarmed, the deployment location and a local phone number.

   N3R's range, duration and altitude capabilities exceed those of the
   pilot. Consequently, routine operations requiring N3R's full range,
   duration, or altitude capabilities are avoided. Although the airplane
   can remain airborne longer than 18 hours at 50 m/s, pilot fatigue
   limits routine flights to six hours or less. When scientifically
   important, eight hour flights can be accommodated. Our record is 21
   flight hours in a 24-hour period which was set by two pilots, each
   making two flights. The standard oxygen system allows operation up to 6
   km. Flights to 9 km are possible with special planning. Low-level night
   flights are acceptable but only under good night VFR conditions, and
   with well-planned flight paths which have been flown several times
   during daylight. In general, all flights must comply with Federal
   Aviation Regulations (FAR) as specified by FAA Part 91, or a special
   waiver (see example) must be obtained. Of specific interest, Part 91.79
   lists restrictions for flights below 300 m AGL. The restrictions
   require a minimum altitude of 300 m (1000 ft.) over "congested areas"
   and 150 m (500 ft) altitude above non-congested areas. Lower altitudes
   are allowed over open water or "sparsely populated areas." In any
   situation, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 300 m to any
   person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. An advantage of low level flight
   with the LongEZ is that it is quiet, and its unusual shape attracts
   favorable attention rather than citizen complaints. Operations over
   water have no special restrictions, except that appropriate survival
   and navigation gear be carried for safety.

                              Research Programs

   LongEZ N3R participates in two to six research programs every year.
   Experimental campaigns last from two weeks to two months during which
   we typically fly 50 to over 100 hours. Because N3R is a fast long-range
   aircraft, experiments can be carried out at almost any location. The
   LongEZ has participated in 50 major field campaigns including the joint
   US-Canadian Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), the Alaskan
   Landscape Flux Study (ALFS), the Long-Range Over water Diffusion Study
   (LROD), the First Flux Experiment (FIFE) of the International
   Satellite/Land-Surface Climatology Program (ISLSCP), as well as several
   others. The following table presents the more recent LongEZ
   deployments.
