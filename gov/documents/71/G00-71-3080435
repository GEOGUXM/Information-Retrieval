                   Estate-tax article falls short on facts

                                  USA TODAY

                                June 1, 2001

   To the Editor:

   USA TODAY's article on the history of the campaign against the estate
   tax -- and the nickname "death tax" -- is missing some important facts
   ("Linking tax to death may have brought its doom," News, May 21).
   * First, no pollster or lobbyist of the 1990s can take credit for the
   "death tax" epithet. There are many references to "death taxes" in
   professional tax journals dating to the 1970s, when I taught tax law at
   Harvard. Californians, who repealed our state inheritance tax with
   nearly two-thirds of the vote in the 1980s, called it the "death tax"
   throughout the debate. President Reagan used the term, too -- for
   example, in a Feb. 8, 1982 campaign speech in Minnesota.
   * Second, the contemporary repeal movement wasn't hatched by lobbyists;
   it began when Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., proposed increasing death
   taxes in 1992. To combat this, on July 23, 1993, I introduced the
   Family Heritage Preservation Act, to immediately repeal the death tax.
   By the end of 1994, I had 29 House co-sponsors; by 1998, 206 of 435
   representatives -- including the entire GOP leadership -- had
   co-sponsored my repeal bill. The current 10-year phaseout is a
   compromise of that legislation.
   To be sure, lobbying and campaigning play a role.  But as the author of
   the bill to kill the death tax who has waged this fight for nearly a
   decade, I have yet to meet the lobbyists mentioned in USA TODAY.
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
   Chairman, House Policy Committee
   Washington, D.C.
