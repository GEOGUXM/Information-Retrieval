   Quick Tips and Examples
   It's easy to search with NASA Spacelink. Just type in a few words or
   phrases. Try to use discriminating terms that are likely to be found
   only in the documents you seek. The more words you give, the better
   results you'll get. Here are some examples:

   Search by typing words and phrases.

     schedule for International Space Station

   Spacelink will find documents containing as many of these words and
   phrases as possible, ranked so that the documents most relevant to your
   query are presented first. Don't worry about missing a document because
   it doesn't have one of the words in your search -- Spacelink returns
   relevant results even if they don't contain all query terms.

   Identify phrases with quotation marks, separate with commas.

     schedule for "International Space Station"

   A phrase is entered using double quotation marks, and only matches
   those words which appear adjacent to each other. Separate multiple
   phrases or proper names with a comma.

   Use UPPER case to indicate exact match.

     MHz frequency for the Space Amateur Radio Experiment

   Spacelink automatically treats adjacent capitalized words as a single
   phrase. Search terms in lowercase will match words in any case,
   otherwise, an exact case match is used.
