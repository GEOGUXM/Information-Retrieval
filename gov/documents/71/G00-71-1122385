   About Student Loans

   A student loan is money you borrow to finance your (or your dependent
   student's) college education. Student loans must be repaid, even if
   you:
     * are not satisfied with the quality of your education,
     * do not complete your program of study, or
     * are not able to obtain employment.

   If you need a student loan to attend college, remember:
     * The amount of money you borrow can affect your lifestyle after you
       leave college.
     * Your ability or inability to repay your student loan can affect
       your credit worthiness for purchases such as a car or house.
     * Failure to repay your student loan can increase your total debt
       because collection costs might be added to your loan balance.
