   The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics is one of the world's most
   widely known scientific reference books for chemical and physical data.
   This 3rd electronic edition follows the 81st edition of the print
   Handbook in terms of content. There are several updated and expanded
   tables: Fundamental Physical Constants (the new set of CODATA
   recommended values, replacing the 1986 set); The Elements (descriptive
   texts on the occurrence, properties, history, and uses of all the
   chemical elements); Dissociation Constants of Organic Acids and Bases
   (expanded by 50%); DipoleMoments (revised and expanded); Threshold
   Limits for Airborne Contaminants (including the most recent
   recommendations).
