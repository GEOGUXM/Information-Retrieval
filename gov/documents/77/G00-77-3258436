   The Mayor's Office of Affirmative Action and Contract Compliance (AACC)
   provides quality certification, compliance, business development, and
   training programs to promote equal employment and economic opportunity
   at every level of City government. To increase opportunities for
   minority and women business owners to participate in City contracting,
   the City of Houston has implemented a Minority/Women Disadvantaged
   Business Enterprise (M/W/DBE) program.

   Firms wishing to participate in the M/W/DBE program must be certified
   by the AACC, which maintains and distributes the M/W/DBE Directory. The
   Directory is issued to all City departments and to prime contractors to
   assist them in making good faith efforts to meet M/W/DBE goals.

   The City's M/W/DBE goals are: construction, 17 percent; purchasing, 11
   percent; and, professional services, 24 percent.

   The AACC administers similar programs for federally-designated
   Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) and Persons with Disabilities
   Business Enterprises (PDBEs).

   Firms wishing to become certified can attend one of the weekly
   pre-certification workshops, offered every Thursday at 2:00 p.m. at the
   AACC office, 611 Walker, 20th Floor. For more information, call AACC at
   (713) 837-9000.
