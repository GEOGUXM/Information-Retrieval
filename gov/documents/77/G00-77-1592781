   Humans are tied to the Earth through an environmental umbilical that
   sustains and nourishes us. But we are an adaptable species and we are
   about to embark on a voyage that will move us out of our natural
   environment into one we are creating for ourselves. Living in Space
   will be our greatest adventure in adaptation. We will create our own
   atmosphere, and possibly our own gravity. We will learn how to cope in
   a threatening and alien environment. But before we venture out, we must
   understand the nature of the place we are going and how our very beings
   will adapt to it. What will we learn there that will better our lives
   here? Science @ NASA brings some of the most riveting stories of
   humanity's greatest adventure: the exploration and development of
   space! From the baby steps to the giant leaps for mankindâ€¦ share the
   excitement!
