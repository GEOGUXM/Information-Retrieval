   Who can become a donor? [Top]
   All individuals can indicate their intent to donate (persons under 18
       years of age must have parent's or guardian's consent). Medical
       suitability for donation is determined at the time of death.  [Top]

   Are there age limits for donors? [Top]
   There are no age limitations on who can donate. The deciding factor on
       whether a person can donate is the persons physical condition, not
       the persons age. Newborns as well as senior citizens have been
       organ donors. Persons under 18 years of age must have parent's or
       guardian's consent.

   How do I express my wishes to become an organ and tissue donor? [Top]
    1. Indicate your intent to be an organ and tissue donor on your
       drivers license.
    2. Carry an organ donor card.
    3. Most important, DISCUSS YOUR DECISION WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED
       ONES.

   If I sign a donor card or indicate my donation preferences on my
   drivers license, will my wishes be carried out? [Top]
   Even if you sign a donor card it is ESSENTIAL THAT YOUR FAMILY KNOWS
       your wishes. Your family may be asked to sign a consent form in
       order for your donation to occur.
       If you wish to learn how organ donation preferences are documented
       and honored where you live, contact your local organ procurement
       organization (OPO).  The OPO can advise you of specific local
       procedures, such as joining donor registries, that are available to
       residents in your area..

   What can be donated? [Top]
     * Organs: heart, kidneys, pancreas, lungs, liver, and intestines
     * Tissue: cornea, skin, bone marrow, heart valves, and connective
       tissue
     * Bone marrow

   If I sign a donor card, will it affect the quality of medical care I
   receive at the hospital? [Top]
   No! Every effort is made to save your life before donation is
       considered.

   Will donation disfigure my body? Can there be an open casket funeral?
   [Top]
   Donation does not disfigure the body and does not interfere with having
       a funeral, including open casket services.

   Why should minorities be particularly concerned about organ donation?
   [Top]
   Some diseases of the kidney, heart, lung, pancreas and liver are found
       more frequently in racial and ethnic minority populations than in
       the general population. For example, African Americans, Asian and
       Pacific Islanders and Hispanics are three times more likely to
       suffer from end-stage renal disease than Whites. Native Americans
       are four times more likely than Whites to suffer from diabetes.
       Some of these diseases are best treated through transplantation;
       others can only be treated through transplantation.
       Successful transplantation often is enhanced by the matching of
       organs between members of the same ethnic and racial group.  For
       example, any patient is less likely to reject a kidney if it is
       donated by an individual who is genetically similar.  Generally,
       people are genetically more similar to people of their own
       ethnicity or race than to people of other races.  Therefore, a
       shortage of organs donated by minorities can contribute to death
       and longer waiting periods for transplants for minorities.

       Are there any costs to my family for donation? [Top]

   The donors family does NOT pay for the cost of the organ donation. All
       costs related to donation of organs and tissues are paid by the
       recipient, usually through insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.

   Can I sell my organs? [Top]
   No! The National Organ Transplant Act (Public Law 98-507) makes it
       ILLEGAL to sell human organs and tissues. Violators are subject to
       fines and imprisonment. Among the reasons for this rule is the
       concern of Congress that buying and selling of organs might lead to
       inequitable access to donor organs with the wealthy having an
       unfair advantage.

   How are organs distributed? [Top]
   Patients are matched to organs based on a number of factors including
       blood and tissue typing, medical urgency, time on the waiting list,
       and geographical location.

   How many people are currently waiting for each organ to become
   available so they can have a transplant? [Top]

       Sharing.

   Can I be an organ and tissue donor and also donate my body to medical
   science? [Top]
   Total body donation is an option, but not if you choose to be an organ
       and tissue donor. If you wish to donate your entire body, you
       should directly contact the facility of your choice to make
       arrangements. Medical schools, research facilities and other
       agencies need to study bodies to gain greater understanding of
       disease mechanisms in humans. This research is vital to saving and
       improving lives.
