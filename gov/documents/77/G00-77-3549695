   SLOT MACHINE -- Argonne National Laboratory technician Chuck Keyser
   checks a device Argonne developed to greatly speed the upgrading of a
   large instrument at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The upgraded
   instrument will detect charged particles streaming from inside the
   world's most powerful particle detector. Argonne National Laboratory

   WHO DONE IT -- Forensic DNA typing takes hours instead of weeks using
   biochips developed by Argonne and the Russian Academy of ScienceÂ’s
   Englehardt Institute of Molecular Biology. Barbara Llewelyn, Assistant
   Director of the Illinois State police's R & D laboratory (rear) and
   scientist Julia Lebed are part of the research team. Argonne National

   CHIP OFF THE OLD DOC -- Biochips pack the equivalent of thousands of
   micro-test tubes on a single glass slide. Argonne National Laboratory
   and Packard Instrument Co. have joined forces to commercialize and

   GEM-LIKE -- The mineral calcite, composed of calcium carbonate, is
   common in sediments, soils and rocks. It plays an important role in
   regulating groundwater and ocean water chemistry, as well as
   atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Portions of the gem-like
   crystal shown here were used at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source to
   study molecular processes at the calcite-water interface.
