   General Overview

   Civil Air Patrol
   is a nonprofit, humanitarian corporation established in 1941 and
   chartered by Congress in 1946. It is also the official auxiliary of the
   United States Air Force. Public Law 476 established Civil Air Patrol's
   objects and purposes as follows: "Provide an organization to encourage
   and aid American citizens in the contribution of their efforts,
   services, and resources in the development of aviation and in the
   maintenance of air supremacy, and to encourage and develop by example
   the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.
   Provide aviation education and training especially to its senior and
   cadet members; to encourage and foster civil aviation in local
   communities and to provide an organization of private citizens with
   adequate facilities to assist in meeting local and national
   emergencies."  CAP accomplishes its aerospace education mission in a
   variety of ways, including both an internal and external program as
   well as sponsorship of the National Congress on Aviation and Space
   Education (NCASE).  Our goal for NCASE is to provide educators with the
   latest hands-on techniques and tools to help them capture the
   imaginations of their students.  CAP promotes the use of aerospace
   themes to help educators excite and motivate their students to excel in
   science, math, technology, language arts, social studies, plus other
   traditional subjects.   We've got an exciting lineup for next year's
   premier aviation and space education event.  It will be held in
   Washington DC on April 4-6 2002.  Click here for more details.

   Internal Aerospace Education Program:

   Civil Air Patrol's internal program has two parts, one for cadets and
   and one for senior members.  Cadets have a mandatory aerospace
   education program. They must learn about aerospace education to
   progress in Civil Air Patrol. The governing regulation for Cadet
   aerospace education is CAP Regulation 52-16. Cadets must pass formal
   tests to progress in the achievement levels and in the awards system.
   Cadets are presented with aerospace education opportunities as part of
   squadron meetings, encampments and field trips and through guest
   speakers, model building and flying.

   Senior members have an elective aerospace education program. The
   publications containing information on aerospace education for senior
   members are CAP Regulation 50-17, CAP Regulation 280-2, and CAP
   Pamphlet 215. Another important publication outlining duties and
   responsibilities for all Aerospace Education Officers is CAP Pamphlet
   15, the Aerospace Education Officers' Handbook.

   Senior members may participate in the Aerospace Education Program for
   Senior Members (AEPSM) and earn the Charles E. Chuck' Yeager Aerospace
   Education Achievement Award (see CAPR 280-2). Seniors may earn the
   "Technician," "Senior," or" Master" ratings in the 215 Aerospace
   Education Officer Specialty Training Track (see CAPP 215). Seniors may
   use attendance at a National Congress on Aviation and Space Education,
   attendance at a Region Aerospace Education Conference or preparing an
   aerospace manuscript for publication, to fulfill certain Senior Member
   Training Program progression requirements (see CAPR 50-17).
            _____________________________________________________

   External Aerospace Education Program:

   The external program is founded on the principles of community
   outreach. The objective, as specified in CAP's 1946 Congressional
   charter, is to "... encourage and foster civil aviation in local
   communities." In later years, the words "civil aviation" changed to
   "aerospace education." CAP has focused on schools and teachers as an
   excellent way to promote aerospace. Teachers can use aerospace themes
   and experiences to excite students, to teach a variety of subjects, and
   to develop special activities such as field trips, science
   competitions, model building, art contests, science fairs, etc. And, it
   is an excellent way to expose students to aerospace career
   opportunities while meeting national curriculum standards.

   An important part of CAP's external program is the Aerospace Education
   Member (AEM) Program. This program is designed primarily for teachers
   from kindergarten through twelfth grade who want to promote aerospace
   education in their schools using CAP educational products and
   resources. For their $30 annual membership dues, AEMs receive a
   membership certificate, lapel pin, periodic newsletters, special
   educational products, the opportunity to participate in CAP's School
   Aerospace Excellence Award Program, etc. Recognizing their budgets are
   tight, we also have a special $15 annual membership rate for
   undergraduate student teachers.  If military airlift is available, AEMs
   receive priority seating on aircraft traveling to CAP's National
   Congress on Aviation and Space Education.  In May 1998, CAP's governing
   board modified the AEM program to allow organizations to join CAP and
   for a designated individual in that organization to receive the AEM
   membership benefits.
            _____________________________________________________

   National Congress on Aviation and Space Education (NCASE):  NCASE is
   the premier aerospace education conference of its kind in the nation.
   It is also one of Civil Air Patrols major contributions to Americas
   aerospace education community. CAP uses this forum to promote science,
   math and technology in todays classrooms. Presented annually since
   1968, NCASE brings together educators from around the nation to learn
   from a variety of gifted speakers and motivational teachers.
   Aerospace-oriented hands-on activities for all grade levels are offered
   in a variety of break-out sessions. Educators share new experiences and
   discover learning tools that will capture the imagination of their
   students. Teachers learn how the wonders of aviation and space can be a
   way to teach ordinary subjects in an extraordinary way. Several awards
   are presented during the conference including the A. Scott Crossfield
   Aerospace Education Teacher of the Year Award, the National Aeronautic
   Associations Frank G. Brewer Trophy, National Coalition for Aviation
   Education Leadership Award, and the National Congress Crown Circle for
   Aerospace Education Leadership.
