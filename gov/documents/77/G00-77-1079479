   [current-line.gif]

Mission

   [logo-trans.gif] We protect human health, the environment and
   beneficial uses of natural resources by conducting cost-effective,
   science-based, state-of-the-art environmental restoration worthy of a
   National Laboratory.
   [greenball.gif] This is accomplished by multidisciplinary teams
       employing applied and passive remediation processes and applied
       environmental risk management techniques.
       [greenball.gif] Skills developed in understanding fate and
       transport of ground water contaminants, contaminant mass removal,
       and contaminant plume reduction will be made more readily available
       to federally controlled sites and the nation as a whole.
       [greenball.gif] Scientific and engineering advancements in
       contaminant hydrogeology and environmental remediation will
       continue to be made and transferred nationally and internationally.

Vision

   By 2003, ERD will be a premier environmental restoration program. We
   will be supported by about 25% WFO projects and 75% EM-40 projects with
   an overall moderate increase in funding. While the LLNL environmental
   restoration (EM-40) activities will remain ERD's core mission, the
   skills, lessons learned, and infrastructure that we have developed will
   be leveraged into Work for Others projects and back into EM-40 projects
   to accomplish a rapid science-based restoration that benefits LLNL, DOE
   and the nation.
