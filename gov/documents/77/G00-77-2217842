Special Agent Employment Information For North Carolina Residents

   FBI Seal
        The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in North Carolina only
   processes individuals who live in North Carolina and are considered to
   be MOST COMPETITIVE CANDIDATES for the Special Agent position.

        MOST COMPETITIVE CANDIDATES are generally 28 - 32 years of age
   with a minimum of five years (preferably six or more years) of
   Professional, Managerial, and/or Supervisory work experience, in
   addition to having a four-year degree.

        Candidates with advanced degrees still need two - three years of
   this work experience to be considered "most competitive."

        Individuals proficient in a language for which the FBI has a need
   must pass FBI language testing or equivalent Defense Language
   Proficiency (DLP) testing to be considered "most competitive" under the
   Language Program.

        Having passed the Bar/CPA exam with at least two years of
   practicing experience is preferred for those individuals to be
   considered "most competitive" under the Law and Accounting Programs.

        Disqualifiers include: Having used marijuana during the last three
   years or more than fifteen times. Having used any illegal drug(s) or
   combination of illegal drugs, other than marijuana, more than five
   times or during the last ten years. Having been convicted of a felony
   or major misdemeanor, including DWIs/DUIs.

        MILITARY PERSONNEL: Candidates must be within twelve months of
   completing obligated service to the military and can only be affiliated
   with a STANDBY RESERVE COMPONENT, if hired as a Special Agent. If
   employed by the FBI, it is the Agent's responsibility to be sure that
   he or she does NOT affiliate, even unintentionally, with the Ready
   Reserve. This includes all National Guard billets (including inactive
   National Guard billets) and all Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)
   billets, as they are Ready Reserve positions.

        If you have these qualifications and are interested in employment
   as a Special Agent with the FBI, please call Special Agent C. Andrew
   Thomure at (919) 854-2425, Raleigh, North Carolina.  If you live in,
   near, or west of Charlotte, North Carolina, please call Staffing
   Assistant Donna Mize at (704) 331-4526 for additional processing
   information.
