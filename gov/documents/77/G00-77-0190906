                               WHAT IS A PHA?
   Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are currently defined based on
   parameters that measure the asteroid's potential to make threatening
   close approaches to the Earth. Specifically, all asteroids with an
   Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) of 0.05 AU or less and
   an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered PHAs. In other
   words, asteroids that can't get any closer to the Earth (i.e. MOID)
   than 0.05 AU (roughly 7,480,000 km or 4,650,000 mi) or are smaller than
   about 150 m (500 ft) in diameter (i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of
   13%) are not considered PHAs. The current list of PHAs is obtained from
   the Minor Planet Center on a daily basis.

                     There are currently 374 known PHAs.

   This ``potential'' to make close Earth approaches does not mean a PHA
   will impact the Earth. It only means there is a possibility for such a
   threat. By monitoring these PHAs and updating their orbits as new
   observations become available, we can better predict the close-approach
   statistics and thus their Earth-impact threat.

   To learn more about the Earth impact threat, visit the NASA Ames
   Asteroid and Comet Impact Hazards site.

                      PHA EARTH CLOSE-APPROACH TABLES
   Tables (updated daily) are available showing future and past PHA Earth
   close-approach data including uncertainties. Earth close-approach
   tables for all NEOs are also available. More information about the
   uncertainties used in these tables is available.
                           PHA ORBITAL ELEMENTS
   The PHA Orbital Elements Table (updated daily) contains data from the
   latest orbit solutions for each PHA. In addition to standard asteroid
   osculating elements obtained from orbit solutions using up-to-date
   data, this table contains perihelion distance (q), aphelion distance
   (Q), orbital period (P), absolute magnitude (H), and the number and
   length of the data used in each orbit solution.
                            TORINO IMPACT SCALE
   Planetary scientists have developed a new means of conveying the risks
   associated with asteroids and comets that might collide with the Earth.

   A risk-assessment scale, similar to the Richter scale used for
   earthquakes, will assign values to celestial objects moving near Earth.
   The scale will run from zero to 10. An object with a value of zero or
   one will have virtually no chance of causing damage on Earth; a 10
   means a certain global climatic catastrophe.
