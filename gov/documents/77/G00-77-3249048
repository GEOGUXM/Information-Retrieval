A VLBI Antenna in Space

     The VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP) mission is the first
     Space VLBI mission for routine science observations. It is sponsored
     by the Japanese space agency Institute of Space and Astronautical
     Science (ISAS) and consists of an orbiting Japanese radio telescope
     called HALCA. (This is not actually an acronym, but rather an
     English version of the Japanese word Haruka which means "far away").
     HALCA was launched into Earth orbit in 1997, specifically for Space
     VLBI observations. The apogee (highest point in the elliptical
     orbit) is high enough to create a telescope "size" of over 30,000 km
     (20,000 miles).

"United Nations" of Radio Astronomy

     The staff of the Japanese VSOP Science Operations Group (or VSOG)
     orchestrates the observations of HALCA. They rely on an
     international collaboration of over a dozen countries and many more
     scientific agencies, including the U.S. agencies of NASA, JPL, the
     National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and many universities.
     They arrange for radio telescopes in Australia, Europe, Japan, the
     U.S., and elsewhere to "co-observe" (look at the same astronomical
     object at the same time) with HALCA for a day at a time, monitor
     HALCA's on-board clock, and record the data received on
     high-precision instrumentation tapes. In addition, they arrange
     shipment of the tapes, from both the satellite tracking stations and
     the co-observing telescopes, to sites (called correlators) in
     Canada, Japan, and the U.S. This data is then processed into images
     or other scientific results.

A Telescope Larger than the Earth

     The effect of HALCA is to create a "new" virtual telescope that is
     three times the diameter of the earth. Thus, the images created from
     the data processed by the correlators is three times more detailed
     than images created with VLBI earth-sized virtual telescopes created
     using ground telescopes only. This increased detail is important
     since so much of what scientists want to "see" lies inside regions
     of space too small to be seen by smaller telescopes. The VSOP
     mission daily creates a giant "zoom" lens that is allowing us to see
     more detail in radio sources, like black holes, than ever before.
