OSM, ACID DRAINAGE TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE (ADTI) GROUP DISTRIBUTES ACID MINE
DRAINAGE PREDICTION TECHNICAL MANUAL

   The Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
   Enforcement (OSM) and the National Mine Land Reclamation Center (NMLRC)
   today announced the Center's release of an Acid Mine Drainage
   Prediction Technical Manual for public distribution.

   The manual, Prediction of Water Quality at Surface Coal Mines, presents
   technical guidelines, techniques and methods used to predict, prior to
   mining, the water quality that will result from surface coal mining and
   reclamation operations. The focus of the manual is on the coalfields of
   the Appalachian Region of the Eastern United States. Case studies are
   included.

   Funding for the production and printing of the manual was provided by
   the National Mining Association, and the Office of Surface Mining.
   "This is an excellent example of a partnership among industry,
   government and academia," said OSM Acting Director Glenda Owens. "A
   partnership that, together with watershed associations and other
   not-for-profit organizations, is also joining together in a Clean
   Streams Alliance dedicated to restoring the streams of this nation
   polluted by acid mine drainage (AMD)." This manual is a companion
   volume to the previously released technical manual on AMD remediation
   methods.

   The ADTI is a partnership-based joint venture, which includes OSM, coal
   producing states, academia, and other government agencies and groups.
   Its purpose is to identify, evaluate, and develop "best science"
   practices to predict the likelihood of AMD discharges prior to mining,
   to describe the best technology for AMD prevention and to identify
   successful remediation practices for existing sources of AMD. The
   National Mine Land Reclamation Center (NMLRC) at the West Virginia
   University serves as the Secretariat for the Coal Mining Sector of
   ADTI. OSM supports the ADTI through $200,000 in funds annually to the
   NMLRC at West Virginia University.

   Copies of the manual are available from the NMLRC website,
   http//www.nrcce.wvu.edu/nmlrc, or NMLRC/WVU, PO Box 6064, Morgantown,
   West Virginia 26506-6064, phone: 304-293-2867, ext. 5450, or by sending
   an e-mail to: adti@nrcce.wvu.edu.
