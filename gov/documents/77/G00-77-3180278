                       Rough-Surface Scattering Theory

                                [3dline.gif]

     WHY? NOAA's climate-change and weather-prediction models require
     measurements of wind speed and direction, as well as heat and
     moisture fluxes, over the global ocean surface. Since the required
     number of in-situ instruments would be impossibly expensive to
     deploy and maintain, remote sensors that could do the job from
     satellites are being developed. Prototype passive (radiometric) and
     active (radar) ocean sensors have already been placed in orbit by
     several nations. However, preliminary results from these instruments
     reveal gaps in our understanding, both of the detailed structure and
     dynamics of the ocean surface itself, and the physics of how
     electromagnetic waves interact with it.

     Because the desired sea-surface properties cannot be measured
     directly by radars, and because the scattering of radar signals is
     determined almost entirely by sea-surface roughness, the first
     problem is to find out what statistical properties of sea-surface
     roughness are most closely related to wind and fluxes. This problem
     lies in the realm of hydrodynamics, and is under study in another
     related ETL project. The second problem is to find out how these
     statistical properties of the sea surface can be extracted from
     backscattered radar echoes. Before this inverse problem can be
     solved, however, the direct problem (what is the scattering from a
     sea-like surface?) must first be well in hand.

  What is the Direct Scattering Problem?

     [scat.jpg] The main reason this problem has not yet been
     satisfactorily solved is the very complex nature of the sea-surface
     roughness. The short, centimeter-scale waves that are responsible
     for backscattering microwave radar signals are superimposed on a
     continuum of longer waves, ranging in scale from tens of centimeters
     to hundreds of meters, which travel in various directions. Even
     numerical solutions of this statistical problem in three dimensions
     are beyond the abilities of today's computers.

     To simplify the problem, "two-scale" or composite-surface models
     have been tried. This approach combines two "classical" methods of
     wave-propagation theory: the method of small perturbations and the
     semi-classical approximation. However, in addition to lacking the
     necessary accuracy for quantitative predictions, this method uses a
     somewhat arbitrary scale-dividing parameter that makes the solution
     of the inverse problem ambiguous. Many important characteristics of
     scattering, such as polarization, angle, and dependence of cross
     sections on wind speed, cannot be accounted for over realistic
     ranges of parameter values. A more accurate theory is required that
     is free of fitting parameters.

     For a long time, no solutions to this problem were known. During the
     last decade, a number of new "unified" theories were advanced, in
     particular by D. Winebrenner and A. Ishimaru (the "phase
     perturbation approach"), M. Milder ("operator expansion"), E. Bahar
     ("full-wave approach"), and A. Fung and K. Chen ("integral equation
     model"). Numerical simulations have shown that these approaches
     extend the utility of "classical" methods significantly. However,
     validity regimes of these approaches are not always clear, and their
     applicability to real sea roughness is not well established.

  What have we done?

     The method developed at ETL uses surface slope as a small parameter.
     (Sea roughness slopes usually do not exceed 0.1-0.2.) A. Voronovich
     uses the "small-slope approximation," and V. Tatarskii uses the
     "quasi-slope expansion." The small-slope approximation was recently
     generalized to incorporate the case of multiple reflections
     ("non-local small-slope approximation"). The quasi-slope expansion
     was developed by V. Tatarskii and M. Charnotskii in "tilt-invariant"
     form, which is not restricted to small slopes and is associated
     instead with small roughness curvatures.

  Present research areas

     These methods now have to be applied to realistic models of the sea
     surface, i.e., ones that are expressed in terms of a wave
     directional spectrum. The problem here is that the "unified" models
     require subtle statistical characteristics of the sea waves that are
     not easily calculated for non-Gaussian height distributions. Now, a
     statistical model of sea surface roughness is being developed by V.
     I. Tatarskii and V. V. Tatarskii, which will permit calculation of
     the required statistical functions from empirical information about
     sea-wave spectra. This model is being tested in numerical
     simulations.

     We are also working on the problem of scattering at small grazing
     angles of incidence, which is important practically but difficult to
     treat theoretically. Present models disagree greatly with
     observations, possibly because diffraction by long ocean waves is
     being ignored. Preliminary calculations suggest that such effects
     may be important for grazing angles less than about 20 deg.
