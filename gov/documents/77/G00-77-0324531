                                   History

   The prospect of global warming caused by an increase in greenhouse gas
    emissions has become a major policy issue during the last decade. The
   transportation sector is currently responsible for approximately 27% of
   greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and is expected to be one
      of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the
     foreseeable future, due to increased demand for motor gasoline, jet
      fuel, and diesel fuel. Therefore, in May 1999, DOT announced the
        formation of its Center for Climate Change and Environmental
                                Forecasting.

                                   Mission

     The Center is the focal point in the DOT of technical expertise on
    transportation and climate change. Through strategic research, policy
    analysis, partnerships and outreach, the Center creates comprehensive
   and multi-modal approaches to reduce transportation-related greenhouse
      gases and to mitigate the effects of global climate change on the
                           transportation network.

                                   Vision

   The Center advances timely and effective transportation initiatives to
   reduce greenhouse gases and preserve the transportation infrastructure.
         The Center develops and evaluates strategies, and promotes
   technologies, that encourage livable communities by fostering economic
              development, mobility, safety, and social equity.
