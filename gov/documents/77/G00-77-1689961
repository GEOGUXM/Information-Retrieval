  Thermal Neutron Radiography

   Recently, Thomas Claytor and I have been working on digital neutron
   radiography at LANSCE. We have been using an EG&G/Heimann electronics
   Large area electronic amorphous silicon detector array to produce
   neutron radiographs. We are in the process of using the detector to
   produce 3-D tomographic reconstructions and will be performing further
   tests in March when the LANSCE comes back on line.

  Silicon Micro-Strip Detectors

   I went to college at U.C.S.C. for four years and got a B.S. in Physics.
   While I was at U.C.S.C. I worked at the Santa Cruz Institute for
   Particle Phyics. At SCIPP I worked on silicon strip detectors with
   Hartmut Sadrozinski. In particular, I developed a method of
   characterizing the detectors with radiation from Ruthenium 106. For
   more information on the Ruthenium characterization technique click on
   this.

  Ultrasonic Nondestructive Testing

   We use ultrasonic imaging to inspect parts and objects for defects and
   density variations which may not be visible to the naked eye. Since
   last June I have been working on several new scanning stations. If you
   would like to know a bit more about the work I've done on Ultrasonics
   click on this.

  Pulsed Plasma Tritium Production

   One of the projects that I am currently working on here at LANL are
   plasma discharge experiments. To learn more about the work I do in this
   area click on this. I am also involved with the development of
   controller which will be used to operate an ultrasonic imaging scanner.
