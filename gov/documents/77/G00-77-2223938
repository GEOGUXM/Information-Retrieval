About DSHS Hearings

How to use this guide

   This guide is a general overview of what to expect if you have a
   Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) hearing before the
   Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). What actually happens at your
   hearing may be different depending on the type of hearing and the
   unique circumstances of your case. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
   will give you instructions at the start of your hearing about how it
   will proceed.

   Words highlighted below have been defined in our Glossary of Legal
   Terms. Just click on the highlighted word and you will jump to its
   definition on the glossary page. You may then return back to this page
   by hitting the back arrow in your web browser. When possible, we have
   also highlighted specific laws and regulations for you to review.

   Please carefully read the brochure "Your Hearing Rights in a DSHS Case"
   we sent you with your Notice of Hearing. If you do not have a copy,
   click here to view the brochure in PDF format (requires the free Adobe
   Acrobat Reader), or click here to download the brochure as a simple
   text file.

   If you have further questions, contact the telephone number listed on
   your Notice of Hearing. You may also contact one of our offices listed
   on the OAH Offices Directory if you do not have a Notice of Hearing.

What kinds of hearings are held?

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) conducts hearings for DSHS
   in four main categories: public assistance; child support; facility
   licensing; and juvenile rehabilitation.
     * Public Assistance. DSHS provides cash, food, medical, and other
       assistance through many different programs. "Other assistance"
       includes services related to cash, food, and medical services such
       as WorkFirst support services, as well as services provided through
       DSHS Divisions of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), Adoption
       Services, Aging, Home and Community Services (HCS), Mental Health,
       Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR), and Telephone Assistance. If you
       are an applicant or recipient of public assistance, in any form,
       through DSHS, and you disagree with a decision that DSHS has made
       about your benefits, you have a right to an administrative hearing.
     * Child Support. The DSHS Division of Child Support (DCS) may set and
       modify child support using the administrative process as a faster
       and less expensive alternative to the court process when there is
       no court order establishing the child support obligation. DCS may
       set child support for children whenever any parent asks for DCS
       services or whenever a child receives public assistance. DCS may
       also enforce some court orders through the administrative process.
       If you disagree with a notice that DCS has sent you about your
       child support obligation, you have a right to an administrative
       hearing. If you are an employer who disagrees with a notice related
       to enforcement of a child support obligation, you also have a right
       to an administrative hearing.
     * Facility Licensing. DSHS regulates many different types of care
       facilities including adult family homes, boarding homes, child day
       care agencies, in-home day cares, drug and alcohol rehabilitation
       centers, nursing facilities, foster care homes and agencies, and
       shelters for victims of domestic violence. As part of its
       regulatory responsibilities, DSHS licenses these facilities and
       monitors them for compliance with minimum licensing standards. If
       you disagree with the action DSHS has taken on your application for
       a license or with your existing license, you have a right to an
       administrative hearing.
     * Juvenile Rehabilitation. DSHS is responsible for setting the
       reimbursement liability for parents with children in Juvenile
       Rehabilitation Centers. If you are a parent who has received a
       reimbursement notice from DSHS and disagree with the liability
       established by DSHS, you have a right to a hearing. DSHS also is
       responsible for monitoring juveniles who are under the supervision
       of the juvenile parole board. If you have received a notice of
       parole violation, you have a right to an administrative hearing.
     * Miscellaneous. You also have a right to a hearing if you have had a
       Child Protective Services (CPS) finding made against you, if you
       are a Certified Nursing Assistant against whom DSHS has taken
       adverse action, or if you receive medical assistance as an
       institutionalized client and the institution is taking action to
       transfer you against your wishes.

   All DSHS hearings are governed by Chapter 388-02 Washington
   Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter 34.05 Revised Code of Washington
   (RCW), and the specific regulations governing the various DSHS
   programs.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

How do I request a hearing?

   You may request a hearing in writing or by speaking to a responsible
   person (such as your case worker, a supervisor, or the fair hearings
   coordinator) at your Community Service Office (CSO). Your CSO has a
   form you can use if that would be helpful.

   You may also write to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) at:

   Office of Administrative Hearings
   PO Box 42489
   Olympia, WA 98504-2489

   All OAH offices have toll-free numbers. To find the best number to
   call, see our online OAH Office Directory. It is best to call the
   office closest to your location. If there are two OAH offices in the
   same city, call the one that is listed as the "Social and Health
   Services" office.

   Interpreters

   All hearings are conducted in English, and the decision mailed to you
   after the hearing will be written in English. If you or a person who
   will be appearing at the hearing on your behalf speaks limited English,
   OAH will provide an interpreter for you at the hearing at no cost to
   you.

   If you want an interpreter at the hearing and have not requested an
   interpreter before receiving the Notice of Hearing, contact the OAH
   office identified on the Notice of Hearing as soon as possible and
   before the day set for the hearing to request an interpreter. If you do
   not contact OAH before the day set for the hearing, the hearing may
   have to be postponed for an interpreter to be scheduled.

   NOTE: You cannot bring a family member or friend with you to serve as
   your interpreter at the hearing.

   Special Accommodations

   If you or a person who will be appearing at the hearing on your behalf
   is hearing or speech impaired, contact the OAH office identified on the
   Notice of Hearing to tell OAH what special accommodations are needed.
   You may call OAH using the Washington State Telecommunications Relay
   Service if you have TTY capability. You may reach the Washington State
   Telecommunications Relay Service by calling 1-800-833-6388. OAH can
   provide sign language interpreters and/or relay interpreters at the
   hearing at no cost to you. However, you must contact OAH before the day
   scheduled for the hearing. Otherwise, the hearing may have to be
   postponed until an interpreter can be scheduled.

   There may be people who, due to other unique physical or sensory
   challenges, require other special accommodations to fully participate
   in the hearing. Contact the OAH office identified on the Notice of
   Hearing as soon as possible so arrangements can be made to accommodate
   any special needs.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens after I request a hearing?

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) schedules a hearing and
   sends out a Notice of Hearing with the date, time, and place of the
   hearing. Enclosed with the Notice is important information about the
   hearing. Pay special attention to the enclosed brochure. Read it all.
   Read it carefully.

   Next, usually, the hearing representative from DSHS will contact the
   person who requested the hearing and any other interested party to
   discuss the case and try to resolve the disagreement. DSHS
   representative's phone number is written on the Notice of Hearing. You
   may initiate contact as well.

   If you wish to review your file and make copies of documents that you
   believe are relevant to the hearing, you should call DSHS
   representative to arrange a time to do this. You may have more than one
   file (economic, social services, etc.). Be sure to ask to see all
   files, including those only in hard copy or only on the computer as
   well as any unfiled documents.

   Sometimes the ALJ will schedule a prehearing conference. These are
   usually held by phone. If the ALJ schedules a prehearing conference,
   instructions about what to expect will be included in the scheduling
   notice.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

How do I prepare for my hearing?

   Carefully read the DSHS notice in dispute. Carefully read the Notice of
   Hearing sent by the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). Carefully
   read the hearing rights brochure enclosed with the Notice of Hearing.
   Carefully read any documents sent by DSHS.

   Call OAH, DSHS, and/or a legal service organization if you still have
   questions about the process or need additional or special assistance.
   Information about requesting accommodations will also be included. (We
   also have included a list of legal resources online for your
   convenience.)

   Read any specific pamphlets about the topic of your hearing. (You can
   find pamphlets on line through the Northwest Justice Project website.)
   Ask DSHS if they have any written information about the type of program
   or notice that is the subject of your hearing.

   Make notes of what you want to tell the ALJ at the hearing and gather
   documents you want the ALJ to look at. It's a good idea to send the
   documents to the ALJ before the hearing. You must send copies of
   anything you send to the ALJ to DSHS and any other parties (such as the
   other parent in child support cases).

   If your hearing relates to child support, you must fill out a
   Washington State Child Support Worksheet and give the ALJ your last two
   years of tax returns and current income information. If child support
   for earlier years is at issue, be sure to send income information for
   those years as well. Read the worksheet instructions for a guideline
   about other factors that may be considered in establishing a child
   support obligation, and bring evidence if you want those factors to be
   considered.

   Witnesses and Exhibits

   You may ask other people if they are willing to come to testify at your
   hearing as witnesses if they know information that is relevant to your
   hearing. Be sure you know what testimony you can expect from each
   witness and that each witness knows what you will be asking. If it
   would be inconvenient for a witness to come in person to the hearing,
   you may ask the witness to be available to testify by telephone. Be
   sure to ask the ALJ at the beginning of the hearing to allow you to
   present witness testimony by telephone and be sure that you know the
   telephone number where the witness can be reached.

   If a witness is unwilling to appear at your hearing but you believe his
   or her testimony is necessary, contact OAH at the telephone number
   given with your Notice of Hearing and request a subpoena. If you want a
   subpoena for a witness, you must be prepared to tell the ALJ why you
   believe the witness is necessary, and possibly what you believe the
   witness will testify about. The ALJ will decide whether to grant your
   request for a subpoena. You will also have to provide the witness's
   name and address. Since it takes time to process and serve a subpoena,
   contact the ALJ as soon as possible. You are responsible for serving
   the subpoenas on your witnesses and for any costs or witness fees for
   your witnesses.

   If you need documents, records, or other papers to prove your case
   other than those in your file with DSHS, but the documents are not
   available to you, you may request the ALJ to issue a subpoena duces
   tecum. You must be prepared to tell the ALJ why you believe the
   document is necessary to prove your case. The ALJ will decide whether
   to grant your request for a subpoena duces tecum. You must be able to
   identify the documents and who has them. Since it takes time to process
   and serve a subpoena duces tecum, contact the ALJ as soon as possible.
   You are responsible for serving the subpoena duces tecum and for
   payment of any fees.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens during my hearing?

   Be at the scheduled place at the scheduled time. If your hearing will
   be held at an Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) office, see the
   OAH Office Directory for directions.

   Bring all of the information that you want the ALJ to use in making a
   decision.

   The ALJ will introduce the people at the hearing and explain the
   procedure for the hearing. Listen carefully so you will know what to
   expect.

   Each person will have an opportunity to present information relevant to
   his or her case. Testimony is given under an oath administered by the
   ALJ. Listen carefully to what the other witnesses say and do not
   interrupt. Make notes to follow up when it is your turn.

   If you think of additional information you want the ALJ to have before
   the decision is made, ask the ALJ for time after the hearing to send it
   in.

   Be calm. The hearing will have a structure to which you must conform,
   but it is informal enough so that non-lawyers can effectively present
   their case. The ALJ will help each person get through the process.

   If your hearing is related to public assistance through a Community
   Service Office (CSO), more detailed information is provided in A Public
   Assistance Hearing--Step by Step.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

How is the decision made?

   The decision will not be made at the hearing. The ALJ will carefully
   consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing, make findings of
   facts, and then apply the applicable DSHS regulations to those facts.
   An ALJ has no authority to grant exceptions no matter how compelling
   your circumstances are. The resulting written decision will be sent to
   you.

   Cases involving public assistance will be sent out within 16 days.
   Those relating to child support, within 20 days. All others, within 30
   to 60 days.

   Back to Frequently Asked Questions

What happens after my hearing?

   The decision made by the ALJ is called an "Initial Decision". All
   parties, including you and DSHS, have a right to appeal the ALJ's
   decision to DSHS Board of Appeals. The decision will become final
   automatically if no one appeals it within the appeal period. If there
   is an appeal, the decision issued by the Board of Appeals is the final
   decision, and it may affirm, reverse, or modify the initial decision
   issued by Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). If you disagree with
   the Board's decision, you may appeal to Superior Court. Instructions on
   how to do this will be included in the Board's decision.

   For certain types of cases, DSHS will follow the OAH initial decision
   right away. For others, it will wait until the decision becomes final.
