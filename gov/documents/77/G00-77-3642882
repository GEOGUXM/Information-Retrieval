                               PRIVACY POLICY
   __________________________________________________________________

   The Employment Development Department (EDD) recognizes that your
   privacy is a personal and fundamental right without exception. The EDD
   values and protects your privacy and places strict controls on the
   gathering and use of personally identifiable data. Your personal
   information is not disclosed, made available, or otherwise used for
   purposes other than those specified at the time of collection, except
   with your consent or as authorized by law or regulation. Privacy
   concerns specific to EDD are as follows:
     * The EDD will only gather information through lawful means. Any
       subsequent use of the information is limited to purposes not
       inconsistent with the purpose(s) given at the time of collection.
       California law states that some information submitted or accessed
       by you may become public records under the Public Records Act.
       However, there are limitations that protect your personal
       information from inclusion with public records.
     * E-mail is considered a communication tool; any data you send via
       e-mail is not secured or encrypted by EDD. If you fill out a survey
       or send the Department an e-mail message, your e-mail address and
       the information submitted will be collected and may be provided to
       other State agencies to better serve your needs. Do not send any
       confidential or personal data via e-mail such as your social
       security number, account number, credit card number, or other data
       that could be compromised.
     * You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your user
       ID, password, and PIN. If you give your user ID, password, or PIN
       to anyone else, they will be able to access your confidential
       information. Contact EDD immediately at (916) 654-6231 if you
       believe your account is being accessed without your authorization.
     * When you view information on this Web site, some non-confidential
       data may be collected, such as the time and date of access and
       where you went during your visit. The Web site may place and
       subsequently retrieve simple text files called "cookies," which
       identify you and your computer to our Internet site. Cookies do not
       contain personal or confidential information about you and will
       only be used to monitor activity on this Web site.
     * All personal information submitted to EDD will be secured against
       loss, damage, modification, unauthorized access, or disclosure as
       required by Federal and California Law, and the State
       Administrative Manual policy. Information voluntarily provided by
       you will be protected by the appropriate computer, network, and
       Internet technical security controls at the employee and
       departmental level to prevent unauthorized access. Some of these
       security controls are: password and user identification
       verification, data encryption, confidential transmissions, secure
       storage areas, and audit trails. The EDDs employees are educated
       regarding the requirements of working with confidential and
       personally identifiable information as well as the consequences of
       misuse.
     * The EDD will not sell or distribute your information to any
       non-governmental third party without your consent. The EDDs
       employees will only use personal information submitted by you on a
       need-to-know basis in order to provide information or services.
     * The EDD does not store or use personal information submitted by you
       any longer than necessary. If no longer required and in order to
       prevent unauthorized access or use of the data, your personally
       identifiable information is destroyed via purging, magnetic
       degaussing/erasing, shredding and/or other means of authorized
       confidential destruction. Regularly scheduled archiving, purging
       and proper disposal of records and information is a standard
       practice throughout the Department.
     * Information on this Web site is public domain and may be copied and
       used as permitted by law, with the exception of pictures and
       official symbols. While EDD attempts to maintain a high degree of
       accuracy, we will not be held liable for errors or omissions that
       may occur. If you notice an error or omission in your information,
       please contact the Department immediately at (916) 654-6231. If you
       visit another Web site using a link from EDDs Web site, you become
       subject to the privacy policy and conditions of that Web site. The
       EDD will not be held liable for information or practices observed
       by other Web sites that provide access links from this Web site.

   As a public agency, EDD understands the importance of maintaining your
   privacy and will make every attempt to maintain your trust and
   confidence regarding the collection and use of your personal
   information.

   This policy has been developed and is maintained in accordance with the
   Information Practices Act of 1977 (Title 1.8 [commencing with Section
   1798] of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code) and according to
   Sections 11015.5 and 11019.9 of the Government Code.
