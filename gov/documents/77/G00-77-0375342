   FNAL

   The Fermilab email gateway server, FNAL.FNAL.GOV was replaced on
   Thursday, May 25th, 2000. The new mail server actually consists of two
   identical systems. One main system and a hot spare. To take advantage
   of this please ensure your outgoing SMTP host on your servers as well
   as email client is set to smtp.fnal.gov.
   DO NOT USE fnal.fnal.gov

   Commandline finger no longer works. Users can check/modify their
   forwards and change their passwords by looking at the webpage:

   http://www-email.fnal.gov/mailserver

   Note: In the username box users must PUT their USERNAME NOT their
   username@fnal.gov

   Their INITIAL password corresponds to:
   your FNAL imap account password (if you have one)

   If not please contact the Fermilab Postmaster at postmaster@fnal.gov to
   get your password reset.
