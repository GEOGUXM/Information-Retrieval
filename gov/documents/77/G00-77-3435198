U.S. Education Department Grants Loan Relief to Military Personnel Called to
                                 Active Duty

      Also asks colleges and universities to refund tuition and charges

   To assist members of the military who have been reassigned or activated
   as a result of the recent terrorist attacks, the U.S. Department of
   Education today directed lenders and colleges and universities to
   provide them with relief from their student loan obligations.

   "The young men and women who serve our country have an enormous job to
   do in the coming months," said U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige.
   "The actions we are taking today will ease their financial burdens as
   they defend our country in these challenging times."

   Today's actions apply to members of the National Guard and the Ready
   Reserves of the Armed Forces who have been called to active duty. The
   department's guidance relates to student loans made under the Federal
   Family Education Loan, William D. Ford Loan, and Federal Perkins Loan
   programs.

   Under the department's guidance, lenders will automatically postpone
   the student loan payments of borrowers during the period of the
   borrower's active duty service. Borrowers with subsidized student loans
   will be eligible to have the federal government assume the interest
   payments on their loans while they are on military duty.

   For military personnel called to active duty whose loans are not yet in
   repayment because they are currently students, or have only recently
   left school and are therefore in a grace period, the department has
   directed lenders to hold their loans in their current deferment status.
   Borrowers will not be required to make payments to their lenders during
   the term of their military service, as well as for a reasonable amount
   of additional time for the borrower to resume enrollment in school. In
   addition, borrowers generally receive a 6 to 9 month grace period after
   leaving school, and the department's action ensures that these students
   will not lose the benefit of this grace period as a result of their
   service.

   In additional guidance, the department strongly encouraged colleges and
   universities to provide either a full refund of tuition and other
   institutional charges or comparable credit to students forced to
   withdraw from school to fulfill their military obligations. The
   department also urged schools to offer flexible re-enrollment options
   to these affected students and to other students who have been forced
   to withdraw from school as a result of the terrorist attacks.

   "Many people's families and livelihoods have been dramatically changed
   by recent events," Paige said, "and I hope the nation's colleges and
   universities will give people time and flexibility to return to their
   normal routines and activities, just as I hope they work with the
   department to help our military reservists make the transition to
   active duty."

   The department's actions also relax requirements that schools return
   federal financial aid to the government when a student aid recipient
   withdraws from school. As a result of today's actions, students who
   withdraw because they are called to active duty or have been affected
   by the military mobilization, as well as others who withdraw as a
   direct result of the terrorist attacks, will not be required to return
   financial aid funds they received for books and living expenses.

   Borrowers and their families who have questions about this or other
   guidance issued by the department should call 1-800-4FEDAID
   (1-800-433-3243) (TTY 800-730-8913).
