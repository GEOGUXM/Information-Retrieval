   Area Forecasts - FA (text)

   Each FA contains a regional synopsis, 12-hour geographic specific
   forecasts, and an 18-hour outlook for each geographic area. Forecast
   weather elements are sky condition, cloud height, mountain obscuration,
   visibility, weather and/or obstructions to visibility, strong surface
   winds (direction & speed), icing, freezing level, and mountain pass
   conditions. Hazards and flight precautions, including AIRMETs and
   SIGMETs, may be found in their respective geographic area. All times
   unless stated otherwise are Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) denoted by
   the suffix Z. UTC is commonly known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or
   Zulu time.

   For a translation of the contractions used in the FA, please visit the
   Contractions Glossary.

   The header for the FA follows the general form:

   iii(H or C) FA ddhhmm

   where iii is the area identifier (ANC - Anchorage, FAI - Fairbanks, JNU
   - Juneau), H or C designates sections of the FA, and ddhhmm is the
   date, hour, and time (UTC) of issuance. The ddhhmm format is used
   throughout the FA for times.

   The header is followed by the generic AIRMET code: TS IMPLY POSSIBLE
   SEV OR GREATER TURB SEV ICE LLWS AND IFR CONDS. NON MSL HEIGHTS NOTED
   BY AGL OR CEILING. This translates to thunderstorms imply possible
   severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low level wind shear, and
   instrument flight rules conditions. Non-mean sea level heights noted by
   above ground level or ceiling. All heights in the FA are taken from
   mean sea level unless stated otherwise.

   AIRMETs designate conditions that are detrimental to small crafts:
   large area moderate turbulence, icing, instrument flight rules
   (ceilings less that 1000 ft and/or visibility less than 3 miles.
   SIGMETS warn all aircraft of severe-extreme icing, severe-extreme
   turbulence, and volcanic activity.

   Geographical Coverage

   Although the AAWU provides state-wide coverage of Area Forecasts, FA's
   are organized by geographical divisions The FA for southeast Alaska
   (Juneau - the panhandle) extends from the Eastern Gulf Coast through
   the Southeast Panhandle. The FA for the northern half (Fairbanks) of
   the mainland extends south to the Alaska Range, north to the Coastal
   Arctic Slope, and west to St. Lawrence Island, including Norton and
   Kotzebue Sounds. The FA for south central Alaska extends north to the
   Alaska Range, south to the Central Gulf Coast, west to Adak, east to
   the Copper River Basin.

   AAWU Graphic Products

   Graphic products present synoptic scale information for the entire
   state of Alaska. Images present information found in text forecasts in
   a graphical overview form. Images are meant to complement -- not
   replace -- the text FA. For an index of the symbols used on the Graphic
   Products, please visit the Symbols Glossary.

   The first suite of AAWU graphics are the four sets of maps that
   complement the FA. Please note the valid time on the header of these
   maps. They are for the specific time mentioned and are not meant to
   cover the entire valid time of the text FA. These maps are:
     * Surface Map showing pressure systems, fronts and precipitation.
     * Turbulence Map showing areas, heights and intensity of turbulence.
     * Icing Map showing areas, heights and intensity of icing as well as
       freezing levels.
     * IFR/MVFR Area Map showing areas of IFR/MVFR conditions, strong
       surface winds (> 30kts) and thunderstorm activity.

   Issuance Times For the FA Graphics
UTC    0900    1500    2100    0300
ADT    0100    0700    1300    1900

UTC    1000    1600    2200    0400
AST    0100    0700    1300    1900

   The second suite of charts are the Significant Weather Charts, which
   are valid at either 24 or 36 hours from the current model run (either
   00Z or 12Z). Again, please note the valid time on each map. These
   charts contain the following information:
     * Areas of IFR/MVFR conditions.
     * Areas of moderate or greater turbulence from the surface to 25,000
       feet.
     * Freezing levels.

   Issuance Times For the Significant Weather Charts
UTC    1700    0600
ADT    0900    2100

UTC    1800    0700
