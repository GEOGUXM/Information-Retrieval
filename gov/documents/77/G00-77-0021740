   ABOUT THE COINS

   The United States Capitol. For the People -- By the People

   Celebrate the first meeting of Congress in the U.S. Capitol and be part
   of history in the making by helping build the first ever Visitor Center
   for the U.S. Capitol. Congress has authorized three commemorative coins
   to celebrate the bicentennial of the first meeting of Congress at the
   U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. A portion of the proceeds
   from the sale of each coin -- $35 for gold, $10 for silver, $3 for clad
   -- is authorized to be paid to the Capitol Preservation Fund for the
   purpose of aiding the construction, maintenance, and preservation of a
   new Capitol Visitor Center. The Visitor Center will offer modern
   facilities, free educational movies and exhibits, and will eliminate
   long waits outside.

   The gold five-dollar coin is the design of Elizabeth Jones, the only
   woman to hold the position of U.S. Mint Chief Sculptor/Engraver. The
   obverse of this coin includes an intricate carving of a single
   Corinthian column, the type found on the Capitol building. The coins
   reverse is adorned with an image of the original structure, beautifully
   portraying the edifice where the first congressional session was held
   in the U.S. Capitol.

   The silver dollar obverse is a creation of artist Marika Somogy. The
   obverse portrays the original U.S. Capitol superimposed on the image of
   todays Capitol building. The contrasting images illustrate how we have
   grown as a nation. The reverse is the design of Mint sculptor/engraver
   John Mercanti and portrays a bald eagle cloaked in a banner inscribed
   U.S. Capitol Visitor Center.

   Dean McMullen designed the clad half-dollar obverse. It features the
   original U.S. Capitol building within an outline of the present day
   Capitol. The reverse is a combination of designs by artists Marcel
   Jovine and Alex Shagin. It portrays 16 stars and the inscription 32
   SENATORS; 106 HOUSE MEMBERS. The stars represent the number of states
   and the inscriptions reflects number of members in the 6th Congress-the
   first Congress to meet in the new Capitol in 1800.
