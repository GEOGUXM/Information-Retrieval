   How to Arrange Sponsorship and Continuing Education Credits for Educational
   Activities at IHS, Urban, and Tribal Facilities:

      The Clinical Support Center is accredited by the Accreditation Council
      for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the American Nurses
      Credentialing Center (ANCC) Commission on Accreditation, and the
      American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE) to sponsor
      continuing education activities at IHS, urban, and tribal facilities
      throughout the country. Sponsorship of a continuing education (CE)
      activity allows us to award CE credits to physicians, nurses,
      pharmacists, and physician assistants who participate in the activity.

      Continuing education planners representing IHS, urban Indian, or tribal
      facilities or programs (except when the tribal employee works for a
      tribe that has taken their tribal share of the CSC budget; tribes that
      have taken shares through Title 1 or 3 of P.L. 93-638 will need to
      negotiate a return of funds to CSC) can arrange sponsorship and
      continuing education (CE) credits by contacting us early in the
      planning process, when planning first begins. When we agree to serve as
      the sponsor, we extend our commitment to help with all aspects of
      planning, implementation, and evaluation. We offer this assistance to
      make the planning process as easy as possible for the CE coordinator,
      to ensure that all of the requirements of the national accrediting
      organizations are met, and to guarantee the participants the best
      educational experience possible.

      continuing education activities, see Sponsorship, or contact us at:

   Two Unique Educational Opportunities:

      There are two training activities available to employees of IHS,
      tribal, and urban Indian programs from the Clinical Support Center that
      we wish to call to your attention.
        * The IHS Pharmacy Practice Training Program (PPTP) is designed to
          improve pharmacists' abilities in the areas of communication,
          patient education and consultation, interviewing, health record
          screening, laboratory test interpretation, physical assessment and
          conflict resolution. These techniques are taught using a case study
          format that includes role playing and practice. Upon completion of
          the training, pharmacists have gained an understanding of the
          philosophy of pharmacy practice in the IHS, awareness of IHS
          standards of practice, increased sensitivity to cultural issues
          unique to Indian health programs, and new clinical knowledge.
        * The IHS Mid-level Primary Care Provider conference is available
          once a year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
          pharmacist practitioners, and nurse midwives who work for Indian
          health programs. Topics are selected based upon the needs of the
          participants and what's important in IHS clinical practice, with a
          focus on common ambulatory problems.

   Dental Assisting Education:

      The purpose of Dental Assisting Education is to increase the dental
      clinic's capacity to provide on-site, basic and continuing education
      for dental assistants. This is accomplished by advocating for and
      supporting the growth and development of dental assistants working in
      Indian Health Service, tribal, and urban Indian program settings.

      The following services are provided by the CSC Dental Component:
        * Adult Learning for Dental Assistants. This course is designed for
          dental assistants who are or will be serving as trainers of other
          dental assistants. It introduces the concepts of adult learning and
          interactive training. Participants will: 1) have an opportunity to
          develop practical teaching applications, and 2) be able to design
          training and improve their teaching skills. All IHS, tribal, or
          urban Indian program dental assistants who currently provide
          training are eligible to attend; enrollment is limited to 15
          participants.
        * Basic Management Skills Training Course for Lead or Supervisor
          Dental Assistants. This course is designed to give attendees the
          skills necessary to be effective managers in the dental clinic
          setting. Participants will: 1) assess learning styles, 2) improve
          communication skills, and 3) learn how to use policies and
          procedures. Participants can expect pre-course communication and
          assignments. All IHS, tribal, and urban Indian program dental
          assistants with at least one year experience as a supervisor/lead
          are eligible to attend; enrollment is limited to 12 participants.
        * Advanced Management Skills Training Course for Lead or Supervisor
          Dental Assistants. This course is a continuation of the basic
          course. Participants will: 1) analyze their leadership style and
          see how it affects the people they supervise, 2) design a plan for
          delegation of duties, and 3) learn how to examine employee
          performance evaluation methods. Participants can expect pre-course
          communication and assignments. All IHS, tribal, or urban Indian
          program dental assistants who have completed the basic course are
          eligible to attend; enrollment is limited to 15.

   Meeting Support:

      The Clinical Support Center can provide support for meetings large and
      small. Conference site selection, audiovisual equipment procurement and
      setup, hotel arrangements, travel processing, clerical support, and CE
      sponsorship are a few of the services available from the CSC. There is
      usually a fee for these services.

       edwards.hooper@phx.ihs.gov.

   Risk Management Series:

      There are eleven modules in this continuing education series available
      for use by IHS, urban Indian, and tribal program health care
      professionals. Each module has been awarded 1.5 hours of CE credit for
      physicians and nurses (physician assistants may claim AMA Category 1
      credit). The modules are designed to be used in a group discussion
      format and require a staff member to coordinate the activity (i.e.,
      schedule and announce a date, time, and place for the activity;
      duplicate and distribute handouts and evaluation forms; take
      attendance; collect evaluations from participants; and lead a
      discussion of the subject matter presented).

      Each module contains several interesting case studies, background
      information to prepare the discussion leader for his/her role,
      suggestions about how to lead the discussion group, handouts and
      evaluation materials to be duplicated for the participants, and a
      sign-in sheet. Goals and objectives are included so that the
      participants know what to expect from the module.

      The modules are best used in sequence. To participate, the staff member
      who will function as the discussion leader should contact the CSC to
      request Module #1. It is not necessary to arrange sponsorship or
      continuing education credit since this activity is already sponsored by
      CSC as an enduring continuing education activity.

      When the discussion leader submits the attendance list and evaluation
      forms, CSC will distribute continuing education certificates to all
      participants.

       carol.anderson@phx.ihs.gov.

   NCME Videotapes

      Videotapes produced by the Network for Continuing Medical Education
      (NCME) are available for loan to Indian health program health care
      professionals. These tapes offer physicians Category 1 or Category 2
      credit toward the AMA Physician's Recognition Award. These CME credits
      can be earned by viewing the tape(s) and submitting the appropriate
      documentation directly to the accredited sponsor, the NCME. A new
      videotape is received in our office every other week and titles are
      listed regularly in The IHS Primary Care Provider. This service is
      available only to Indian Health Service, tribal, or urban Indian
      program employees.
