   [left_tip.gif] Alternative Measure Descriptions and Maps
                                                            [right_tip.gif]

   All interested parties are invited to participate in the plan
   formulation process.

   These are draft materials for public review and comment.  The attached
   text documents describe engineering measures under consideration for
   the restoration of the Barataria coastal ecosystem.  The accompanying
   maps correspond to the proposed areas for implementation of these
   measures.  Combinations of these measures will be the basis for the
   project plans.

   Heres how to participate:

   1              Download and print the measure description documents:
   Barrier Shoreline Restoration Alternative Measures (PDF 21 KB)
   Wetland Creation/Restoration Alternative Measures (PDF 36 KB)

   2             Click on one of the regional maps below to display either
   the Wetland Creation/Restoration or Barrier Shoreline Restoration
   component study area.  Clicking on area outlined in yellow  will
   display a close-up map of the area with measures delineated.  Be sure
   to visit all five maps for each component (10 total).

   3             Review the text documents and associated maps together.

   4              Please submit comments and suggestions to the Coast 2050
   study team.  In your comments, please consider the following questions:

   a.     Are any measures missing from any of these maps?  Please propose
   additional measures and locations.

   b.     Is there anything special that the study team needs to consider
   to implement these measures as drawn?

   .
   Please submit all questions, comments, or suggestions to the Coast 2050
   study team (coast2050info@dnr.state.la.us).  Alternatively, submit
   written comments to:
