                       Press Release of Senator Biden

           BIDEN TRAVELS TOMORROW TO AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN, INDIA

   Contact: Lynne Weil
   Monday, January 7, 2002

   Undertaking a multi-faceted trip to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India,
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will
   visit American troops and meet with top government and military leaders
   in the region.

   I want to see for myself what the dangers are to our men and women in
   uniform and the effectiveness of the multinational force working to
   assure that humanitarian aid is getting through, Biden said on the eve
   of his departure. I also want to emphasize to Afghanistans new
   President, Hamid Karzai, and Pakistans President, Pervaiz Musharraf,
   that our efforts wont be considered a success until we track down Osama
   bin Laden and Mullah Omar, and break up the al Qaeda network, no matter
   how long it takes. We expect their full cooperation.

   In Afghanistan, Biden also is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister
   Abdullah Abdullah, Defense Minister Mohammed Fahim, Deputy Defense
   Minister Rashid Dostum and Sima Samar, Minister for Womens Affairs. In
   India, Biden is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Atal Bihari
   Vajpayee and other key government leaders.

   Weve made major strides in the fight against terrrorism since September
   11, but there are more questions than answers at this point, Biden
   said. First, I want to know if the leadership in the nations of the
   region are really committed to working with us, especially to pursue
   bin Laden and Omar? Will the Presidents plan to invest billions of
   dollars to reconstruct Afghanistan help ensure that terrorists no
   longer will be tolerated there? Will women be given their rights, as
   they had prior to 1973 when the King was overthrown, to have a real
   education and take their rightful place in that society? Are the
   various tribal leaders committed to a united Afghanistan? How can the
   U.S. use its influence in Islamabad and New Dehli to calm an incredibly
   dangerous situation between two nuclear adversaries? Is President
   Musharraf genuinely committed to fulfilling his pledge to hold
   elections and moving Pakistan toward democracy? These are just a few of
   the questions I want answered.

   Biden will visit Kabul, Lahore, Islamabad and New Delhi January 8-18.

   As we celebrate Afghanistans liberation, we must show the people that
   we stand with them through what surely will be a long period of
   reconstruction, Biden said. And the current situation between India and
   Pakistan must be carefully managed. There is no better way to know what
   each side needs than to listen to them closely, and to speak with them
   frankly.
