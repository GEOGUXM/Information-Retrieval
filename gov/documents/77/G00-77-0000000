                             STARDUST Technology

   The Stardust Spacecraft is fortunate to be able to incorporate many
   spaceflight proven technologies, in its design. Virtually all of the
   technologies used to create the spacecraft were either already
   operating in space or were flight qualified for spaceflight before
   Stardust took advantage of them. Using these existing resources reduced
   the cost of production and improved the overall quality of the results.
   Advanced technologies used included polymer composite components and
   structural subassemblies and electronics systems.

   The Stardust mission spacecraft is derived from the SpaceProbe deep
   space bus developed by Lockheed Martin Astronautics. This lightweight
   design incorporates silicon solar cell arrays that convert sunlight
   into electricity to power spacecraft systems.

   The total weight of the spacecraft including the propellant needed for
   deep space maneuvers is 380 kilograms. The overall length of the main
   bus is roughly 5 feet (1.7 meters), about the size of an average office
   desk.
