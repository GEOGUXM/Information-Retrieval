   Pursuant to Government Code Section 11019.9, all departments and
   agencies of the State of California shall enact and maintain a
   permanent privacy policy, in adherence with the Information Practices
   Act of 1977 (Civil Code Section 1798 et seq.), that includes, but not
   necessarily limited to, the following principles:

   (a) Personally identifiable information may only be obtained through
   lawful means.
   (b) The purposes for which personally identifiable data are collected
   shall be specified at or prior to the time of collection, and any
   subsequent use of the data shall be limited to and consistent with the
   fulfillment of those purposes previously specified.
   (c) Personal data may not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise
   used for a purpose other than those specified, except with the consent
   of the subject of the data, or as required by law or regulation.
   (d) Personal data collected shall be relevant to the purpose for which
   it is needed.
   (e) The general means by which personal data is protected against loss,
   unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure shall be posted,
   unless the disclosure of those general means would compromise
   legitimate agency objectives or law enforcement purposes.
   Each department shall implement this privacy policy by:

   1) Designating which position within the department or agency is
   responsible for the implementation of and adherence to this privacy
   policy;
   2) Prominently posting the policy physically in its offices and on its
   Internet website, if any;
   3) Distributing the policy to each of its employees and contractors who
   have access to personal data;
   4) Complying with the Information Practices Act (Civil Code Section
   1798 et seq.), the Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250 et
   seq.), Government Code Section 11015.5, and all other laws pertaining
   to information privacy, and
