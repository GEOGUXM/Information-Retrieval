      Note: For each license application type, three or more forms are
    required. We've prepared a list of the forms by application type, so
                   you can make sure you've got them all.

     OREA's pdf forms now have fields into which you can enter your data
   using the free Adobe Acrobat Reader. This form can then be printed, but
    the data is not saved when the document is closed unless you have the
           full Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Business Tools software.

                                    Note:
       Effective January 1, 2000, the term of a California real estate
   appraiser license is two (2) years, instead of four (4) years. Although
     the license must be renewed every two years, proof of completion of
      continuing education will only be required once every four years.
