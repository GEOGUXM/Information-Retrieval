   Ultrasensitive trace-isotope analysis has been an important tool in
   modern science. Two well developed methods, Low-Level Counting (LLC)
   and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), have been used for
   archaeological dating, medical diagnostic procedures, and for studying
   the transport processes in the ocean, atmosphere, and groundwater. They
   also have applications in physics, such as studying cosmic rays and
   detecting solar neutrinos. We have recently developed a widely
   applicable method, Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) [1], and
   demonstrated its feasibility by analyzing two rare isotopes in a
   natural krypton sample at the parts-per-trillion level. ATTA can
   enhance the capability and expand the applications of ultrasensitive
   trace-isotope analysis.

   ^85Kr has a half-life of 10.8 years and an isotope abundance of ~10^-11
   in the atmosphere, while ^81Kr has a half-life of 2.3 x 10^5 years and
   an abundance of 6 x 10^-13. The present-day ^85Kr in the environment
   has been released primarily by nuclear-fuel reprocessing plants. It has
   been used as a general-purpose tracer to study air and ocean currents,
   date shallow groundwater, and monitor nuclear-fuel reprocessing
   activities. In contrast, ^81Kr is produced in the upper atmosphere by
   cosmic-ray induced reactions and is shielded from man-made fission
   products by stable ^81Br. ^81Kr is an ideal tracer for dating ancient
   groundwater and ice on the time scale of 10^5-10^6 years. A method of
   counting ^81Kr atoms would also make possible a solar neutrino detector
   that is sensitive to both ^7Be and ^8B neutrinos from the sun.

   Existing Methods

   LLC [2] has generally been used to measure the abundance of an isotope
   by counting its nuclear decays. It is currently used to count ^85Kr.
   Although once used to count ^81Kr, this is no longer possible because
   of the high present-day decay background of ^85Kr. Taking a different
   approach, AMS [3] counts atoms instead of decays, thereby greatly
   enhancing the detection efficiency and avoiding the radioactive
   background problem. AMS is now routinely used as the standard method of
   ^14C-dating. Recently, AMS has been used to count ^81Kr and date
   groundwater [4]. In this work, a large heavy-ion accelerator (K1200,
   MSU) was used to remove all of the electrons from the atoms so that
   ^81Kr can be separated from its abundant isobar ^81Br.

   Source; (b) Skimmer; (c) Transverse Cooling; (d) Zeeman Slower; (e)
   Trap; (f) Photon Detector; (g) Balance Coil.). In this work, a krypton
   gas sample is injected into the system through a nozzle, around which a
   DC discharge is maintained. The discharge excite a fraction of the
   atoms into the 5s[^3/[2]][2] metastable level so that the atoms can be
   manipulated by laser light at the convenient wavelength of 811nm.
   Two-dimensional transverse cooling is used to reduce the atomic beam
   divergence and amplify the atom flux in the forward direction. The
   thermal (300Â°C) atoms are then decelerated with the Zeeman slowing
   technique, and loaded into a magneto-optical trap. A photo-diode
   viewing the trap region detects the fluorescence of and count the
   trapped atoms.

   Atom Trap Trace Analysis

   A laser-based technique is attractive because it is simple, small and
   inexpensive. ATTA is based on techniques of laser manipulation of
   neutral atoms. In our system(see figure 2), individual krypton atoms
   are trapped by laser light inside a vacuum chamber and detected by
   viewing their fluorescence. An atom typically spends 0.1 second in the
   trap and scatters one million photons. The sensitivity of the
   fluorescence detector is such that a single trapped atom provides a
   signal-to-noise ratio of 50 (see figure 3).

   departure of individual ^83Kr atoms; (b) Signal of a single trapped
   ^81Kr atom.

   For isotope separation, ATTA relies on the fact that different types of
   atoms and molecules have different resonant frequencies. Even different
   isotopes of the same element differ due to the so-called isotope
   shifts. The atom trap is a wonderful isotope separator because it only
   traps atoms of a particular isotope when the laser frequency is tuned
   to its resonance position (see figure 4).

   signal is 3 hours(0.5 hours).

   Applications

   While the demonstration has been focused on krypton isotopes, ATTA can
   be applied to many other trace-isotopes for a wide range of potential
   applications including measuring solar neutrino flux, searching for
   exotic particles, tracing atmospheric and oceanic currents,
   archeological and geological dating, monitoring bone-loss rates in the
   diagnosis of osteoporosis, and monitoring fission products in the
   environment for safe-guarding nuclear wastes.
