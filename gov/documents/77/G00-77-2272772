Resource Materials and Research Activities

   Determining the safety of genetically engineered products, preventing
   foodborne illness, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
   innovative drugs and other health therapies are all part of FDA's
   mission to protect and promote the health of the American people.
   Fundamental to fulfilling these and many other responsibilities, is an
   Agency built on a base of strong science.

   The reference materials, background information, and research projects
   listed here are the basis, and sometimes the results, of scientific
   endeavors at FDA.
