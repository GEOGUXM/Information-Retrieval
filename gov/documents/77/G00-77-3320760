   This "smoothed" graph removes the seasonal trends in the Clear (and
   N^*) and Cloudy TOVS soundings, by plotting the global annual average
   standard deviation. The most important feature is that the trended
   global average annual standard deviation has decreased for both Clear
   (and N^*) and Cloudy soundings by 0.46 degrees K and 0.65 degrees K
   respectively. In addition, this graph displays the coefficient, system
   and science improvements that have been made to NESDIS' TOVS operation
   so as to provide a relative correlation with either Clear (and N^*) or
   Cloudy sounding accuracy improvements. It should be noted that while
   these trended accuracy statistics indicate a significant accuracy
   increase in the TOVS soundings at all levels they do not represent
   current accuracies for layers above or below the 500-700 mb layer. The
   advent of improved graphics capabilities (EDGE), in 1992, made possible
   the accelerated rate of implemented operational improvements during the
   following years. It is anticipated that the operational implementation
   of both the Revised TOVS (RTOVS) system in early 1998 as well as the
   Advanced TOVS (ATOVS) for NOAA-K will provide further improvements to
   these trended accuracy statistics.
