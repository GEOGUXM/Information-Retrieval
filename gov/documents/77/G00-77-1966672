        A critical role of the Council is to serve as a neutral forum for
        the identification of system issues and barriers and to explore and
        analyze possible solutions. A variety of methods of electronic
        information gathering are being explored for future development in
        this section, including on-line surveys, interactive
        structured-topic on-line trainings, on-line question and answer
        sessions, etc. Watch this site for future opportunities to comment
        on issues facing the Council and Californians with developmental
        disabilities.
