                          Sen. Baucus Press Release

                 BUSH SIGNS BAUCUS RAILROAD RETIREMENT BILL

    Senators Measure Will Increase Benefits for Railroad Workers, Widows

                              December 20, 2001

   WASHINGTON, D.C.) U.S. Senator Max Baucus today praised President Bush
   for signing his bill that will improve retirement benefits for more
   than 10,000 railroad employees and retirees in Montana. Bush signed the
   Railroad Retirement and Improvement act into law Thursday. As chairman
   of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus wrote and cosponsored the bill
   with Republican Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and then pushed it through
   Congress. "I applaud President Bush for signing this important bill
   into law," Baucus said. "This bill has been a long time in coming, but
   now we're going to provide rail workers and their families with the
   retirement benefits they deserve. This is right for Montana and the
   country." "We're glad to see this bill pass," said Glendive's Pat
   Mischel, a member of the United Transportation Union and the
   Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. "I want to thank Max for his
   leadership on this bill. It wouldn't have passed without his hard work.
   This bill went from not being heard on the Senate floor last year to
   passing this year. That's a big difference. Max worked in a bipartisan
   way with the House and Senate. "This bill will put more young people to
   work in a good-paying job, and it will also provide increased benefits
   to the people who have paid into [the Railroad Retirement Fund],"
   Mischel added. Baucus said his bill will provide increased retirement
   benefits to the 10,000 rail employees and retirement program
   beneficiaries in Montana, increase benefits for spouses of deceased
   rail workers, reduce the retirement age for workers with 30 years of
   service from age 62 to 60, and cut in half the time needed to vest in
   the program, from 10 to five years. The Baucus-Hatch bill also will
   allow for investment of railroad retirement assets in a diversified
   portfolio of investments. "This legislation represents a historic
   agreement between rail management and rail labor," Baucus said. "It
   will modernize the financing of the retirement system and will provide
   increased benefits to retirees and their dependents. The current system
   is inadequate." Baucus said his bill will correct a longstanding
   inequity in the current way retirement benefits are calculated for
   widows and widowers of rail employees. Currently, while still living,
   rail employees receive a 145 percent retirement benefit 100 percent for
   themselves and 45 percent for their spouse. But when a rail worker
   dies, his or her spouse only receives 50 percent of the rail employee's
   benefit. Baucus's bill will guarantee the spouse 100 percent of the
   rail employee's benefit. Baucus noted that each month, about 700 new
   widows and widowers across the nation an average of one an hour --
   begin receiving Railroad Retirement survivor benefits. "These new
   widows and widowers often find that on the death of a spouse, their
   Railroad Retirement benefits are dramatically reduced," Baucus said in
   a statement before the Senate. "They find that they have not only lost
   a spouse, but they have lost the ability to maintain even a modest
   lifestyle. "It's just not fair that wives and husbands of rail workers
   see their monthly checks so drastically reduced," Baucus said. "Our
   bill gets rid of this inequity, and provide spouses with full benefits.
   This bill is long overdue." The Baucus-Hatch bill received wide support
   on Capitol Hill, from both Democrats and Republicans, with 75 senators
   co-sponsoring the Senate measure. "On behalf of the 10,000 active and
   retired rail workers in Montana, I want to thank Senator Baucus for
   making the Railroad Retirement Improvement Act a reality," said Fran
   Marceau, Montana legislative director of the United Transportation
   Union. "Without his determination this bill would not have been passed.
   This is a fantastic Christmas gift from Max to so many needy widows in
   our state." Baucus said, "This bill has wide support because it's the
   right thing to do for America and Montana. Folks who work in the rail
   industry and their families deserve to be treated fairly." In a speech
   before the Senate, Baucus said the federal Railroad Retirement system
   has served railroaders, their families, and their surviving spouses for
   65 years, with roots that reach back to the 1930s and the struggle to
   find answers to the hardships that resulted from the Great Depression.
   The program currently provides benefit payments to more than 673,000
   retirees and other beneficiaries across the country. But inequities
   exist. And Baucus said it's time to revamp the program. The main
   components of the Baucus-Hatch bill include: Improving benefits for
   widows and widowers. The bill provides 100 percent benefits for the
   spouses of deceased rail workers, compared to the current benefit level
   of 50 percent. Lowering the minimum retirement age at which employees
   with 30 years of service are eligible for full retirement benefits to
   60 from 62. This would return the age at which a railroad employee can
   retire with full benefits to what it was prior to 1984. Lowering the
   vesting requirement for employees from 10 to 5 years. This aligns
   Railroad Retirement with current private industry pension practices.
   Improving the investment returns of the Railroad Retirement Account.
   Currently, the taxes collected in the Railroad Retirement Account can
   only be invested in U.S. government securities.
