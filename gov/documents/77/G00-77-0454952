          + To make the observations through which changes in the physical
            and chemical state of the stratsphere can be determined and
            understood. In particular, to make the earliest, possible
            identification of changes in the ozone layer and to discern
            the cause of the changes.
          + To provide an independent calibration of satellite sensors of
            the atmosphere.
          + To obtain the data that can be used to test and improve
            multi-dimensional stratospheric chemical and dynamical models.
