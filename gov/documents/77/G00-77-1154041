      Add a link to www.americorps.org from your website.
      Our new website allows prospective AmeriCorps members to check out
      thousands of service opportunities online. And our custom-search
      feature makes it easier than ever for people to match their interests,
      skills, and preferences with the program and location that's right for
      them.
      Potential members now can apply directly online and electronically
      submit their application to their program(s) of choice nationwide, or
      in their hometown. Matching members with projects once took months -
      now it only takes days.
