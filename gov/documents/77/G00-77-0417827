ACTS Extension Workshop

   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced
   willingness to extend operations of the Advanced Communications
   Technology Satellite (ACTS) for education and research purposes to an
   education-based consortium. The spacecraft is permanently retired
   on-orbit at 105.2 degrees West longitude, but further use of its
   payload is feasible since it has been estimated that 2 to 4 years of
   fuel remains onboard to support attitude control adjustment.

   A one-day workshop was held on October 24, 2000 at the Ohio Aerospace
   Institute to discuss and share information about this opportunity. View
   the workshop presentations below.

   For additional information about this opportunity, please contact
   NASA's ACTS Project Manager Robert Bauer at 216-433-3431. For
   information about University Consortium development, please see the
   Ohio Consortium for Advanced Communications Technology web site.
