       Gifts from Foreign Entities: Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act

   [grad_blu.gif]

   Under 5 U.S.C. 7342, an employee may not accept a gift exceeding $260
   in value from a foreign government or an international organization. A
   prohibited gift includes travel expenses exceeding $260 in value unless
   the travel takes place entirely outside the United States. This
   statutory restriction extends to the spouse and dependents of the
   employee. The law does allow the employee to accept gifts valued at
   $260 or less, which is considered the minimal value.

   A tangible gift of more than minimal value may be accepted on behalf of
   the agency. The Federal Government may accept, under applicable agency
   gift acceptance authorities, travel and related expenses from a foreign
   government in connection with travel by an employee as official duty
   (e.g.,  31 U.S.C. 1353, Sponsored Travel via the HHS-348 mechanism).

   In the HHS General Administration Manual Chapter 20-25, Foreign Gifts
   and Decorations, the section on Gifts of Minimal Value, states that
   with specific exceptions,
   "an employee may not accept a gift of more than minimal value unless it
       appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or
       embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations
       of the United States. If an employee accepts a tangible gift of
       more than minimal value, such a gift is deemed to have been
       accepted on behalf of the United States and, upon acceptance,
       becomes the property of the United States."

   Procedures for appropriate disposition of such gifts are also included.

   See also the Digest of Foreign Activity Ethics Provisions prepared by
   the Office of the General Counsel, Ethics Division, for a discussion of
   the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and Foreign Agent
   Prohibition.
