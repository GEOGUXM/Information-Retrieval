              The agreement in 1987 between CNES and NASA to join resources and
              expertise on the TOPEX/Poseidon Project culminated 20 years of
              development into using a spaceborne radar altimeter to measure
              ocean-surface topography.

              TOPEX/Poseidon launch image TOPEX/Poseidon was launched August 10, 1992
              from the ESA launch facility at Kourou, French Guiana, aboard an Ariane
              42P launch vehicle. Nearly nine years later TOPEX/Poseidon data has
              revolutionized the way the global ocean is studied. For the first time,
              the seasonal cycle and other temporal variabilities of the ocean have
              been determined globally with high accuracy, yielding fundamentally
              important information for testing ocean circulation models. Major
              observations were made using TOPEX/Poseidon data on
                * Oceanic circulation including details on the movement of Rossby and
              Kelvin waves
                * Oceanic and coastal tides
                El Niño, La Niña, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
                El Niño-like circulation in the Atlantic Ocean
                Oceanic seasons in the Mediterranean
                Ocean floor topography from surface data used to refine the geoid
              model

              Recognizing the importance of continuing ocean-surface topography
              measurement, NASA and CNES approved Jason-1 as a joint follow-on to
              TOPEX/Poseidon Nine years of scientific discovery by TOPEX/Poseidon
              have broadened its original list of science objectives.
