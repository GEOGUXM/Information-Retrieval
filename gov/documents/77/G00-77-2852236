                              List of Protocols

   Our group has focused on the preparation of various tissues for
   microdissection (MD) and subsequent molecular analysis. Below are
   specific protocols we have successfully utilized in our lab.
   Investigators may apply these methods to tissue types other than
   prostate and to both microdissected and non-microdissected samples, but
   they must be aware that:
     * They will need to tailor each protocol for their own research
       objectives and tissue under study.
     * Molecular Profiling (MP) is a rapidly developing field and they
       must keep abreast of the research as alternative protocols are
       being developed by other groups.
