   One of the most challenging problems in managing large networked
   systems is the complexity of security administration. Today, security
   administration is costly and prone to error because administrators
   usually specify access control lists for each user on the system
   individually. Role based access control (RBAC) is a technology that is
   attracting increasing attention, particularly for commercial
   applications, because of its potential for reducing the complexity and
   cost of security administration in large networked applications.

   With RBAC, security is managed at a level that corresponds closely to
   the organization's structure. Each user is assigned one or more roles,
   and each role is assigned one or more privileges that are permitted to
   users in that role. Security administration with RBAC consists of
   determining the operations that must be executed by persons in
   particular jobs, and assigning employees to the proper roles.
   Complexities introduced by mutually exclusive roles or role hierarchies
   are handled by the RBAC software, making security administration
   easier.
