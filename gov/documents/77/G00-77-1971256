   Flight-related Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) -
          "Economy Class Syndrome" (posted 7/1/01)
          ____________________________________________

           ILLNESS:  There is increasing evidence that immobilization in
          airline seats for long flights puts people at risk for deep vein
           thrombosis (DVT).  DVT, blood clots inside veins found deep in
           extremities or body cavities, is a common disorder.  A venous
          thrombus is a clump of blood cells, platelets, and fibrin (clot)
           which attaches to the inside walls of veins, can grow in size,
           and break off to travel downstream from the clot.  If the clot
          stays localized, it can cause swelling and vein irritation.  If
           part of it breaks off, then it can cause blockage downstream,
             may travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolus) and result in
          serious illness or even death.  In some circumstances, deep vein
          thrombosis may also contribute to other serious medical problems
                          such as heart attack and stroke.

             SYMPTOMS:  While superficial venous thrombosis usually is
           accompanied by redness and tenderness along the course of the
          involved vein, deep venous thrombosis may not be accompanied by
             any symptoms at all.  Symptoms of DVT, if present, usually
          include swelling of the involved extremity with local tenderness
          deep within the muscles in the area.  If the DVT occurs in veins
          such as those in the pelvis there may be no symptoms.  In these
            cases the first sign of DVT may be one of the complications
               mentioned above such as pulmonary embolus.  Therefore,
          preventing DVT is key to saving injuries and lives.  Prevention
           is especially important since DVT during long flights may not
                         allow early medical intervention.

           SUSCEPTIBILITY: Over 40 y.o. and risk increases with age.  DVT
                       occurs more common in women, than men.
            External Risk Factors: Immobilization (bed rest, long trips,
           etc.); Smoking; Cramped seating in some new aircraft; Obesity;
          Recent Trauma from an accident or surgery (especially to legs);
           Decreased Oxygen; Oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement
           Medical Risk Factors:     Previous DVT; History of malignancy;
            Recent surgery; History of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (this
               disorder is associated with higher risk of DVT); Oral
                       contraceptives or hormonal replacement
          Familial/Hereditary Risk Factors:  Occurrence of DVT, especially
                                    under age 35

          The risks are not simply additive, and the risk of DVT can more
                          than double with 2 risk factors.

                           PREVENTION / RECOMMENDATIONS:
                                1.     During Travel
                     * Stand up and walk around at least hourly
            * Exercise your calf muscles by going up on tiptoes several
                                times while standing
          * Drink adequate fluids - at least 1 liter per 5 hours of flight
          * Avoid alcohol as it increases the stickiness of platelets and
                                promotes fluid loss
          * Avoid crossing legs or prolonged awkward hip or knee positions
                                  whenever seated
                    * Wear loose fitting clothing when traveling
                                 2.    Stop Smoking
                                 3.     Lose Weight
          4.     Discuss with your doctor family and personal history that
          might pre-dispose you to Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and increase
                              your risk during travel.
           * Discuss whether folic acid may be helpful you in preventing
                                        DVT.
           * Discuss whether therapeutic compression stocking, and/or an
              anticoagulant would be helpful to you in preventing DVT
          5.     The effectiveness of aspirin as a preventive measure for
                                DVT is controversial
                       6.     Elevate your legs when possible
