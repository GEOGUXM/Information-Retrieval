   The United States Probation Office, Middle District of Florida, is
   proud to present FedFacts - The Real Deal.  This program is unique to
   our district as it was created to fill the void left by traditional
   community drug education programs that often do not include federal
   drug penalty information. Our staff believes it is imperative for young
   adults and their parents to be aware of federal drug penalties and
   prosecution.   A growing number of federal drug offenders are between
   the ages of 18 - 25; therefore, our program's information is valuable
   to society's youth and could make a difference in their lives as they
   make critical decisions that will have a life long effect.

   FedFacts - The Real Deal is suitable for many curriculums, including
   county school classrooms, private organizations, juvenile detention
   centers, private schools, and community centers.

                                Program Goals

       [star_bullet.gif]  Establish a great working relationship between
