          Stream gage levels in Idaho, relative to 30 year average.



                 Explanation
   [color code for] New record high for day
   [color code for] > 90th percentile
   [color code for] 75th - 89th percentile
   [color code for] 25th - 74th percentile
   [color code for] 10th - 24th percentile
   [color code for] < 10th percentile
   [color code for] New record low for day
   [color code for] Not ranked

   The colored dots on this map depict streamflow conditions as a
   percentile, which is computed from the period of record for the current
   day of the year. Only stations with at least 30 years of record are
   used.

   The gray circles indicate other stations that were not ranked in
   percentiles either because they have fewer than 30 years of record or
   because they report parameters other than streamflow. Some stations,
   for example, measure stage only.

   Statewide Streamflow Table

      Real-time data typically are recorded at 15-60 minute intervals, stored
      onsite, and then transmitted to USGS offices every 1 to 4 hours,
      depending on the data relay technique used. Recording and transmission
      times may be more frequent during critical events. Data from real-time
      sites are relayed to USGS offices via satellite, telephone, and/or
   radio and are available for viewing within minutes of arrival. All
   real-time data are
   provisional and subject to revision.

   Build Table    Build a custom summary table for one or more stations.
   Build Sequence Build a custom sequence of graphical or tabular data for
                  one or more stations.
