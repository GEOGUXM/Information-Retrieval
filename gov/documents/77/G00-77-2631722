   What is the U.S. Department of Energy's definition of an alternative
   fuel?

   Alternative fuels are substantially non-petroleum and yield energy
   security and environmental benefits. DOE currently recognizes the
   following as alternative fuels: methanol and denatured ethanol as
   alcohol fuels (alcohol mixtures that contain no less than 70% of the
   alcohol fuel), natural gas (compressed or liquefied), liquefied
   petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal-derived liquid fuels, fuels derived from
   biological materials, and electricity (including solar energy). DOE can
   expand this list when new fuels are developed and approved as meeting
   this definition.

   What are the characteristics of the alternative fuels?

   What are the current battery technologies for electric vehicles and how
   do they differ?

   Lead Acid
   This is the most commonly used and least expensive technology.
   Generally, the vehicles have a range of less than 100 miles per charge,
   and the life of the battery is about three years. Chrysler, Ford, GM,
   and Toyota vehicles use this battery technology.

   Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
   NiMH offers a range of about 100 miles per charge, but has an increased
   cost. The life expectancy of the battery is about 100,000 miles.
   Chrysler, Ford (California only), General Motors, Honda, and Toyota
   offer vehicles with NiMH technology.

   Do alternative fuels offer any emissions benefits?

   Yes, all the alternative fuels reduce ozone-forming tailpipe emissions.
   The diagram below shows the percentage of combined carbon monoxide (CO)
   and nitrogen oxide NO[x] emissions for each alternative fuel as
   compared to reformulated gasoline (RFG). For example, the emissions
   from CNG vehicles are estimated to be 20%, compared to 100% emissions
   from vehicles using RFG. CNG vehicles demonstrate an 80% reduction in
   ozone-forming emissions.

   What is a GGE?

   A gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) is the volume of natural gas it
   takes to equal the energy content of one liquid gallon of gasoline.
   Since natural gas is not a liquid, its volume is measured in cubic feet
   (CF), rather than gallons. Therefore, the GGE is a way of comparing
   equivalent volumes of fuel based on their energy content in British
   Thermal Units (Btu). The GGE of CNG is 123 CF and this volume of CNG
   has the same energy content as one gallon of gasoline (based on 929
   BTU/CF of CNG and 114,264 Btu/gallon of gasoline). Since the other
   alternative fuels are liquids at room temperature, their Btu is based
   on the energy in one liquid gallon and there is no need for a
   conversion or GGE.

   What is the average price at the pump?

   Like gasoline and diesel, the price of alternative fuels fluctuates in
   accordance with outside factors, such as international economic changes
   and supply and demand. The accessibility of alternative fuels is
   regional, and geographic location can greatly affect the price at the
   pump. For example, propane is generally less expensive in southern
   states that have easy access to the Dixie pipeline; natural gas is more
   economical in urban areas; and ethanol producers tend to sell their
   fuel in the Midwest to cut down on fuel transportation costs. Since LPG
   and CNG are also used outside the transportation sector, it is
   difficult to isolate the price charged for vehicle refueling. More
   detailed information on the price of alternative fuels can be obtained
   through the fuel associations or the Energy Information Administration.

                more LNG
                     more LPG
                          less M85
                               less

   Are there incentives for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles?

   The federal government has income tax deductions, many states have
   incentives and some private companies offer rebates or discounts. Most
   of the incentives offset a percentage of the initial vehicle purchase
   cost. There are also federal and state laws that help ensure that the
   cost of alternative fuels remains competitive with gasoline. The
   incentives are listed by state at http://www.fleets.doe.gov.

   How safe are the alternative fuels?

   Most people are familiar with gasoline, so they rarely question its
   safety. However, people who are unaccustomed to alternative fuels may
   have misconceptions or doubts about their safety in vehicle
   applications. Some safety issues associated with the use of alternative
   fuels are outlined here.

   CNG
   The fuel is odorless, and odorants must be added to detect leaks and
   spills. In the event of a leak, the gas will rise to the ceiling and
   create a potential risk for enclosed areas. Sturdy, heavy storage tanks
   must be used to avoid possible hazards from the high-pressure storage.

   E85
   Because it is an alcohol, ethanol can be corrosive to some metals,
   gaskets, and seals. E85 is less volatile than gasoline, despite the
   fact that it contains 15% gasoline. The ethanol component of E85 is
   denatured to prevent consumption.

   LNG
   The fuel is cooled cryogenically to -260Â°F. At this temperature, bodily
   contact with the liquid fuel, cold metals, or cold gas can cause
   cryogenic burns (frostbite). Methane gas detectors must be installed to
   detect leaks, because odorants cannot be added to LNG.

   LPG
   Strong tank construction is required, but the pressure hazard is less
   than with CNG. LPG should be odorized and detectors are recommended to
   help detect leaks or spills. The fuel is extremely volatile and LPG
   fires burn twice as hot as gasoline fires.

   M85
   Methanol is corrosive to several metals, rubberized components,
   gaskets, and seals. Low flame luminosity makes M85 fires difficult to
   detect in the daylight. Unhealthy exposure can occur through fume
   inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact with skin.

   Electricity
   Electrical circuits are self-contained and grounded to limit the risk
   of shock from the vehicle frame. EV battery packs store enough energy
   to produce a dangerous or even lethal shock. Electrolytes in the
   battery may cause chemical burns and protective gear must be worn.
