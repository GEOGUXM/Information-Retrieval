                          Media Coverage of SST Group

   On occasion, articles or news items appear in magazines reporting the
   work of the Solid State Theory group. This section gives information on
   these reports.
    1. Fortune Magazine features the research of NREL's SST group in their
       article on new materials.
       Fortune 500 cover
       The April 17, 2000 issue of Fortune Magazine (the 500 issue)
       featured development of new materials in its "Industrial Management
       & Technology" section. The work of the NREL-SST group was one of
       four research programs described in this article, entitled "What's
       Cooking in the Chem Labs", by Ivan Amato (I. Amato, FORTUNE, pp.
       454[C]-454[V], Apr. 17, 2000). The coverage was based on the
       research of the SST group in the past few years, involving the
       prediction of new materials using quantum mechanics and statistical
       mechanics. For details of the research, see our web pages on New
       Materials and Inverse Bandstructure. Part of this work featured by
       Fortune was originally published in the article "The inverse
       band-structure problem of finding an atomic configuration with
       given electronic properties" (A. Franceschetti and A. Zunger,
       Nature 402, 60, 1999) by Alberto Franceshetti and Alex Zunger.
    2. The January, 2000, issue of "Materials Research Bulletin"
       highlights NREL's SST group's papers on GaInP[2] and GaAsN.
       The January 2000 issue (Vol. 25) of MRS Bulletin covered in its
       "Research/Researchers" section the recent papers published by
       Mattila, Wei, and Zunger in Physical Review Letters (T. Mattila,
       S.H. Wei and A. Zunger, "Electronic structure of sequence mutations
       in ordered GaInP2," Physical Review Letters 83, 2010-2013 (1999).
       and in Rapid Communications (T. Mattila, S.H. Wei and A. Zunger,
       "Localization and anticrossing of electron levels in GaAsN alloys,"
       Phys. Rev. B. 60, R11245-R11248,1999). The writeup by the staff is
       entitled "NREL Researchs Explain Anomalous Photoluminescence of
       Ordered GaInP[2] and Pressure-Dependence of Transitions in Alloys
       of GaAs[1-x]N[x]".
    3. Ozolins and Zunger's work on phonon instabilities reported in
       "Nature" magazine
       "Nature" magazine covered a PRL article by Ozolins and Zunger. The
       April 1, 1999, issue of Nature (vol. 398, pp. 372-375, 1999)
       contains a writeup on the paper entitled "Theory of Systematic
       Absence of NaCl-Type (-Sn-Type) High Pressure Phases in Covalent
       (Ionic) Semiconductors", by V. Ozolins and A. Zunger (Phys. Rev.
       Lett. 82, 767-770, 1999). The writeup by Mark S. T. Bukowinski is
       entitled "Phonons rewrite structural recipies".
    4. Inverse Band-Structure work of Franceschetti and Zunger reported in
       "Nanotech Alert"
       The November 5, 1999, issue of "Nanotech Alert" contains a piece
       entitled "Reverse engineer atomic electronic structures" by their
       staff writer reporting on the recent paper "The inverse
       band-structure problem of finding an atomic configuration with
       given electronic properties" (A. Franceschetti and A. Zunger,
       Nature 402, 60, 1999) by Alberto Franceshetti and Alex Zunger.
    5. Inside R&D spreads word on Franceschetti and Zunger's Inverse
       Band-Structure Method
       The November 19, 1999, issue of "Inside R&D" contains a piece
       entitled "Work backwords to discover electronic properties" by
       their staff writer reporting on the recent paper "The inverse
       band-structure problem of finding an atomic configuration with
       given electronic properties" (A. Franceschetti and A. Zunger,
       Nature 402, 60, 1999) by Alberto Franceshetti and Alex Zunger.
    6. SST Quantum Dot calcuations reported as interesting new DOE funded
       research in "Energy Research News"
    7. Newspaper calls attention to highly cited physicist
       The classification of 517,000 physicists according to the number of
       times that their papers were cited in 1981-1995 created significant
       interest. The placement of Alex Zunger as the 39th most cited
       physicist was the subject of an article entitled "Golden physicist
       listed as top brain", by Joeseph B. Verringia (Rocky Mountain News,
       March 5, 1998).
    8. Perdew and Zunger article a "Classic"
       A "citation classic" is defined by the Institute for Scientific
       Information (ISI) as a highly cited publication, as identified by
       the Science Citation Index (SCI). In general, a publication cited
       more than 400 times should be considered a classic. The paper
       entitled "Self interaction corrections to density-functional
       approximations for many electron systems", by J. P. Perdew and A.
       Zunger (Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048-79, 1981) was declared a citation
       classic, having been cited more than 1,125 times.
    9. SST Quantum Dot Calculations featured on the cover of "MRS
       Bulletin"
   10. Cover story of "MRS Bulletin" showcases SST work on Spontaneous
       Ordering in Semiconductors
   11. Vice President of R&D in ARCO Solar, Dr. C. Gay, praises PV theory
