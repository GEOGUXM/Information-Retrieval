   ........................... A13 Foreword The mission of the NIA The
   Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging is
   the "conduct and (NIA) comprises ten scientific laboratories and a
   research program that support of biomedical, social and behavioral
   include the scientific disciplines of biochemistry, cell and molecular
   research, training, biology, structural biology, genetics,
   neuroscience, behavioral sciences, health information epidemiology,
   statistics, and clinical research and the medical disciplines
   dissemination, and other of neurobiology, immunology, endocrinology,
   cardiology, rheumatology, programs with respect hematology, oncology,
   and gerontology. Medical problems associated with to the aging process
   and the diseases and aging are pursued in-depth using the tools of
   modern laboratory and other special problems clinical research. The
   central focus of research is understanding age- and needs of the aged."
   related changes in physiology and the ability to adapt to environmental
   stress. This understanding is then applied to developing insight about
   the Research on Aging Act pathophysiology of age-related diseases. The
   program seeks to understand of 1974, as amended in 1990 by P.L.
   101-557. the changes associated with healthy aging and to define the
   criteria for evaluating when any change becomes pathologic. Thus, not
   only are the common age-related diseases under study (e.g., Alzheimer's
   disease, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, cancer), but the
   determinants of healthy aging are also being defined. The bulk of the
   NIA intramural research program is based at the Gerontol- ogy Research
   Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Balti- more,
   Maryland. The Brain Physiology and Metabolism Section and the newly
   created Laboratory of Neurogenetics operate basic research pro- grams
   in the Clinical Center at the Bethesda campus of the National
   Institutes of Health and the Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography,
   and Biometry is located in the Gateway Building in Bethesda. The IRP
   provides a stimulating, academic setting for a comprehensive effort to
   understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated
   research. The program offers many excellent training opportunities in
   both labora- tory and clinical medicine with a wealth of valuable
   resources. The NIA is committed to training researchers for lifetime
   careers in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Dan L. Longo, M.D.

   Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science (LCS) was established in 1985 as
   an outgrowth of the Cardiovascular Section of the Clinical Physi- ology
   Branch. LCS is presently organized into two sections: Cardiac Function
   and Behavioral Hypertension. The Cardiac Function Section, which
   comprised the entire LCS at its incipience, is organized into six
   functional units, each headed by a tenured or senior scientist. The
   Behav- ioral Hypertension Section was formerly part of the Laboratory
   of Behav- ioral Science and joined LCS in 1997. The overall goals of
   the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science are (1) to identify
   age-associated changes that occur within the cardiovascular system and
   to determine the mechanisms for these changes; (2) to study myocardial
   structure and function and to determine how age interacts with chronic
   disease states to alter function; (3) to study basic mechanisms in
   excitation-contraction coupling and how these are modulated by surface
   receptor signaling pathways in cardiac muscle; (4) to determine the
   chemical nature and sequence of intermediate reactions controlling the
   movement of ions through ionic channels and pumps present in
   myocardium, and how these are affected by aging and disease; (5) to
   determine mechanisms that govern neuro-hormonal behavioral aspects of
   hypertension; (6) to determine mechanisms of normal and abnormal
   function of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells; and (7) to
   establish the potentials and limitations of new therapeutic approaches
   such as gene transfer techniques. In meeting these objectives, studies
   are performed in human volunteers, intact animals, isolated heart and
   vascular tissues, isolated cardiac and vascular cells, and subcellular
   organelles. Each section/unit/group independently conceptualizes and
   implements its research portfolio. Opportunities for collaboration
   among units/sections, however, are fostered and encouraged. In addition
   to independent work, substantial interaction occurs among scientists
   both within and between the sections/units. The stimuli for such
   interactions originate from individual scientists and from the Lab
   Chief, who commits substantial 1 energy to encourage (but not to
   demand) these research collaborations. Consequently, many of the LCS
   projects become multi-faceted, spanning a range from humans to
   molecules. Using this approach, scientists recognize that future
   research advances require the integration of discoveries within and
   among individual research areas. The networking among individuals
   within LCS also extends to individuals in other institutes within the
   NIH, academic institutions, and industry. We believe that such
   networking among individual facets of the biomedical research community
   is required for integration of discoveries that is tantamount to
   practical application of these research discoveries. The broad overall
   LCS mission permits tenured scientists, senior fellows, and new fellows
   appointed to the Lab to chose their specific research projects. In
   other words, individuals are most productive when working on projects
   on which they develop their own "passion." The resultant LCS
   environment has become somewhat unique: it is not strictly akin to a
   university department in which each individual dictates his/her mission
   and applies for individual funding in order to implement the proposed
   program; however, neither is the LCS environment strictly "mission
   oriented" in the sense that each individual is mandated to work on a
   given project in a "top down" design. The LCS environment is best
   described as a balance between the above approaches; and in the broad
   sense, the collective research output of the Lab can be considered to
   be a "bottom up" approach. Specifically, most projects originate at the
   investigator level but are coordinated by the Lab/Section/ Unit Chiefs
   to achieve a meaningful mosaic within the broad framework of the Lab
   mission. 2 Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science Staff Office of the

   Biography: Dr. Lakatta received his M.D. from Georgetown University
   School of Medicine, Washington, D.C. in 1970. His postdoctoral training
   included an internship and residency in medicine at Strong Memorial
   Hospital, University of Rochester School of Medicine, cardiol- ogy
   fellowships at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins University Hospitals, and
   basic research training at NIH and at the Department of Physiology,
   University College, London, England. He was section chief of the
   Cardiovascular Laboratory in the Clinical Physiology Branch from 1976
   to 1985, at which time he founded the Laboratory of Cardiovascular
   Science. Keywords: Dr. Lakatta directs the Cardiac Function Section
   (CFS) which has a broad based research program ranging from studies in
   humans to cardiovascular aging G protein coupled cardiac molecules. The
   program is comprised of the following units: receptors cardiac
   apoptosis Human Cardiovascular Studies Unit: This unit's studies deal
   with the vascular cell chemotaxis interactions of age, lifestyle, and
   disease on cardiovascular structure/ Recent Publications: function in
   humans. The study panel for the bulk of the studies is the Baltimore
   Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Initially, age-associated Xiao RP,
   et al. Circ Res 1999; 84(1): 43-52. changes in cardiovascular structure
   and function are defined in healthy individuals and subsequent studies
   define mechanisms for these changes Kuschel M, et al. and their
   prognostic significance. Additional populations that provide a
   Circulation 1999; 99: 2458- 2465. diversity of lifestyle and disease
   have been added to the study panel for specific projects. Acute or
   chronic interventions in these individuals or in Long X, et al. J
   Geront the BLSA are utilized to determine the responsiveness of
   age-associated 1999; 54: B23-B27. changes to pharmacological therapies
   or lifestyle changes, for example Nussbacher A, et al. Am J exercise
   habits. Several areas of related research in animal tissue and cells
   Physiol 1999; 277: H1863- implemented in other units of the Section
   complement these studies in H1871. humans. Molecular Cardiology Unit:
   The main focus of this unit is to define the molecular bases of aging
   in the heart. Many features of the age-associated changes in heart
   cells resemble those found during fetal development. For this reason,
   emphasis has been placed both on studies of development and on that of
   aging. The focus on early cardiac gene expression has relied greatly on
   the use of an embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation model system. In
   these studies, potential early cardiac gene transcription factors will
   be identified and the proteins responsible for activating expression
   are Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science 5 being targeted using
   standard molecular biological techniques. For aging, a number of model
   systems are being developed so that specific genes can be targeted
   during senescence to examine their functional consequences. Each
   project area has multiple components, and it is hoped that through
   integration of developmental with aging studies, we will be able to
   obtain a global view of cardiac gene expression and how alterations in
   individual gene expression patterns lead to physiological and
   pathophysiological consequences. Excitation-Contraction Coupling Unit:
   This unit's main research focus is on the control of cardiac cell
   calcium regulation. Substantial evidence indicates that the triggering
   of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release in cardiac muscle depends
   upon the interaction of the L-type sarcoplasmic calcium channel
   (dihydropyridine receptor) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium
   release (ryanodine receptor) via local calcium gradients. This unit has
   developed quantitative mathematical models that embody this "local
   control" hypothesis. To test the predictions of these models, we
   require the ability to alter the behavior of these channels, while
   preserving their natural geometrical relationship in the cardiac
   myocyte. To achieve this, models are developed in which the relevant
   proteins (DHPR, RyR, FKBP-12.6) are mutated by homologous recombination
   in mouse embryonic stem cells. Genetically engineered myocytes produced
   are studied by biophysical techniques (patch-clamp and confocal
   microscopy). Additional projects deal with identifying how cardiac cell
   regulatory mechanisms become altered with aging and disease (anoxia,
   ischemia, hypertension, heart failure). The initial mechanistic focus
   of this unit has broadened from the study of biophysical mechanisms in
   cardiac cells to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) as
   well. These studies, which combine fluorescence and confocal imaging,
   link strongly to projects within the Vascular Studies Unit. Cardiac
   Function Section: Further studies examine the functional effects of
   reactive oxygen and nitrogen species on cardiovascular function. There
   is considerable evidence that these play important roles in health and
   in disease states, including myocardial ischemia, congestive heart
   failure and atherosclerosis. These reactive species may frequently
   exert dramatically opposite biological effects, yet the spectrum of
   molecular targets overlaps to a considerable degree, particularly with
   respect to critical or regulatory thiol sites on proteins. Experiments
   are designed to examine how the dynamic competition between these
   species may be important in the evolution of various pathophysiological
   states, and how local control over nitric oxide and reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production, and hence targeting, is responsible for some
   of the most important aspects of their physiologic and/or pathological
   roles. Specific areas of interest include, Laboratory of Cardiovascular
   Science 6 (1) the relationship between ROS, the redox state, and the
   function of mitochondria, and, (2) the role of NO in
   excitation-contraction coupling in heart. Receptor Signaling Unit: The
   unit's focus is on elucidating signal transduction mechanisms for G
   protein-coupled- receptors, e.g., a and ß- adrenergic and opioid
   receptors and their subtypes in the heart. The interaction of signals
   emanating from stimulation of these with other receptor-mediated
   signaling pathways are also investigated. Studies are designed to
   integrate information gleaned from genetic manipulations, including
   gene transfer by adenoviruses, transgenic and gene targeted animal
   models, in conjunction with electrophysiologic, confocal imaging and
   cell biological techniques to probe novel intracellular regulatory
   mechanisms. In addition, considerable efforts have been put on cardiac
   aging and heart failure associated changes in G-protein coupled
   receptor signaling to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and develop
   new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human heart failure.
   Endogenous Sodium Pump Ligand in Blood Pressure Regulation: (A.Y.
   Bagrov, and O.V. Fedorova) Research in the group is primarily focused
   in pathophysiology of experimental hypertension. The main goal of the
   ongoing research is to better understand the cellular and molecular
   basis of salt sensitivity of hypertension. Primarily, research efforts
   concen- trate on the regulation of the sodium pump, a major sodium
   transporting system in the kidney and cardiovascular tissues, by
   endogenous digitalis- like sodium pump ligands (SPL), such as ouabain
   and marinobufagenin. These studies utilize Dahl hypertensive rats, in
   which genetically deter- mined sodium sensitivity due to mutation of
   a-1 subunit of the sodium pump underlies the development of
   hypertension. These studies are paral- leled by investigations of SPL
   in patients with various types of hyperten- sion. A major effort is
   made to define the sodium pump isoform profile of the SPL. In addition,
   the group is increasingly interested in co-regulation of the sodium
   pump in cardiovascular tissues by SPL and protein kinases, and in the
   involvement of SPL in tissue growth control and hypertrophic signaling.
   Gene Therapy Unit: Investigators in the unit used constructs of
   endothe- lial growth factor (VEGF) with different vectors such as
   adenoviruses or plasmid/liposome complexes in experiments to deliver
   genes to promote angiogenesis. The major efforts are directed to
   characterize different experimental models of cardiac pathology in
   animals using the "cutting edge" in vivo technology such as
   pressure/volume analysis of cardiac function and Doppler
   echocardiography in mice. Great importance is assigned to the
   development of the optimal methods of delivery of appro- priate genetic
   constructs to targeted tissue in vivo and to assess their Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 7 therapeutic effectiveness. The Gene Therapy
   Unit interacts with other LCS units/sections, serves as a resource for
   other GRC labs, and collaborates with industry and academic
   institutions in animal trials that employ gene targeted therapy.
   Vascular Studies Unit: Research areas of this unit include
   characterization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), VSMC
   properties (migration, secretion, invasion) in vivo, i.e., from
   neointimal lesions in restenosis injury, or from atherosclerotic
   plaque, and in vitro, i.e., in VSMC cells in tissue culture. A major
   focus is directed at discovering novel aspects of growth factor
   receptor-coupled signaling pathways that regulate cell migration and
   how these pathways change with age. Similar studies on signaling
   mechanisms of advanced glycation end- products (AGE) via their
   receptors (RAGE) on VSMC form an additional facet of the Unit's work.
   This Unit is also responsible for molecular biology studies on
   apoptosis in the cardiovascular system, focusing at this time on the
   regulation of cardiomyocytes death and survival. The Unit is highly
   interactive with other parts of a LCS-wide "vascular initiative"
   composed of Gene Therapy and Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Human
   Studies Units within the Cardiac Function Section of the Membrane
   Biology Section. The Vascular Unit also networks widely with academic
   institutions and industry. Collaborators: Jerome L. Fleg, M.D.,

   Ph.D. at Ivan Pavlov Medical Univer- sity, Leningrad, USSR. He
   subsequently completed his cardiology training and held clinical and
   academic appointments in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1992-1994, he
   worked at the NIA as a Visiting Associate. Keywords: We are studying

   pathways, which underlie the effects of LSP, and test the hypothesis
   3009-3014. that protein kinases potentiate the effects of LSP via
   isoform-specific phosphorylation of the sodium pump. Substantiation of
   these hypotheses may provide new approaches towards understanding the
   pathogenesis of NaCl sensitive hypertension and potentially provide new
   methods of early detection of the risk and prevention of pressor
   responses to high salt intake. Goal 1. The studies of MBG and OLC in
   pathogenesis of Dahl hyperten- sion include the experiments in which
   central and peripheral effects of MBG and OLC in rats with NaCl induced
   hypertension are blocked by MBG and ouabain antibodies which will
   permit assessment of whether each LSP contributes to hypertension.
   These experiments are paralleled by Laboratory of Cardiovascular
   Science 9 a study investigating (i) whether doses of MBG/OLC
   administered to rats which are sufficient to promote hypertensinongenic
   effects are (a) compa- rable to in vivo plasma levels of CS, and (b)
   associated with the changes in activity of the NKA and expression of
   NKA isoforms in cardiovascular tissues. Goal 2. In Dahl hypertension,
   the development of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy is followed by the
   development of heart failure. We investi- gate interactions of LSP with
   other vasoconstrictor systems (endothelins, angiotensins) during the
   development of left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart
   failure in Dahl rats. Plasma levels of LSP, endothelin, angiotensin II
   and atrial natriuretic peptide will be monitored in Dahl rats on high
   NaCl diet. In parallel, the combined action of LSP, endothelin,
   angiotensin II and atrial natriuretic peptide on Na/K ATPase activity
   from cardiovascular tissues is studied. We expect, that co-regulation
   of NKA by LSP and other cardiovascular hormones occurs via protein
   kinase C dependent mechanism. Studies of this mechanism may provide
   important data on both hypertensinogenic and growth promoting
   properties of LSP (Goal 3). Goal 3. The studies of mechanisms of action
   of LSP focus on (i) NKA isoform specificity, and (ii) on the
   co-regulation of NKA by CS and protein kinases. These experiments will
   utilize NKA activity and receptor binding assays. The major questions
   to be answered are: (i) Do protein kinases unmask the effect of LSP via
   phosphorylation of the sodium pump?, (ii) Do protein kinases affect
   Na/K pumping and receptor proper- ties of NKA?, and (iii) Is there an
   isoform specificity in the co-regulation of NKA by LSP and protein
   kinases? This Project is a continuation of ongoing studies testing the
   hypothesis that isoforms of the sodium pump represent receptor sites
   specific for different LSP, OLC and MBG in particular. The expression
   of a-1 and a-3 isoforms of the sodium pump in membrane fractions
   (sarcolemma and nerve ending plasmalemma) from rat heart and human
   mesenteric arteries will be studied. Concentration response curves of
   the inhibition of NKA in membrane fractions by LSP, including MBG and
   ouabain, will be determined in the absence and in the presence of
   activators of protein kinase C. Collaborators: Peter A. Doris, Ph.D.,

   from the University of Cincinnati in 1970. After completing training in
   Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Disease at Washington University
   in 1977, he assumed his current position in NIA's Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science. His research interests include normative aging
   changes in cardiovascular struc- ture and function, silent myocardial
   ischemia, and congestive heart failure. Keywords: Effects of Age,

   These findings have led us to conceptu- alize that aging is a muted
   form of hypertension. In industrialized societ- Nagai Y, et al.
   Circulation ies, a 20-30 mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP)
   typically occurs 1998; 98: 1504-1509. across the adult lifespan in
   subjects who remain normotensive by clinical criteria. The etiology of
   this SBP rise involves a gradual replacement of elastic fibers in the
   vascular media by less distensible collagen and cal- cium. Recent
   studies in our laboratory using pulse wave velocity and applanation
   tonometry of the large arteries have demonstrated a 200-500% increase
   in arterial stiffness across the adult life span. Two-dimensional
   echocardiographic determination of LV mass in these same subjects has
   revealed that the late systolic augmentation of arterial pressure
   quantified by applanation tonometry is an independent determinant of LV
   mass, beyond the effect of SBP. These studies, therefore, support the
   hypothesis that age-associated increases in arterial stiffness are
   responsible in part for the mild LV hypertrophy and substantial
   reduction in early diastolic LV filling rate seen with aging.
   Cross-sectional studies in our laboratory have Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 11 demonstrated both lesser arterial stiffness
   and enhanced endothelium dependent arterial dilation in endurance
   trained athletes correspond to their sedentary age peers. To further
   examine the hypothesis that arterial stiff- ness can be reduced, we
   have designed short-term drug interventions and longer-term exercise
   training interventions, both in normal older subjects and individuals
   with congestive heart failure. Although the exercise train- ing studies
   are still in progress, a recently completed study has shown that acute
   infusion of the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside to normal older
   subjects dramatically reduced their resting arterial stiffness and
   improved their LV performance during exhaustive cycle exercise to
   levels typical of unmedicated young individuals. Another major goal of
   our laboratory is to determine the mechanisms for the well known
   decline in maximal aerobic capacity (VO ) seen with 2max aging. In an
   early study, we found that normalization of treadmill VO2max for total
   body muscle mass nearly eliminated the age-associated reduction in VO ,
   inferring that the loss of muscle tissue with age contributes 2max
   importantly to the decline in VO . We have employed gated cardiac 2max
   blood pool scans with the isotope technetium-99m to quantify LV perfor-
   mance at rest and during maximal upright cycle exercise and its modula-
   tion by age, gender, lifestyle variables and cardiovascular disease.
   Our initial investigation using this techniques demonstrated that
   stroke volume at peak exercise was preserved across age by a greater
   reliance on LV dilatation to compensate for reduced systolic emptying.
   More recently we have found that this age-associated LV dilatation
   during exercise is more prominent in men than women despite similar
   impairment in emptying. Endurance trained older subjects utilize both
   larger end-diastolic LV volumes and enhanced LV emptying to augment
   stroke volume during exercise to a greater degree than untrained
   individuals. Simultaneous monitoring of oxygen consumption throughout
   these exer- cise cardiac blood pool scans has allowed us to examine the
   relative importance of cardiac versus peripheral factors in the
   age-associated decline in aerobic capacity and its modulation by
   endurance training. A recent investigation using this methodology
   suggests that declines in cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen
   difference contribute nearly equally to this decline in aerobic
   capacity with aging. Similarly, the marked augmentation of peak VO in
   endurance trained older subjects 2 relative to their sedentary peers is
   accomplished to a similar extent by enhanced cardiac output and
   peripheral oxygen extraction. Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science 12
   We have also utilized pharmacological probes to further define mecha-
   nisms for the decline in maximal exercise cardiac performance with age
   and their potential for modulation. For example, beta adrenergic
   blockade during exhaustive cycle ergometry in younger subjects markedly
   reduced their maximal heart rates and systolic emptying and augmented
   their exercise-induced LV dilatation, producing a profile similar to
   that of older unmedicated subjects. These data support our hypothesis
   that an important mechanism for the age-associated reduction in maximal
   cardiac perfor- mance is reduced beta adrenergic responsiveness. Our
   laboratory has utilized the electrocardiographic and Thallium scinti-
   graphic response to treadmill exercise to predict the development of
   future coronary events in clinically healthy adults. Although we and
   others have demonstrated the increased coronary risk associated with
   ischemic ST segment depressions that develop during treadmill exercise,
   we recently showed that such ST depression beginning during recovery
   has similar adverse prognostic significance. In another study, we found
   that exercise- induced silent ischemia by electrocardiogram and
   Thallium scan was strongly associated with increased carotid artery
   intimal-medial thickness, an indicator of carotid atherosclerosis.

   al. Circ Res integrins along with occupancy of the associated protein
   known as IAP 2000; 86: 807-815. (integrin-associated protein) are
   required for CamKII activation in re- sponse to chemoattractant
   recognition. Activated CamKII inhibits nonmuscle myosin light chain
   kinase (MLCK), altering VSMC myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation
   to attenuate stress fiber formation and promote migration. CamKII
   regulation of MLCK activity is also involved in ß3 integrin signaling,
   not only in VSMCs, but numerous other cell types, including
   macrophages, the erythroleukemic cell line K562, and HEK 293 cells.
   Interestingly, calcineurin, which is activated in the cell by the same
   signals that activate CamKII (i.e., calcium and calmodulin), can have
   the opposite effect of MLC phosphorylation resulting in inhibition of
   cell migration. These studies have what is likely to be general concept
   regarding migration, i.e., that the relationship between migration and
   MLC Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science 14 phosphorylation is
   bell-shaped, with low or no migration occurring at very low or very
   high levels of phosphorylation. The practical consequence of this is
   that some cells may require increased phosphorylation for migra- tion,
   while others decreased phosphorylation so that CamKII (and possibly
   calcineurin) may play different roles in promoting or inhibiting
   migration in different cell types. Another potentially important target
   of CamKII regulation is TIAM, a protein first identified as a promoter
   of migration/invasion in T cell lym- phomas. TIAM has subsequently been
   shown to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for rac1 and to
   be expressed in many different cell types, including VSMCs.
   Phosphorylation of purified TIAM by CamKII leads to increased GEF and
   rac activity, promoting membrane ruffling and inhibiting stress fiber
   formation. Current studies are directed at developing dominant negative
   inhibitors of TIAM to test the signficance of this CamKII target in
   migrating cells. Our studies have identified a unique intracellular
   signaling network in VSMCs that is triggered by chemoattractant
   recognition and modulated by growth status, secretion of growth factors
   and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and ECM- VSMC interactions
   with ramifications for other cell types in other settings. Advanced
   Glycation Endproducts, Their Receptors, and Vascular Disease: Advanced
   glycation endproducts of proteins (AGE) accumulate in the plasma and in
   tissues with age and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. In isolated
   vascular cells, AGEs induce a proxidant stress, leading to activation
   of pro-inflammatory events such as increased activity of MAPK and
   NF-kB, increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production,
   and increased PDGF B chain activity, all of which have been implicated
   in vascular lesion development and the recruitment of inflam- matory
   cells to atherosclerotic lesions. We have demonstrated that many of the
   effects of AGEs on gene expression are mediated through a unique
   immunoglobulin-type receptor called RAGE. We have constructed
   epitope-tagged wild type and mutant RAGE molecules and have shown that
   transfection of wild type receptor leads to increased MAPK activity and
   (MCP-1) RNA and protein levels in response to AGEs. Mutant recep- tors
   in which the cytosolic tail has been removed, however, do not result in
   increased MCP-1 production, but in fact block the ability of
   co-transfected wild type receptors to signal. These observations
   demonstrate that RAGE acts not merely as an AGE-binding protein but a
   bona fide transmembrane receptor, engaging intracellular signaling
   molecules to affect changes in gene expression and protein production
   and secretion. Current studies are concentrated on exploiting the
   truncated receptor as a dominant negative to block the effects of
   RAGE-mediated signaling during vascular lesion Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 15 development in transgenic mice. In addition,
   interaction cloning tech- niques are being used to identify
   intra-cellular proteins associated with the receptor. Molecular
   Mechanisms of Cell Death in the Cardiovascular and Musculoskeletal
   Systems: Cardiac cell loss marks the transition from compensatory
   hypertrophy to heart failure and is a key event in the remod- eling of
   the heart after ischemic insult. Cell loss is due predominantly to the
   death of cardiomyocytes and is mediated in part by apoptosis. Because
   adult cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated cells and there is
   no identifiable cardiac stem cell present in the adult heart, their
   loss is cur- rently permanent. We use various experimental models
   coupled with transgenic and extragenic approaches to study the process
   of cell death in the heart, with the goal to curtained and potentially
   fully protect cardiomyocytes from death-inducing stimuli. In a search
   for proteins that regulate apoptosis in the heart, we and others have
   identified a muscle- specific protein known as ARC (Apoptosis Repressor
   with CARD [Caspase Recruitment Domain]). Our studies show that ARC
   expression is downregulated by a number of death-inducing stimuli and
   that forced expression of a modified ARC fully protects isolated
   cardiomyocytes from these stimuli. We have also shown that ARC protects
   cells from death through multiple mechanisms, including direct
   inhibition of caspase activation, prevention of cytochrome c release
   and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and regulation of
   the NF-kB activity, an important regulator of apoptosis in a variety of
   cells. Transgenic mice carrying the ARC transgene under the control of
   a cardiac-specific pro- moter have been generated and are currently
   being used to assess whether forced expression of ARC will reduce
   infarct size and prevent cardiac remodeling following infarction. A
   conditional ARC knock-out is cur- rently in development and additional
   studies are focused on how ARC expression is regulated and its
   pleiotropic effects achieved. In addition to the heart, ARC is also
   expressed in injured blood vessels and skeletal muscles. Expression in
   injured blood vessels is confined to the neointima, an area of the
   blood vessel lumen into which vascular cells migrate and accumulate
   following vessel injury. Accumulation of a neointima is an important
   event in restenosis following balloon angioplasty and in cardiac
   transplant atherosclerosis. We have shown that vascular smooth muscle
   cells (VSMCs) isolated from the neointima (NI) express up to 5 times
   more ARC than cultured VSMCs from the medial (M) cell layer. This
   difference in ARC expression correlates with the increased sensitivity
   of M-VSMCs vs. NI-VSMCs to apoptosis-inducing stimuli. Forced
   expression of ARC in M-VSMCs confers resistance to Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 16 apoptosis comparable to that seen with
   NI-VSMCs. These results suggest that increased resistance to apoptosis
   caused by upregulation of ARC expression is an important factor that
   could prevent neointima growth and its associated pathogenic effects.
   With some of the collaborators listed below, we are also currently
   examin- ing the role of ARC in skeletal muscle, particularly its role
   in skeletal muscle atrophy associated with disuse, cachexia,
   age-related disorders such as sarcopenia, and musculoskeletal diseases.
   We hypothesize that changes in the activation and/or expression of ARC
   is a common mecha- nism for regulating not only cell death but also
   cell growth (hypertrophy/ atrophy) in skeletal muscle. One experimental
   model of skeletal muscle disuse currently under investigation is that
   of the sarcoglycan-deficient mouse. Sarcoglycan forms an essential
   connection between the contractile apparatus and cell membrane, linking
   contraction to work and potentially to intracellular signaling pathways
   through membrane proteins, such as integrins. The muscles of the
   deficient mouse are chronically "unloaded" and undergo severe atrophy.
   Our preliminary analysis indicates that apoptosis is elevated in such
   muscle cells, that it is "regionalized" to certain nuclei within the
   multinucleated fiber, and is correlated with reduced ARC expression.
   Experiments are underway to determine if forced ARC expression can
   prevent "regionalized" apoptosis within sarcoglycan-deficient single
   muscle fibers and reverse muscle fiber atro- phy in this disease model.
   Experiments are also underway to examine ARC expression in aging
   muscles and in myoblast stem cells from these muscles, which exhibit an
   age-associated decline in proliferative potential and increased
   susceptibility to apoptosis. Collaborators: Richard Kitsis, Albert

   plans are underway to actively apply this system to mouse transgenic
   models and to differen- tiating ES cells. Spatial and Temporal
   Analyses: Previous studies were performed in collaboration with the
   laboratory of Dr. Antoon Moorman, Amsterdam. With the development of
   molecular cell markers specific for contraction and relaxation,
   functional aspects of myocardial differentiation had been addressed
   through the use of in situ hybridization. We reported how Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 18 expression of SERCA2 and PLB in the rat may
   partly explain why the embyronic atrium and ventricle function
   essentially as they do in the adult. SERCA2 is expressed in a
   craniocaudal gradient; whereas that of PLB is expressed in a gradient
   essentially opposite to that of SERCA2. Accumula- tion of the NCX and
   RyR transcripts also occurs very early, similar to that for SERCA2, but
   do not show gradients of expression. With development, SERCA2 and PLB
   expression increase during late fetal and perinatal development;
   whereas that for NCX1 decreases at or around birth in a compartment
   dependent manner. NCX1 expression is, however, increased with aging. We
   have currently prepared a number of transgenic mice containing the
   promoters for rat NCX upstream of the b-galactosidase gene. The aim of
   this work is to identify sequences important for regulat- ing cardiac
   restriction of this gene's products. Secondly, SERCA2 pro- moter
   constructs are being used similarly to understand how this promoter can
   regulate gradients of expression throughout the developing and adult
   myocardium. Signal Transduction Pathways Mediating SERCA2 Expression:
   Using a model of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we have been able to
   determine that adrenergic agonists can play a critical role in
   regulation SERCA2 mRNA accumulations. Activation by alpha adrenergic
   agonists and protein kinase C isoforms reduces both SERCA2 mRNA
   expressions in a time and dose dependent mechanism probably through
   activation of the MAP kinase system. Beta adrenergic activation only
   results in decreased SERCA2 mRNA expression through a pathway that
   requires extracellular calcium and entry via the voltage dependent
   sarcolemmal calcium channel. The regulation however does not appear to
   be primarily transcriptional. Transfection into neonatal rat
   cardiomyoctyes of the 2.8 kb human SERCA2 promoter constructs linked to
   reporter sequences indicate a lack of response with any of the
   adrenergic agonists. Recent studies with Nuclear run-on assays have
   also indicated that transcriptional control of SERCA2 gene expression
   is not the primary mechanism responsible for increased mRNA, protein
   and function of SERCA2 seen perinatally. Studies are underway, to
   elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the post-transcriptional
   regulation, one possibility of which may relate to an alternatively
   spliced isoform of SERCA2 seen in the fetal myocardium, whose
   expression is greatly reduced late in gestation. Expressional Analysis
   of Cardiac NCX in Development and Senes- cence: We have examined the
   mRNA expression of the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) in rat heart during
   perinatal development and with aging. NCX is highly expressed in late
   fetal and neonatal rat hearts, decreasing to adult Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 19 levels by 20 days after birth. The lowest
   level of accumulation is seen in 6 and 18 month old animals. In the 24
   month old senescent rat, NCX expres- sion is increased by almost 50%
   above that seen at 6 and 18 months (p<0.05), but is not different from
   that at 15 neonatal days. Results from nuclear run-on assays indicate
   that NCX expression during the perinatal period is regulated at least
   partially through transcriptional mechanisms. Relatively high
   transcriptional activity is seen at birth but by 20 post-natal days, no
   transcriptional activity from NCX can be detected. During devel-
   opment, there are no major changes seen in the use of the five
   identified transcription start sites, nor is there any major difference
   in the splicing patterns seen in the 5' untranslated regions. We have
   identified the pres- ence of five different splicing variants in the
   cytosolic loop of the coding region, three of which have not been
   previously described in heart. We have also recently cloned a 2.8 kb
   fragment containing the putative cardiac NCX1 promoter and a consensus
   thyroid hormone responsive element which we are now examining. The work
   is now focused on the in vitro examination of this promoter. A number
   of putative GATA binding sites and Nkx binding sites have been
   identified. In transfection studies, GATA 4, 5, and 6 isoforms have
   been shown to be sufficient to transactivate this sequence. Constructs
   lacking these cis-binding elements or mutants of these sequences have
   been prepared and are being examined both in vitro and in the
   transgenic models described above. Embryonic Stem Cells and Myocardial
   Development: This research area involves a model of in vitro
   differentiation of cardiomyocytes origi- nating from embryonic stem
   cells (R1) and embryonic carcinoma cells (P19). The research is aimed
   at understanding the developmental processes involved in cardiac
   myocyte differentiation and development. To identify, atrial versus
   ventricular like cells, expression vector constructs have been made
   that link atrial and ventricular markers to the green fluorescence
   protein (GFP) and other selection markers. These constructs have been
   introduced into ES cells and positive transformants identified through
   neomycin resistance selection. From this work, we hope to use various
   molecular techniques to identify and analyze various transcription
   factors and growth factors that promote cardiac cell division and
   differentiation and importantly, the sequence of their activation and
   inhibition. Specifi- cally, we are examining the expressed sequences of
   differentiating P19 cells through a technique called serial analysis of
   gene expression (SAGE). This technique takes advantage of PCR and type
   II restriction enzymes to isolate short sequences sufficient to
   identify RNA products expressed at any time point. Currently, SAGE
   analyses have been performed on adult mouse myocardium, 3+3 day in
   vitro differentiating P19 cells and a com- parative analysis is
   underway with 3+0.5 day in vitro differentiating P19 Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 20 cells. Through this technique, we hope to use
   the information gained about the expressed sequence pattern to target
   and specifically identify gene products that are important to cardiac
   differentiation. Temporal/Spatial Regulation: The aim of this program
   is to develop conditional and inducible gene targeting models, limited
   to specific car- diac lineages (e.g. ventricular myocytes) and
   inducible at a desired devel- opmental stage. The tools chosen to
   accomplish this program are the Cre Recombinase-Lox P recombination
   system and the tetracycline trans- activator system. A number of mice
   have been prepared that carry the Cre recombinase transgene under
   control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter. Secondly, a targeting
   construct containing LoxP sites has been prepared such that induction
   of Cre Recombinase expression by withdrawal of tetracycline should
   cause excision of a critical exon in a targeted gene. This system has
   been placed under control of a lineage-specific promoter so that a
   tissue-specific knockout can be made to occur at a specified time.
   Currently a tetop-Cre Recombinase and MLC2V-tTA construct has been
   injected into pronuclei of C57BL/6 oocytes and a number of founder
   lines positive for these transgenes have been identified. These lines
   are currently being studied for appropriate expression using another
   reporter mice. To inducibly knockout RyR2 expression, a 15 kb mouse
   129/SvJ genomic DNA fragment has been cloned, sequenced and the genomic
   structure determined. This sequence has been appropriately modified and
   lox P sites and neomycin resistance cassettes placed appropriately
   within the se- quence. This mutant mouse RyR2 targeting vector has also
   been success- fully introduced into embryonic stem cells, injected into
   blastocysts, and positive chimeras have been identified. This work is
   on-going. Collaborators: Professor Magdi H. Yacoub, Imperial College

   mikes@vax.grc.nia.nih.gov Biography: Dr. Stern studied theoretical
   physics at Princeton and received an M.D. degree from University of
   Pennsylvania. Following internship, he was a Staff Fellow in the
   Laboratory of Technical Development of the NHLBI, where he invented a
   method to measure tissue microvascular blood flow using laser light
   scattering. Following an Internal Medi- cine residency at University of
   Michigan and Cardiology fellowship at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Stern joined
   the faculty in Cardiology at Johns Hopkins in 1981. His research on
   laser light scattering fluctuations in cardiac muscle, in collaboration
   with the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science at GRC, led to the
   discovery that apparently resting heart muscle produces continuous,
   random asynchronous subcellular waves of contrac- tion, which proved to
   be due to propagated calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
   This led directly to his present interest in the basic mechanism of
   cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. His studies on the physiology
   of excitation-contraction coupling in single cardiac myocytes during
   extreme hypoxia led to the finding that reoxygenation injury is due to
   calcium shifts brought about by ionic conditions created during a
   vulnerable period of complete energy depletion. In parallel with this
   work, Dr. Stern carried out mathematic modeling of the basic mechanisms
   of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Based on this work he
   proposed, in 1992, the local control hypothesis of excitation
   contraction coupling, has become the leading theory of this process. In
   1996, Dr. Stern joined LCS full time as a member of the Senior
   Biomedical Re- search Service. Keywords: Calcium Microdomain Signaling
   in Intracellular Communication: The heartbeat is initiated by the
   release of calcium from stores in the calcium signals
   excitation-contraction sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It is now well
   established that the trigger coupling for this release is the entry of
   a much smaller amount of calcium ryanodine receptors through
   voltage-controlled L-type calcium channels in the cell mem-
   mathematical modeling brane. This is the mechanism of calcium-induced
   calcium release Recent Publications: (CICR), which is known to be
   mediated by ryanodine receptors, which are calcium sensitive calcium
   channels located in the membrane of the Stern MD, et al. Proc Natl Acad
   Sci USA 1999; 96: SR. Similar ryanodine receptors are located on

   types, where their function is not yet understood. Stern MD, et al. J
   Gen Physiol 1999; 113(3): 469- 489. The release of SR calcium is a
   tightly controlled and smoothly graded function of the trigger calcium;
   this is paradoxical since CICR is an Cheng H, et al. Biophys J 1999;
   76(2): 606-617. intrinsically self-reinforcing process which might be
   expected to lead to an all-or-none response. A possible resolution of
   the paradox is based on the fact that the L-type trigger channels and
   the SR release channels are known to be localized to opposite sides of
   the 15 nm dyad junctions between the cell membrane and the SR membrane.
   This Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science 22 means that the trigger for
   CICR is not whole cell calcium, but rather the local calcium
   microdomain generated in the neighborhood of the trigger- ing channel.
   We have shown mathematically that the interaction between the
   stochastic gating of individual channels and the fluctuating calcium
   microdomains which they generate can give rise to smoothly graded and
   controlled calcium release in the whole cell aggregate, even though
   indi- vidual release events may be nearly all-or-none. This is the
   local control hypothesis, which implies that whole cell calcium release
   depends criti- cally on the details of the gating and ion permeation of
   the trigger and release channels, and on the local geometrical
   relationship between them. Over the past several years, considerable
   evidence has accumulated show- ing that this is the case. We have
   recently constructed a similar local- control model of the role of CICR
   in skeletal muscle excitation-contrac- tion coupling. This model
   successfully explains many paradoxical obser- vations, and leads to the
   insight that collective behavior of mesoscopic arrays of
   calcium-coupled release channels, which we term couplons, may be the
   basic functional unit of EC coupling. In order to test the local
   control hypothesis more definitively, we hope to develop a model in
   which the full machinery of excitation-contraction coupling (junctions,
   ryanodine receptors, L-type calcium channel, auxil- iary junctional
   proteins) is expressed and in which the components and the signals that
   control their localization can be manipulated genetically. This is the
   major project of our laboratory at the present time. Since cardiac
   myocytes are terminally differentiated and non-dividing, they cannot be
   used directly. In general, cultured cell lines do not form SL/SR
   junctions even when expressing the channel proteins. Our present
   approach to the problem is to make use of the well developed technique
   of gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, together with in
   vitro differentiation of ES cells into embryoid bodies which contain
   beating cardiac myocytes. We have successfully established culture
   techniques which promote cardiac differentiation in a high percentage
   of embryoid bodies, and have demonstrated calcium sparks and waves,
   which are produced by RyR- mediated intracellular calcium release, in
   cells as early as 7 days of differ- entiation. These studies will be
   continued to characterize the biochemistry, ultrastructure and EC
   coupling physiology of these cells. These baseline studies will define
   that model and lead to increased understanding of the development of
   cardiac-type EC coupling. We will then use homologous recombination
   methods to obtain cardiac myocytes in which the key protein domains
   responsible for calcium sensing and release, and others (such as the
   enormous 2 megadalton "foot process" of the ryanodine receptor) whose
   function is unknown, have been altered. More impor- tantly, we hope to
   discover the signals which give rise to the organized Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science 23 geometrical structure of the dyad junction,
   and to alter it in order to test the sensitivity of coupling to
   geometry which is predicted by the local control theory. A combined
   approach utilizing ES cell techniques, confocal calcium measurement,
   patch clamp and mathematical modeling will be used. Since ryanodine
   receptors are ubiquitous, it is likely that the insights gained from
   this program will be important for understanding the way in which
   spatial and temporal localization of intracellular calcium signals
   leads to their diversity of function in many cell types. Collaborators:

   from the University of Maryland and joined the Laboratory of
   Cardiovascular Science in 1995. During Ph.D. research, he discovered
   "Ca2+ sparks", now known as the elementary events of Ca2+ signaling in
   many types of cells. His current research interest focuses on local
   Ca2+ and cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in the context of
   excitation-contraction coupling and receptor-mediated signal
   transduction in normal and diseased hearts. These studies enlist an
   array of state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., confocal microscopy,
   electrophysiology and laser flash photolysis), gene-targeted animal
   models as well as mathematical modeling. Keywords: Ca2+ Sparks: Ca2+

   extensive studies over the last five years, the origin and the exact
   nature of Ca2+ sparks remain elusive: whether Ca2+ sparks are single-
   channel events or a collective phenomenon of clusters of RyRs? What
   makes the spark size twice that predicted by theory? How big is the
   Ca2+release flux underlying a spark? What mechanism terminates
   Ca2+sparks (see below)? To address these fundamental questions, we
   embark on novel imaging techniques, digital imaging processing algo-
   rithms and models of spark generation. Laboratory of Cardiovascular
   Science 25 Termination of Ca2+-Induced Ca2+ Release: In cardiac
   myocytes, Ca2+ release from RyR in the SR is activated by the
   Ca2+-induced-Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. CICR, with its inherent
   positive feedback, is expected to operate in an "all-or-none" fashion.
   In order to generate Ca2+ transients of graded amplitude and robust
   stability, a regulatory mechanism must exist to counteract the
   regenerative CICR. Several mechanisms, including inactivation,
   adaptation, and stochastic closing of RyRs have been pro- posed, but no
   conclusive evidence has yet been documented. Our recent study has shown
   that FK506-binding protein (FKBP), an immunophilin and accessory
   protein of RyR, constitutes a prominent regulator of CICR via
   shortening the duration of the elementary release events (Ca2+ sparks)
   and accelerating the desensitization of RyR to Ca2+. To elucidate the
   primary termination mechanism of CICR, we first developed a novel
   fluorescent technique. By combination of a fast, linear Ca2+ indicator,
   Oregon Green BAPTA 5N, and a high concentration of Ca2+ chelator, EGTA,
   Ca2+ release was visualized as discrete "Ca2+ spikes" restricted to T
   tubule-SR junctions, each consisting of single or a few Ca2+ sparks.
   In- creasing the open duration and promoting the reopens of Ca2+
   channels with the Ca2+ channel agonists, FPL64176, did not prolong or
   trigger secondary Ca2+ spikes, even though 2/3 of the SR Ca2+ remained
   available for release by caffeine. Latency analysis revealed that Ca2+
   spikes coin- cided with the first openings, but not with the reopens,
   of L-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, after an initial maximal release
   (e.g., at 0 mV), even a multi-fold increase in unitary Ca2+ current
   produced by a hyper polarization step to -120 mV, failed to trigger
   additional release, indicating an absolute refractoriness of RyRs. When
   the release was submaximal (e.g., at +30 mV), tail currents upon hyper
   polarization did activate addi- tional Ca2+ spikes; confocal images
   revealed that the tail release originated from those unfired during
   depolarization. These results indicate that Ca2+ release is terminated
   primarily by a highly localized, use-dependent inactivation of RyRs,
   but not by stochastic closing and adaptation of RyRs, or depletion of
   SR Ca2+ in intact ventricular myocytes. Collaborators: James S. K.

   Dr. Rui-Ping Xiao has been working in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular
   Science since February 1990. She was trained as a physiologist and
   molecular pharmacologist at Tong-Ji Medical University, China, and at
   the University of Mary- land, where she received her M.D. and Ph.D.,
   respectively. Her main scientific focus has been related to
   receptor-mediated transmembrane signal transduction in the
   cardiovascular system. In addition, consider- able efforts have been
   put on cardiac aging and heart failure associated changes in G-protein
   coupled receptor signaling. The breadth of our work covers four
   different areas: (1) signal transduction mechanisms which underlie the
   distinct functional roles of ß-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtype
   stimulation in cardiac myocytes; (2) age-and heart failure-related
   alterations in cardiac responses to ß-AR subtype stimulation; (3)
   interaction of the ß-adrenergic signaling pathway with other cardiac
   sarcolemmal receptor mediated signaling pathways (e.g., opioid,
   adenosine, and acetylcholine receptors); and (4) the role of
   Ca2+/calmodulin-depen- dent kinase II (CaMKII) in cardiac functional
   regulation. Most studies are designed to integrate information gleaned
   from genetic manipulations, including gene transfer by adenoviruses,
   transgenic and gene targeted animal models, in conjunction with
   electrophysiologic, confocal imaging and cell biological techniques.
   The mechanistic and interdisciplinary nature of our research has made
   the past few years particularly fruitful. Keywords: Dual Coupling of

   by Gi-dependent functional Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science 27
   compartmentalization of the ß AR-directed cAMP/PKA signaling to 2
   sarcolemmal microdomain. This compartmentalization allows the common
   second messenger, cAMP, to perform selective functions during ß-AR
   subtype stimulation. In chronically failing heart, the ß AR/G 2 i
   coupling is exaggerated. The enhanced Gi signaling underlies the heart
   failure-associated dysfunction of ß AR. Based on the dual G coupling of
   ß AR, we conceptualize that 2 2 receptor ligands may selectively
   activate a subset(s) of the post-receptor signaling pathways. By
   screening a variety of ß AR ligands, we have 2 identified one ligand
   (fenoterol) that selectively activates Gs, bypassing the Gi signaling.
   Strikingly, fenoterol is able to restore the markedly depressed ß AR
   contractile response in two experimental chronic heart 2 failure
   models. Our most recent studies provide compelling evidence that
   stimulation of ß1AR, but not ß AR, induces cardiac apoptosis. The anti-
   2 apoptotic effect of ß AR stimulation in cardiac myocytes is mediated
   by 2 Gi-Gg subunits-PI3 kinase-Akt signaling pathway. These studies not
   only reveal the diversity and specificity of ß-AR subtype and G protein
   interac- tions, but also provide new insights for understanding the
   co-existence and different functional roles of ß1AR and ß AR in healthy
   and failing hearts. 2 Roles of Ca2+/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase
   II (CaMKII) in Regulating Cardiac Pacemaker Activity: The human heart
   faithfully supplies blood to the body by beating more than 3 billion
   times in a lifetime. The sinoatrial (SA) node possesses automaticity
   and serves as the primary physiological pacemaker of the heart. Our
   recent studies have shown that SA node pacemaker activity is critically
   dependent on Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
   (CaMKII)-mediated positive feedback regulation of the L-type Ca2+
   current (I ). In freshly dissoci- Ca,L ated rabbit single SA node
   cells, specific CaMKII inhibitors, a peptide CaMKII inhibitor or KN-93

   dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, 3 µM KN-93 or 10 µM CaMKII peptide

   CaMKII activation is obligatory to the genesis of pacemaker AP. To
