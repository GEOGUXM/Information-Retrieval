   Workers' Compensation
        __________________________________________________________________

   The Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs
   (OWCP) administers four major disability compensation programs which
   provide wage replacement benefits, medical treatment, vocational
   rehabilitation, and other benefits to federal workers or their
   dependents who are injured at work or acquire an occupational disease.

   The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, the
   Federal Employees' Compensation Program, the Longshore and Harbor
   Workers' Compensation Program, and the Black Lung Benefits Program
   serve the specific employee groups who are covered under the relevant
   statutes and regulations by mitigating the financial burden resulting
   from workplace injury. Individuals injured on the job while employed by
   private companies or state and local government agencies should contact
   their state workers' compensation board.

   The Department of Labor has several programs designed to prevent
   work-related injuries and illnesses. You may obtain information about
   these programs by visiting the home pages for the Occupational Safety
   and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Mine Safety and Health
   Administration (MSHA).
