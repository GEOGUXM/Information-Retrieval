Scientific Goal:

   To explore the mesosphere and lower thermosphere globally and achieve a
   major improvement in our understanding of the fundamental processes
   governing the energetics, chemistry, dynamics, and transport of the
   atmospheric region extending from 60 km to 180 km. SABER is one of four
   instruments on NASA's TIMED Mission.

Scientific Objectives:

     * Study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere structure including its
       seasonal, latitudinal and temporal variations.
     * Investigate the energetics and distribution of radiatively active
       species in the non-LTE environment to understand the relative
       importance of radiative, chemical, and dynamical sources and sinks
       of energy.
     * Analyze the O[y] and HO[y] chemistry and its coupling with
       energetics and dynamics.
     * Conduct studies of dynamics and transport and their role in the
       energy budget.
     * Develop a climatology of key atmospheric parameters in the TIMED
       core region from 60 to 130 km.

Key Experiment Features:

     * Mathematical inversion of Earth limb emission vertical profiles
       measured by a multispectral radiometer operating in the near to
       mid-infrared over the range 1.27 µm to 17 µm (7865 cm^-1 to 650
       cm^-1).
     * Capability to continuously sound the atmosphere both night and day
       is provided by limb emission sounding permitting diurnal change and
       polar night studies to be conducted with daily global coverage.
     * Autonomous pressure and altitude registration and automatic
       correction for spacecraft motion effects are performed using two
       wide and one narrow band CO[2] channel centered in the 15 µm band.
     * State-of-the-art mechanical cooling of the detector focal plane
       array is employed in order to achieve high radiometric sensitivity,
       operational flexibility, and long experiment life.
     * Experiment builds on a rich spaceflight heritage of limb sounding
       including the Nimbus-7 LIMS experiment SAMS, CIRRIS, ATMOS, HALOE,
       CLAES, ISAMS, and SME. The instrument design and experiment
       approach is based directly on the highly successful LIMS instrument
       and flight experience

                           Instrument Description

   The SABER instrument is a 10-channel radiometer that will measure
   infrared Earth limb emissions. The instrument telescope is a Cassegrain
   design with a picket-fence tuning fork chopper at the first focus, and
   a clam shell reimager to focus the image on the focal plane. The
   telescope has been designed to reject stray light from the Earth and
   atmosphere outside the instrument instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV).
   The baffle assembly contains a single axis scan mirror which permits
   the 2 km vertical IFOV of each detector to be scanned from the Earth to
   a 400 km tangent height. Accurate vertical registration of the tangent
   height of the data in the atmosphere is achieved by analysis of the
   14.9 µm CO[2] channels. The telescope and baffle assembly are cooled to
   240 K by a dedicated radiator. The focal plane assembly, consisting of
   a filter array, a detector array, and a Lyot stop is cooled to 75 K by
   a miniature cryogenic refrigerator. The detector array contains
   discrete HgCdTe, InSb, and InGaAs detectors. The conductive heat load
   on the refrigerator is minimized by a support system that thermally
   isolates the focal plane assembly from the telescope. The telescope is
   supported and thermally isolated from the instrument base plate by a
   glass composite structure. The cryogenic refrigerator and electronics
   heat loads are dissipated to space by the plate radiator. Instrument
   responsivity drifts due to changes in telescope and focal plane base
   temperatures as well as other causes are corrected by an in-flight
   calibration system.

                                Data Products

   The series of SABER data products will include Level 0: Unprocessed
   signals in counts; Level 1A: signals in counts, time referenced and
   tagged with ancillary data; Level 1B: Calibrated and spacecraft motion
   corrected radiances ready for limb retrieval applications; Level 2:
   Observed geophysical parameters - Routine products; Level 2A: Derived
   geophysical parameters - Analysis products; Level 3: Zonal mean and
   mapped geophysical parameters produced using daily, weekly, monthly,
   and seasonally averaged data; and Level 4: Model derived products
   developed for example, from more than one measurement. SABER data are
   retrieved on pressure surfaces and tied to altitude through
   registration within collocated NCEP temperature, pressure, and altitude
   profiles merged into the SABER data stream on the ground. Level 1B
   products will include tangent altitude and pressure versus radiance for
   selected spectral bands: CO[2]( [nus.gif] [2]) centered at 14.9 µm,
   O[3]( [upsilon.gif] [3]) at 9.3 µm, H[2]O( [upsilon.gif] [2]) at 6.8
   µm, NO( [upsilon.gif] ) at 5.3 µm, CO[2]( [upsilon.gif] [3]) at 4.2 µm,
   OH( [upsilon.gif] =7,8,9) at 2.06 µm, OH( [upsilon.gif] =3,4,5) at 1.6
   µm, and O[2](^1 [Delta.gif] ) at 1.27 µm. The figure below shows
   calculated radiance as a function of tangent height for the main CO[2]
   isotopes in the narrow and wide spectral channels. The SABER level 1
   product will be the sum of limb emissions by all the isotopes shown in
   the figure as a function of tangent point altitude. Level 2 and Level
   2A products are described in the tables on page 4. A LIMS experiment
   pressure versus temperature profile is shown as an example of a routine
   product. SABER will make measurements to much higher altitudes than
   LIMS (e.g. for Z> 100 km). A HALOE experiment pressure versus latitude
   Sunset water vapor cross section is shown as an example of a Level 3
   product. SABER will make water vapor latitude cross section
   measurements daily including both day and night observations.

         Plot of the calculated altitude versus limb CO2 emissions
   Calculated altitude versus limb CO[2] emission for the main isotopes in
   the SABER wide(W) and narrow(N) channels. The Level 1 product will be
   the sum of these emissions in each channel as a function of altitude.

   Typical SABER daily latitude versus longitude and yearly latitudinal
   coverage is shown below for a May 18, 2000 launch. SABER will always
   view on the anti-Sun side of the spacecraft resulting in asymmetric
   global coverage during any 60 day period. Coverage of opposite poles
   occurs as the spacecraft periodically yaws. The time of year when SABER
   observes the summer polar region can be selected by changing the
   initial equatorial crossing time.

                                  crossing
      time of 18:00. This crossing gives Northern polar coverage nearly
                                  centered
                         around the summer solstice.
