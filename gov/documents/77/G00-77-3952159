     Providing a way out of poverty is the mission of Community Services,
   which includes Community Actions Agency (CAAs) both public and private,
   Migrant and Seasonal Farm Worker Agencies (MSFWs), American Indian
   tribes and tribal organizations, home energy program providers, and
   other limited-purpose agencies (LPAs) and the Department of Community
   Services and Development (CSD), which is the state-level partner with
   this local network.

   With the support of CSD, these local agencies promote self-sufficiency
   through programs to help poor people gain education and job skills,
   find employment, improve income management, secure adequate housing and
   pay energy bills, secure temporary emergency assistance, improve
   nutrition, and more.  The men and women who work and volunteer at these
   Community Services Agencies and the staff at CSD have established a
   reputation for caring and commitment that few can surpass.
   Here are other organizations that also play an important part in
   community services.

   CSD also has a close working relationship with many utility companies
   throughout the State.  Most of these utility companies are under
   contract with us to provide direct payment to an approved customer's
   utility account.  If you work for a utility company and would like to
   participate in our Direct Payment Process, contact Danny Feister (916)
   341-4278 for information.
