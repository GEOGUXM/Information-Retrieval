                              Mission Overview


   Three flights of the SAGE III instrument are currently planned
   including a flight aboard a Russian Meteor-3M platform in 2001 and the
   International Space Station in 2004. The launch of the third SAGE III
   mission has not been identified.

   The chart below shows the coverage over the earth provided by the first
   two missions for solar occultation measurement events.

   SAGE III Coverage

   SAGE III/Meteor will be in a sun-synchronous orbit that provides
   primarily high latitude measurements. SAGE III/ISS (International Space
   Station), on the other hand, will be in an inclined orbit that provides
   near global coverage over the course of about a month.

   Meteor-3m patch Meteor-3M Mission
   The initial SAGE III mission is aboard the Russian Space Agency
   Meteor-3M platform, currently scheduled for launch in 2001. Meteor-3M
   will be placed in a sun synchronous orbit that yields solar measurement
   opportunities between 50° and 80° North and 30° and 50° South. The high
   northern latitude coverage will provide insight into the processes
   leading to ozone depletion during boreal winter and provide coverage
   that complements the mid and low latitude coverage provided by SAGE II
   and other SAGE III missions.

   ISS patch International Space Station Mission
   SAGE III is scheduled to be a part of the International Space Station
   (ISS) payload beginning in 2004. ISS will be placed in a 51°-inclined
   orbit that yields SAGE III solar measurement opportunities from 70°
   South to 70° North over the course of one month. This orbit is similar
   to that of SAGE II (a 57°-inclined orbit) and is well suited to SAGE
   III's primary mission to provide long-term global monitoring of ozone
   and aerosol variations.

   Flight of Opportunity (FOO) Mission
   The third SAGE III mission has not formally been selected.
