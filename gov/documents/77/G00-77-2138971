  Dropped Raobs

   When a plot of roab counts by month, by latitude band, for the years
   1968-1996 revealed that the band 60-90S had fewer raobs, rather than
   the expected extra, for the FGGE year, 1979, a review of the data
   preprocessing codes was initiated. The review revealed an insidious
   error in the program that entered climatological events into the
   prepbufr files. From what appears to be a side effect of a compiler
   optimization, the first bufr message was not written to the output
   file. Since the prepbufr processing always begins with "ADPUPA"
   (raobs/pibals/dropsondes), we had systematically lost soundings. The
   particular code was one introduced in August 1995 in response to the
   conversion to the J916's from the YMP-8, in order to multitask the
   processing to make-up for the slower single processor clock speed of te
   J916's compared to the YMP. In order assess the loss of data, we have
   run monthly summaries and created grads compatible grids of raob
   counts. We chose to bin the counts in 3x3 lat-lon bins. The 3x3
   resolution was chose to be close to the 2.5x2.5 deg resolution of much
   of the output, and to make the plots easier to view and interpret.

  Jan Plots

   The plots take the difference of monthly counts of missing data and
   remaining data. The red areas are boxes where the missing counts exceed
   the reamining data by 10. The cutoff of 10 was chosen to eliminate
   isolated and travelling sites that may have been omitted but are less
   conseqential than regularly reporting fixed sites.
