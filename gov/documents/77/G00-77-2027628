   [sm3.gif] Today's Supply of and Demand for Electricity in California

   Additional information and related links.

   [today.gif?894]

   The power grid that supplies the electric current coming into your home
   or business is designed to maintain a dynamic balance between the
   consumer demand for electricity and the amount being supplied by
   generators. The chart at right is an approximate representation of this
   dynamic balance. Quantities which are forecasts or estimates are shown
   by dashed lines. You may need to click your browser's reload button to
   update the graph.

   The current demand (or "load") depends on how much power consumers are
   using right now. While the load changes every time someone switches a
   light on or off, the sum of loads due to a large number of consumers
   varies slowly. In addition to the supply needed to meet this demand,
   some "reserve" generating capacity must be kept ready to operate in
   case of any unexpected events.

   The current load is published every ten minutes by the California
   Independent System Operator (ISO) for the area it controls, which
   covers about 80% of electricity use in the state. It is a little more
   difficult to quantify the amount of supply that may be available, which
   we call "Potential Capacity". Our approximation is based on: the total
   capacity of generators licensed to operate, minus the generators that
   are out of service (forced and planned outages), plus imports, minus
   exports. Outages are updated daily, and imports and exports are updated
   hourly. The official ISO System Status page can be found here.

   ISO Control Area This graph shows data for the ISO control area only,
   which covers about 80% of electricity use in California. It includes
   the service areas of the three major utilities ( PG&E, Southern
   California Edison, and San Diego G&E) and the Sacramento Municipal
   Utility District, but not LADWP, which provides electricity to Los
   Angeles. In addition to the resources in state, transmission lines
   connecting California to the rest of the Western region allow
   electricity to be imported and exported. More detail and site links can
   be found here. Back to top.

   Maximum Capacity This number is an estimate of the total generation
   capacity inside the ISO control area. It does not include generators in
   the municipal utility districts. It is computed as the sum of the
   online capacity of all the generators licensed to operate as of
   February 2001. The fact that a generator is licensed, and so included
   in this figure, does not mean that it will be operating or selling
   electricity into the ISO on any given day. For more detail and links to
   the original data sources click here. Back to top.

   Potential Capacity The generation capacity potentially available to
   supply electricity is computed here as the sum of (Maximum Capacity)
   minus (Forced and Planned Outages) plus (Imports) minus (Exports). The
   generation capacity actually available in any given hour will differ
   from this number for a variety of reasons. Hydroelectric capacity may
   be reduced due to water shortages. Some plants are only available a
   certain number of hours per month, or may have restrictions on their
   operation due to air quality concerns. There may also be resources
   available to the ISO in the form of voluntary load reductions
   ("negawatts"), which are not included here. Click here for a more
   detailed discussion. Back to top.

   Current Load "Load" is the technical term for total demand for
   electricity. It is the amount of electricity that customers are pulling
   out of the grid at any given moment. This amount is monitored in real
   time by the ISO, and published every 10 minutes. The ISO load accounts
   for about 80% of total electricity use in California. Details and data
   links here. Back to top.

   Forecast Load While the load changes every time someone turns on a
   computer or switches off a light, on the average it can be predicted,
   given information about the weather, the daily habits of individuals
   and businesses, etc. Every day the ISO publishes two-day-ahead and
   one-day-ahead forecasts of what the loads will be for each hour, which
   are used to schedule delivery of adequate electricity. The curve shown
   here is from the one-day-ahead forecast (ie. this forecast was computed
   yesterday). More detail and data links can be found here. Back to top.

   Load plus Reserves To guarantee the reliability of the transmission and
   distribution system, the ISO must be able to correct any sudden
   imbalances between supply and demand that may occur. This means that a
   certain amount of "reserve capacity" has to be available at all times.
   The current industry standard sets reserves equal to about 7% of the
   system load. For planning purposes, the reserve requirements are based
   on the forecast load, so the line on the graph is today's forecast load
   plus an additional 7%. The ISO calls a Stage 1 Emergency when reserves
   drop below 7%, a Stage 2 Emergency when reserves are less than 5%, and
   a Stage 3 Emergency when reserves drop to 1.5%. In a Stage 3 Emergency,
   rolling blackouts may be initiated to reduce the system load. A more
   detailed discussion is presented here. Back to top.

   Forced and Planned Outages Every morning the ISO publishes figures for
   the quantity of generation that will be offline for that day. A
   generator offline (ie. not operating) is called an "outage". Planned
   outages are those that have been scheduled ahead of time with the ISO,
   while forced outages are those that occur with little or no advance
   notice. The graph shows a separate line for each---the total generation
   offline is the sum of the two. The outage figures are updated at noon.
   We use the previous day's figures until noon as an estimate. Today's
   numbers are: Planned Outage 9035 MW; Forced Outage 2602 MW. More
   information and data links here. Back to top.

   Imports and Exports The electricity transmission grid that serves
   California is interconnected with the rest of the western United States
   and Canada, allowing the state to import and export electricity. These
   imports and exports must be scheduled with the ISO, so that they know
   how much electricity is flowing through the grid at any time. The
   values for imports and exports shown here are taken from the hour-ahead
   market data available at the ISO website. More information and data
   links available here. Back to top.
