           ATSDR RELEASES STAUFFER CHEMICAL CO. SITE RADIOLOGICAL

            HEALTH CONSULTATION AND SCHEDULES OPEN HOUSE MEETINGS
     __________________________________________________________________

   What: The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a
   public health agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
   Services, today released its draft public health consultation
   "Evaluating Dose Measurements of Gamma Radiation for Residents near the
   Stauffer Chemical Company Superfund Site and Vicinity Properties Tarpon
   Springs and Holiday, Florida."

   The document is a draft for public comment and reviews individual gamma
   radiation dose measurements for participants in a study conducted in
   1999 by the Pinellas County Health Dept.

   ATSDR reviewed the Pinellas County data as a follow-up to ATSDR's 1999
   public health assessment addendum for the Stauffer Chemical site and as
   part of a draft public health response plan for the site released in
   June 2001.

   At their request, people living near the Stauffer plant who were
   concerned about the possibility of phosphorus slag from the plant
   emitting harmful levels of radiation had their individual exposure to
   gamma radiation measured with a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). The
   study participants wore the TLD's all day for a 30-day period.

   From 1947 to 1981, phosphorus slag from the Stauffer plant was used as
   a construction material in nearby roads, buildings, driveways and
   homes.

   ATSDR concluded that the combined gamma radiation doses from homes and
   pavement with phosphorus slag measured for residents near the former
   Stauffer chemical plant are consistent with background levels and do
   not pose a health risk to the community.

   One study participant's dose level exceeded background level, though
   not at a level of health concern. As a precaution, ATSDR recommends
   that Pinellas County or the state of Florida remeasure the
   participant's exposure and perform a radiation survey at the
   participant's residence.

   Public Comment Period: The draft public health consultation is
   available for public review and comment. The public comment period for
   the health consultation will end February 15, 2002.

   Repository copies of the document are available for public review at
   the Tarpon Springs Library, 138 E. Lemon Street, Tarpon Springs,
   Florida. Written comments about the health consultation should be sent
   to:

     Chief, Program Evaluation, Records and Information Services Branch
                ATSDR, 1600 Clifton Road, NE, Mailstop E-56
                          Atlanta, Georgia 30333

   Open-House Meetings: Open-house meetings for Pinellas and Pasco County
   residents interested in ATSDR's health consultation will be held:

             January 29, 2002              January 29, 2002
         10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.       6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
          South Holiday Library    Citizens Alliance for Progress
          4649 Mile Stretch Dr.
               Holiday, FL        401 E. Martin Luther King Jr., Dr.
                                          Tarpon Springs, FL

   These open-house meetings are not intended to be large-scale meetings.
   Instead, community members may drop in at any time to discuss the
   health consultation with ATSDR staff.

   Background: ATSDR's mission is to prevent adverse human health effects
   and diminished quality of life from exposure to hazardous substances
   from waste sites, unplanned releases, and other sources of pollution
   present in the environment.

   Public health assessments and health consultations report information
   about hazardous substances in the environment and evaluate whether
   exposure to those substances in the past, present or future could harm
   people in the area. They identify other public health activities that
   might be needed and make recommendations to other government agencies,
   such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state and local
   health and environmental departments, concerning actions to protect
   public health.

   Comments received during the public comment period will be logged and
   become part of the consultation's administrative record. Comments
   (without identifying who made them) and responses will be included in
   an appendix to the final health consultation. Although names of those
   who submit comments will not be included in the final health
   consultation, they are subject to release under Freedom of Information
   Act.

   For More Information: Community members seeking information on the
   procedures or content of the health consultation should contact ATSDR
   Health Physicist Michael Brooks, toll free, at 1-888-42-ATSDR
   (1-888-422-8737). Callers should refer to the "Stauffer Chemical Co.
   site." ATSDR Regional Representative Carl Blair in Atlanta also may be

   Members of the news media are requested to make an appointment to
   interview ATSDR staff. Phone Mike Groutt or John Florence, in the ATSDR
