     * Nuclear Science and Physics Programs Invest in a Major Expansion of
       the PDSF Computer Cluster at NERSC

     By John Hules
     Eighty-two new servers and significant improvements in the overall
     computing and networking infrastructure will be added this fall to
     the PDSF (Parallel Distributed Systems Facility), a large
     Linux-based computer cluster that is currently operated as a
     partnership between three Berkeley Lab divisions: Nuclear Science,
     Physics, and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
     Center (NERSC). Computing power will be expanded by 57
     dual-processor nodes, and storage capacity will be tripled.
     The PDSF serves the data-intensive computing needs of international
     high energy and nuclear physics experiments at the worlds most
     powerful accelerator centers -- including the AGS/RHIC complex at
     Brookhaven National Laboratory (STAR, E895), CERN (NA49, ATLAS,
     ALICE), and Fermilab (CDF, E871) -- as well as neutrino detectors in
     Canada (SNO) and Antarctica (AMANDA), and other experiments that are
     expanding our knowledge of the universe.
     "The large computing and storage capabilities of the PDSF play an
     essential role in helping researchers extract the physics from the
     terabytes of data that they produce," said Lee Schroeder, director
     of Berkeley Labs Nuclear Science Division. "For example, the STAR
     experiment is producing descriptions of nuclear collisions at the
     highest heavy ion collider energies ever achieved, and SNOs first
     physics results are helping to solve the solar neutrino problem and
     provide further evidence for neutrino oscillations. These great
     physics results were made possible by the dedication of the
     NERSC/PDSF staff and their close collaboration with the research
     teams."
     Projects that use the PDSF provide support for expansion and
     upgrades of the system. Currently the Berkeley Lab Nuclear Science
     and Physics divisions and the NERSC Center cover the costs of four
     NERSC Division employees who provide system administration and user
     support. The sponsoring divisions within the DOE Office of Science
     are Nuclear Physics, High Energy Physics, and Mathematical,
     Information, and Computational Sciences.
     Clusters are assemblies of commodity computers designed and
     networked to operate as a single system. The PDSF currently consists
     of 281 processors with a theoretical peak processing capacity of 155
     gigaflop/s and a total storage capacity of 7.5 terabytes. When the
     current expansion is completed in October 2001, the PDSF will have
     395 processors, and the number of disk vaults will grow from 15 to
     40, with a total 24 terabytes of shared storage.
     Each new node will have two 1-gigahertz Pentium III CPUs, with 1 GB
     of memory per CPU. Gigabit Ethernet networking for the
     high-bandwidth compute nodes will enable the PDSF to run parallel
     processing jobs that require up to 50 nodes (100 processors). In
     addition, Gigabit Ethernet for the disk vaults will make it possible
     to take advantage of the server-side performance improvements of the
     2.4 Linux kernel.
     The STAR Collaboratio is the largest user of the PDSF and is making
     the largest investment in its expansion.. The PDSF has become such
     an integral and indispensable part of the projects data analysis
     that they have changed the standard acknowledgment for all their
     publications to recognize NERSCs support.
     Other research groups contributing to the current PDSF expansion are
     the CDF experiment at Fermilab, the Cosmic Microwave Background
     astrophysics program at Berkeley Lab, the ATLAS experiment at CERN,
     the DeepSearch supernova experiment, and the Relativistic Nuclear
     Collisions program at Berkeley Lab.
     In addition to the new servers and disk vaults, the expansion will
     include added memory for some compute nodes as well as upgrades to
     console servers, switches, networking cables, disk drives, software,
     and miscellaneous tools -- all with the goal of continuing to
     provide a reliable, well-supported resource that meets its users
     growing needs.
