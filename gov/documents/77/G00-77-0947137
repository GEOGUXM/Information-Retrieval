   The Pesticide and Environmental Toxicology Section (PETS) is composed
   of four units. The Pesticide and Food Toxicology Unit carries out risk
   assessment and hazard evaluation activities related to pesticides and
   other chemical contaminants in food and consumer products. These
   include evaluating chemical contamination of raw agricultural
   commodities, processed foods, and environmental media in cases of
   accidental release. Staff within the program perform activities
   required by legislation to review risk characterizations prepared by
   the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) and to evaluate pesticide
   toxicity data in support of pesticide use and regulation in California.

   The activities of the Pesticide Epidemiology Unit involve the following
   legislatively mandated programs: pesticide illness surveillance,
   epidemiological and other assistance to local health officers in the
   event of an outbreak of pesticide poisoning, and joint and mutual
   responsibility with the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) to
   develop regulations to protect workers exposed to agriculture
   pesticides. OEHHA has a mandated membership on the Pesticide
   Registration Evaluation Committee. The Unit also provides education and
   training on the recognition, management, and reporting of pesticide
   poisoning to health professionals and others, and provides guidelines
   for medical supervision and cholinesterase monitoring of agricultural
   pest control workers. Risk communication activities carried out by the
   Unit include education for the public and for county health departments
   on pesticide related health issues.

   The Water Toxicology Unit performs major risk assessment and hazard
   evaluation activities relating to chemical contaminants in drinking
   water. These activities include developing health advisories, action
   levels, and public health goals for chemical substances in drinking
   water, and providing toxicological assistance for chemical monitoring
   activities for the drinking water supply. The program also provides
   education to the public and other governmental agencies on drinking
   water contamination and regulatory standards development.

   The Fish and Water Quality Evaluation Unit evaluates chemical
   contaminants in fish and wildlife and develops fish consumption health
   advisories. Fish consumption advisories are published in the California
   Sport Regulations and are part of a public communications program
   intended to help protect citizens, including sensitive subpopulations,
   against toxic chemicals. The program also conducts mandated marine
   population studies, develops fish sampling designs, and collaborates
   with other agencies in the mandated Coastal Fish Contamination Program.
