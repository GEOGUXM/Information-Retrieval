   The California Office of the Patient Advocate is pleased to present the
   first annual HMO Report Card. Please try it out and see how quality
   counts when choosing an HMO.

   The quality of medical care and service you get from HMOs is different
   from plan to plan. Some HMOs and their doctors get good grades. Others
   don't.
     * Some HMOs help find problems early, avoiding illness
     * Some HMOs do a better job in caring for members with a serious
       condition
     * Some HMOs make it easy to get the care you need

   See what HMO members say about their health plans and learn how good
   the care is when results from medical records are compared. Consider
   what is most important to you in How to Get Quality from your HMO.

   The California Department of Managed Care also helps members who have
   complaints about their HMO and are not satisfied with the efforts of
   the HMO to solve the problem. See the Ready to Resolve Your HMO Problem
   Report to compare HMOs on the number and types of member complaints
   that the Department of Managed Care has handled.
