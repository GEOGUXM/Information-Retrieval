                                                  What is the ozone layer?

   High up in the atmosphere, in a region called the stratosphere between
   19 and 30 km above the Earth's surface, ozone is constantly being
   produced and destroyed naturally. This ozone layer filters out UV rays
   from the Sun and protects life on Earth. Usually there is a fine
   balance between the build up and loss of ozone. However, any decrease
   in the amount of ozone in the ozone layer will increase the amount of
   ultra-violet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth's surface, and worsen
   the impacts due to UV exposure. UV rays from the Sun can be very
   damaging to many things on Earth. For example, prolonged exposure to
   the Sun's UV radiation causes sunburn, which over many years can
   develop into skin cancer. UV rays can also damage eyesight. UV rays are
   also harmful to other forms of wildlife, particularly small plants and
   animals living in the sea called plankton. Plankton is not protected
   from the Sun's rays, which can penetrate water to a depth of many
   meters. Plankton forms the base of the ocean food chain. UV rays can
   damage certain crops, like rice, which many people in the world rely on
   for food. Finally, UV rays can damage paint, clothing and other
   materials.

                        What causes ozone depletion?

        In the 1970s it was discovered that man-made chemicals called
      chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were destroying the ozone in the ozone
      layer. CFCs contain chlorine which may be released under certain
    stratosperhic conditions and react with ozone. Once the chlorine has
    broken up one ozone molecule, it is freed to repeat the process again
    and again, up to 100,000 times. Thankfully, the use of CFCs has been
    banned since 1996. However, because CFCs remain in the air for a long
    time, they will continue to affect the ozone layer well into the 21st
                                  century.

                    What is the South Pole "ozone hole"?

   Scientists believed that ozone levels were quite stable until the late
     1970s. Since then, a general decline in ozone levels has been seen.
     This ozone loss is believed to be related, in part, to increases in
   chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere from human-produced chemicals.
       However, every year during September and October (the Southern
    Hemisphere spring), ozone loss is much greater over Antarctica, where
                            an ozone hole forms.
    The hole forms because the stratosphere above Antarctica becomes very
    cold in winder and is cut off from the rest of the world by a natural
    circulation of wind called the Polar Vortex. This prevents mixing in
     the atmosphere and so any ozone depletion is concentrated here. In
     addition, the very cold temperatures in the air cause clouds in the
   stratosphere which speed up ozone depletion by chlorine and bromine. In
    summer (December and January), the ozone hole repairs itself when new
   ozone comes from lower latitudes, but forms again the following spring.

       How does amount of ozone in the atmosphere effect UV radiation?

    Changes in ozone concentration in the atmosphere affect ultra violet
      (UV) radiation. The UV portion of the solar spectrum is generally
   divided into three regions: 1) UV-A (315-400 nm); 2) UV-B (280-315 nm);
     and 3) UV-C (< 280 nm). The UV-A is essentially unaffected by ozone
    absorption; the UV-B is strongly affected by variations in ozone; and
     the UV-C is almost entirely absorbed before it reaches the surface.
     Even a small increase in the amount of UV-B radiation can cause an
              increase in health problems such as skin cancer.
     At the earth's surface, the incoming solar radiation depends on the
    absorption and scattering of the atmosphere, the earth-sun distance,
    and the irradiance of the sun. The atmospheric transmission in the UV
   portion of the spectrum is controlled primarily by Rayleigh scattering
      by air molecules, scattering by clouds, and absorption by ozone.
   Aerosol particle scattering and absorption can also play a significant
   role. Solar UV irradiance arriving at the earth's surface is controlled
   by both natural and anthropogenic effects in both the stratosphere and
                              the troposphere.

   What role does CMDL play in ozone monitoring?

         The Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), part of
        NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), traces its
         roots in ozone monitoring back to the U.S. Weather Bureau and its
          measurements of total column ozone as part of the International
       Geophysical Year (IGY), 1957. W.D. Komhyr established the U.S. Dobson
        network in its current form with well-characterized and calibrated
       instruments and standardized operating procedures in the early 1960s.

      The NOAA/CMDL Cooperative Dobson network of 16 stations (including five
    sites within the continental U.S., one in Hawaii, and another at the
   South Pole with data records of nearly forty years in length) observes
        the total atmospheric ozone column using ground-based Dobson
    spectrophotometers. The instruments are regularly calibrated against
     World Standard Dobson No. 83 maintained by CMDL and provide a very
      stable observational record well suited for determining long-term
    changes in ozone. The World Standard is calibrated annually at Mauna
   Loa Observatory. Data from Dobson No. 83 at Mauna Loa are also used for
               validating satellite column ozone measurements.

   A network of eight ozonesonde sites makes weekly ozone vertical profile
     observations from the surface to about 35 km using electrochemical
    concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes. Three of these sites, Boulder,
    Colorado; Hilo, Hawaii; and South Pole, Antarctica have records of at
    least 15 years in length covering a significant portion of the period
   that stratospheric ozone has been declining. The unique record from the
      South Pole Station shows the annual development of the springtime
    Antarctic "ozone hole" along with deepening of the "ozone hole" over
      the past two decades. Because of the sensitivity of the Antarctic
   stratosphere ozone layer to depletion from human-produced chlorine and
      bromine compounds, the ozone profile measurements should provide
       sensitive indicators of ozone recovery as the ozone destroying
                             compounds decrease.

       Along with the total column and profile measurements of ozone,
      measurements of the human produced chlorine and bromine compounds
     responsible for ozone depletion have been made by CMDL since 1977.
     Weekly flask grab samples and continuous in situ analyzer data from
   eight stations, ranging from the high Arctic to the South Pole, provide
   information on the gases that are the source of chlorine and bromine in
    the stratosphere. These data show that effective equivalent chlorine
     (this accounts for bromine as well as chlorine) peaked in the lower
          atmosphere in 1994 and has since begun to slowly decline.
