   revised and extended edition of 1894.
   Elements of Style
   Write by the rules.
   Travlang's Translating Dictionaries
   An amazing variety of translators, including English-to-Spanish,

   English-to-Esparanto, and more (including the reverse of each of
   these)!
   The Wordsmyth English Dictionary-Thesaurus (WEDT)
   A full dictionary and a complete thesaurus, integrated into one work;
   you only need to look up a word once, with hyperlinks to synonyms, and
   similar or related words available where appropriate.
