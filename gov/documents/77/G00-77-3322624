   The bandwidth of various parts of the production system are listed
   below:
     * Tape drive - The tape drive hardware is not decided. Before the
       start of Run 2 it is quite likely that newer technology with 6 MB/s
       speed or higher with capacity around 50 GB will mature. In that
       case we'll need 5 input tape drives and 3 output tape drives, plus
       a few more for buffering and spare.
     * Disk - The disk speed from an early test was approximately 20 MB/s.
       With RAID disks, the disk speed is expected to reach 50 MB/s or
       more. However, it will drop considerably if multiple read/write
       occurs on the same disk array whether or not the disk head
       contention costs much performance. Therefore it may be desirable to
       avoid multiple read/write on the same physical disks.
     * I/O bus: The fibre channel on input/output nodes should have
       bandwidth around 1 Gb/s, or 90 MB/s.The SCSI bus on the worker
       nodes will probably have bandwidth of 20-40 MB/s. The bandwidth on
       worker nodes is not a problem because there are multiple worker
       nodes. The bandwidth on the output node is also suitable to sustain
       5 concurrent read/write tasks of 11 MB/s each.
     * Network - The network on input/output nodes will be gigabit
       Ethernet (90 MB/s wire speed), and on worker nodes are 100BaseT (9
       MB/s). With multiple worker nodes the bandwidth is sufficient.
       Overall there are known no show-stoppers on bandwidth issues.
