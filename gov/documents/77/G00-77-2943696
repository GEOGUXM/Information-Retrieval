                  Welcome to the Quarterly Banking Profile
   The Quarterly Banking Profile (QBP) is a quarterly publication that
   provides the earliest comprehensive summary of financial results for
   all FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions.
     * This report card on industry status and performance includes
       written analyses, graphs, and statistical tables.
     * It is published approximately 75 days after the end of each quarter
       (i.e., 75 days after March 31, June 30, September 30, and December
       31).
     * Internet editions of the Quarterly Banking Profile are available
       beginning with the December 31, 1994, issue.
     * An accompanying publication consisting solely of charts and graphs,
       the QBP Graph Book, is available for editions dating back to
       December 31, 1995.
     * Additionally, the State Banking Performance Summary provides key
       financial and ratio data for commercial banks and savings
       institutions in each state. Information is available dating back to
       the June 30 1997, report period.

   During the FDIC's Quarterly Banking Report press briefing of 9/20
   several then-unanswerable questions concerned how the banking industry
   may respond to the events of 9/11. We have subsequently conducted a
   review "How the Banking Industry has Responded to Crisis" that
   addresses these concerns.
