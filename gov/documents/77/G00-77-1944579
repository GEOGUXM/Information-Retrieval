   Magnetized Target Fusion
   LANL is working on a new experimental program in Magnetized Target
   Fusion (MTF). MTF involves compressing a few-centimeter scale
   magnetized (~ 50-100 kilogauss) target plasma with a fast-moving metal
   wall. We believe it has the potential to create a burning fusion plasma
   in the laboratory for a very low capital cost.  In FY00-02 experiments
   are aimed at demonstrating production of a suitable target plasma. In
   follow-on experiments, not yet funded, the plasma target will be
   imploded on the Shiva-Star pulsed power facility at the Air Force
   Research Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, using deuterium fuel for the
   plasma. We are aiming at achieving a 10:1 cylindrical compression of
   the plasma, using liner compression technology at a few megajoules of
   energy to provide the power to adiabatically heat the plasma to
   fusion-relevant conditions.

   The new plasma injector experiment for MTF at LANL, named FRX-L (field
   reversed experiment - liner) is now operational (9/2001), and has begun
   to make static (non-translated) high energy FRC plasmas.
