      Why did NASA Headquarters change the Dial-in process?
        * HQ is protecting its systems and services with an improved security
          architecture, including a firewall system.
        * The only remote access to the HQ private services (e.g.File and
          Print services) is through the dial-in service.
        * The prior dial-in service had weak security compared to the rest of
          the security architecture because:






        * Same password was used to access many different services (e.g. HQ,
          ISP).






        * Passwords were written down.






        * Passwords were easily guessed or compromised (e.g. names, dates,
          etc.).






        * Scripted passwords (anyone having access to your computer may have
          access to HQ systems).






        * If the computer system was sold or stolen this could have resulted
          in the compromise of current scripted passwords.






     Intruders were seeking out these weaknesses and exploiting them.







   How does SecurID provide additional security and protect our data?
     * SecurID can only be used for dial-in access.






     * Token codes are randomly generated and change every minute.






     * Cannot be guessed






     * Useless if written






     * Passcodes cannot be scripted






   What is SecurID and how does it work?
     * SecurID Tokens






     * 6-digit number generators






     * Numbers are called TOKENCODEs






     * All 6 digits must be entered






     Used in conjunction with a PIN







     * 4-8 character alphanumeric password






     * Set by you; doesn't expire






     * Type in the PIN followed by the TOKENCODE






     * Combination is called a PASSCODE






   Will the standard token work for the visually impaired?


     * No, a special software based token is available for the visually
       impaired which will provide the same level of security.
     * For further assistance please call 202-(202) 358-HELP (4357);
