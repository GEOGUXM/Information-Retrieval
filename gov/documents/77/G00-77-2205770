   Mission Statement

              "Provide the U.S. with access to the Measurement traceability
        that promotes innovation, increases competitiveness, and facilitates
        trade so as to maximize the impact, importance, relevance, and
        effectiveness of NIST measurement technology."

   Vision Statement

              "Our Country served with world-leading measurement
        traceability pathways, data products, and services
        ."

   Overview

              The NIST Office of Measurement Services (OMS)
        facilitates access to measurement and standards activities of NIST
        Laboratories and Programs through the dissemination of NIST
        products, data, and services. OMS is composed of three programs:
        Standard Reference Materials, Calibration, Standard Reference Data.
        The first two make up the largest and most successful measurement
        traceability in the world. The third OMS program provides
        scientists, engineers and the general public access to critically
        evaluated data necessary to perform state-of-the-art research and
        development, and product and process development.

              Through these programs the measurement standards and services
        generated in the technical laboratories of NIST are provided to meet
        the needs of state and local governments, federal agencies,
        industry, and the scientific community for traceability, at
        necessary levels of accuracy, to national standards. Measurement
        services provides expert guidance and services regarding legal
        metrology to state and local governments, business, and industry to
        ensure measurement uniformity, traceability, and equity in domestic
        and international commerce.

              The Office of Measurement Services has successfully placed
        these traditional and discrete services within the context of the
        critical regulatory, market, and trade issues of today. This
        coordinating effort has served to heighten the importance,
        effectiveness, and relevance of the technological assistance that
        NIST provides.

              The linking of industry's measurements to NIST via the
        outreach and technology transfer programs under the office of
        Measurement Services umbrella assures
        that the United States receives the superior services synonymous
        with NIST's reputation for technological excellence.
