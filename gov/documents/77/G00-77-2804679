   Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Sunday, 1 to

   collection of local preservers, David Lawrence and Herman Bigham. There
   are over 50 priceless sculptures representing diverse cultural
   traditions and affirming various aspects of African motherhood. One
   such sculpture, Bamoum Ancestral Mother, originates from Cameroon,
   Central Africa and is a representation of the pregnant mother of
   fertility and mankind. Some of these Museum quality pieces have been
   valued between thirty and forty thousand dollars by the Director of
   Sotheby's African & Oceanic Section. To interview David Lawrence,
