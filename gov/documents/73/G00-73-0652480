   MODIS Instrument Operations

                                [bluebar.GIF]

   The purpose of the MODIS Instrument Operations Team (IOT) is to plan,
   schedule, and monitor MODIS activities.

   Planning

   Operational Activities (OAs) have been designed to meet all MODIS
   science requirements. Descriptions of these OAs can be found in the
   MODIS Operations Concept Document (OCD).

   If you are planning a MODIS Field Campaign, please use the Field
   Campaign Notification Form to coordinate your efforts with the MODIS
   IOT. Thank you!

   Scheduling

   The MODIS Instrument Operations Team schedules a daily set of
   Operational Activities using the Instrument Support Toolkit (IST)
   software package provided by the EOS Flight Operations Segment.

   If you would like to request a MODIS activity be added to the schedule,
   please download this MS Word version of the Schedule Change Form (from
   Appendix B of the OCD). After the form has been filled out completely
   and has received all necessary signatures, please send it to the MODIS
   IOT for review.

   Monitoring

   The MODIS IOT will monitor all housekeeping telemetry for non-nominal
   conditions. In the event of an out-of-limits state, the MODIS IOT will
   follow recovery procedures as defined in the MODIS Fault Detection and
   Recovery Document.

   Information regarding telemetry trending, limited life items, and
   instrument anomalies can be found in the MODIS IOT Weekly Reports.

   The INSTRUMENT OPS sub-links in the menu bar on the left of this screen
   will take you to the following locations:

   Health and Status describes the current state of the MODIS Instrument.

   Weekly Reports is where one may view a week-by-week summary of the
   MODIS instrument and MODIS IOT activities.

   Load Reports allows the user to view flight data products related to
   the MODIS Instrument.

   Field Campaigns is where the user may submit a field Campaign
   Notification Form

   IOT Documents list several MODIS IOT specific links to files and sites
   (differs from the MCST Links site).
