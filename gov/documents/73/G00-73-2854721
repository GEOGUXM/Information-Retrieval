  Vision

   East Tennessee's "Technology Corridor" is forging the model for
   America's 21st Century economy. From Chattanooga to Oak Ridge to
   Knoxville to the Tri-Cities , working partnerships between the public
   and private sectors of the region are sharing resources to create jobs
   and opportunity. Setting the example, East Tennessee is clearly the
   place to live and do business.

  Mission

   The Summit will demonstrate Knoxville's entrepreneurial leadership in
   the "Technology Corridor", build regional relationships, focus on
   linking the resources of East Tennessee to the world, and showcase the
   region's unique blend of natural and technological resources.

  Theme

   We have evolved from the mountains of the Southern Highlands. Our
   Present is a product of our relationship to these mountains, the rivers
   flowing from them, and the people who have settled amongst them over
   time. The quality of our Future is dependent upon how well we honor
   this mountain heritage and balance economic growth with protection of
   nature's gifts. The Summit is about our actions to integrate expanded
   financial, intellectual and technological efforts to assure that
   economic prosperity occurs, but not at nature's expense... for our
   quality of life is our most precious resource.
