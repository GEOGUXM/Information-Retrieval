   Need Help with PDF?
   The pamphlets and booklets we mention can be downloaded right off this
   site, in Portable Document Format, or PDF.  They'll look just like they
   do on the screen, complete with the                              text
   layout, graphics and images.

   Before You Print
   To view or print these PDF files, you need a free software "plug-in,"
   known as the Adobe Acrobat Reader. This plug-in is useful for lots of
   sites throughout the World Wide Web. It's also free and easy to
   install. Just follow these simple instructions.

   Download and Install
   To download and install the
   Adobe Acrobat Reader, click on the download button below and follow
   these easy steps.
    1. Register with Adobe (if you haven't already registered as an
       Acrobat Reader user)

    2. Choose the Reader version, platform version, and language version
       you need, from the pop-up lists.

    3. Click the "Download" button at the bottom of the page. You may need
       to use the "Save Next Link As..." or "Save to Disk" functions of
       your Web browser.

    4. After the application has downloaded, quit your Web browser.

    5. Double-click the newly downloaded file.

    6. Follow the installation instructions on your screen.
       See the Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 Troubleshooting Guide for
       assistance.
