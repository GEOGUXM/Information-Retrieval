                                          Data

         The NEGP presents the new Interactive Data Center. The Data Center
         allows you to view 10 years of data through tables and graphs, compare
         states, compare your state to other states and the nation, and to find
         out who the highest performing states in the nation are on particular
         goal indicators.

         The National Education Goals Panel believes that policymakers and
         others interested in education need good information to help them
         monitor state progress toward the National Education Goals. The Panel
         believes that those interested in improving the quality of education in
         America need to be able to monitor educational progress over time,
         benchmark state performance against the best in the nation and the best
         in the world, and determine whether all groups of students in a state
         are achieving at high levels. Technically sound and timely data help
         policymakers and others evaluate education progress and make sound
         decisions. This page allows you to examine how much progress each state
         and the nation have made toward the National Education Goals since they
         were established in 1990. You can compare your state to others, compare
         how states are doing on a specific indicator of progress, or read the
         key findings from the most recent NEGP report.
