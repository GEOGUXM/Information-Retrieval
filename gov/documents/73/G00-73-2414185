                            OMNI Live Data Flows

    Live data from the OMNI testbed is normally available 24 hours a day.
    During development activities it may be paused temporarily but should
      resume shortly. During Inspection Day '99 the OMNI equipment will
      operate in mobile mode to act like a satellite. In this mode the
   equipment is located in a van that drives around GSFC and delivers live
   data via the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The
                currently scheduled TDRSS support times are:
               * Wed. 11/03/99 09:00-17:00 CST
               * Thu. 11/04/99 09:00-17:00 CST
               * Fri. 11/05/99 09:00-17:00 CST

                                              [OMNIvan.sml.jpg]
   Live data will not be accessible for approximately one hour before and
   after these times while the equipment is moved between the building and
                                  the van.
