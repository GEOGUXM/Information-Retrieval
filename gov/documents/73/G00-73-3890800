   Impacts of Climate Change and Land Use on the Southwestern United
   States

   Introduction

   This interactive workshop was designed to provide background
   information and stimulate discussion on the effects of climate
   variability, possible natural and human-related long-term climate
   change, and land-use change in the rapidly-growing southwestern United
   States.

   This information will be used by the U.S. Global Change Research
   Program as part of a national assessment of Global Change issues.

   This web conference was open for interactive participation from Monday,
   July 7th through Friday, July 25th, 1997. The articles and comments
   will remain available indefinitely.

   In addition to this web workshop, a three-day face-to-face workshop on
   this same topic was held at the Udall Center, University of Arizona,
   September 3-5, 1997.
