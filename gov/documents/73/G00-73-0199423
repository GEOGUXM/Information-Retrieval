       Background

   An on-line guide and answers to frequently asked questions on the
   Boards accessibility guidelines for play areas are now available. This
   guidance is designed to clarify and interpret  various requirements of
   guidelines, which the Board issued in October, 2000 under the Americans
   with Disabilities Act (ADA). The guidelines specify the minimum level
   of accessibility required in the construction and alteration of play
   areas covered by the law. The Board issued these requirements as a
   supplement to its existing ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) which
   originally did not provide any provisions specific to play areas.
   Since the guidelines are one of the first of their kind in providing a
   comprehensive set of criteria for accessible play areas, the Board
   developed this guidance to help users understand and follow the
   guidelines.  This material guide covers all parts of the play area
   requirements, including the number of play components required to be
   accessible, accessible surfacing in play areas, ramp and transfer
   system access to elevated structures, and access to soft contained play
   structures.
