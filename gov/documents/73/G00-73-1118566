               January 2002 Cost-of-Living Adjustment

        Retired Federal employees and entitled surviving family members of
        deceased Federal employees and retirees will receive a
        cost-of-living increase effective December 1, 2001, which will first
        be reflected in the benefit payable January 2, 2002.

        Under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the
        Organization Retirement and Disability System (ORDS), the
        cost-of-living increase will be 2.6 percent for those who have
        received benefits for at least one year. The 2.6 percent increase
        was determined by computing the percentage increase in the Consumer
        Price Index (CPI) for urban wage earners and clerical workers from
        the third quarter average of 2000 to the third quarter average of
        2001, as provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
        Statistics.

        Under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) and FERS
        Special, the cost-of-living increase will be 2.0 percent for those
        who have received benefits for at least one year. This amount was
        derived from the same CPI comparison as CSRS. However, if the change
        in the Consumer Price Index is between two and three percent, the
        FERS COLA is 2.0 percent. Federal Employees' Retirement System and
        FERS Special adjustments are not provided until age 62, except for
        disability and survivor benefits.

        To get the full COLA, a retiree or survivor annuity must have begun
        no later than December 31, 2000. If not, the increase is prorated
        under both plans. Pro rated accounts receive one-twelfth of the
        increase for each month they received benefits. For example, if the
        benefit commenced November 30, 2001, the prorated COLA would be
        one-twelfth of the full COLA.

        Under both plans, benefits are paid on the first business day of the
        month after the month in which they accrue. Benefits which accrue in
        December 2001 are payable on January 2, 2002.

        Note: A benefit will not be increased if it would cause the
        annuitant to receive payments in excess of any cap amount specified
        by law.

        The attached tables show the actual prorated percentages that apply,
        under both plans, according to the month in which the annuity began.
