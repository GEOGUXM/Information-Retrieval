   John Lumpkin, M.D., M.P.H.
   Chair, National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics
   6525 Belcrest Road
   Room 1100
   Hyattsville, MD 20782-2003

   Dear Dr. Lumpkin:

   Thank you for your letters regarding the implementation of the
   administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). You raise many
   important issues, several of which are under active discussion at the
   Department of Health and Human Services (the Department).

   We would like to respond to the specific recommendations in your
   letters. Because of the number of recommendations and our wish to be
   responsive to you in terms of current efforts at the Centers for
   Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Department, we have prepared an
   enclosure.

   As always, we welcome your recommendations regarding implementation on
   HIPAAÂ’s administrative simplification provisions. The National Provider
   Identifier final rule cannot be published until budget commitments for
   the costs of enumeration have been made, which we do not expect before
   FY 2003. As we continue implementation efforts, we look forward to
   working with the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics.

     Sincerely,

     / s /

     Claude A. Allen
     Deputy Secretary

   RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESPONSES ON HIPPA IMPLEMENTATION

    Recommendation:

     Provide early guidance on new policies.

    Response:

     We have provided guidance on several occasions (including providing
     guidance on the privacy regulation and sending you a letter
     regarding our intention to publish a proposed rule revising the drug
     coding standard) and will continue to do so whenever feasible.
     However, we are not able to provide information on final rules which
     are in the formal clearance process.

    Recommendation:

     Allow flexibility in the enforcement of the new standards.

    Response:

     The Department is planning to develop a regulation on enforcement of
     the HIPAA standards and will take your advice into consideration
     when we begin.

    Recommendation:

     Oppose delays in the compliance dates for the HIPAA standards such
     as those found in section 836.

    Response:

     We share your concern regarding the potential effects of delays.
     However, the Administration has taken no position on the pending
     legislation. We are proceeding with the compliance dates as stated
     in final regulations.

    Recommendation:

     Publish and implement HIPAA regulations quickly.

    Response:

     We recognize the need to issue these regulations as soon as
     possible. The Department is working toward publishing the final rule
     on security, and a proposed rule on a claims attachment standard, by
     the end of the year. The National Provider Identifier rule is
     currently under development.

    Recommendation:

     Expedite the HIPAA change process.

    Response:

     We are committed to working with designated standards maintenance
     organizations (DSMOs) in order to streamline the process and will
     work to publish the recommended changes in regulations as soon as
     possible.

    Recommendation:

     Explore consistent standards for paper transactions.

    Response:

     We will work through our Department representatives to the National
     Uniform Claim Committee and to the National Uniform Billing
     Committee to bring this issue to the attention of the Committee.

    Recommendation:

     Accept DMSO recommendations for changes to the standard electronic
     transactions and code sets.

    Response:

     The Department has already begun the development of the regulations
     necessary to adopt these changes and intends to publish them as
     quickly as possible. We are working toward publication of a final
     rule early in Calendar year 2002. In addition, in order to ease your
     concerns regarding the coverage of the standard code sets, we will
     monitor the efforts of code set maintainers to ensure they are
     meeting the needs of the health care industry.
