   Board Presents FY '02 Budget Request to House Subcommittee

                                                       TRANSLATE THIS PAGE

   ((WASHINGTON -May 1, 2001) The CSB has presented its Fiscal Year 2002
   budget request to members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on
   VA, HUD and Independent Agencies. The CSB is asking for $9 million, an
   increase from the current $7.5 million appropriation.

   Board Member Dr. Andrea Kidd Taylor, speaking on behalf of the other
   members, told Congress that the CSB "has completed a significant
   turnaround", saying "we have reorganized and revitalized the Board."

   Taylor noted that the CSB has, in the past year, published three
   incident investigation reports, established incident selection criteria
   and developed and published the agency's five year strategic plan. The
   CSB has also initiated two new incident investigations, and this summer
   is scheduled to complete a major investigation into the hazards of
   reactive chemicals.

   Taylor also said the CSB will issue two safety bulletins explaining the
   lessons learned from previous incidents investigated by its staff. One
   of the bulletins will specifically address the procedures used to
   maintain safety during the changing of chemical process conditions,
   known within the industry as "Management of Change".

   "These reports and investigations demonstrate that the Board is
   actively engaged in carrying out our mission," Taylor said.

   Taylor said the CSB is "a young agency" that "unlike other independent
   agencies such as NTSB and CPSC, that were largely created from existing
   organizations, we are still creating our infrastructure and recruiting
   our employees one-by-one. Under our plan, it will require four more
   years for us to reach full strength, if we receive all the funds we
   need to achieve that goal."

   Taylor told the subcommittee, "We recognize we are asking for a
   substantial percentage increase in our budget. But the $1.5 million is
   modest in terms of the entire federal budget. This amount will enable
   us to build the infrastructure needed to deal with serious chemical
   incidents that are certain to occur over the next few years."

   The complete written testimony submitted to the House Appropriations
   Committee, Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies, is
   available as both a Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF file.
