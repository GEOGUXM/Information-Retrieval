Fire Fighting Agents for Exposure Protection
     __________________________________________________________________

Fire experiment comparing treated and untreated vinyl siding

   Experience from previous wildland/urban interface fires indicates that
   they can be spread by burning brands. These fires start small in areas
   where the brands can collect, such as under eaves or in corners. If the
   structure can be protected from a small fire for a short period of
   time, the chances of the structure surviving the wildland/urban
   interface fire may increase dramatically.

   This experiment demonstrates the use of durable agents (in this case a
   protein-based compressed air foam) for protecting building exteriors
   from ignition. Two exterior wall sections forming a corner were
   constructed with vinyl siding over sheathing on wood framing. One hour
   before ignition, Corner A was treated with a durable agent. Corner B
   received no treatment. Both corners were exposed to a 50 kW fire for 10
   minutes. Within 3 minutes of ignition, Corner B (untreated) had flames
   extending into the eaves and roof area. After 10 minutes of fire
   exposure, Corner A had received only minor damage. The fire did not
   spread on Corner A.

   This experiment demonstrates that durable agents applied to combustible
   exterior siding, reduces the likelihood of ignition and flame spread.
   Further research needs to be done to examine the effectiveness of
   durable agents under hot, dry and windy conditions.
