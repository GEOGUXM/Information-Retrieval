Coast Guard Proposes Prop Injury Avoidance Measures

   Under a proposed rulemaking* by the U.S. Coast Guard, owners of
   non-planing recreational houseboats with propeller-driven propulsion
   located aft of the transom would be required either to equip the vessel
   with a propeller guard, or employ three combined measures: a swim
   ladder interlock, an aft visibility device, and an emergency ignition
   cut-off switch.

   The proposed rulemaking is available on the Internet, at
   http://www.uscgboating.org or http://dms.dot.gov, or call (800)
   368-5647. No public meeting on the proposal is being planned at this
   time.

   The change is in response to the National Boating Safety Advisory
   Council recommendations. While accident data does not show a high
   number of reported annual fatalities due to propeller strikes, previous
   public comment indicating great public interest on this issue and
   consultation with NBSAC motivated the Coast Guard to propose the
   rulemaking.

   To comment on the proposal, refer to the docket number for this
   rulemaking [USCG-2001-10163], indicate the specific section to which
   each comment applies, give the reason for each comment, and include
   your name and address. Comments may be submitted on or before March 11,
   2002, by mail, hand delivery, fax or electronic means, to:
