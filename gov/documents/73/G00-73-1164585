Partners for Fragile Families

   HHS has a continuing partnership with the private-sector initiative,
   Partners for Fragile Families (PFF). This initiative is aimed at
   helping fathers work with the mothers of their children in sharing the
   legal, financial, and emotional responsibilities of parenthood. In
   March 2000, HHS approved ten state waivers for the Partners for Fragile
   Families Demonstration projects. Working at the community level with
   non-profit and faith-based partners to provide employment, health, and
   social services, these projects will test new approaches to involving
   young fathers with their children and to helping mothers and fathers
   build stronger parenting partnerships. Projects sites are located in
   California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
   Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

   The Office of Child Support Enforcement has funded Fatherhood
   Development Workshops on effective practices for working with young
   unemployed and underemployed fathers; the development of a manual for
   workers to use in helping low-income fathers learn to interact more
   effectively with the child support enforcement system; and a peer
   learning college for child support enforcement experts to identify
   systemic barriers these young fathers face in becoming responsible
   fathers.

   In addition, the National Institute of Child Health and Human
   Development (NICHD) is supporting a 20-city, multi-year study of
   "fragile families." This study, funded through a private/public
   partnership, will assess the effects of father involvement on child
   well-being, including fathers who live apart from their children on a
   permanent or intermittent basis. Preliminary data from several sites
   indicates that 44 percent of never-married fathers are living with
   their partners when their baby is born, that over 80 percent of fathers
   are providing financial assistance to the child's mother during
   pregnancy, and that over 90 percent of mothers want the father to be
   involved in the child's life.

Parents' Fair Share

   Sites in seven states participated in Parents' Fair Share (PFS), a
   demonstration project that provided employment-related training,
   parenting education, peer group support, and mediation services to
   encourage low-income fathers to be more involved with their children
   and increase their payment of child support.  Current available
   reports:
     * Parenting and Providing:  The Impact of Parents' Fair Share on
       Parental Involvement, November, 2000.  Report is on the Manpower
       Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) web site.
     * Working and Earning:  The Impact of the Parents' Fair Share on
       Low-Income Fathers' Employment, November 2000.  Report is on the
       MDRC web site.

OCSE Responsible Fatherhood Demonstrations

   Eight states (California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri,
   New Hampshire, Washington, and Wisconsin) have received Responsible
   Fatherhood demonstration grants or waivers through the Office of Child
   Support Enforcement to allow them to test comprehensive approaches to
   encourage more responsible fathering by non-custodial parents. Each
   state project is different but they all provide a range of needed
   services such as job search and training, access and visitation, social
   services or referral, case management and child support. The initial
   implementation report, OCSE Responsible Fatherhood Programs:  Early
   Implementation Lessons, is available on line. A limited number of
   printed copies are available. For a single copy of the report send a
   fax labeled "Fatherhood Report" to 202-690-5514, identifying the name
   of the report you are requesting and provide your name and/or
   organization and complete mailing address.

Welfare-to-Work

   Currently, HHS is working closely with the Department of Labor to
   implement the Welfare-to-Work program, which provides grants to states
   and communities to move long-term welfare recipients and certain
   non-custodial parents of children on welfare into lasting, unsubsidized
   employment. Amendments to WtW passed last year will make it easier to
   identify fathers eligible for services. The Administration for Children
   and Families and the Employment and Training Administration in the
   Department of Labor have issued a joint guidance to State Child Support
   Enforcement agencies, State TANF agencies and Welfare-to-Work grantees
   on strategies to enhance the recruitment, referral, eligibility
   determination, and provision of services to non-custodial parents under
   the welfare-to-work program.

   WtW grants represent a new and valuable source of funding for local
   work-focused services to noncustodial parents (NCPs). The U. S.
   Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of
   Labor, sponsored a study of 11 selected WtW grantees with an NCP focus
   to identify how some WtW grantees have designed and implemented
   programs that address the employment and other service needs of NCPs.
   The study report, Serving Noncustodial Parents:  A Descriptive Study of
   Welfare-to-Work Programs, prepared by The Urban Institute and
   Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., documents a variety of recruitment
   strategies and service approaches being implemented and highlights key
   issues that must be addressed to serve this population. [The report is
   also available in PDF format.] A limited number of printed copies of
   the report are available. For copies, send a fax labeled "Serving
   Noncustodial Parents" to 202-690-5514, identifying the name of the
   report you are requesting and provide your name and/or organization and
   complete mailing address.
