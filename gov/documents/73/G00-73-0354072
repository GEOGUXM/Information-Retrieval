                28th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference

   Sessions for the 28th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference will be
   organized into six general areas as shown below. Each major area is
   sub-divided into a number of topics to facilitate the review process
   and the final organization of oral and poster sessions. Abstracts
   describing novel ideas in all technologies are encouraged.

   Authors must state the category number and sub-category letter in which
                   they wish their abstract to be reviewed
   .

      INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF ABSTRACTS FOR THE 28TH IEEE PVSC
              DEADLINE: RECEIVED BY MAIL BEFORE March 31, 2000

   Two separate abstracts are required for this conference:

   1. SHORT ABSTRACT:
   Authors are required to submit one camera-ready copy of a short
   abstract that provides a concise statement of objectives and a summary
   of important results. The short abstract must fit entirely within a
   single rectangular region

   11 cm wide by 7.5 cm tall. The recommended font style is Times New
   Roman, font size should be ten point. Single line spacing is required
   for the text of the abstract. The title must appear in CAPITAL LETTERS
   followed by a double space, then the authors and their affiliations,
   including locations, should be single spaced. This abstract will be
   reproduced directly in a bound volume for distribution at the
   conference.

   2. REVIEW ABSTRACT: Six copies of a review abstract limited to 3 pages
   maximum, including figures, must be submitted for review by the Program
   Committee. The following information must be at the top of the first
   page of the review abstract in the order shown below:
   a. Name of the author designated to receive correspondence
       b. Complete mailing address of the corresponding author
       c. Telephone number of the corresponding author
       d. FAX number of the corresponding author if available
       e. E-mail address of the corresponding author if available
       f. The category number and sub category letter
       g. The preferred mode of presentation (oral or poster)
       h. Title of the paper
       i. The list of authors and their affiliations (including mailing
       address)

   Submission of an abstract for review is considered by the Program
   Committee as an agreement that the work will not be published or
   presented by the author prior to the conference. Presentation at the
   28th IEEE PVSC does not preclude later publication of a fuller account
   of the work. If your organization requires internal review and
   approval, please secure these clearances before submission of an
   abstract.

   The review abstract will be evaluated on the basis of the clarity of
   objective, scope and method of approach, and significance of the
   results. The author designated as the author for correspondence will be
   notified of the paper's acceptance or rejection during the month of May
   2000.

   Papers must de delivered in camera-ready form at the conference, with a
   signed copyright release form, prior to presentation. All papers
   presented will be published in an IEEE Conference Proceedings, which
   will be mailed to each conference registrant. No papers will be
   published without presentation at the conference.

   No abstracts will be accepted by FAX.
   Abstracts must be received by the Program Chairperson by March 31, 2000
