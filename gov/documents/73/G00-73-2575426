   Multifactor Productivity (MFP) measures the changes in output per unit
   of combined inputs. Indexes of MFP are produced for the private
   business, private nonfarm business, and manufacturing sectors of the
   economy. MFP is also developed for 2-and 3-digit Standard Industrial
   Classification (SIC) manufacturing industries, the railroad
   transportation industry, and the utility and gas industry.

   Special Notice:

   Notice for data users who accessed multifactor productivity data
   between April 10, 2001 and May 3, 2001

   There were errors in some of the multifactor productivity available on
   the BLS web site between April 10, 2001 and May 3, 2001. The errors
   were confined to measures for the manufacturing sector and 2-digit SIC
   manufacturing industries. The 1999 data for manufacturing output and
   materials were incorrect because of a programming error. The errors did
   not affect any data for private business or private nonfarm business,
   nor did they affect any data in the quarterly Productivity and Cost
   news releases.
                                                                       Top
