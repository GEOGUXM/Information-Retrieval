   [Fork_LiftB030.gif] Just Using Existing Lessons:

     [Folder9353.gif] No computer in the classroom
     * Assign students to work the projects in a computer lab or library
     * Print out the exercise pages that come with some lessons and
       distribute them to your students

     [Floppy_Disk9073.gif] 1 non-networked computer in the classroom
     * Download the lessons onto a floppy disc on a networked computer,
       then transfer them to your non-networked computer in the classroom.
       You can then play them whenever you wish (you won't be able to use
       "live Internet data", but the lesson will still work just fine).

     * You can play the lesson inside NetScape Navigator right in the
       browser whenever you wish! You can let several students work on the
       computer at once.

   [Pencil_and_Paper81F0.gif] Making Your Own Lessons:

     Download the authoring application (for Macintosh or PCs) and create
     your own. You can either upload them to the IWE Web Site, or you can
     just play them off the computer or save them to a floppy disk.
