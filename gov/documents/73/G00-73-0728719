   Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere Products

   There are five Level-2 (Orbital Swath) MODIS Atmosphere products. Each
   has been assigned an Earth Science Data Type (ESDT) name that will be
   used in cataloging and archiving the datasets. The ESDT name for each
   product is given in parentheses, below. The Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere
   products are:

   Visit the Aerosol Product site 1. The Aerosol Product (MOD04_L2)
   monitors aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, particle size
   distribution, aerosol mass concentration, optical properites, and
   radiative forcing.

   Visit the Water Vapor Product site 2. The Water Vapor Product
   (MOD05_L2) monitors atmospheric water vapor and precipitable water.

   Visit the Cloud Product site 3. The Cloud Product (MOD06_L2) monitors
   the physical and radiative properties of clouds including cloud
   particle phase (ice vs. water, clouds vs. snow), effective cloud
   particle radius, cloud optical thickness, cloud shadow effects, cloud
   top temperature, cloud top height, effective emissivity, cloud phase
   (ice vs. water, opaque vs. non-opaque), and cloud fraction under both
   daytime and nighttime conditions.

   Visit the Atmosphere Profile Product site 4. The Atmosphere Profile
   Product (MOD07_L2) monitors profiles of atmospheric temperature and
   moisture, atmospheric stability, and total ozone burden.

   Visit the Cloud Mask Product site 5. The Cloud Mask Product (MOD35_L2)
   indicates whether a given instrument field of view (FOV) of the Earth's
   surface is unobstructed by clouds or affected by cloud shadows. The
   cloud mask also provides additional information about the FOV including
   the presence of: cirrus clouds, ice/snow, and sunglint contamination.
   Finally flags denoting day/night and land/water are included.
   Level-3 MODIS Atmosphere Products

   There are three Level-3 (Global Gridded) MODIS Atmosphere products.
   Each of the Level-3 products contain statistics generated from the
   first four Level-2 products noted above. Statistics are summarized over
   a 1 by 1 degree global grid during daily, eight-day, and monthly
   periods. The Level-3 MODIS Atmosphere products are:

   Visit the Daily Global Joint Product site 1. The Daily Global Joint
   Product (MOD08_D3) contains over 400 statistical datasets derived from
   Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere parameters that are summarized over a 24 hour
   (00 to 00 GMT) period.

   Visit the Eight-Day Global Joint Product site 2. The Eight-Day Global
   Joint Product (MOD08_E3) contains over 600 statistical datasets derived
   from Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere parameters that are summarized over an 8
   day period.

   Visit the Monthly Global Joint Product site 3. The Monthly Global Joint
   Product (MOD08_M3) contains over 600 statistical datasets derived from
   Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere parameters that are summarized over a monthly
   period. It should be noted that the content of this product is
   identical to the Eight-Day Global Joint Product, except for the time
   period covered.
