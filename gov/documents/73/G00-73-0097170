      Hubble Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Timeline

      As a result of the weather-delayed launch, the mission has been
      shortened to 3 EVA days. This will guarantee that the Discovery will be
      safe from all possible Y2K problems under all contingency return
      situations.

      NASA calls a spacewalk an "Extra-Vehicular Activity", or EVA. Each of
      the EVA servicing periods is an EVA Day, although these "days" span two
      "Flight Days". For example, EVA Day 1 begins two days and 19 hours into
      the mission, and it ends in the second hour of the third mission day.
      The tasks are arranged in order of importance and efficiency. The
      spacewalkers will work in teams of two, with each pair going out on
      alternating days.

      EVA Day 1
      The first team will replace Hubble's three Rate Sensor Units (RSUs),
      each containing two gyros. They will also install Voltage/Temperature
      Improvement Kits (VIKs) on Hubble's six batteries.

      EVA Day 2
      The second team will replace the telescope's central computer and a
      Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS).
      3 Days, 19 Hours

      EVA Day 3
      The first pair of spacewalkers goes out again to replace a transmitter
      and a data recorder, upgrade electronics, and begin reinforcing
      Hubble's thermal skin.
      4 Days, 19 Hours

      EVA Day 4
      The second team returns to Hubble to finish attaching the new thermal
      protection.

      HST Command Plan

      The Servicing Mission Command Plan is the set of procedures used by
      Hubble's ground control team to prepare the telescope for servicing,
      test the newly installed equipment, and release the telescope back into
      orbit.

      Shortly after launch, the Space Telescope Operations Control Center
      (STOCC) team will begin transitioning the telescope from normal science
      operations to a "ready for servicing" condition. They will command
      Hubble to its capture attitude and configure it for rendezvous with
      Discovery.

      In preparation for capture and berthing, the STOCC will instruct
      Hubble's aperture door to close and the high gain antennas to be
      stowed. Immediately after the astronauts install the new equipment,
      they will move to a safe location. Then, the STOCC will test the
      hardware to determine if more work is needed. Later, while the crew
      sleeps, the STOCC team will perform more detailed checkouts. Finally,
      at the mission's end, ground controllers will prepare Hubble for its
      return to normal operations.

      Servicing Mission Integrated Timeline [pdftiny.gif]

      The Servicing Mission Integrated Timeline (SMIT)

      The Servicing Mission Integrated Timeline (SMIT) is a detailed,
      minute-by-minute schedule of mission activities. It simultaneously
      shows all major work performed by the astronauts and the ground
      controllers. The timeline also includes several time measures (mission
      elapsed time, orbit number, UT, etc.), the position of the Shuttle and
      Hubble, and the astronauts' sleep time. The servicing team relies on
      this script-like schedule to track mission progress.

      How to Read the Integrated Timeline

      TIME: The clock begins at launch. The time is shown in Greenwich Mean
      Time (GMT) and Mission Elapsed Time (MET).
        * For GMT, the day of the year is shown in the margin.
        * For MET, the day of mission is shown in the margin.

      ORBIT#: When the Shuttle begins preparations for rendezvous with
      Hubble, the ORBIT# will be that of the Shuttle. Prior to these
      preparations, the ORBIT# will be that of Hubble.

      DAY/NIGHT: The shaded areas show when Hubble is in the Earth's shadow.
      The light areas represent Hubble's daytime.

      SAA: Time in the South Atlantic Anomaly. The SAA is an area of intense
      radiation above the coast of Argentina. As the Shuttle and other
      satellites pass through it, the SAA can disrupt electronics and
      communications signals. It is the southern point of the Van Allen Belt.

      HST ATTITUDE: How Hubble is positioned.

      ORBITER ATTITUDE: How the Shuttle is positioned.

      CREW SCHEDULE: Major crew activities, such as preparing for a spacewalk
      and sleeping.

      ORBITER, CREW, SSE: The Shuttle and astronaut activities relating to
      Hubble and the Space Support Equipment (SSE).

      FUNCTIONAL COMMAND: A description of the command and verification
      activities performed by Hubble's ground controllers. A legend in the
      margin shows the different types of commands.

      TLM FORMAT: The telemetry format requirements for the engineering and
      science channels.

      TDRSS/I&C: The area of communication coverage and the Zone Of Exclusion
      (ZOE).

      GROUND SYSTEM ACTIVITIES: The major activities within the Space
      Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC).

      MAJOR EVENTS: An overview of all major activities in space and on the
      ground.
