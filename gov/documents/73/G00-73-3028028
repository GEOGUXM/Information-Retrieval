   Interdisciplinary icon Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection

          The Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection consists of
          monthly mean data from the fields of meteorology, atmospheric,
          land surface, oceanic, cryospheric, biospheric, solar and remote
          sensing sciences. Over 70 physical parameters have been selected
          from over 24 important climate data sets. Most parameters are
          presented as IEEE Float 4-byte words on a 1x1 degree (or
          commensurable) grid.

   Pentad icon SIESIP, Five and Ten Day Data

          The Seasonal to Interannual Earth Science Information Partner
          (SIESIP), Pentad & Decade Data Collection, is an expansion of
          the Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection. This data
          collection consists of climate parameters at a 5-day and 10-day
          mean temporal resolution. The creation of this dataset is one of
          the Goddard DAAC's contributions to the SIESIP project.

   ISLSCP icon International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project
          (ISLSCP)

          The ISLSCP Initiative I - Global Data Sets for Land-Atmosphere
          Models - Includes vegetation, biophysics, hydrology, near
          surface meteorology, radiation, soils, and snow-ice parameters.
          Monthly, and some monthly-6 hourly and 6-hourly data are
          available globally for 1987 through 1988 on a common 1 degree
          grid.

          Versions of the ISLSCP II data sets are becoming available for
          review. This data collection spans a 10 + year time period from
          1986 to at least 1995. Where data sets continue beyond 1995 they
          will be included in the collection as feasible. The data will be
          produced at a spatial resolution of 1 degree for the
          meteorological data and at 0.5 and 0.25 degrees for topography,
          soils, and vegetation parameters.

   GEDEX icon Greenhouse Effect Detection Experiment (GEDEX)

          The GEDEX data collection contains over sixty data sets with
          parameters relevant to greenhouse effect research (surface and
          upper air temperature, solar irradiances, radiation budget,
          clouds, and greenhouse gases). Many data sets are available for
          a 10 year period spanning the 1980's. Depending upon the data
          set, the coverage is global, regional or local.

   Research Forum icon Research Forum

          This Forum will present special data sets and documents related
          to important Global Change and Climate problems being discussed
          in scientific meetings and refereed journals. The purpose is to
          make important research data sets available to other scientists
          working on these problems.
