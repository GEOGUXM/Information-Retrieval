                  Differences Between California and Federal Law:

      In general, California law conforms to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
         as of January 1, 1998. However, there are continuing differences
        between California and federal law. California has not conformed to
        most of the changes made to the IRC by the Internal Revenue Service
         Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-206) and the
      Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law
       106-170). California has not conformed to any of the changes made by
       the Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277),
       the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999 (Public
       Law 106-36), the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act
       of 2000 (Public Law 106-519), the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
         2001 (Public Law 106-554), and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
                  Reconciliation Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-16).

                               2001 Tax Law Changes

        Solar Energy System Credit:

        A new credit is available for the purchase and installation of a
        solar energy system. For taxable years beginning on or after January
        1, 2001, and before January 1, 2006, there will be allowed a credit
        equal to the lesser of 15% for tax years 2001 through 2003 or 7½%
        for the tax years 2004 and 2005 of the net cost paid to purchase and
        install a solar energy system for the production of electricity, or
        $4.50 per rated watt of generating capacity of that system.

        Homeowners and Renters Assistance (HRA):

        The HRA refund amounts allowable have increased by 45%.

        qualified employee for duties related to a joint strike fighter.

        * The Employer Child Care Program Credit and the Employer Child Care
          Contribution Credit are extended to taxable years beginning before
          January 1, 2007.

               define "qualified investments,"

               and

               credit.

        New Deduction:

        A deduction is allowed for interest paid on any loan or financed
        indebtedness from a utility company to purchase energy efficient
        equipment and products for California residences.

        Net Operating Losses (NOLs) and Disaster Losses:

        Taxpayers are allowed special treatment for losses sustained as a
        result of the 2000 Napa valley earthquake. These disaster losses can
        be:
        * Carried back to the 1999 tax year (if an election is filed by the
          extended due date for the taxable year in which the disaster
          actually occurred) and carried forward at 100% for five years, then
          carried forward an additional 10 years at 50%, or
        * Claimed in the 2000 taxable year and carried forward at 100% for
          five years, then carried forward an additional 10 years at 55%.
        * For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, and before
          January 1, 2003, farmers are allowed a deduction for losses
          sustained due to Pierces disease and its vectors. This loss may
          create an NOL, which is allowed to be carried forward for 9 years
          at 100%. The NOL may be deducted only from income apportioned to
          the area affected by Pierces disease using a two-factor formula.

        New California Income Exclusions:

          income.
        * Compensation for erroneous convictions is excludable from
          California income.

        Electronic Postmarks:

        California law will now conform to the federal law that permits
        electronic postmarks to be proof of the date of an e-filed return.

        Innocent Investors:

        Taxpayers can notify the FTB of their innocent investor status in an
        abusive tax shelter. If substantiated, FTB will be prohibited from
        seizing and selling their principal residence.

        Principal Business Activity (PBA) Code:

        The Franchise Tax Board will now require individuals to include
        their PBA code on the face of their tax return. FTB is authorized to
        disclose a taxpayers name, address, social security number or tax
        identification number, and PBA code to city tax officials under
        specific limited circumstances.

        New Voluntary Contributions Fund:

        America, California Chapters Fund.

                         Head of Household Filing Status:

       The Proposition 22 Legal Defense and Education Fund recently filed a
       cause of action in Sacramento Superior Court challenging the Board of
      Equalizations decision in the Hisserich case. The court issued a writ
         of mandate ordering FTB not to follow the Hisserich decision for
             purposes of determining head of household filing status.

                                 Tax Form Changes
        * Form 3506, Child and Dependent Care Expenses Credit form has been
          developed for taxpayers claiming this credit.

          booklet but will instead be mailed separately to taxpayers who
          filed one last year.
