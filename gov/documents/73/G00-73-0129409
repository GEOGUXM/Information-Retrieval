   FCC ANNOUNCES A NEW FILING LOCATION FOR PAPER DOCUMENTS
   AND A NEW FAX NUMBER FOR GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE

   NEW FILING LOCATION FOR PAPER DOCUMENTS. Effective December 18, 2001,
   the Commission's contractor, Vistronix, Inc., will begin receiving
   hand-delivered or messenger-delivered paper filings for the
   Commission's Secretary at a new location in downtown Washington, DC.
   The address is 236 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Suite 110, Washington, DC
   20002. The filing hours at this location will be 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
   All hand deliveries must be held together with rubber bands or
   fasteners. Any envelopes must be disposed of before entering the
   building.

   This facility is the only location where hand-delivered or
   messenger-delivered paper filings for the Commission's Secretary will
   be accepted. Accordingly, the Commission will no longer accept these
   filings at 9300 East Hampton Drive, Capitol Heights, MD 20743. In
   addition, this is a reminder that, effective October 18, the Commission
   discontinued receiving hand-delivered or messenger-delivered filings
   for the Secretary at its headquarters location at 445 12th Street, SW,
   Washington, DC 20554.

   Other messenger-delivered documents, including documents sent by
   overnight mail (other than United States Postal Service (USPS) Express
   Mail and Priority Mail), must be addressed to 9300 East Hampton Drive,
   Capitol Heights, MD 20743. This location will be open 8:00 a.m. to 5:30
   p.m. The USPS first-class mail, Express Mail, and Priority Mail should
   continue to be addressed to the Commission's headquarters at 445 12th
   Street, SW, Washington, DC 20554. The USPS mail addressed to the
   Commission's headquarters actually goes to our Capitol Heights facility
   for screening prior to delivery at the Commission.
   If you are sending this type of document or using this delivery method
   It should be addressed for delivery to
   Hand-delivered or messenger-delivered paper filings for the
   Commission's Secretary 236 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Suite 110,
   Washington, DC 20002 (8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.)

   United States Postal Service first-class mail, Express Mail, and
   Priority Mail 445 12th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20554

   NEW FAX NUMBER FOR GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE. In light of recent events in
   Washington, DC, resulting in unforeseeable and understandable
   disruption of regular mail delivery, the Commission wants to ensure
   that it continues to be accessible and responsive to members of the
   public. For this reason, the Commission is providing a means for the
   public to fax general correspondence to the Commission, such as
   inquiries about the Commission's activities, status inquiries,
   fee-related questions, and any other correspondence that is not an
   official filing addressed to the Commission's Secretary.

   The public may now fax correspondence to the Commission at
   202-418-0188. If possible, please include the following information in
   the addressee block of the correspondence.
     * The Commission's full name and address (445 12th Street, SW,
       Washington, DC 20554)
     * The name of the Commission Bureau or Office to which the
       correspondence is directed
     * The name and room number of the FCC staff person to whom the
       correspondence is directed
       As noted above, this fax number for general correspondence must not
       be used for official filings addressed to the Commission's
       Secretary.
       As the Commission continues to address the need for heightened
       security measures, the Commission encourages its customers to make
       full use of this additional means of communication. For additional
       information on contacting the Commission, go to
       http://www.fcc.gov/contacts.html Please address any questions about
       this Public Notice to Ginger Weasenforth, at gweasenf@fcc.gov or at
       202-418-0330.
