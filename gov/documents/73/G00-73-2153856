    NIEHS Web Site Credits



     The top-level pages of this version (December 2000) of the NIEHS
     website were developed by Web Services (Jed Dube, Sarah Welna, Pete
     Cozart and Bill Watson) and the Office of Communications and Public
     Liaison (Lou Rozier and Bill Grigg).

     The sectional web pages have been developed by the respective
     organizational groups within the Institute.

     The first version of the NIEHS website (circa summer 1994) was
     developed by Jim Dix, along with a handful of others, who originally
     located and organized relevant links, some of which have been carried
     forward to the current version.
