     On the Internet

   Think of TAGS as a virtual conference center.  Participants may enter a
   TAGS conference by clicking a link in an e-mail message, or by entering
   their user ID and password in our User Login area of this website.

   Participants can go directly to a prescribed topic or enter a secure,
   virtual conference room and select a topic.  The topic could be a
   "live" remote meeting, a survey, an asynchronous brainstorming session,
   an opportunity to assess ideas, a chance to view results, an action
   planning session or one of several other online TAGS functions.  In
   some cases, participants can complete entire tasks online that used to
   require multiple face-to-face meetings.  At other times, the online
   work is designed to shorten and better focus the time spent
   face-to-face.

   Face-to-Face Meetings

    In a well-run traditional meeting, participants individually voice
   ideas while a facilitator tries to capture them on a flip chart,
   one-by-one.

    In a TAGS meeting, participants simultaneously contribute ideas with
   our easy-to-use software on a network of computers.  All ideas
   immediately post to an electronic flip chart displayed on each person's
   computer and on a large screen at the front of the room.  Participants
   build on others' ideas and continue to offer new ideas in their own
   words and with complete anonymity.

   Using a mixture of group discussion and TAGS tools, participants can
   categorize and prioritize ideas, use electronic "ballots" to
   anonymously indicate their level of support for each idea, view
   tabulated results on-screen, and discuss results in an effort to reach
   consensus.

   This technology does not replace expert mediation skills and human
   interaction among participants in a face-to-face meeting.  Instead, the
   mediator uses this technology to enhance participant interaction and
   outcome.

    Once agreement is reached, participants can use TAGS to assign tasks
   with completion targets and implementation timelines. The mediator can
   print out complete meeting notes before participants leave the meeting
   and archive meeting data for future use (or shred the information to
   ensure confidentiality).
