General information

   The interests in astrophysics of the Space and Remote Sensing Sciences
   Group (NIS-2) in Los Alamos National Lab focus on gamma-ray bursts,
   x-ray binaries, accretion- and rotation-powered pulsars, neutron star
   dynamics, atomic processes in astrophysical sources, soft x-ray and EUV
   backgrounds, and EUV and soft x-ray transients such as flare stars.

   An important mission of the group is to develop new types of optical,
   ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-ray detectors for ground and space
   applications. The group has flown high-energy instruments on Pioneer
   Venus Orbiter, the ISEE-3 (ICE), P78-1, Vela satellites, and the
   Japanese satellite Ginga. The group is currently developing experiments
   for several scientific missions including the X-ray Multimirror Mission
   (XMM), High Energy Transient Explorer (HETE), MARS-96, and the MOXE all
   sky x-ray monitor on the Russian Spectrum X-Gamma satellite project,
   and is the lead institution operating the Array of Low Energy X-ray
   Imaging Sensors (ALEXIS) satellite and its wide field-of-view ultrasoft
   x-ray telescope array.

   The group is actively participating in Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
   (CGRO) and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) research through several
   guest investigator projects, and is also involved in establishing the
   growing-up Fenton Hill Observatory in the Jemez mountains, which
   includes an ultra-high-energy gamma-ray telescope, Milagro.
