   The U.S. Geological Survey, Imaging Spectroscopy Group is currently
   mapping in many places on the Earth. We are using Imaging Spectroscopy
   to map:

     * Surficial mineralogy (mineral resources to land management
       studies),
     * Environmental studies,
     * Vegetation communities/species,
     * Cryptobiotic soils, (where appropriate),
     * Research on vegetation health,
     * Research on specific ecosystems, and
     * Search for abandoned mine lands and assessment of potential mine
       drainage.

   We are accomplishing the above goals using diagnostic spectral features
   to identify specific molecular absorption bands in the spectra of
   surficial materials. Currently, we are using the NASA Airborne Visual
   and Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) system for our mapping.
   AVIRIS produces approximately 17-meter ground spatial resolution (pixel
   to pixel spacing) in an image 614 pixels (10.5 km) wide and many
   kilometers long. The spectra cover the 0.4 to 2.5 micron spectral range
   in 224 bands at 0.01-micron spacing. This spectral resolution allows us
   to resolve absorption bands due to specific chemical bonds in
   materials. Every pixel in the image has such a spectrum, so we are able
   to spatially map the presence and abundance of those bonds as seen from
   the aircraft. The chemical bonds are associated with specific
   materials, whether solid, liquid, or gas. Thus, we can produce maps of
   specific materials. See the speclab home page for additional details
   and many examples of what can be done with Imaging Spectroscopy .

  Terrestrial sites under study:

   Each site below will eventually have its own page. A scene refers to a
   AVIRIS 512 line by 614 pixel image cube, covering about 90 square
   kilometers, and comprising about 150 megabytes (including engineering
   data). Data volume for completed project includes radiance data,
   surface reflectance data, mapping products, derived maps, support
   information (field and lab spectroscopy, digitized aerial photography
   and other information and totals approximately 600 megabytes per scene.
