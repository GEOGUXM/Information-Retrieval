  Adamski, J.C., and Knowles, Leel, Jr., 2001, Ground-Water Quality of the
  Surficial Aquifer System and the Upper Floridan Aquifer, Ocala National Forest
  and Lake County, Florida, 1990-99: Water Resources Investigations Report

   ABSTRACT
   Data from 217 ground-water samples were statistically analyzed to
   assess the water quality of the surficial aquifer system and Upper
   Floridan aquifer in the Ocala National Forest and Lake County, Florida.
   Samples were collected from 49 wells tapping the surficial aquifer
   system, 141 wells tapping the Upper Floridan aquifer, and from 27
   springs that discharge water from the Upper Floridan aquifer. A total
   of 136 samples was collected by the U.S. Geological Survey from 1995
   through 1999. These data were supplemented with 81 samples collected by
   the St. Johns River Water Management District and Lake County Water
   Resources Management from 1990 through 1998.

   In general, the surficial aquifer system has low concentrations of
   total dissolved solids (median was 41 milligrams per liter) and major
   ions. Water quality of the surficial aquifer system, however, is not
   homogeneous throughout the study area. Concentrations of total
   dissolved solids, many major ions, and nutrients are greater in samples
   from Lake County outside the Ocala National Forest than in samples from
   within the Forest. These results indicate that the surficial aquifer
   system in Lake County outside the Ocala National Forest probably is
   being affected by agricultural and (or) urban land-use practices. High
   concentrations of dissolved oxygen (less than 0.1 to 8.2 milligrams per
   liter) in the surficial aquifer system underlying the Ocala National
   Forest indicate that the aquifer is readily recharged by precipitation
   and is susceptible to surface contamination.

   Concentrations of total dissolved solids were significantly greater in
   the Upper Floridan aquifer (median was 182 milligrams per liter) than
   in the surficial aquifer system. In general, water quality of the Upper
   Floridan aquifer was homogeneous, primarily being a calcium or
   calcium-magnesium- bicarbonate water type. Near the St. Johns River,
   the water type of the Upper Floridan aquifer is sodium-chloride,
   corresponding to an increase in total dissolved solids.
   Dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the Upper Floridan aquifer ranged
   from less than 0.1 to 7.3 milligrams per liter, indicating that, in
   parts of the aquifer, ground water is rapidly recharged by rainfall and
   is susceptible to surface contamination.

   Median concentrations of nutrients in the Upper Floridan aquifer were
   not significantly different between the Ocala National Forest and the
   area of Lake County outside the Forest. The maximum nitrate
   concentration in the Upper Floridan aquifer in Ocala National Forest
   was only 0.20 milligram per liter, whereas, 9 of 39 samples from the
   Upper Floridan aquifer in Lake County had elevated nitrate
   concentrations (greater than 1.0 milligram per liter). Hence, nitrate
   concentrations of the Upper Floridan aquifer appear to be affected by
   land use in Lake County.
