   About EDSITEment: Partners

   National Endowment for the Humanities National Endowment for the
   Humanities is an independent federal agency established to promote
   knowledge of human history, thought, and culture. For more than thirty
   years, educators and students throughout the nation have benefited from
   NEH grants that create and preserve knowledge, identify and disseminate
   reliable learning resources, and empower teachers through professional
   development programs. EDSITEment brings the NEH commitment to
   excellence in humanities education to the Internet.

   National Trust for the Humanities is a non-profit charitable
   corporation formed in 1996 to support and extend the programs of the
   National Endowment for the Humanities.

   MCI WorldCom WorldCom Foundation is dedicated to broadening the
   education of America's children and families with cutting edge computer
   technology. By sharing its Internet expertise and powerful network
   capabilities, WorldCom has already helped bring Internet access to
   neighborhood libraries and schools across the country. Now, WorldCom is
   partnering with nationally-renowned organizations like NEH to develop
   Internet school curricula and web-based support tools. In addition to
   offering in-kind service and volunteer support, WorldCom, through the
   WorldCom Foundation, provided the funding to develop the EDSITEment
   program and website.

   Council of the Great City Schools The Council of the Great City Schools
   (CGCS), an organization of the nation's largest public school systems,
   represents K-12 education in inner-city schools. The Council serves as
   a voice for urban educators and students, and provides a forum for
   sharing ideas and resources among urban school leaders. Urban schools
   in the Council will be the recipients of information about EDSITEment
   through educator mailings.

   MarcoPolo Program
   MCI WorldCom - MarcoPolo Program EDSITEment is one of six educational
   websites participating in the MarcoPolo program. MarcoPolo is a
   partnership between the WorldCom Foundation and leading educational
   organizations that has created standards-based K-12 Internet Content
   for the Classroom, including original content, panel-reviewed links to
   top web sites, search engines that help find needed information
   quickly, and rich supplemental resources across multiple disciplines.

   The MarcoPolo partners not only deliver top-notch content in their
   respective disciplines, but also work as a consortium to set common
   quality guidelines, share best practices and technology innovations,
   and ultimately create cross-disciplinary educational experiences.

   Designed for busy teachers who want to build basic and transferable
   Internet skills, not in a vacuum, but in tandem with finding a great
   educational resource, MarcoPolo provides educators, at no cost, the
   highest quality Internet content and the professional development
   needed to use it effectively in the classroom.
