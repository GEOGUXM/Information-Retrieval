             Interlibrary Loan/Document Delivery Services Guide
     __________________________________________________________________

What is Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery?

   Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is the borrowing or lending between two
   libraries of books, technical reports and other selected materials.
   Interlibrary Loan also includes the exchange of articles photocopied
   from journals and conference proceedings.

   Document Delivery is the purchasing of journal articles, technical
   reports, society papers, and services from a commercial source.

Who is eligible to use ILL and Document Delivery services?

   All NASA Langley Civil Service (scientists, engineers, managers,
   support personnel, etc.), official NASA Langley contractors, and
   program employees (ASEE, LARRS, etc.) are eligible to use both ILL and
   document delivery services.

How do I place a request for either service?

     * Check NASA GALAXIE and /or other appropriate resources to be sure
       that NASA Langley does not own the material needed.
     * If item is not located, contact an Information Specialist at x42356
       if you need assistance in determining whether or not items are held
       in our library collection.
       Request forms are available at the Reference Desk and ONLINE.

   You may also contact:
     * Cecelia Grzeskowiak or Ken Carroll
     * fax (x42375)
     * email or
     * submit your request in person.

What materials are NOT available through ILL?

        These types of materials often are not available through ILL:

     * Recently published books (published within one (1) year).
     * Entire volumes or issues of periodicals
     * Reference works
     * Rare books or original manuscripts
     * Newspapers or other bulk materials in original format
     * Audiovisual materials or computer software
     * Some doctoral dissertations and/or masters theses.

How long does it take to get material back from ILL or document delivery?

   Turnaround time varies from one lending insitution to another. Average
   delivery time is one to two weeks for regular requests. RUSH requests
   for photocopies of articles can be filled via FAX within hours or days,
   depending on your need. RUSH requests for books and other loan type
   items can be filled in one to two days via courier delivery services.

If I need this book longer than the due date, what should I do?

   If you find that you are getting close to the due date and you need
   additional time to finish the book, some libraries MAY offer a renewal
   extension. Please request extensions at least three to five days before
   the book is due.

How should I return ILL materials?

   Return materials through our internal mail system or bring them to the
   3rd floor Reference Desk. Please do not place interlibrary loan books
   in the first floor book drop. Materials should always be returned by
   the due date. Prompt return of materials helps us avoid being charged
   overdue fines levied by the lending library. Also, most libraries
   routinely refuse borrowing privileges to other libraries which have
   lost materials or have repeatedly returned items after the due date.

Copyright Issues

   Confidentality of Library Records: All library user records pertaining
   to the use of ILL are confidential.

   The Copyright law of the United State (Title 17, U.S. Code) governs the
   making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materals.
   Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives
   are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction which is
   not to be "used for any purpose other than the private study,
   scholorship, or research." If a user makes a request for, or later
   uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use,"
   that user may be liable for copyright infringement.

   We reserve the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its
   judgement, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of
   copyright law.
