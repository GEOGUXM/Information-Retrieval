FAFSA Follow-Up Overview

   You have successfully submitted your FAFSA electronically. Now the
   Department of Education takes the next step by processing your
   application and sending you a Student Aid Report (SAR) by mail. A copy
   of your SAR is also sent electronically to the schools you've listed in
   your FAFSA.

   Your estimated EFC is a preliminary estimate based on the information
   you provided on this application. It is subject to change based upon
   your college's verification of information you provided. The EFC is
   used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid (and spouse,
   if applicable). Note that many schools have their own methodology to
   determine your family contribution and financial need. You will receive
   an official EFC on your Student Aid Report (SAR) based on the
   processing results of your FAFSA. For more information about the EFC
   see the Student Guide site at www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/StudentGuide/.

What happens now?

   FAFSA Follow-Up allows you to do the following:
    A. Check the status of your submitted FAFSA by selecting Check Status
       of a Submitted FAFSA, or by returning to the FAFSA on the Web home
       page at www.fafsa.ed.gov and selecting Check my Submitted FAFSA.
       You can use the application status check to check the status of
       your FAFSA or correction at any point during the processing period.
       Checking the status of your application at any time during the
       processing period is beneficial, but we recommend you at least
       check the status at the following times:
          + 1 week after submission - if you used a PIN to sign your
            application
          + 2-3 weeks after submission - if you printed, signed and mailed
            a signature page.
    B. Once we have received all required signatures and processed your
       application or correction form, you can access your processed
       application data by selecting Student Access from the left
       navigation bar.
       If we have a current e-mail on file for you, and your 2002-2003
       application was processed successfully, we will send you an e-mail
       notification with instructions on how to access your electronic SAR
       (Student Aid Report). You will also have the option to print a
       copy. If we do not have an e-mail for you, or your application was
       not process completely, you will receive a paper copy of your
       2002-2003 SAR.
       If you have submitted you application for the 2001-2002 school
       year, you will receive a paper SAR. You should receive your SAR in
       two to three weeks after filing your application. Review the SAR
       carefully. If you do not receive your SAR within four (4) weeks,
       call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at
       1-800-4-FEDAID/TTY 1-800-730-8913 or1-319-337-5665.
       If you would like to print a copy of your 2002-2003 SAR, or if you
       have received a 2001-2002 paper SAR but need another paper copy,
       you can request one by selecting Print SAR from the left navigation
       bar. Please note: you will need your PIN to access this request
       form.
    C. If you find you've made a mistake after submitting your
       application, you will have to wait until after your application has
       been processed to make corrections. Corrections can be made through
       Corrections on the Web at www.fafsa.ed.gov. You must have a PIN to
       access your Corrections on the Web data.
