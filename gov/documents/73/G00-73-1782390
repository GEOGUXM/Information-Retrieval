   Rolla, the county seat of Phelps County, is an attractive mixture of
   rural and urban life. It is the home of several high-technology
   businesses and federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey
   and the U.S. Forest Service. The University of Missouri at Rolla, which
   is a nationally recognized leader in science and technology, has
   educated students in Rolla for 125 years.

   Rolla is located at the crossroads of I-44, US 63 and Missouri Highway

   Mid-Continent Mapping Center

   The Mid-Continent Mapping Center (MCMC) is one of several mapping
   centers in the National Mapping Division (NMD) within the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS). MCMC is a production, research, and data
   management facility for maps and digital cartographic data products.
   The work of MCMC supports planning and development activities,
   construction projects, scientific studies, resource management, and
   environmental monitoring activities, nationwide, at every level of
   government, academia, and the private sector.
   MCMC evolved from an office of the USGS Topographic Division (now NMD)
   located on the campus of what was then the Missouri School of Mines and
   Metallurgy (now the University of Missouri-Rolla) in 1932. It now
   shares a building in Rolla with an office of the USGS Water Resources
   Division. MCMC employs more than 300 people as cartographers,
   engineers, technicians, computer scientists, computer programmers, and
   administrative staff.
