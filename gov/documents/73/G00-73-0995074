                                Loan Programs

   Cal-Vet/VA - This program is targeted toward veterans and active duty
   personnel who want to minimize the amount of cash they need to complete
   their purchase. A Certificate of Eligibility from the United States
   Department of Veterans Affairs for the maximum VA loan guaranty based
   on the purchase price of the property is required.

   Cal-Vet 2000/97 - This program is for veterans and active duty
   personnel who do not qualify for the VA guaranty, or need a loan amount
   in excess of $203,000 (up to the $250,000 maximum).

   Cal-Vet 80/20 - This loan is for veterans and active duty personnel who
   want to make a down payment of 20% or more. Because there are fewer
   processing requirements these loans generally take less time to process
   and fund.
