    The U.S. Consulate homepage is maintained by the Office of the Public
   Affairs in Karachi. Links to other, non-U.S. Government Internet sites
       should not be construed as an endorsement of the views therein.

   The IRC is located on the ground floor of the American Consulate
   Building, 8 Abdullah Haroon Road, which is almost the center of the
   city surrounded by important offices and five star hotels. Consulate
   security limits public access, but the IRC has compensated through an
   intensive use of electronic means of information retrieval and
   dissemination. Co-location within the Consulate does allow the quick
   response to information requests from the Consulate Officers.  It also
   serves the information needs of the U.S. Mission Officers, and staff in
   support of U.S. public diplomacy objectives.

     Visa Inquiries: All U.S. Visas are processed in Islamabad. For visa
    interviews, please contact the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy,
                                  Islamabad
          (92-51-20802700). Additional information is available at
                             CONSULAR SERVICES.

             American Citizen Services are available in Karachi.
