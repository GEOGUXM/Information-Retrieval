                   ENVIRONMENTAL & ENERGY AWARENESS WEEK
                             ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
   Former Senator Gaylord Nelson, who served as both senator and governor
   for the State of Wisconsin, founded Earth Day in 1970. For years prior
    to Earth Day, he had been troubled by the fact that the state of our
    environment was simply a non-issue in politics of our country. Earth
        Day is celebrated every year on April 22nd. The Environmental
    Management Systems Group sponsors an Environmental & Energy Awareness
     Event each April through the success of KSC's Recycling activities.
