      Powerful infrared beams shed light on radiation damage in living cells

      ONE of the strongest infrared light sources ever created is giving
      scientists in California an unprecedented view of the damage inflicted
      on living cells by radiation and toxic chemicals. Their findings could
      spark changes in safety regulations for nuclear power workers and those
      exposed to hazardous chemicals and drugs.

      A team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory near San Francisco
      is using a powerful light source originally used for making advanced
      microchips to blast single living cells with a beam that can be focused
      on an area smaller than the cell. Each type of cell reflects the
      infrared beam in a unique way, because particular molecules in the cell
      absorb characteristic amounts of light. Analysing the frequencies in
      the spectrum of the reflected signal can provide a wealth of
      information: for example, the scientists can use this "signature" to
      determine whether DNA strands have been damaged, or if cells have
      recently died.

      Michael Martin, who presented the work at last week's American Physical
      Society meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, recently looked at the
      effect of ionising radiation on cells. His group's work has shown that
      previous radiation studies, which were based on less sensitive methods
      using dyes, may have overestimated the effect of the low doses of
      radiation to which nuclear plant workers are typically exposed.

      These studies may have overlooked an exposure threshold below which no
      damage occurs, says Martin. If the team's preliminary results are
      mirrored in larger studies, they could lead to changes in safety
      regulations. And the researchers have already determined the specific
      damage that some chemicals cause.
