    About FirstGov

   FirstGov is a public-private partnership, led by a cross-agency board
   and administered by the Office of FirstGov in the General Services
   Administration's Office of Governmentwide Policy.
     * Welcome from President Bush

    Our Vision
   Our work transcends the traditional boundaries of government and our
       vision is global - connecting the world to all U.S. Government
       information and services.

    Facts About FirstGov.gov
     * In September 2000, we launched FirstGov.gov, the only official U.S.
       Government portal to 47 million pages of government information,
       services, and online transactions.
     * Our site offers a powerful search engine that searches every word
       of every U.S. government document in a quarter of a second or less.
     * FirstGov.gov also features a topical index, online transactions,
       links to state and local government, options to contact your
       government, and other tools so you don't have to know the name of
       the government agency to get the information you want anytime you
       want it.
        FirstGov is an Award Winning Site
          + Award Winning Site

    FirstGov.gov Linking Policy
     * FirstGov.gov links to websites that provide useful, timely,
       citizen-centered information and services consistent with our
       Linking Policy.

    Catalyst for Electronic Government
   But we're much more than a cutting-edge website:
     * We are working across government to accelerate the growth of a
       secure seamless, electronic government.
     * We are encouraging cross-agency portals to serve specific customer
       groups such as those already created for kids, workers, seniors,
       and more.
     * We are reaching out to businesses, non-profits, associations, and
       other groups. We have more than 120 FirstGov partners and the
       number is growing.
     * We are transforming the way government at all levels deliver
       services to you and the way you interact with your government.

    Our Funding
     * FirstGov was funded in the year 2000 by the Federal Chief
       Information Officers Council and 22 other federal agencies. We also
       received the gift of a search engine from the Fed-Search
       Foundation, a non-profit charity established by Dr. Eric Brewer.
       Dr. Brewer's early research on parallel computing was funded with a
       grant from the Defense Department.
     * President Bush's proposed 2002 Budget recognizes the role of
       FirstGov in cross-agency electronic government. His Budget
       Blueprint calls for the use of the Internet to create a
       citizen-centric government and provides a fund that will grow to
       $100 million over 3 years to support electronic government. The
       Blueprint calls FirstGov.gov one of the "essential building blocks"
       for projects that will operate across boundaries, along with the
       development of a Public Key infrastructure for digital signatures.
