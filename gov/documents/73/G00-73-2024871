                                 GAMS Glossary

   Class
          The principal search mechanism in GAMS is based on a
          tree-structured taxonomy of mathematical and statistical
          problems. Each node in this tree is termed a problem class, and
          is designated by a tag, an alternating sequence of letters and
          numbers (e.g., D2b1). Each module in GAMS is assigned to one or
          more problem classes. To locate software GAMS users find a class
          that describes the problem they wish to solve and then view the
          modules with that classification.

   Component
          A component is a retrievable object associated with a package or
          module. Examples of module components are Source, Fullsource
          (source plus dependencies), Documentation, and Example.
          Available components vary from module to module and package to
          package. Note that source is not always available (it is never
          available for commercial software indexed in GAMS).

   Cross-index
          A cross-index collects in one place references to information
          available from a variety of sources. GAMS is an example of a
          cross-index of mathematical and statistical software.

   Module
          In GAMS we use the term module to denote a unit of software that
          can be used to solve a particular problem. A module can be a
          Fortran subprogram, a C procedure, a stand-alone program, or a
          command in a system. Modules are what you are searching for when
          you use GAMS.

   Package
          A package is a collection of modules related by authorship,
          maintenance, or distribution. A package can be a subprogram
          library, an interactive system, or a moderated collection of
          programs.

   Repository
          A repository is an Internet site that maintains and distributes
          a collection of software packages. In GAMS some repositories are
          free public-access sites, such as netlib, while others are
          computer systems accessible only by NIST staff. (In the latter
          case GAMS has made special arrangements to redistribute selected
          components.)

   Virtual repository
          GAMS does not maintain a software repository of its own.
          Instead, it is a cross-index of a variety of repositories
          maintained by others. Nevertheless, it does provide many
          facilities of a software repository, such as search and
          retrieval of source and documentation. Thus, GAMS can be viewed
          as a virtual repository.
