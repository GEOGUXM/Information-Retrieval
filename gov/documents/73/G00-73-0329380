   Privacy Statement

   This Web site is provided as a public service by the Center for
   Scientific Review (CSR) at NIH. CSR Websites perform a wide range of
   functions, including the collection and dissemination of grant
   application and scientific peer review policy statements, laws and
   regulations, technical, and, in some cases, personal information. CSR's
   policy with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal
   information is to ensure compliance with applicable Federal law,
   including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended),
   the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Freedom of Information
   Act. The Center also rigorously follows the principles delineated in
   The Use of Privacy Statements on NIH Web Sites ("Privacy Principles"),
   published by the NIH On-Line Information Branch, Office of
   Communications and Public Liaison on June 18, 1999.

   Accordingly, of the information we learn about you from your visit to
   "http://www.CSR.nih.gov" we store only the following:

     * The domain name from which you access the Internet
     * The date and time
     * The Internet address of the Website from which you linked directly
       to our site
     * The name of the file or the word string you searched, and
     * The browser used to access our site.

   This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the
   various sections of our site and identify system performance or problem
   areas. We also use this information to help us expand the coverage of
   the site to assist users in finding desired information.

   We do not give, share, sell or transfer any personal information to any
   third party.

   When inquiries are e-mailed to CSR, we store the question and the
   e-mail address information so that we can respond electronically.
   Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who
   sends questions or comments to our Website. We will not obtain
   information that will allow us to personally identify you when you
   visit our site, unless you chose to provide such information to us.

About "Cookies"

   While visiting sites within the NIH.GOV domain, you may occasionally
   encounter a Web page, including some at CSR, that employs cookies. A
   cookie is a small file that a Website transfers to your computer's hard
   disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your
   session while you are connected. Requests to send cookies from NIH and
   CSR Web pages are not designed to collect information about you, but
   only about your browser "session." The cookie makes it easier for you
   to use the dynamic features of these Web pages. The cookie and the
   information about your session will be destroyed automatically shortly
   after you close your browser -- it is not permanently stored on your
   computer. Unless a CSR Web page specifically notifies you otherwise, we
   will not collect and maintain personal information about you. To
   protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after
   you have finished conducting business with a Website that uses cookies.
   If you are concerned about the potential use of information gathered
   from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you
   before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that
   let you identify and/or reject cookies.

   Questions about NIH privacy policies should be sent to the NIH Privacy
   Act Officer.
