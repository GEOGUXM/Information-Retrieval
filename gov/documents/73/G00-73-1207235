Introduction

   Welcome to Classification Web, the exciting new CDS product that
   enables anyone who has access to the World Wide Web to browse and
   search the full text of the Library of Congress Classification (LCC)
   schedules! This product is powered by a customized classification
   version of MinaretÂ®, a MARC record-based database management program
   developed by Cactus Software, Inc. It is the same product that is used
   by Library of Congress cataloging staff members in their daily
   classification activities.

   Classification Web (Class Web for short) offers the following features:
     * Access to the most up-to-date version of the LCC database. This
       database is updated by the Library of Congress weekly - with Class
       Web you will never be using an outdated version of a classification
       schedule.
     * Browse screens and search screens. Page through a classification
       schedule or search the schedules by captions, index terms, or even
       keywords. Do simple searches or complex Boolean searches.
     * Enhanced browser that includes a powerful calculator function. Use
       this feature to combine table and schedule data and display fully
       calculated numbers together with their corresponding captions.
     * Hierarchy browser. Browse schedules at any level of the hierarchy
       from the most general to the most specific.
     * Notes function. Write and save your own notes and hot links at any
       location in any of the classification schedules.
     * Subject Correlations. Find correspondences between subject headings
       and classification numbers or vice-versa, as reflected in
       bibliographic records.
     * Subject Headings. Search the database of Library of Congress
       subject authority records.

   This tutorial will give you a quick introduction to each of these
   features so that you can get started exploring Class Web on your own.
   More detailed descriptions of most features are available at any stage
   of your search by clicking Help. This will give you access to an
   extensive context-sensitive help system.
