USGS Browse Image Viewer - Frequently Asked Questions

  Question: Why are the Landsat 7 Browse Image colors so unusual?

   Answer:
          Color stretch is performed on the raw data upon ingest from the
          satellite by Ground Station systems on a scene-by-scene basis
          before being delivered to this system. Scenes in the same path
          from the same acquisition date may vary due to their individual
          image content for bands 5,4,3. For example, more or fewer
          clouds, more or less water.

  Question: How do I know where I am?

   Answer:
          The shaded relief map of the world in the lower left corner
          displays a green icon to show "You are here". While your cursor
          is in the locator map, the location is displayed in the browser
          status bar, both in latitude/longitude and path/row units.
          Clicking on this locator map will "teleport" the viewer to that
          location.

  Question: Why are some scenes cloudy when the cloud cover is 0% ?

   Answer:
          The cloud cover index is automated calculation, base on scene
          content. This algorithm gets fooled by snow, ice, water, or
          other unusual scene content. Haze and small or thin clouds can
          get missed. This is an estimate only.

  Question: What is this Map Projection Stuff, and why are some of the images
  side-ways?

   Answer:
          Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area will produce more skewing near the
          edges of a region. Just remember that North is pointing from
          path to path-1, not necessarily towards the top of your page.

  Question: Why such long response times?

   Answer:
          Nine graphic images of 30-40K each may take from a few seconds
          up to 1.5 minutes, depending upon your internet connection. Once
          a set is cached, response should be more interactive.

  Question: Why do some images seem to change colors half-way through a scene?

   Answer:
          These are gain-changes in the sensor, which are done purposely.
          When ordering Landsat 7 data, a calibration parameter file
          containing all relevant gain change information is used to to
          process the data. So, the appropriate gain and bias values are
          incorporated and these artifacts do not exist in an actual Level
          1 product.

  Question: Why does the image browser web page display become corrupted when
  the browser window is resized?

   Answer:
          This appears to be a bug with Netscape 4.x on many platforms. No
          other tested browser shows this behavior. Pressing the "refresh"
          button will properly redisplay the page.
