   NOAA CoastWatch often partners with other NOAA offices and U.S.
   Government agencies to provide customized data products and services to
   meet common goals. These partnerships may be formed at the local level
   (i.e., CoastWatch Regional Nodes and state governments) or at the
   national level (i.e., CoastWatch Central providing data in support of
   Sustainable Seas Expeditions). Some current CoastWatch collaborative
   efforts include:

Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting Project

     Using aircraft, buoys, and satellites, this work group is
     integrating data for development of HAB forecasting systems. A
     preliminary result of this effort is the creation of the HAB
     Bulletin. The HAB bulletin provides timely information to the
     management community in the Gulf of Mexico during a bloom event. The
     near real-time bulletins provide interpreted data that include wind
     speed and direction information, and a chlorophyll image from the
     OrbView-2/Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite.
     The bulletin is a collaborative effort of the National Ocean Service
     Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, NOAA CoastWatch, and
     the NOAA Coastal Services Center. --More information--

Near Real-time Hypoxia Warning Project

     The Gulf of Mexico hypoxia warning system is a joint project of the
     NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Coastal
     Data Development Center, and the CoastWatch Gulf of Mexico Regional
     Node. The effort is part of the annual Southeast Area Monitoring and
     Assessment Program's (SEAMAP) summer groundfish survey conducted by
     NMFS in the Western and North-central Gulf of Mexico aboard the NOAA
     Ship Oregon II. --More information--

El Nino Watch

     The El Niño Watch is a monthly production of the West Coast Regional
     Node. It was started in January, 1992, in response to the onset of
     El Niño conditions in the equatorial Pacific. One of the main El
     Niño indicators for the U.S. west coast is the presence of warmer
     than average surface water. --More information--

Sea Nettles

     Sea nettles, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, seasonally infest the
     Chesapeake Bay and affect many activities on the Bay. Knowing where
     and when to expect this biotic nuisance may help to alleviate this
     problem. Maps of probable sea nettle presence are created by
     identifying locations where the current environmental conditions are
     favorable to sea nettles. This is accomplished using data derived
     from hydrodynamic computer models and NOAA satellites. --More

Sustainable Seas Expeditions

     The Sustainable Seas Expeditions is a five-year project of
     underwater exploration and discovery of the marine world with
     special emphasis on the national marine sanctuaries of the United
     States. The expeditions are the brainchild of Dr. Sylvia Earle,
     scholar and Explorer -In-Residence of the National Geographic
     Society. Led by Dr. Earle, the expeditions are a project of the
     National Geographic Society in cooperation with the National Oceanic
     and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other government agencies,
     industry, and private institutions, made possible by a grant from
     the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund. NOAA CoastWatch provides
     datasets on a daily basis to assist in building a baseline of the
     marine sanctuaries. --More information--
