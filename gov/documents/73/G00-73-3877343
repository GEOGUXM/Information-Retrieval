                     19-ID & 19-BM Beamtime Application

   We are now accepting proposals for 19-ID and 19-BM beamlines for all
   runs during the year 2001. Typically two or three day slots will be
   awarded based on the proposal requirement. Applications are accepted on
   a continuous basis and there is no specific deadline for applications.
   Currently the estimated cycle time from the date of submission is on
   average approximately 6 months. In addition, accelerated proposals are
   also considered. Make sure to indicate which beamline you wish to use
   (19-ID or 19-BM)

   Thank you for your interest in the SBC program. We look forward to
   receiving your proposal.
