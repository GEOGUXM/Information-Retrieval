   EES Division Office (EES-DO)
   The EES Division mission is to contribute to the solution of complex
   problems of national importance in the areas of energy resources,
   environmental quality, and national security. Our approach to solving
   these problems is to apply strengths in observation, modeling and
   experimentation, all anchored to a solid foundation of excellent,
   cutting edge science. We contribute through research and development in
   geological, geophysical, environmental and biological sciences. We also
   contribute to our national science and technology base through
   education, scientific research, and industrial competitiveness. Group

   Hydrology, Geochemistry and Geology (EES-6)
   We apply observational, analytical, experimental, and modeling
   approaches to complex problems involving geology, subsurface fluid flow
   and transport, and geomaterials. Group Members

   Geotechnical Engineering and Research (EES-7)
   EES-7 is a group of 17 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support
   staff stationed in Las Vegas, Nevada, whose activities center around
   the DOE Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project (YMP). Many
   activities take place directly at the Yucca Mountain site,
   approximately 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Group Members

   Atmospheric and Climate Sciences (EES-8)
   The Atmospheric and Climate Sciences Group is Los Alamos National
   Laboratorys atmospheric and oceanic research capability. Group Members

   Environmental Geology and Risk Analysis (EES-9)
   EES-9 includes 35 support, student, and technical staff, with expertise
   in the geosciences, environmental engineering, toxicology, chemistry,
   quality and data assurance, information management, probabilistic risk
   analysis, and the use of both formal and informal decision tools. EES-9
   leadership in environmental programs is based on our ability to
   integrate multidisciplinary expertise. We apply our expertise and
   capabilities primarily to problems related to environmental and
   geologic hazards. To be successful, we must integrate our
   decision-making and decision-support capabilities that impact human
   health and safety within the framework of regulatory policy. Group

   Environmental Dynamics and Spatial Analysis (EES-10)
   EES-10 is a highly interdisciplinary team that on focuses
   abiotic/biotic interactions, particularly in semiarid environments and
   emphasizes their tightly interrelated ecology and hydrology. Because
   such systems are also highly heterogeneous, spatial analysis and
   accounting for spatial heterogeneity are critical components. Our
   overall approach integrates (1) high-resolution modeling, (2) long-term
   multiscale field data collection, and (3) experimental manipulation.
   Our broad range of research results applies to a variety of
   environmental problems, from contaminant transport and landfill-cover
   design to global change. Group Members

   Geophysics (EES-11)
   EES-11 is a multidisciplinary group of over 60 people with a focus on
   basic and applied research in seismology, stress wave physics,
   geodynamics, nonlinear elasticity, drilling systems, and borehole
   instrumentation. The groups research involves experimental, numerical,
   and observational approaches. We are responsible for geophysical
   laboratories; experimental and operational drilling rigs and associated
   shops and equipment; deployed and deployable seismometers; and borehole
   logging equipment. Group Members

   Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP)
   Los Alamos National Laboratory maintains one of the University of
   California's five branches of its Institute of Geophysics and Planetary
   Physics. We sponsor a broad, collaborative research program in the
   Geosciences that provides for exchanges of university faculty and
   students with laboratory research staff. This collaboration results in
   a continuous flow of ideas to and from the Laboratory that invigorates
   and enhances Laboratory program and core competency development
   efforts, as well as continuing collaboration with the University of
   California and other research universities throughout the nation. Group

   Los Alamos Seismic Research Center (LASRC)
   The Los Alamos Seismic Research Center (LASRC) is a unified team of
   scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) that focuses on
   basic and applied research on a wide range of seismic phenomena.
   Current areas of expertise include: crustal imaging on all scales,
   seismic wave propagation and source modeling, seismic hazards
   assessment, paleoseismology, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
   verification, nonlinear acoustics, oil and gas exploration/production,
   interaction of seismic waves with fluids in porous media, and
   educational outreach programs.
