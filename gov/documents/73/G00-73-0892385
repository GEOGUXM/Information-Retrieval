                            A Word from the Chief

    Our City has begun a new look, a new bridge, downtown renovation and
   soon a new City Building. The Kelso Police Department is also taking on
    a new look this year. The construction of a new Police Station within
      the new City Complex will provide a new facility to assist us in
     serving the public. We have also transformed the look of our patrol
                                  vehicles.

        Looking back over the past year, I am very proud of the many
    accomplishments the men and women of the Kelso Police Department have
   achieved. Our goal is improving the quality and consistency of service
                          we provide the community.

   With the continued support of the community and leadership of our City
      Council, the hard work and dedication of our staff, I am looking
                      forward to continuing that trend.

                               Steve Scibelli
                               Chief of Police
