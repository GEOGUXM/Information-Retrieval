   Licensing Process

   The Medical Board's Licensing Section protects the consumer through the
   proper licensing of physicians and surgeons.  The comprehensive review
   of an application provides that licensees have the requisite
   qualifications and educational credentials for medical practice.

   California's licensing requirements remain among the more stringent in
   the nation; nevertheless, an ever-increasing number of applicants seek
   licensure in California.  During the 1999-2000 fiscal year, almost
   4,650 applications were received by the Board and over 4,000 licenses
   were granted.  Applicants should recognize that the application review
   process can be lengthy and are encouraged to start the application
   process at least six to nine months before they need licensure.  While
   the sense of urgency experienced by each applicant is understood, the
   licensing staff is responsible for reviewing many files, and cannot
   complete the review of a file if required documents are missing.
   Oftentimes, the missing documents must be obtained from distant medical
   schools or programs, resulting in more delays.  Furthermore, during
   busy times of the year, individual staff members may be working on over
   500 files at any one time.  It is imperative for applicants to
   understand that the review process is guided by the requirements set
   forth in State law, which does not provide for any waivers to be
   granted by staff or by the Board.
     * Applications are reviewed in the order of receipt.
     * Applicants should submit all required documentation as soon as
       possible; however, without both the application and fees, staff
       cannot begin the initial review process.
     * Fingerprint cards should be submitted early in the process,
       preferably with the application and fees, because this security
       clearance is lengthy.
     * Do not wait to submit an application until all documentation is
       complete, because that will significantly delay the fingerprint
       card processing.

   Once an application has been received, staff must complete the initial
   review within 60 working days, although this often occurs in less
   time.  The applicant is then notified in writing of the application
   status and given an itemized list of documents needed to complete the
   file.  These subsequent documents also will be reviewed in order of
   receipt.

   The review of applications filed by US/Canadian medical graduates is
   fairly routine.  When delays occur, they generally result from the
   required FBI fingerprint clearance, which may take a few months.

   While the review of applications filed by international graduates is
   more complex, delays usually are the result of education and training
   which does not meet the standard required in law and which therefore
   must be remediated.  Other extensive delays occur as applicants try to
   obtain documents from foreign institutions or when certified
   translations are needed.

   Lastly, when all documents have been submitted and an application is
   complete, regulations allow an additional 100 days for processing.
   This time frame may include a senior management review of complex files
   and a request for clarification of some documented information.

   Keeping all of this in mind, we cannot predict the variables that may
   cause delays as each application is reviewed.  Therefore, it is not
   possible to provide assurances that any applicant will be licensed by a
   specific date.
