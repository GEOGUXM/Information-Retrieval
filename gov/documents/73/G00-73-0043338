                             HOW TO PARTICIPATE


                                                     NASA will collaborate
                                              on research with outstanding
                                         educational institutions, as well
                                             as cutting-edge companies and
                                                  non-profit organizations
                                                     at NASA Research Park

   They will come from the integration of these segments, each making the
   most of its unique attributes--NASA's focus on high-risk, long-term
   research; industry's abilitiy to react quickly with applied

   technologies; and academia's expertise in educating and training a
   vibrant work force for the future. At the NASA Research Park, Ames
   Research Center partners provide educational opportunities consistent
   with NASA's mission.

     Partners must meet the following criteria:

      Support NASA's mission under the Space Act (42 U.S.C. õ2451 set
     seq.)
      Comply with site environmental constraints and community
     partnership agreements

        Ames is one of ten NASA centers throughout the United States
    It is located in the heart of the Silicon Valley at Moffett Field in
                                 California

                        Ames Leads Key NASA Research

     Aerospace Operations Systems research at Ames has a long history of
    improving air traffic control and aircraft performance.  The program
    aims to make major reductions in aircraft accidents and to triple the
                      national airspace system by 2010.

        Astrobiology is the study of Earth science, space science and
     evolutionary biology. Ames researchers seek answers to fundamental
   questions about the origin of life, the existence of life beyond Earth
                and the future of life on Earth and in space.

       Information Technology research at Ames is infusing innovative
   approaches and technologies into all of NASA's programs, including the
        Space Shuttle and the Space Station. Researchers also work on
     intelligent systems to explore the universe, computer models of the
   Earth to help us understand its complex workings and new ways to handle
                         increasing amounts of data.
