        Board of Vocational Nursing And Psychiatric Technicians Logo

                         LICENSING AND EXAMINATIONS

   The Board is responsible for examination and licensure of over 7,000 VN
   applicants and 450 PT applicants annually. There are five different
   methods to qualify for licensure as an LVN in California (see
   Vocational Nurse Fact Sheet), and four different methods of qualifying
   for PT licensure (see Psychiatric Technician Fact Sheet).

   The Board contracts with the National Council of State Boards of
   Nursing, Inc. for the year-round computer-adaptive vocational nurse
   licensure examination (NCLEX) administered at over 200 test centers
   nationwide. After an application has been approved, the applicant is
   sent an NCLEX Registration Bulletin with instructions on registering
   for the examination. Once the applicant has registered for the NCLEX,
   an Authorization to Test will be mailed from the NCLEX Data Center in
   New Jersey. The applicant is then responsible for calling to schedule
   an appointment to test.

   There is no national licensure examination for PTs. The Board develops
   and administers a year-round computer-administered examination to
   approximately 450 applicants annually at four test centers (Alameda,
   Diamond Bar, Sacramento and San Diego.). When a PT applicant is
   approved, a Notice of Eligibility and Candidate Handbook is mailed. The
   applicant is responsible for calling the toll-free number to schedule
   an appointment to test.

   For information regarding out-of-state licensed applicants, see the
   Fact Sheet for Out-of-State Licensed Applicants.

   Pursuant to Sections 2512 (Vocational Nurses) and 2571 (Psychiatric
   Technicians) of the California Code of Regulations, an application
   shall be deemed abandoned if no action is taken on an application by
   the applicant for a period of two years. Abandoned applications and all
   pertinent records are destroyed at the end of the two-year period.
