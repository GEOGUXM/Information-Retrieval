   Until 1994, the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) had been
   responsible for archiving and distributing both space and Earth science
   data. Of its nearly 7 terabytes of archival digital data, approximately
   3.4 terabytes were Earth science data. In addition, NSSDC held an
   extensive Earth science film archive. A new policy from the Earth
   Sciences and Applications Division at NASA Headquarters placed the
   responsibility for data archiving and management on the science
   discipline divisions whose missions would support the science research
   community. Consequently, NSSDC no longer archives any new Earth science
   data. In fact, much of the existing Earth science data holdings are to
   be migrated to the various designated archives. Since 1992, NSSDC has
   taken a pro-active role in identifying and initiating the transfer of
   various Earth science data products, about half of which are restored
   on new magnetic media. This page describes the Earth science data
   transfer activities and provides selective data, information, and
   resources available to users. It also links to some external resources.
