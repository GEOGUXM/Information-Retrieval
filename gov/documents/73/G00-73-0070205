   Bicycle Rules and Safety

   Bicycles riders (cyclists) on public streets have the same rights and
   responsibilities as automobile drivers and are subject to the same
   rules and regulations as any other vehicle on the road.

   Each year in California, over one hundred people are killed, and
   hundreds of thousands more are injured in bicycle collisions.

   The keys to safe bicycling include being predictable, visible and
   communicating your intentions to motorists.

   The following links provide valuable information on Bicycle Rules and
   Safety, as well as some helpful hints and general bicycle information.
