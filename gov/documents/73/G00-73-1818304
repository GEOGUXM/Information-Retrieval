   The Scientific LibraryÂ’s experienced staff can help fill all your
   scientific information needs, and save you valuable time, by searching
   many different databases for you and sending you the results. We can
   search databases that provide access to journal citations, chemical
   information, cited references, journal impact factors, full-text
   patents, and more. Our librarians can help you find the information
   that is vital to your research needs. In most cases, we can offer this
   service at no cost to you.
   The Scientific Library staff has access to many different databases,
   including:

     [di.gif] Beilstein
     [di.gif] Chemical Abstracts on CD-ROM

   The Library's staff can access additional databases via a fee-based
   information retrieval system. The cost of searching this system is
   charged to your program after approval and signature authorization is
   obtained. The staff will discuss any possible cost with you BEFORE
   performing any fee-based search. The  fee-based system that we
   currently use is:
