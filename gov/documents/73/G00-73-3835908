   General Comments
   The temporal resolution of both Landsat Thematic Mapper (referred to as
   Landsat TM or TM), which have been collected since 1983, and Landsat
   MSS data, is about two weeks. The TM data have a spatial resolution of
   30 meters, compared to 75 meters for the MSS, and six rather than four
   spectral bands; three visible bands (blue, green, and red) versus two
   for the MSS data, plus a near-infrared and two mid-infrared bands
   versus two near-infrared for the MSS. Therefore, more detailed regional
   and local eolian erosion vulnerability image maps can be generated
   using the TM data. However, like the MSS data, its temporal resolution
   of about two weeks makes the data not very useful for monitoring and
   detecting active dust storms. Also, because of the relatively high
   spatial resolution of the TM data, compared to GOES, SeaWiFS, and WiFS,
   detailed analysis of vegetation dynamics at dust source sites can be
   made. In the deserts, with the two week revisit time and commonly cloud
   free conditions it is usually not diffcult to find multitemporal TM
   data for change analysis between different years and/or seasons to
   evaluate vegetation changes caused by climate variations at both
   regional and relatively local scales. This type of multitemporal
   vegetation change analysis is an important part of this project.

   A digital image map mosaic was generated using twelve Landsat TM images
   collected during the summer of 1997 (eight images were collected in
   June, three on July 15th, and one on May 21st). The 1997 digital image
   mosaic (shown on the left) represents land surface conditions during a
   dry season in a dry year. The data are being used to compare with a
   digital image mosaic generated using 1992 Landsat TM images which
   represents land surface conditions during a wet season in a wet/El Ni√±o
   year. The wet year image mosaic was generated using Landsat TM images
   collected during April 1992. Figure 1 (lower left) shows the regional
   rainfall for for a portion of the Southwest from 1992 and 1997, (600 x
   800, 40 kilobytes).

   Besides using the Landsat TM image mosaics to generate digital change
   images, which help with several issues including those dealing with
   vegetation change and the transport of fine sediments, we are also
   using the image maps to extract information about soil types,
   vegetation cover, and surface armouring/protection. The spatial
   resolution of the mosaics is 30 meters. Landsat TM bands 2, 4, and 5
   were used to generated the color composite shown on the left. In order
   to better show the land surface information in both bright and dark
   regions on a single product, a large spatial filter was applied to the
   data.

   view the mosaic at higher resolutions.

   Laughlin, Nevada Area
   (600 x 691, 780 kilobytes) Click one of the thumbnails to view a pair
   of images collected on two different dates: 19 April 1992 and 20 June
   1997. The images are animated, alternating (blinking) between the pair,
   to better visualize where vegetation and other surface changes have
   occured. Viewing images in this manner allows one to easily see changes
   between the two dates.

   The blink animations require a JavaScript capable/enabled browser, such
   as Netscape or MS Internet Explorer versions 3.0 and higher. Contact
   webmistress@TerraWeb.wr.usgs.gov for help or comments.

   20 June 1997
   (732 x 688, 283 kilobytes) Click one of the thumbnails to view an 10x
   compressed overview image and access full resolution images of subareas
   of particular interest.

   Click on the Blink button to view a 10x compressed image pair: the
   false color composite and the eolian erosion vulnerability image map of
   the region. The images will be animated, alternating (blinking) back
   and forth between the pair. Viewing images in this manner allows one to
   easily compare vulnerable areas (yellow tones in the map) with the
   false color composite.

   The blink animations require a JavaScript capable/enabled browser, such
   as Netscape or MS Internet Explorer versions 3.0 and higher. Contact
   webmistress@TerraWeb.wr.usgs.gov for help or comments.
