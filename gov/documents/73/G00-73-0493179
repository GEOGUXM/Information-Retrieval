                                  Learning

      NASA Oceanography recognizes the importance of teaching today's and
   tomorrow's decision-makers about the state of our ocean planet and the
                   role played by scientific observation.

                        Mission Educational Resources

         ESE and each ocean observing satellite mission have produced
      educational products that will help students and teachers better
           understand what NASA Oceanography program is all about.

                         Sustainable Seas Expedtions

          NASA Oceanography has also partnered with Sustainable Seas
      Expeditions (SSE) to conduct a series of online events that takes
    students on the expeditions in our National Marine Sanctuaries and to
   give teachers tools to teach oceanography in their classrooms. The SSE,
   NASA Oceanography partnership will create a basis by which teachers and
     students can come to know our oceans through their own research and
                                exploration.

                             Teaching from Space

       During the Fall of 1998 NASA's Teaching From Space partnered with
     NASA On The Cutting Edge to create programs on our ocean observing
     efforts. The following RealMedia archive is hosted by NASA Quest's
                       Learning Technologies Channel:

     Oceans In Motion and Color of Oceans

                                 Oceanworld

     Dr. Robert Stewart or "Dr. Bob" in the Department of Oceanography in
   the College of Geoscience at Texas A&M University invites you to learn
     about the oceans and how they impact our world. You will find some
     great educational resources helpful when teaching about our oceans.

     OceanWorld Web Site

                           Remote Sensing Tutorial

         If you want to know more about remote sensing NASA's Learning
      Technologies Project has created a great remote sensing teaching
    resource. You will also be directed to other ocean related web sites
                         for students and teachers.
