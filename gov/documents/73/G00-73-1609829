   Our Mission
   The JSC TSC will be the gateway to access the Human Space Science
   Intranet, where ISS experiment activities and science information can
   be easily accessed by the remote users and Principle Investigators
   (PIs). The PI and User community will have the ability to effortlessly
   check TSC services, POIC services, ISS science activity plans,
   experiment schedules, and confidently transfer experiment data over a
   secure channel in a low-cost environment.
   Security, especially network security with Firewalls is important so
   each PI will be protected from every other PI and Internet users. The
   TSC security policy will be used to determine acceptable traffic flow
   to and from each PI.
   Finally, the TSC will be capable of providing around the clock support,
   seven days a week. The actual schedule will be based upon on-board
   experiment activities. As an added benefit, the PI will be able to
   monitor their science and operation over the Internet via the TSC. The
   Mission Operations and Data Systems team, located at the TSC will
   respond to product and service questions from any of the PIs supported
   by the TSC. Our job is to ensure that all queries and requests are
   handled satisfactorily.
   The JSC Telescience Support Center data system provides data
   acquisition, data processing, data distribution, and data archive
   services for the currently defined users.
