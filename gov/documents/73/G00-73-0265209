                         A MESSAGE FROM VOA DIRECTOR

                              ROBERT R. REILLY

   [reilly.jpg] It is a great honor to have been selected by President
   George W. Bush, and confirmed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors,
   as the 25th Director of the Voice of America. I am especially pleased
   to be among the few VOA directors to have been chosen from within its
   ranks.

   No other government institution has played a larger role in ensuring
   that the United States has so many friends around the world. And today,
   at a time of crisis, we represent the single most powerful tool in the
   American arsenal of public diplomacy. I pledge my total commitment to
   making sure that we at VOA fulfill our mission as expressed in our
   Charter.

   President Bush was clearly referring to our mission when he said in his
   inaugural address, "Our democratic faith is more than a creed of our
   country Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations."
   The wind of which the President spoke is the airwaves on which we
   broadcast. The content of our programs is the seed. The message is one
   of hope and freedom. That is the true Voice of America.

   As you all know, the Voice of America was born during a period of great
   adversity, World War II. We are now in another period of great
   adversity. The promise made in 1942 that "We shall tell the truth"
   applies to our broadcasts today, just as it did then. We are in a war
   of ideas. This war preceded the outbreak of hostilities in Afghanistan.
   It continues as those hostilities occur, and will after their
   cessation. We are on one side in that war. The other side presents the
   United States as the source of all evil in the world and contends,
   therefore, that it must be destroyed. One of the many differences that
   characterize our side in the war of ideas is that we are not afraid to
   tell the truth.

   Telling the truth requires a great deal more than simply recounting the
   positions of the various sides in a dispute. It requires an act of
   discernment as to the veracity of the contending claims. In order to
   tell the truth, we must know it. In reporting it, our stories must
   point our audiences in its direction. This takes a great deal of
   research, context, and a tremendous breadth of knowledge. During this
   time of crisis, we are especially fortunate to have a staff with the
   skill and background to meet the very highest journalistic standards.

   In fact, I wish to commend the entire VOA staff for the outstanding job
   it has done, with limited resources and under extreme pressure, since
   the events of September 11th. Many of our staff have worked long and
   exhausting hours. I applaud their dedication, perseverance, and sense
   of duty. Qualities like these have made the VOA what it is today--a
   trusted and well-respected international broadcaster.

   I look forward to the task ahead in the great tradition of previous VOA
   directors. At this time, our initials could also aptly stand for the
   motto: Veritas Operans in Adversis Truth Working in Adversity.

   Sincerely,

   Robert Reilly

   Director
