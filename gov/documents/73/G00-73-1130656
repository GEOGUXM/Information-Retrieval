   This statement addresses collection, use and security of and access to

     * Information Collected and How it is Used
     * Information Related to the Registration of Manufactured Housing

    Information Collected and How it is Used

   We do not collect names, home, business or e-mail addresses, telephone
   numbers, or account information from contacts we receive through the
   Internet. We get this information only if you voluntarily provide it to
   us through e-mail, surveys or forms.

   Through our web server software we automatically collect and store the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain address used but not the
       e-mail address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical
       identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or
       directly to your computer;
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
    3. The date and time you visited this site; and
    4. The web pages you accessed at this site.

   The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web
   services and to help us understand how people are using our services.
   Our web site logs are not personally identifiable and we make no
   attempt to link them with the individuals who browse our site.

    Information Related to the Registration of Manufactured Housing

   The Department of Housing and Community Development is responsible for
   the registration of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, commercial
   coaches, truck campers, and floating homes. Information gathered from
   forms available at this site is used for the expressed purpose of
   processing your request and/or carrying out the purposes of specified
   statutes. Health and Safety Code Section 18081.3 allows us to provide
   bulk information regarding the registration and title status of
   manufactured homes, mobilehomes, commercial coaches, truck campers, and
   floating homes for statistical or commercial purposes. However, Code
   Section 18081.3(b) expressly excludes the name or names of the
   registered owner from being provided.

   The Department of Housing and Community Development will not sell bulk
   information for the purpose of creating a mailing list for
   solicitations. In addition, while any person may review the titling
   status of any particular mobilehome the home address of the registered
   owner appearing in the information on current registration and title
   status is confidential if the owner requests confidentiality of that
   information.

    Public Disclosure and Personal Information

   In accordance with the Public Records Act, Government Code Section 6253
   (a), some information collected at this site is considered public
   information and may be subject to inspection. Government Code Sections
   6254 et. seq. enumerates the exemptions to this public disclosure
   obligation. One such exemption is personal information the disclosure
   of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone
   number. We collect no personal information about you unless you
   voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (i.e.
   completing a "HCD Comments Form") and we will disclose no personal
   information other than that which is required by law.

   If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by
   the user, the California Information Practices Act of 1977, Government
   Code Section 11015.5 and the federal Privacy Act of 1974, may protect
   it. However, this information may constitute a public record once you
   provide it, and may be subject to public inspections and copying if not
   protected by federal or state law.

   California is prohibited by law from selling or otherwise distributing
   to third parties personal information collected by electronic means
   other than the bulk information described under "Information Related to
   the Registration of Manufactured Housing."

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy and Security Statement,
   the California Public Records Act, or other law governing the
   disclosure of records, the applicable law will control.

    Security Requirements for the Browser

   Our web site has security measures in place to protect against loss,
   misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. One of
   these measures is the use of a Secure Socket Layer which encrypts
   message transmissions. The Secure Socket Layer works with your browser
   and the receiving Internet site to scramble the message while it is
   transported through the Internet.

   Transactions requiring payment and/or confidential information require
   the use of a 128 bit encryption standard Secure Socket Layer.

    Unauthorized Use/Access

   This computing system is operated by the State of California and is for
   official use only. In the normal course of system monitoring,
   individuals with unauthorized access or unauthorized use are subject to
   having their activities monitored. If such monitoring reveals possible
   evidence of criminal activity further legal action may be taken in
   accordance with Section 502 of the California Penal Code and/or
   applicable federal law.
