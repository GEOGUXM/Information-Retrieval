   TXEB IMPLEMENTS NEW CASE NUMBERING SCHEME FOR 2002 The United States
   Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas has changed the way
   new bankruptcy cases are assigned their permanent case numbers. The new
   scheme was implemented on January 2, 2002. Case numbers on cases filed
   prior to 2002 remain unchanged. The Eastern District of Texas is made
   up of 7 divisions, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 & 9. Previously, the
   five-digit case number (for bankruptcy cases) consisted of the division
   number followed by a sequential 4-digit number within each office. A
   similar scheme was also used for the 4-digit adversary proceeding case
   number and the miscellaneous proceeding 3-digit number as well. The new
   scheme assigns sequential case numbers on a district-wide basis, rather
   than on a divisional office basis. The division number is no longer
   part of the case number. Each bankruptcy case number filed anywhere in
   the district is assigned a consecutive case number, the first being
   10001. Adversary & miscellaneous proceedings will have their respective
   four- and three-digit case numbers similarly assigned. This change has
   been implemented in preparation for electronic filing that will
   commence later this year. As electronic case & document filing grows,
   the importance of the division/office-based case number & the inherent
   distinction it provides will continue to wane. Case files will be
   stored in electronic form, available as needed throughout the district.
   Ultimately, document filing & retrieval will be available at any
   geographic location worldwide, via the Internet. For additional
   information regarding the new case numbering scheme or electronic
   document filing, contact your nearest Eastern District of Texas
   Bankruptcy Court Clerk's office.
