     Katherine MacReynolds receiving the award for "externally praised
     leadership of NIST services for characterizing customer
     transfer-standard and other antennas by near-field scanning and for
     calibration of the probes necessary for this method, key to the
     performance of satellite communication systems and advanced radar; for
     innovative contributions to antenna characterization methodology; and
     for provision of consistently superb service to near-field customers
     having special measurement needs."
