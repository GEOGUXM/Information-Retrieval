Introduction

   Boston Harbor, once one of the most polluted waterways in the nation,
   is in the final stages of a major cleanup. A $3.8 billion cleanup
   program, begun in 1985 by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
   (MWRA) was designed to address more than 300 years of metropolitan
   waste disposal. The cleanup has significantly improved the
   environmental quality of the harbor, enforced reduction of industrial
   waste releases at the source, eliminated sludge discharge (Dec. 1991),
   improved treatment of Boston sewage, and relocated the sewage outfall
   from the Harbor mouth to a new location 9 miles offshore in
   Massachusetts Bay.

USGS Research

   Since 1989, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation
   with the MWRA, has been conducting research to understand and predict
   the fate of contaminants introduced to Massachusetts` coastal waters.
   The overall objective is to develop a capability to predict the fate of
   contaminants associated with fine-grained sediments on a regional
   basis. We emphasize sediments because most contaminants introduced to
   the ocean are adsorbed by and transported with suspended sediments.
   After complicated cycles of deposition, resuspension, and biological
   and chemical interactions, contaminants on particles may be eventually
   buried in bottom sediments, which become the ultimate contaminant sink.

MAJOR RESULTS

   Image of Boston Harbor Ocean Circulation

   (a) Modelling
   Computer simulations of ocean circulation and dilution of sewage
   effluent show that, with the new outfall location, water quality will
   greatly improve in Boston Harbor without significantly degrading
   conditions in Massachusetts Bay, in Cape Cod Bay or in the rich
   biological habitat of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.
   Image of Sedimentary Deposits (b) Sediment Transport and Fate
   The ultimate respositories for some of the contaminants introduced from
   the Boston Metropolitan area are Stellwagen Basin and Cape Cod Bay.
   Winter storms resuspend and transport sediments from the region
   offshore of Boston, including the new outfall site, to these locations.
   Maps of sedimentary environments and bottom morphology have been
   generated using side scan sonar and high resolution bathymetric
   surveys. These have helped managers choose the location of the outfall
   and the location of stations used to monitor the fate and transport of
   contaminants.

   (c) Monitoring
   Monitoring sites have been established at critical locations in
   Massachusetts Bay to establish a baseline of contaminant levels in
   sediments and to document natural variability. These sites will
   continue to be monitored over the next 2 years as the treated effluent
   is discharged through the new outfall into Massachusetts Bay. Since
   1989, monitoring oceanographic parameters and sediment chemistry by the
   USGS near the Massachusetts Bay outfall has identified storms as a
   major process for redistributing sediments and associated contaminants.
   The USGS research program complements the benthic and water column
   monitoring program conducted by the Massachusetts Water Resources
   Authority.

   (d) Geochemistry
   The bottom sediments of Boston Harbor have gotten cleaner over the last
   20 years due to the reduced amount of pollutants introduced into the
   system.
