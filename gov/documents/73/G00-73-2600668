                   About the Atmospheric Sciences Division
            _____________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Atmospheric Sciences Division of Brookhaven National
   Laboratory. We are some three dozen scientists, engineers, and support
   personnel.

   Our research focuses mainly on the chemistry, physics, and transport of
   substances in the atmosphere. A major extension of our activity is the
   interaction of atmospheric materials with shortwave (solar) and
   longwave (terrestrial infrared) radiation. Another major focus of
   research is the use of tracers to measure flows and exchange of fluids
   between compartments, in the atmosphere, in buildings, and the
   subsurface environment, including pipelines, and petroleum reservoirs,
   to cite two recent examples. Our research consists of a mix of field
   measurements and their interpretation, laboratory studies, and theory
   and modeling.

   Support for our research comes largely from the United States
   Department of Energy (DOE), mainly from its Environmental Sciences
   Division (ESD) within the Office of Biological and Environmental
   Research (OBER) with additional support from other U.S. Government
   agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
   Important non-governmental support comes from agencies such as the
   Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

   Administratively, the Atmospheric Sciences Division is located within
   the Environmental Sciences Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory
   (BNL).  This home page is intended to introduce the visitor to our
   personnel and activities. We welcome your interest and inquiries.
