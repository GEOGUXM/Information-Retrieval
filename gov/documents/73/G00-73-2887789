   the first measurement of the rate of Type Ia supernovae at high
   redshift. The result is derived using a large subset of data from the
   Supernova Cosmology Project as described in more detail at this meeting
   by Perlmutter et al. (1996). We present our methods for estimating the
   numbers of galaxies and the number of solar luminosities to which the
   survey is sensitive, the supernova detection efficiency and hence the
   control time. We derive a rest-frame Type Ia supernova rate at z , 0:4
   of 0:82 +0:54\Gamma 0:37 +0:42\Gamma 0:32 h2 SNu where the first
   uncertainty is statistical and the second includes systematic effects.
   1. Introduction Beginning with the discovery of SN 1992bi (Perlmutter
   et al 1995), we have developed search techniques and rapid analysis
   methods that allow systematic discovery and follow up of "batches" of
   high-redshift supernovae. 1Presented by I. Hook (imh@mh1.lbl.gov) and

   PAIN ET AL. The observing strategy developed compares large numbers of
   galaxies in each of ,50 fields observed twice with a separation of ,3
   weeks. This search schedule makes it possible to precisely calculate
   the "control time," the effective time during which the survey is
   sensitive to a Type Ia event. For this analysis, we have studied a set
   of 52 similar search fields observed in December 1993 and January 1994.
   The data were obtained using the "thick" 1242 \Theta 1152 EEV5 camera
   at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma. The projected pixel size
   is 0:5600, giving an image area of approximately 110 \Theta 110.
   Exposure times were 600s in the RMould filter, and the images typically
   reach a 3oe limit of R = 23mag. Seeing was typically around 1:400. Many
   of the fields were selected due to the presence of a highredshift
   cluster (z , 0:4). Suitable clusters and their redshifts were taken
   from Gunn, Hoessel & Oke (1986) and from the ROSAT catalog. The total
   useful area covered in this study is 1.73 sq deg. The analysis
   procedure and method for finding SNe can be summarized as follows. For
   most fields, two first-look "reference" images were obtained and for
   all fields two second look "search" images were obtained 2\Gamma 3
   weeks after the reference images. The images were flat-fielded and
   zero-points for the images were estimated by comparison with E (red)
   magnitudes of stars in the APM (Automated plate measuring facility,
   Cambridge, UK) POSSI catalog (McMahon & Irwin 1992). The search images
   were combined (after convolution to match the seeing of the worst of
   the four images) and the combined reference images were subtracted from
   this after scaling in intensity. The resulting difference image for
   each field was searched for SN candidates. In this subset of the search
   data three SNe were found with redshifts 0.354, 0.375 and 0.420
   determined from spectra of the host galaxies. For the purposes of this
   analysis, we assume these are all Type Ia SNe (see Perlmutter et al.
   1996). The method used to calculate the rate can be divided into two
   main parts: (i) estimation of the number of galaxies and the total
   stellar luminosity (measured in 1010 LBfi) to which the survey is
   sensitive and (ii) estimation of the SN detection efficiency and hence
   the control time. 2. Galaxy counts In order to compare the distant SN
   rate with local equivalents, we need to know the redshifts of the
   galaxies we have surveyed. In this work we use the galaxy counts
   derived from the analysis of Lilly et al (1995) to estimate the number
   of galaxies sampled as a function of redshift. R band counts as a
   function of redshift were calculated by Lilly based on the analysis of
   magnitude-redshift data obtained in the Canada-France Redshift Survey
   THE TYPE IA SUPERNOVA RATE AT z , 0:4 3 Figure 1. Number of galaxies as
   a function of magnitude determined from one of our non-cluster images
   using FOCAS. The dashed-dot line shows the counts derived from the
   analysis of Lilly et al (1995), integrated over the redshift range 0 !
   z ! 2, and normalized to the image area of 0.03 sq deg. (Lilly et al,
   1995 and references therein). To check that the assumed distribution of
   galaxies with R magnitude and redshift, N (z; R), give reasonable
   galaxy counts compared to our data, we have plotted the number of field
   galaxies classified by the FOCAS software package, as a function of
   apparent magnitude, on one of the search images that was not targeted
   at a galaxy cluster. The R-band galaxy counts given by the analysis of
   Lilly et al (1995) integrated over the redshift range 0 ! z ! 2
   (dash-dotted line) are shown on the same scale, assuming an effective
   area for this image of 0.03 sq deg (Figure 1). Many of our search
   fields were chosen specifically to target high-redshift clusters. For
   each of these fields, we estimate the number of cluster galaxies by
   counting galaxies as a function of R magnitude in a box of size 500
   \Theta 500 pixels centered approximately on the center of the cluster
   as estimated by eye from the images. The counts in a similar box in a
   region of the image away from the cluster were subtracted from the
   cluster counts to give the cluster excess counts as a function of R
   mag. Typically a cluster contributes 10% of the galaxy counts on an
   image. We assign these galaxies to the cluster redshift, and add the
   cluster contribution to the N (z; R) for that image given by the
   models. Values of reddening due to the Galaxy were supplied by D.
   Burstein (derived from Burstein & Heiles, 1982) for each field and
   applied to the data assuming RV = 3:1 and AR=AV = 0:751 (Cardelli et
   al, 1989). 4 R. PAIN ET AL. 3. Control times and detection efficiencies
   To calculate the control times we assumed that SN magnitude as a
   function of time follows the average of the best-fit, time-dilated and
   K-corrected Leibundgut (1988) Type Ia template light curves (the
   generalized K correction described by Kim et al. (1996) and Kim, Goobar
   & Perlmutter (1995), was used here). The control time is then given by
   the weighted sum of days during which the SN can be detected, where the
   weighting is by the detection efficiency, ffl. This detection
   efficiency is a function of the magnitude difference \Delta m (zero if
   \Delta m is negative), which is itself a function of time t relative to
   maximum, and ffit, the time separation of the search and reference
   images. It depends on the quality of the subtracted images (seeing,
   transmission) together with the detailed technique (convolution,
   selection criteria) used to extract the signal (SNe candidates) from
   the background (cosmic rays, asteroids, bad subtractions, etc). In
   addition, there is a slight dependence on the host galaxy magnitude.
   The detection efficiency was calculated using a Monte-Carlo method. A
   synthetic image was created for every field by adding simulated
   supernovae to the search images using point-spreadfunctions drawn from
   each search image. The reference images were subtracted from the
   synthetic search images using exactly the same software as used for the
   supernova search and the number of simulated SNe that satisfy the
   selection criteria was determined. This technique allows us to measure
   detection efficiencies as a function of supernovae magnitude
   individually for every field, thus taking into account the other
   parameters mentioned above. Figure 2(a)-(c) shows the fractional number
   of simulated SN recovered, as a function of SN magnitude (at detection)
   for the three fields in which SNe were found. Figure 2(d) shows the
   efficiency as a function of relative surface brightnesses of the SN and
   host galaxy. This last parameter gives an indication of the effect of
   SN location with respect to the host galaxy. Although this is a small
   effect, it was taken into account. For a typical field the detection
   efficiency is over 85% for any added fake stellar object brighter than
   R = 22:0 magnitude (Note that the more recent searches of this project
   have worked with significantly deeper images). 4. SN Ia Rates 4.1.
   SURVEY RATE Before calculating the luminosity-weighted SN rate, we
   first determine a "survey rate" of SN discoveries that a search for Ia
   SNe can expect to obtain, per square degree. We give the rate in a
   range of 1 mag in R, THE TYPE IA SUPERNOVA RATE AT z , 0:4 5 21.0 21.5

   bars show the 1oe statistical uncertainty, and the horizontal bars show
   the bin ranges. centered on the mean peak R magnitude of the 3 SNe
   found in this search, R = 21:8. The survey rate is given by survey rate
   (21:3 ! R ! 22:3) = NSNP i areai \Theta \Delta Ti : where NSN = 3 is
   the number of SNe we found in the 1 magnitude range, and \Delta Ti is
   the control time for field i, computed for a SN with magnitude R = 21:8
   at maximum. For example a value of \Delta Ti = 21 days was found for
   the field containing SN1994H observed on 1993 December 19 and 1994
   January 12, 24 days apart. We measure a survey rate for 21:3 ! R ! 22:3
   of 34:4 +23:9\Gamma 16:2 SNe year\Gamma 1deg\Gamma 2 (the error quoted
   is statistical only). In practice this translates to 1.73 SNe per
   square degree discovered with a 3 week baseline, in data with limiting
   magnitude R , 23 (S=N , 3 for R=23). 4.2. RATE IN SNU To calculate the
   rate in SNu, we compute the expected redshift distribution of SNe,
   Nexp(z), which is proportional to the observed SN rate, rSN (1+z)\Gamma

   luminosity from clusters is shown by the shaded area. The December
   1993-January 1994 search data was most likely to find SNe with
   redshifts between z = 0:3 and z = 0:4. Between z = 0:3 and z = 0:55,
   the search was more than 50% efficient. Note that our more recent
   searches go deeper than this data. where rSN is the rate in the
   rest-frame of the supernovae. It is given by Nexp(z) = rSN1 + z X R X i
   Ngal(z; R)i \Theta LB(z; R) \Theta \Delta Ti(z; R) where i runs over
   all fields, R is the galaxy apparent R magnitude and LB is the galaxy
   rest-frame B band luminosity in units of 1010 LBfi. The control times
   \Delta T , in units of centuries, have been calculated for each field
   in bins of z and R (the size of the bins is 0.5 mag in R, 0.05 in z).
   To compute the rest-frame B band galaxy luminosities from apparent R
   magnitudes, we used B \Gamma R colors and B-band K corrections supplied
   by Gronwall & Koo. Note that the combined color, K and evolution
   correction is small in the redshift range of interest (0:3 \Gamma 0:5)
   since the observed R band is close to the rest-frame B-band. In this
   calculation MBfi = 5:48 and q0 = 0:5 were assumed. The rest frame
   supernovae rate rSN at z , 0:4 was obtained by fitting the redshift
   distribution of observed SNe to the expected distribution, Nexp(z)
   using a maximum-likelihood fit using Poisson statistics. The mean
   redshift corresponding to this rate is ! z ?= THE TYPE IA SUPERNOVA

   derive a value for the SN rate of rSN (z = 0:38) = 0:82 +0:54\Gamma
   0:37 h2 SNu: where the error is statistical only. 4.3. SYSTEMATIC
   UNCERTAINTIES We have studied various sources of systematic
   uncertainty. Table 1 summarizes their contributions. For given assumed
   galaxy counts, the main contribution comes from the fact that Type Ia
   SNe are not perfect standard candles. We also tested the sensitivity of
   our result to the assumed form of galaxy evolution, N (z; R), by
   recalculating the rate using the model of Gronwall & Koo (1995) and
   that used by Glazebrook et al (1995). These give values for the rate of
   1:61+1:05\Gamma 0:73h2 SNu and 1:27+0:83\Gamma 0:57h2 SNu respectively.
   Although there is a large difference in the results derived using the
   counts of Lilly et al compared with the other models, we choose not to
   include this in the systematic uncertainty. For the purposes of this
   analysis we use the Lilly et al counts, since these are based on data
   that are well-matched to our survey in magnitude and redshift range,
   and only small amount of extrapolation was required in converting from
   the I to R band. Host galaxy inclination and extinction effects could
   not be estimated following the analysis used for nearby searches
   because of the different detection techniques involved. A correct
   estimation would require modeling of galaxy opacities, which is beyond
   the scope of this paper. We therefore compare our uncorrected value
   with uncorrected values for nearby searches, 8 R. PAIN ET AL.
   Altogether, we estimate the total systematic error to be +0:32\Gamma
   0:42 and we assume the Lilly et al counts for N (z; R). 5. Discussion
   and Conclusion This measurement is the first direct measurement of the
   Type Ia rate at high redshift. In their pioneering work searching for
   high redshift supernovae, Hansen et al. (1989) discovered a probable
   Type II event at z = 0:28 and a Type Ia event at z = 0:31
   (No/rgaard-Nielsen et al., 1989), however no estimates of SN Ia rates
   were published based on this discovery. Nearby Supernovae rates have
   been carefully reanalyzed recently (Cappellaro et al. 1993a & 1993b,
   Turatto et al., 1994, Van den Bergh and McClure, 1994, Muller et al.
   1992) using more precise methods for calculating the control times and
   correcting for inclination and over-exposure of the nuclear regions of
   galaxies in photographic searches. The rate obtained for Type Ia SNe
   are now consistent among these groups and vary between 0.2 h2 SNu and
   0.7 h2 SNu depending on the galaxy types (E, Sa etc., higher rates are
   found in later type galaxies). Taking into account the facts that at z
   ,0.4 the ratios of galaxy type are different and using the Type Ia
   rates reported in Cappellaro et al (1993b), we calculate a local rate
   of 0:53 \Sigma 0:25 h2 SNu for the mix of galaxies expected at z , 0:4.
   Our measured value of 0:82+0:68\Gamma 0:49h2 SNu (where statistical and
   systematic uncertainties have been combined), although slightly higher,
   agrees with this value within the uncertainty and indicates that Type
   Ia rates do not change dramatically out to z ,0.4. Note, however that
   correcting for host galaxy extinction and inclination may change this
   conclusion. Theoretical estimates of Type Ia SNe rates have been
   derived from stellar and galaxy evolution models. Calculations were
   done mostly for elliptical galaxy type. Recent calculations, based on
   evolutionary models of elliptical galaxies, predict rates of , 0:1h2
   SNu (Ferrini & Poggianti 1993). Assuming a factor of , 2 higher rate in
   non-elliptical galaxies compared to ellipticals (Capellaro et al.
   1993b) and a mix of galaxy types as above, we convert this to an
   overall rate of Type Ia SNe at z , 0:4 in all galaxy types, and derive
   a value of , 0:37h2 SNu. Our total uncertainty of +0:68\Gamma 0:49 in
   the measurement presented in this paper does not allow any firm
   conclusion but our observed rate seems to lie above this theoretical
   prediction. There may be an increase of Type Ia rate with redshift.
   Ruiz-Lapuente, Burkert & Canal (1995) predict significant increase in
   rate for redshifts between 0.4 and 0.8 depending on the specific model
   they consider. In the near future, our ongoing high-z SN search and
   others should provide enough data to constrain the theoretical
   calculations. This work was supported in part by the National Science
