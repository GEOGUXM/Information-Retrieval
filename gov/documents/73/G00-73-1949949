   What's the fastest way to find something if I don't know what heading
   to look under?
   The site map lists all of the links under each main heading on the home
   page. You can go to the site map and either browse or, following the
   instructions at the top, search for a specific term.

   Some tables are too wide for my printer. How can I make them fit on the
   printout?
   Here are some options:
    1. Use the smallest font size offered by your browser.
    2. In the "Page Setup"(Internet Explorer) or "Print..."(Netscape
       Navigator) menu, change the paper orientation from portrait to
       landscape.
    3. Save the HTML page as a text file and then open it in your word
       processor; or copy the table and paste it into an open word
       processor document. Then change the margins, paper size, and font
       size as necessary. Note: Decimal alignment in the table columns
       will hold only with a monospace font, such as Courier.
    4. If the document is available in PDF, use the print option in
       Adobe's Acrobat Reader.

   Why are some files in PDF format, and how can I read them?
   Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) reproduces the exact look of a
   printed page and is used for documents that could not be readily
   deployed in hypertext markup language (HTML)--the "typeset" format that
   is designed for web browsers--or in the plain "typewriter" text of
   ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Also, the
   document may be offered in PDF along with one or both of the other two
   formats.

   PDF files are displayed through Adobe's Acrobat Reader, which can be
   obtained free of charge from Adobe's site.

   For information about PDFs and screen-reading software for the visually
   impaired, see our Accessibility page.

   A document was updated today but I am getting only the old version. How
   do I get the update?
   Try clicking the "reload" button on your browser.
   When you request a Web document, your browser downloads it from the
   originating site to your computer; it is this copy that your browser
   reads. When you next request the document, your browser may be reading
   the copy on your computer and not the updated version on the
   originating site. Clicking "reload" will usually get the updated
   version.
   Note: Because the document address may have changed since you last saw
   it, you should reload the page that leads to the desired document as
   well as the document itself.

   Clicking "reload" didn't get the updated document. What now?
   Try clearing cache.
   Your local copy of the document may have been stored in a feature of
   your browser called cache. The "reload" request may have directed the
   browser to your cache instead of the originating site. Removing copies
   of documents from cache will force the browser when you click "reload"
   to seek the document at the originating site.
   To clear cache, consult the help files of your browser.

                                                             Return to top
     __________________________________________________________________

   What do I do if clearing cache plus clicking "reload" doesn't get the
   updated document?
   You may need to consult with your Internet service provider (ISP).
   Your ISP will sometimes cache documents for the same reason browsers
   cache documents. If many users are requesting the same document, the
   ISP stores the document on its system instead of retrieving it from the
   originating site each time a user requests it. Hence the ISP copy may
   not be the originating site's latest version.
