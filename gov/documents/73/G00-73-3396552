   How and when was the EPA created?

   According to the publication "The Guardian: Origins of the EPA,"
   President Nixon declared his intention to establish the Environmental
   Protection Agency with Reorganization Plan Number 3, dated July 9,
   1970. The EPA's mission would include:

     "The establishment and enforcement of environmental protection
     standards consistent with national environmental goals... The
     conduct of research on the adverse effects of pollution and on
     methods and equipment for controlling it; the gathering of
     information on pollution; and the use of this information in
     strengthening environmental protection programs and recommending
     policy changes... assisting others, through grants, technical
     assistance and other means, in arresting pollution of the
     environment... assisting the Council on Environmental Quality in
     developing and recommending to the President new policies for the
     protection of the environment."

   After being cleared through hearings in the Senate and House of
   Representatives, the EPA came into being on December 2, 1970.

   You can obtain a copy of this publication at the above link or from the

   How can I locate the phone numbers and mailing addresses of EPA staff
   people?

   EPA's automated Employee Directory contains the telephone numbers of
   most EPA employees and associated contractors. You can search the
   locator by the name of the employee. The main mailing address for EPA
   is:

   Environmental Protection Agency
   Ariel Rios Bldg
   1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW
   Washington, DC 20460

   To send a letter to a certain person, you would need to add their name,
   and the appropriate mail code (listed in the Employee Directory) for
   the employee's office to the above address.

   There is also a list of mailing addresses for EPA's regional offices.

   How do I report a violation of environmental regulations?

   State and local governments have responsibility for enforcing most
   environmental laws in the area where you live. You can locate these
   government offices through your telephone directory. In most
   communities, the responsible agency is the city or county health
   department. At the state level, an environmental agency carries out the
   pollution control laws, whereas an agriculture agency often handles
   regulation of pesticides. If these sources can't help you, contact your
   regional EPA office.

   How can I find out about job openings and internships at the EPA?

   The Office of Human Resources and Organizational Services is the key
   contact for all employment information within the EPA. However, job
   information is not contained centrally on the EPA Internet server, but
   is instead maintained by the Federal Office of Personnel Management
   (OPM) exit EPA . OPM offers information about all federal jobs that fit
   specific qualifications, and will soon be searchable by specific
   Agencies or Departments.

   For environmental general employment/career information, please access
   the "Environmental Careers Resource Guide". This document contains fact
   sheets concerning different environmental careers, and links to a
   "Regional Human Resource Offices" page which provides phone numbers and
   addresses for EPA offices. For the Washington DC area you can call the
   jobs hotline at 202-260-6000, or call Employee Services at
   202-260-3267.

   EPA offers several opportunities for internships. You can find
   information on these opportunities from the Office of Human Resources
   and Organizational Services web site.

   You may also wish to contact your regional EPA office for information
   about more internship opportunities. If you call the Human Resources
   phone number at the office to which you would like to apply, the staff
   member can direct you to offices with summer internship openings.
