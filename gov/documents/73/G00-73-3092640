                                 Get Acrobat

   To download these NLRB forms you will need to use Adobe Acrobat 3.0 (or
   newer version), which you can install for free by clicking on the
   yellow button above. To fill in the form, select the hand tool on the
   Adobe toolbar and click inside a box on the form. An "I" beam will
   appear to allow you to type your information. Press tab or click in
   other boxes to get to different areas of the form. Use the + magnifying
   glass to increase type size for easier reading. Click outside of the
   form field before printing because a field will not print if it still
   contains a blinking "I" beam. For best results at printing, be sure to
   use the printer button on the Adobe toolbar to print instead of the one
   on your browser. When you click on any of these forms, you first will
   find instructions on how to fill out and file the form, followed by the
   form itself. The instructions for filling in the charge and petition
   forms are also set forth below.

                            IMPORTANT INFORMATION
                      BEFORE FILLING OUT A CHARGE FORM!
     * Please call an Information Officer in the Regional Office nearest
       you for assistance in filing a charge. The Information Officer will
       be happy to answer your questions about the charge form or to draft
       the charge on your behalf. Seeking assistance from an Information
       Officer may help you to avoid having the processing of your charge
       delayed or your charge dismissed because of mistakes made in
       completing the form.
     * Please be advised that not every workplace action that you may view
       as unfair constitutes an unfair labor practice within the
       jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Please
       click on the Help Desk button for more information on matters
       covered by the NLRA.
     * The section of the charge form called, "Basis of Charge," seeks
       only a brief description of the alleged unfair labor practice. You
       should NOT include a detailed recounting of the evidence in support
       of the charge or a list of the names and telephone numbers of
       witnesses.
     * After completing the charge form, be sure to sign and date the
       charge and mail or deliver the completed form to the appropriate
       Regional Office.
     * A charge should be filed with the Regional Office which has
       jurisdiction over the geographic area of the United States where
       the unfair labor practice occurred. For example, an unfair labor
       practice charge alleging that an employer unlawfully discharged an
       employee would usually be filed with the Regional Office having
       jurisdiction over the worksite where the employee was employed
       prior to his/her discharge. An Information Officer will be pleased
       to assist you in locating the appropriate Regional Office in which
       to file your charge.
     * The NLRBs Rules and Regulations state that it is the responsibility
       of the individual, employer or union filing a charge to timely and
       properly serve a copy of the charge on the person, employer or
       union against whom such charge is made.
     * By statute, only charges filed and served within six (6) months of
       the date of the event or conduct, which is the subject of that
       charge, will be processed by the NLRB.

                            IMPORTANT INFORMATION
                     BEFORE FILLING OUT A PETITION FORM!
     * Please call an Information Officer in the Regional Office nearest
       you for assistance in filing a petition. The Information Officer
       will be happy to answer your questions about the petition form or
       to draft the petition on your behalf.
     * Check one of the boxes listed under Question 1 representing the
       purpose of the petition: RC-a union desires to be certified as the
       bargaining representative of employees; RM-an employer seeks an
       election because one or more individuals or unions have sought
       recognition as the bargaining representative, or based on a
       reasonable belief supported by objective considerations that the
       currently recognized union has lost its majority status;
       RD-employees seek to remove the currently recognized union as the
       bargaining representative; UD-employees desire an election to
       restrict the union's right to maintain a union shop clause; UC-a
       labor organization or an employer seeks clarification of the
       existing bargaining unit; or AC-a labor organization or an employer
       seeks an amendment of a certification issued in a prior Board case.
     * Under Question 5, please carefully describe the bargaining unit
       involved in the petition, listing the job classifications included
       in the unit and the job classifications excluded from the unit.
     * After completing the petition form, be sure to sign and date the
       petition and mail, fax or hand deliver the completed petition form
       to the appropriate Regional Office.
     * The filing of a petition seeking certification or decertification
       of a union should generally be accompanied by a sufficient showing
       of interest to support such a petition-i.e., a showing that 30% or
       more of the employees in the bargaining unit seek to be represented
       by the union or seek to decertify the currently recognized union.
       If the showing is not sent to the Region with the filing of the
       petition, a party must supply the showing of interest within 48
       hours after the filing of the petition, but in no event later than
       the last day on which a petition may be timely filed.
     * Be sure to include telephone and fax numbers of the parties since
       this will be a significant aid to the processing of the petition.
     * Be sure to include the name and address of any other labor
       organization or individuals known to have a representative interest
       in any of the employees in the unit described in Question 5 of the
       petition.
     * A petition should be filed with the Regional Office where the
       bargaining unit exists. If the bargaining unit exists in two or
       more Regions, it can be filed in any of such Regions. An
       Information Officer will be happy to assist you in locating the
       appropriate Regional Office in which to file your petition.

       Agent to whom your case is assigned that you intend to file such a
       request and the date you will send it to the Regional Office. If a
       withdrawal request is not received within the time period
       communicated to the Board Agent to whom your charge or petition is
       assigned, the Board Agent may recommend that the charge be
       dismissed.
