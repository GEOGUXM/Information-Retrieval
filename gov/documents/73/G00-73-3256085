                     FREQUENTLY REQUESTED COUNTY RECORDS

   Many County agencies retain historical records in their offices. This
   directory is intended to assist the public and County agencies in
   locating King County records that are retained by the creating agency,
   or are housed at another repository, and are requested on a frequent
   basis.

   For ease of use, records are grouped according to a broad function as
   opposed to alphabetically or by agency. Where necessary some records
   are listed under more than one function.

   Note that only records are included, not services. For example,
   adoption records are listed, but who to contact for the adoption
   process is not since that is a service. In cases where the distinction
   between record and service was not clear, it is listed as a record.

   Functional Categories:

   Court - Legal Records             Election Records
   Legislative Records               Police Records
   Licenses - Certificates - Permits Tax - Financial Records
   Property - Land Records:
       Assessment Records
       Construction Records
       Real Property Records
                                     Personal Records
                                     (records relating to people)
