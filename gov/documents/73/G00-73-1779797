   We are the natural outgrowth of the ice research community...a
   laboratory dedicated to providing our colleagues with a premier
   facility for examining, sampling, and analyzing ice cores from some of
   the remotest places on Earth. We are scientists, technicians, and
   students here to work with you, learn with you, inform you and connect
   you with the world of ice core research.
