                           GOES Solar X-ray Imager

   The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Solar
   X-ray Imager (SXI) is a Wolter Type I grazing incidence X-ray telescope
   to be deployed on the GOES-M spacecraft. The SXI instrument (103 kb GIF
   image) is designed to obtain a continuous sequence of coronal x-ray
   images at a 1-minute cadence with a 512X512 intensified CCD. Broadband
   filters will be employed to obtain images at several wavelength bands
   between about 6 and 60 Ã…. These images will be used by the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center
   (NOAA/SEC) and the broader community to monitor solar activity for its
   effects on the Earth's upper atmosphere and near space environment. Dr.
   John Davis of the MSFC Solar Physics Branch is Project Scientist for
   SXI.

   GOES-M launch GOES-M was launched on July 23, 2001 at 3:23 a.m. EDT
   atop an Atlas 2A rocket. Approximately one hour after launch, the
   spacecraft deployed its electricity-generating, solar array. To date,
   GOES-M systems appear to be healthy.

   Although not yet operational, SXI test images may be obtained from the
   National Geophysical Data Center.
