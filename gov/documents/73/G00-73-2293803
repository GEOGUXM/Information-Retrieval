   Smallpox
   Disease of the past and protection for the future
   The last natural case of smallpox occurred in 1977, and in 1980, the
   World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global eradication of
   smallpox and recommended that all countries cease vaccination.

   Because there are concerns that the smallpox virus could be used as a
   bioterroristic weapon, the CDC Smallpox Outbreak Response Plan and
   Guidelines has been developed and is currently under review. The plan
   will coordinate CDC, state, and local public health activities should a
   smallpox outbreak occur, and it will help health officials define and
   control the outbreak.

                                                                      News
