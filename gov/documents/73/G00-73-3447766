   Statewide Peer Review

   The New York State Academy for Teaching and Learning (NYSATL) reviews
   and promotes model Learning Experiences for study and replication. The
   Academy encourages New York State teachers to submit Learning
   Experiences for review.

   Learning Experiences submitted to the Academy by December 1, will be
   considered for the Statewide Peer Review in March.  If the Learning
   Experience is selected, teachers will present their Learning Experience
   to a panel of peers who will provide valuable feedback and
   suggestions.  After any necessary revisions, the teacher becomes a
   member of NYSATL.  After any necessary revisions, the teacher becomes a
   member of NYSATL.

   The Statewide Peer Review process is supportive and informative.
   Teachers have come away from the process with good advice for improving
   their Learning Experiences and for creating models that translate the
   learning standards into classroom practice.

   Members of the Academy may submit their Learning Experience for
   consideration to be posted on the NYSATL website as a model for
   adaptation.

   NYSATL encourages use of its Statewide Peer Review process to assist
   teachers in changing classroom practice to help students reach higher
   levels of achievement in relation to the learning standards. This
   process is described in the NYSATL booklet .pdf (164K). Below are the
   forms which are used to support this initiative. These forms may be
   printed and used for local and regional peer review opportunities.
