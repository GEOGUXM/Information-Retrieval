         Exciting changes in the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum

   We're installing accessible paving and redesigning the courtyard for an
   improved visitor experience.

   To ensure visitor safety, we have closed the museum for the winter. We
   hope to reopen this spring. The mild weather we had during November and
   December allowed construction to stay on schedule, so we're optimistic
   that we'll have the gates back open for you in time to see the bonsai
   azaleas in bloom. We'll keep you posted here on our progress.
