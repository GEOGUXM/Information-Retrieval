   Welcome to Registered Nurses License Renewal

   The On-line Professional Licensing System allows Registered Nurses to
   renew their RN and advanced practice certifications, request
   duplicate licenses, and make address changes.

   You are eligible to renew online if:
     * Your license expires within the next 3 months.
     * Your license is delinquent by no more than 60 days.

                 The following credit cards are accepted with NO fee for
   the service:
                 VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER, Secured transaction
   processing

   FIRST TIME USERS - You will need your:
     * RN License Number   -   Example (alpha/numeric = RN123456)
     * Social Security Number
     * Credit Card Information
     * Continuing Education Information
     * eMail Address   -   Please enter correct email address   Example (
       jsmith@aaa.com )
     * Click here to get started, or click on Professional Licensing link
       in left column.

   RETURNING USERS - You will need your:
     * User ID
     * Password
     * Credit Card Information
     * Continuing Education Information
     * Click here to get started, or click on Professional Licensing link
       in left column.

   TIME FRAMES:
   Nurses need to allow up to 48 hours for the records to be transferred
   from the on-line licensing system into the Boards database. It is not
   instantaneous because, for security reasons, the user is not directly
   accessing the Department of Comsumer Affairs database. The plastic card
   license should arrive within 2 weeks. Transaction may take longer if
   there is an address change or other unique issues.

   For assistance in the on-line process you may contact the Department of
   Consumer Affairs eGovernment Team at (916)322-7834 between the hours of
   8-5 PST Monday through Friday, or email to egov@dca.ca.gov.
   For licensing information you may contact the Board of Registered
   Nurses at (916) 322-3350.
