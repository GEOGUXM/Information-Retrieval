                           Web Site Privacy Notice
   __________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting the Administration on Aging Web Site and
   reviewing our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy for visits to
   http://www.aoa.gov is clear:

     We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our
     website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

  Information Collected and Stored Automatically

   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
     * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain), and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website
     * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site,
     * The date and time you access our site,
     * The pages you visit, and
     * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of
       that website.

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.

  Personally Provided Information:

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web sites.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself
   through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain
   the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to
   fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

  Links to Other Sites

   Our Website has links to other federal agencies and to private
   organizations. Once you link to another site, it is that site's privacy
   policy that controls what it collects about you.

  Information Collected When You Send Us an E-mail Message

   When inquiries are E-mailed to us, we again store the text of your
   message and E-mail address information, so that we can answer the
   question that was sent in, and send the answer back to the E-mail
   address provided. If enough questions or comments come in that are the
   same, the question or suggestions may be used to guide the design of
   our Web site.

   We do not retain the messages with identifiable information or the
   e-mail addresses for more than 60 days after responding unless your
   communication requires further inquiry. If you send us an e-mail
   message in which you ask us to do something that requires further
   inquiry on our part, there are a few things you should know.

   The material you submit may be seen by various people in our agency,
   who may use it to look into the matter you have inquired about. If we
   do retain it, it is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, which
   restricts our use of it, but permits certain disclosures.

   Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
   communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information, you
   might want to send it by postal mail instead.

  Intrusion Detection:

   This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
   various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are
   subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement
   investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information
   from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

  Disclosure:

                AoA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal
                information about our visitors, unless required for law
                enforcement or statute.
