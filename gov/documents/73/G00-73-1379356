     National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program finds solutions for DOE complex

   by Carol Lavery

   The National Spent Nuclear Fuel Programs agenda includes canister and
   internal basket design, fuel characterization, transport, criticality
   issues, licensing and certification support for repository placement,
   and predictive data analyses for performance during storage.

   Both repository waste package designs and the next generation of DOE
   spent nuclear fuel transport casks require protection against a
   criticality, or self-sustaining nuclear fission reaction in the fuel.

   Some isotopes of uranium and other fissile materials spontaneously
   release neutrons (fissile materials). Criticality is suppressed if a
   material is present that absorbs the neutrons so they cannot interact.

   Criticality safety protection can be provided with innovative disposal
   packaging design objectives that may include:
     * Limiting the amount of neutron activity (from fuel) in a waste
       package
     * Incorporating long-lived neutron-absorbing material in the internal
       structure
     * Incorporating structural or other added material that excludes
       moderators such as water
     * Adding materials that maintain neutron-absorbing capability after
       the SNF degrades.

   Research indicates that the new gadolinium alloys will satisfy all four
   packaging objectives to ensure criticality safety protection for the
   long-term storage needs of DOE spent nuclear fuel.

   For criticality control, engineers and designers prefer a gadolinium
   alloy internal basket over other neutron-absorbing materials.

   Initial corrosion tests show that the new
   nickel-chromium-molybdenum-gadolinium (abbreviated as Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd)
   alloy is more corrosion-resistant than the 316L stainless steel alloy
   used for the fuel storage canister.

   Boron, also a neutron absorber, is unacceptable for use in the canister
   internal structure because weldable structural boron alloys are not
   available. Also, boron is soluble in water and may flow out of the
   system, no longer available to absorb neutrons.

   Work now is proceeding on alloying gadolinium with a nickel-
   chromium-molybdenum composition. Initial results indicate acceptable
   high-temperature processing properties, microstructure, mechanical
   properties, weldability and corrosion resistance. A provisional patent
   application is in place for the alloys and the fabrication process.
