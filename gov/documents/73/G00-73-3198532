   Law Library
   The Wirtz Labor Law Library at the U. S. Department of Labor is a
   separate collection of over 30,000 volumes housed within the DOL Main
   Library at the Frances Perkins Building in Room N2445. It is open to
   the public during the regular weekday business hours of 8:15 A.M. to
   4:45 P.M. It is staffed to provide reference and research assistance
   with an extensive print, electronic, and microform collection of
   federal labor law resources of both a primary and secondary nature.
   There is particular emphasis on collecting legal treatises which
   support the practitioner of labor law and its related fields, i.e.,
   immigration, bankruptcy and trust law.

   While the Law Library's primary goal is to support the research needs
   of the Department's Office of the Solicitor (SOL) and their particular
   DOL Agency clients, it also serves the labor law needs of private law
   firms, academic institutions, and corporate establishments across the
   United States. The Wirtz Labor Law Library, as a selective Federal
   Depository Library, is also open to the public.

   WESTLAW and Lexis-Nexis, legal research databases, as well as other
   electronic databases are available at Law Library staff workstations.
   One PC dedicated to WESTLAW is available by password access to SOL and
   DOL staff.

   The print and electronic holdings of the Law Library are accessible
   through the Wirtz Labor Library's online catalog. Significant DOL
   regulatory documents and other legal and labor-related websites are on
   the DOL website and also appear in the online catalog.

   Arrangement and Contents of the Collection
   The Law Library is housed in three connecting rooms. The Central Room
   is the home of the reference desk with an adjacent collection of
   directories, legal encyclopedias, and other finding aids. This room
   also has a lounge seating area.

   The West Room houses the core of the Law Library's collection, which
   includes federal and state statutes, federal and regional reporters,
   federal and decennial digests, the American Law Reports, the treatises
   and the law reviews. A historical collection of superseded United
   States Code and labor-related titles of the Code of Federal Regulations
   may be found here. The annotated codes for a number of states ( AZ, CA,
   DC, FL, IL, KY, MD, NM, NY, PA, TX, VA, WV). In this room there is also
   a separate collection of federal administrative publications.

   The East Room houses the Library's microform collection and some of the
   government depository collection, including the Federal Register and
   the Congressional Record. Selected congressional hearings and reports,
   the Code of Federal Regulations dating from 1977, and the Federal
   Register can be found in microform format. There is also a separate
   collection of compiled federal legislative histories on significant
   labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [see also: FLSA
   Advisor] and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959.

   The North side of each of these rooms is reserved for study space; its
   floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the DOL Child Care Center playground.
   The Law Library has a total seating capacity for 85 consisting of 25
   carrels, 3 large cubicles for extensive research needs, and several
   tables. There are 11 data jack connections throughout the Library.

   Access to Special DOL Collections
   Several other small collections of DOL regulatory documents are located
   within the office of the respective regulating agency. The Law Library
   staff have access to those which may be of service to outside users.
   These collections form a wealth of historical and current regulatory
   information. Those documents most often requested to be researched by
   the Law Library staff in response to requests are related to Wage and
   Hour issues, such as Family Medical Leave Act opinion letters, and
   Davis-Bacon Act [see also:Davis-Bacon Wage Determinations ] and Service
   Contract Act wage determinations. The most frequently requested are
   unpublished Wage & Hour opinion letters dated before 1961, of which the
   Department's Office of the Solicitor has the most comprehensive
   collection in the United States.

   Office of the Solicitor
   There are eleven Divisions [Black Lung Benefits; Civil Rights ,
   Employee Benefits , Employment and Training Legal Services, Fair Labor
   Standards, Legislation and Legal Counsel, Labor-Management Laws, Mine
   Safety and Health, Occupational Safety and Health , Plan Benefits
   Security , Special Appellate and Supreme Court Litigation ] within the
   Office of the Solicitor. Each division represents different DOL
   Agencies with special subject needs within the Department of Labor,
   e.g., the Division of Black Lung Benefits representing the Office of
   Workers' Compensation Programs . Each division has a separate law
   library collection germane to its needs. Much of the staff has desktop
   access to WESTLAW and Lexis-Nexis. Some also have access to several
   legal treatises on CD-ROM. To supplement these branch collections, the
   DOL Law Library serves the core research needs of all the divisions.
