       Like any responsible webmaster, I felt it necessary to provide you
       with a few links to other sites related to what we do in this
       Division.  Some of these sites are maintained by DWR, ...some are
       not.  Nevertheless, you should find them useful in gaining a better
       understanding of how your State Government works, what we in DWR
       R/W do, and how we do it.  If you have other sites you think would
       be of value and appropriate to link from here, please drop a note
       (with the referenced URL) to the Webmaster.

       SWP_Map_Plain.gif (3084 bytes) State Water Project - The State
       Water Project serves more than half the people of this state by
       moving excess water from wet Northern California to the drier
       Central and Southern California.  This site provides a basic
       overview of the SWP, including a brief history, description of the
       major features, etc.
       reclamlogo.gif (5259 bytes) State Reclamation Board - The State
       Reclamation Board, acting by and through the Sacramento-San Joaquin
       Drainage District, is responsible for flood control in the Central
       Valley.  This is their homepage.
       swrcb_logo.gif (9244 bytes) State Water Resources Control Board - A
       lot of people confuse the State Department of Water Resources with
       the State Water Resources Control Board.  Their functions are
       distinctly different, however.  DWR moves surface water; SWRCB
       controls who has the right to use surface water, and has the
       responsibility for setting minimum water quality standards
       statewide.  Take a look at their web site, and you'll get a better
       understanding of the differences.
       ctonwhit.jpg (10544 bytes) CALTRANS Right of Way (HQ) - We do a lot
       of things alike.  We also do a lot of things very differently, even
       though we have to work within the same laws!  Its important to
       understand the differences.
       slc_logo.jpg (32339 bytes) California State Lands Commission - The
       kinds of property rights DWR and the Reclamation Board acquire and
       hold are VERY different from the rights held by CALTRANS, the CSLC,
       or most any other State agency.  CSLC deals with "sovereign lands
       of the State of California" and "School lands", both of which are
       peculiar to CSLC.
       dgs_logo.gif (4816 bytes) D.G.S., Real Estate Services Div. -
       Although this state office has reorganized into more of a
       "consultant" mode, they are still heavily involved in State real
       estate matters.  DWR R/W staff and legal counsel confer with their
       counterparts at RESD frequently.
       AppInst_logo.jpg (5887 bytes)  Appraisal Institute, and the
       irwafade.gif (3424 bytes) International Right-of-Way Association -
       The two organizations provide a considerable base of knowledge and
       training courses for the advanced education of quality real estate
       appraisers, land agents, right of way agents, and many other real
       estate professionals in nearly all levels of government
       nationwide.  Both of these organizations are charter members of The
       Appraisal Foundation.
       appfseal.gif (4817 bytes) The Appraisal Foundation - In the early
       1980's, the crisis in the savings and loan industry highlighted the
       need to improve appraisal practices throughout the United States.
       The Appraisal Foundation, a not-for-profit educational organization
       dedicated to the advancement of professional valuation, was
       established by the appraisal profession in the United States in
       1987, and set before itself the task of ensuring that appraisals
       are based upon established, industry recognized standards, free
       from outside pressures.  The Appraisal Foundation serves as the
       parent organization for two independent boards: the Appraiser
       Qualifications Board (AQB) and the Appraisal Standards Board
       (ASB).  With the 1989 enactment of the Financial Institutions
       Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), Congress gave these
       two Boards considerable responsibilities.  Check out these sites
       for more information.
       orealogo.gif (11788 bytes)   California Office of Real Estate
       Appraisers - In response to Title XI of the federal Financial
       Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)
       mandate, the Real Estate Appraisers Licensing and Certification law
       was enacted by the California Legislature in 1990, and OREA was
       established and charged with developing and implementing a real
       estate appraiser licensing and certification program for real
       estate appraisers who appraise property backed by federal loan
       guarantee programs.  If you want to learn more about OREA, visit
       their site.
