   Federal Regulation Concerning Background Checks for Commercial Drivers
   Transporting Hazardous Material

   The Department of Transportation (DOT) is in the process of developing
   a rulemaking to prohibit states from issuing or renewing a commercial
   driver's license with an endorsement to operate a motor vehicle
   transporting a hazardous material unless the Department of Justice has
   first conducted a background check on the applicant.

   Once the individual's investigation has been completed, the DOT must
   then determine that the applicant does not pose a security risk
   warranting denial of the license.

   This rulemaking is required by section 1012 of the U.S. Patriot Act. It
   will be accessible through this web page as soon as it is published in
   the Federal Register.
