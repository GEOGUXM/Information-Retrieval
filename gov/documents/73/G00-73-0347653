   Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy
                To President Bushs State Of The Union Address
                                Jan. 29, 2002

   "The country and the Congress are united in the struggle against
   terrorism, and the President struck a chord that resonates deep and
   wide across the nation.

   "A troubling undercurrent that affects our national well-being is the
   re-emergence of federal deficits. I had hoped that we would not go back
   to those days, especially so soon after hard-won victories based on
   fiscal discipline. The federal governments ability to respond as it
   should to our security needs abroad and to our needs here at home now
   is severely limited by decisions made last year that have wiped out the
   surplus."
