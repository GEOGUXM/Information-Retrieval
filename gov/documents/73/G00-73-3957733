             Shark Nursery Areas and Juvenile Abundance Indices

Introduction

   Shark nursery areas are habitats where female sharks give birth to
   young or lay eggs, or where the juvenile sharks spend their first
   weeks, months, or years of life. Shark nursery areas can be identified
   by the presence of both pregnant females and newborn (neonate) sharks.

   Nursery habitats may include one or several types of habitats over a
   broad geographic range or depth. Springer (1967) observed that shark
   nursery areas are generally in shallow waters within the coastal zone.
   Shark nursery areas have been found in bays and estuaries
   (Simpfendorfer and Milward 1993; Musick et al. 1993; Castro 1993;
   Hueter and Manire 1994; Pratt and Merson 1996) and coral reef lagoons
   (Clarke 1971; Stevens 1984; Gruber et al. 1988).

   The pattern of distribution and utilization within the nursery areas
   can vary by species. Bass (1978) divided nursery areas into primary and
   secondary areas. Primary nursery areas are those where parturition
   occurs and where neonates live for a short time, usually only a few
   weeks or months. Secondary nurseries occur where juveniles spend a much
   longer period of time after leaving the primary nursery. Juvenile
   sharks may return to secondary nurseries for many years.

   The distribution of shark nursery areas in the northern Gulf of Mexico
   has not been documented. Our shark research program has been closely
   coordinated with those of NMFS-Pascagoula Laboratory in Mississippi,
   the University of Mississippi Department of Biology, the Louisiana
   State University Coastal Fisheries Institute and Mote Marine
   Laboratory. Long-term plans are to document the distribution and
   abundance of neonate and juvenile sharks in the Gulf of Mexico.

   Along the Gulf of Mexico coastline there are many bays and estuarine
   habitats which may serve as nurseries. Many habitats vary from
   near-oceanic conditions to shallow esturine areas. Are these different
   habitats of varying importance for coastal sharks? Which species prefer
   which habitats? Our laboratory is currently investigating these
   questions and other questions with regard to how human activities and
   coastal development affect shark populations.

  Juvenile abundance indices

   picture

   To improve management and recovery of shark stocks, there is a need for
   better estimates of relative population abundance and monitoring of
   shark population strength. Prior to 1993, most estimators of shark
   population strength were derived from commercial fishing sources.

   There are currently only three surveys for monitoring shark population
   size off the eastern coast of the US. The Virginia Institute of Marine
   Science has been monitoring the abundance of sandbar and dusky shark
   from areas adjacent to the mid-Atlantic Bight for the last 17 years.
   National Marine Fisheries Service-Pascagoula, MS has been developing an
   assessment of the distribution and abundance of coastal sharks in the
   Gulf of Mexico and western North Atlantic. National Marine Fisheries
   Service-Narragansett, RI Laboratory has also conducted longline surveys
   between Miami, FL and southern New England.

   Data on juvenile shark population size and recruitment to the adult
   portion of the population has not been reported for any shark species.
   Unlike most teleost species, the relationship between population size
   and recruitment is direct, owing to the reproductive strategy of low
   fecundity combined with few, fully formed offspring (Holden, 1977).
   Quantitative estimates of juvenile abundance can provide promising
   alternatives to traditional hindcasting models and could improve the
   ability to assess current and future shark stock size and strength. Our
   laboratory is currently conducting surveys in previously established
   nursery areas to establish a juvenile abundance index which can be used
   for stock assessment.

Methods

   The long-term objective is to further define shark nursery areas in
   various habitats in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Mexico between the
   St. Marks River, FL and the Mississippi River and continue abundance
   index sampling in previously established nursery areas. Our laboratory
   is currently surveying five coastal bay systems in northwest Florida
   from St. Andrews Bay, FL to the St. Marks River, FL.

  Nursery area survey sampling methods

   Shallow (1-5 m) and deep (5-10 m) stations are randomly selected in
   each bay system to sample sharks populations. Gill nets, 3.3 m width,
   104 m long, and composed of six 16.7 m long panels (stretched mesh
   sizes of 5 panels are from 8.9 cm to 14.0 cm in steps of 1.27 cm, with
   20.3 cm for the sixth panel), are randomly set and fished for one-two
   hours. Following each soak period, the nets are checked and cleared of
   catch, or pulled and reset. Shark surveys are conducted monthly from
   April-October. Sharks captured are measured to the nearest cm for body
   lengths (precaudal, fork length, total length, and stretch total
   length) and data for sex and life history stage (neonate, young-of-
   the-year, juvenile, adult) are recorded. All sharks caught are
   identified, measured, and recorded by station, mesh size, and sex.
   Sharks in good condition are tagged and released and those in poor
   condition are saved for life history studies. Environmental data are
   collected prior to sampling. Mid-water temperature (ÂºC), and dissolved
   oxygen (mg l^-1) is measured with a YSI Model 55 oxygen meter and light
   transmission (cm) determined using a Secci disk. Surface salinity (ppt)
   is measured with a refractometer.

  Juvenile Shark Index of Abundance Sampling Methods

   Gill nets that are used in the index of abundance are the same as those
   used in the nursery ground delineation study. Index sampling is
   conducted in previously established nursery areas following the same
   methodology.

Results

  Temporal and spatial distribution in nursery areas

   Preliminary evidence suggests that shark species composition differs
   among areas. The Atlantic sharpnose and bonnethead sharks are the
   dominant species collected in Crooked Island Sound and constitute over
   65% of the total catch. In contrast, finetooth, blacktip, and spinner
   sharks are the most abundant species captured along the islands that
   front Apalachicola Bay, comprising 77% of the catch.

   Recruitment of neonates and/or pupping by adults in the nursery areas
   varies by species and time of the year. Within Crooked Island Sound,
   young-of-the-year bonnethead sharks (400-500 mm TL) are among the first
   sharks to recruit to the inshore area in April. In May, neonate
   sharpnose sharks (300-350 mm TL) are first captured. This is followed
   by blacktip (500-630 mm TL), scalloped hammerhead (400-500 mm TL), and
   blacknose shark (470-530 mm TL) neonates in June and July. Additional
   collections of young-of-the-year spinner and finetooth are made
   throughout the year. Along St. Vincent Island, neonate blacktip,
   finetooth (500-650 mm TL) and to a lesser extent sharpnose sharks are
   first captured in May. In July, spinner and sandbar (570-700 mm TL)
   shark neonates (520-680 mm TL) are found but not in as high abundance
   as blacktip sharks.

   Juveniles are the dominant life-history stage captured in all areas.
   Most larger juveniles and young-of-the-year (>500 mm TL) are found
   along the islands that front Apalachicola Bay. These species are mostly
   blacktip, spinner, sandbar, and finetooth sharks. Species with smaller
   juveniles and young-of-the-year (<500 mm TL) (e.g. Atlantic sharpnose,
   bonnethead, and blacknose) are captured in Crooked Island Sound. The
   difference in spatial distribution among juveniles of different species
   may reflect an attempt to avoid predation as both areas appear to have
   a high forage base. Crooked Island Sound is a small, semi-enclosed
   sound that has few larger adult sharks and species with small neonates
   and juveniles may be selecting this area as a nursery based on low
   predation levels. However, additional abiotic and biotic
   characteristics may be involved and more research is needed to test the
   factors involved in nursery area selection.

  Juvenile Shark Index of Abundace

   Trends in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) vary depending on species. Most
   species were found to have no clear trend in CPUE . This is an ongoing
   study but current results can be obtained in: Carlson, J.K. and
   J.H.Brusher
