            Information for Prospective Independent Investigators

   We are pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications from
   independent investigators (IIs) on our insertion device beamline in
   Sector 20. The objective of this program is to provide opportunities
   for qualified researchers who are not affiliated with PNC-CAT to
   productively utilize our facilities at APS. We intend to award 25% of
   beamtime to IIs.

    Click here  for the capabilities of this beamline.

   Please submit proposals through the APS web-based II proposal form.
   You are also encouraged to contact a member of the PNC-CAT staff before
   submission to discuss your proposal.  Click here  for due dates of
   proposals for upcoming runs.

   Any individual listed on the proposal who is not an already badged APS
   user should  register  with the APS User Office (APS User Registration
   form) at the time the proposal is submitted. For more information about
   orientation and other procedures you must complete before you can
   conduct experiments at the PNC-CAT beamline, please see  PNC-CAT User
   Information.

   Your proposal will be reviewed and a decision will be made on its
   acceptance at our beamline. After acceptance, your beamtime will be
   scheduled.

   After you have been scheduled, an  Experimental Safety Approval Form
   must be submitted no later than two weeks before the beamtime date.
   Also an account must be set up with APS for incidental expenses
   (supplies, phone calls, shipping charges) while you are at APS. This
   can take over a month to set up and the process should be started as
   soon as you know your schedule. No user will be allowed to use their
   scheduled beamtime until such an account has been established. Please
   contact Pat Burn  { pburns@dirac.phys.washington.edu } the PNC-CAT
   coordinator, for information about setting up an account.
