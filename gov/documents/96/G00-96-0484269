   A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HHS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL JUNE 2001
   Prepared by Geneviève Nowolinski, Office of Evaluation and Inspections
   A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HHS OIG INTRODUCTION The concept of an Inspector
   General is not a new one. The first known Inspector General was
   designated by King Louis XIV of France in 1668 to review his troops and
   report to him on the condition of the army. A century later, the
   revolutionary Continental Congress named Thomas Conway, an Irish
   soldier of fortune serving as a Major General in the Continental Army,
   as the first Inspector General (IG). The Army's main concern was to
   ensure that our fledgling republic's scarce dollars were properly spent
   for wartime munitions and supplies. Conway remained in the job only
   briefly, owing to disagreements with his Commander-in-Chief, General
   George Washington. The next year, in 1778, Baron Frederick William
   Augustus von Steuben was appointed as the Inspector General of the
   Army. Despite some initial resistance from the Continental Army
   colonels, he soon earned the respect of his subordinates and superiors,
   as well as a place in history as the "Father of the Inspector General
   system."1 In fact, the idea of oversight of spending by Federal
   agencies remains much the same as in George Washington's time. Our
   founding fathers dealt with the problems of defective or shoddy
   military equipment, mismanagement and graft, just as our current
   Inspectors General deal with waste, fraud and abuse in Federally-funded
   programs. For over a century after the Revolution, Federal government
   fiscal oversight took the form of account ledger and voucher reviews by
   relatively few auditors and accountants, and even fewer means of
   enforcement.2 But as the country grew, so did its need for Federal
   oversight. Following the landslide election of 1920 that swept
   Republican Warren G. Harding into the White House, Congress passed the
   Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which separated the two functions
   into two separate entities: the Bureau of the Budget (now Office of
   Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office (GAO). This
   Act was the cornerstone in the creation of the future Inspector General
   Acts of 1976 and 1978. The second critical block was set in 1959, when
   amendments to the Mutual Security Act created the Office of the
   Inspector General and Comptroller (OIGC), which was physically located
   within the International Cooperation Administration. This Inspector
   General was appointed by the Secretary of State and the Office was
   envisioned as a potential information resource for the GAO and
   Congress. Of special significance to modern IG concepts is the fact
   that the Office was granted access to all Government records, and
   charged with reporting deficiencies in program operations, so that
   appropriate corrective actions could be taken. 1 U.S. Army Inspector

   ___________________ 1 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General Under authority granted by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
   the comptroller function was dropped and the OIGC's name was changed to
   Office of Inspector General, Foreign Assistance (IGA). The Act also
   elevated the Office by making the position a Presidential appointment,
   thus laying the groundwork for future statutory IG positions. The IGA
   position lasted ten years, and was replaced by the Agency for
   International Development's non-statutory IG in the mid-seventies. It
   is generally agreed that the first official inspector general for a
   Federal agency was the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
   Administrative Office of Inspector General, appointed in 1962. That
   office had a false start, however, and was eliminated twelve years
   later by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz, in the name of management
   efficiency, and replaced by offices of investigation and audit. Because
   the USDA IG and other early Inspector Generals were not mandated by
   statute, they reported directly to the Agency Secretary and other
   Department officials, a fact that significantly weakened the IG's
   authority. The USDA Inspector General position had been created as a
   "stop-gap measure," a direct result of the Billie Sol Estes scandals
   and subsequent Congressional investigations. Estes was an unscrupulous
   Texas businessman who had enriched himself through fraudulent dealings
   with the USDA's grain storage program which had gone unnoticed by the
   agency's ineffectual audit mechanisms. The political climate in the
   late 1960's and early 1970's was ripe for a wave of Government reforms.
   The shooting of four Kent State college students at a anti-war protest,
   the environmental disasters of Love Canal and Three Mile Island, and
   the Jonestown cult deaths marked the tempestuous era and left the
   public fearful of crime, pollution, and politics. Faith in the
   Government's ability to police itself was at its lowest ebb, a response
   in part to the Estes scandals and resulting Congressional hearings
   which revealed the extent of the corruption. The hearings, conducted by
   Representative L. H. Fountain (D-NC) as Chairman of the House
   Intergovernmental Relations subcommittee, virtually ensured that he
   would be the future author of IG legislation. At the same time, Senator
   Frank Moss had held hearings with the Senate Finance Committee that
   examined the $1.8B of fraudulent billings and overcharges in the
   Medicaid program. The country had just ended a long and divisive war in
   Vietnam, the aftershocks of the "hippie" generation's
   anti-establishment movement were still being felt, and the economy was
   recovering from a recession inspired by the oil shortages of 1973. The
   Watergate affair, with President Nixon's resignation in its aftermath,
   was the coup de grace to the public's confidence in Federal agencies
   and officials. The time was finally right for a consensus on the need
   for Federal agencies to have fully discrete Inspector General offices
   with a mandate to provide oversight of the agencies' programs. It was
   into this receptive milieu that the HEW Inspector General Act of 1976
   was born.

   ___________________ 2 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General STATUTORY FOUNDATION OF THE HHS INSPECTOR GENERAL There are
   fifteen separate legislative documents regarding Inspectors General,
   some establishing a single Federal agency IG, others mandating a broad
   category of Federal inspectors general. Discussed below are the three
   major laws affecting the HHS Office of Inspector General and additional
   sources of IG authority. The HEW Inspector General Act of 1976 As part
   of the comprehensive review3 of the Department of Health, Education and
   Welfare (HEW) undertaken by the Fountain committee and others, it was
   determined that a serious deficiency in all Federal agencies was the
   lack of an efficient mechanism for coordinating efforts to identify and
   mitigate fraud and waste. Audit and investigation functions have always
   existed within modern government entities. In our own Federal
   government system, what was lacking prior to IG legislation was formal
   collaboration and communication between these two functions. Fountain
   and his committee members set about the task of designing an entity
   that would combine the existing audit and investigative components into
   a twentieth-century version of an Inspector General. Equally important
   was the delegation of authorities to the Inspector General's office.
   The draft legislation for the Inspector General Act of 1976 specified
   four chief criteria: the independence and objectivity of the Office; a
   semiannual requirement for reporting to Congress; direct access to all
   agency records and information; and subpoena authority for information
   and documents outside the agency. As a guarantee that the independence
   of the office was not compromised, the Inspector General's Office was
   also provided management authorities such as direct contracting for
   goods and services and full personnel management authority. To ensure
   its passage, the legislation had been intentionally attached as an
   amendment to the non-controversial H.R. 11347, an Act to convey Federal
   land to the Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children.4 The bill was
   signed into law by President Gerald Ford on October 15, 1976, and the
   following year newly- elected President Jimmy Carter nominated Thomas
   D. Morris as the first Inspector General at the Department of Health,
   Education, and Welfare (HEW). The HEW Inspector General Act of 1976,
   Public Law 94-505, mandated the creation of the Office of Inspector
   General under the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)
   Secretary. This first Federal IG was to be a Presidential appointment,
   subject to removal only by the President, and only with a written
   explanation to Congress. The IG was to be selected on the basis of
   demonstrated abilities in auditing, accounting, 3 Department of Health,
   Education, and Welfare, Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Program
   Abuse, Report to Congress, pp. 94-786, GPO, 1976. 4 Telephone
   conversation with James R. Naughton, June 12, 2001. Naughton served as
   Counsel to the Committee from 1955  1983 and was one of the primary
   authors of the legislation.

   General investigation, administration and public management. Most
   importantly, the HEW OIG was to be charged with auditing, investigating
   and supervising oversight of Agency programs, and was to provide annual
   reports to Congress. This first attempt at a systematic approach to
   internal monitoring of the Department placed the Office directly under
   the purview of, and reporting directly to, the HEW Secretary. The
   authors of the legislation recognized the inherent conflicts of an
   Inspector General position, and sought to buffer the office from
   pressures originating both inside and outside of the agency. For this
   reason, Inspectors General were accorded authority to "enter into
   contracts and other arrangements for audits, studies, analyses and
   other services with public agencies and with private persons, and to
   make such payments as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of
   the [IG] Act."5 Furthermore, the Act stipulated that the IG "reports to
   and is under the general supervision of the Secretary...but shall not
   report to or be subject to supervision by any other officer"6 of the
   Department, and went even further to specify that the Secretary may not
   "prevent or prohibit the Inspector General from initiating, carrying
   out, or completing any audit or investigation."7 This was a critical
   point in defining the IG role, since functional autonomy is the heart
   of any truly independent oversight. The Inspector General Act of 1978
   The Inspector General Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-452) created fourteen
   additional inspector general positions in the major Federal agencies,
   essentially recognizing the success of the HEW experiment and extending
   IG authority to other agencies. The proposed legislation had been met
   with unanimous opposition from the agency heads, as well as some
   Congressional representatives. Agency executives were clearly
   uncomfortable with an audit and investigation organization over which
   they had little or no control. Moreover, there was a concern that
   inspector general audits could have the effect of demonstrating that
   the agency needed less than its current budget. Nevertheless, the
   legislation was enacted, proving that the inspector general concept was
   here to stay. The Act became law exactly two centuries after the
   appointment of the first Inspector General by the Continental Congress.
   The Act mandated certain reporting requirements such as annual and
   semi-annual reporting to Congress, as well as immediate (within 7 days)
   reports of any particularly serious or flagrant problems to the agency
   Secretaries and to Congress. Other mandated duties include review of
   legislation and regulations, establishment and coordination of 5 5

   General working relationships with Federal, State, local and private
   entities, and the authority to audit and investigate all Departmental
   programs. This last authority has been the linchpin for the Office's
   functions, and the primary tool to battle what has been called "the
   three horsemen of the IG: fraud, waste, and abuse."8 Specific
   authorities outlined in the legislation have given the Inspectors
   General their clout. These authorities include the authority to:
   subpoena records; have unrestricted access to relevant agency records;
   request assistance from other Federal, State or local government
   agencies; administer oaths; and receive complaints and provide
   whistleblower protection. The Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988
   The Amendments of 1988 provided the final statutory foundation for the
   Inspectors General and created another twenty-eight inspector general
   positions. These Amendments created different categories of Inspectors
   General: "establishment" IGs, which are Presidential appointments and
   "designated Federal entity" IGs, which are appointed by the agency
   heads. Other, usually smaller, Federal entities are simply required to
   report to Congress on their internal audits and investigations  no
   formal Inspector General is required. Such Federal entities are not
   covered by most of the provisions of the Act. The Amendments added new
   responsibilities to their existing tasks, requiring management reports
   of actions taken in response to OIG findings, in addition to the
   previously required OIG audits and evaluations. The Act retained
   requirements for the OIG to review proposed regulations and provide
   recommendations concerning the regulatory impact. Additional Sources of
   OIG Legal Authority The HHS OIG is also authorized to conduct
   investigations and audits under several statutes other than the
   Inspector General Acts: Civil Monetary Penalties -- Title XI of the
   Social Security Act (Section 1128A) includes provisions that authorize
   the HHS OIG to levy civil monetary penalties against entities found to
   have acted improperly in dealings with HHS programs, including
   submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Program
   Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. Sections 3801-12) also authorizes
   the OIG to levy civil monetary penalties and assessments in cases of
   entities making false statements or claims 8 "Monitoring Government,"

   General to any Federal agency. Since most health care related matters
   are covered under the Social Security Act statutes, this latter Act is
   rarely invoked. Exclusions from Federal Programs -- Under Title XI of
   the Social Security Act (Sections 1128, 1156, and 1892), entities
   convicted of program-related crimes, patient abuse or neglect, and
   other felonies may be excluded from participation in any Federal health
   care program, including Medicare and Medicaid. These cases are
   litigated by the Office of Counsel to the Inspector General. Medicaid
   Fraud Control Units (MFCUs)  The Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of
   1977 to Title XIX of the Social Security Act authorize the Secretary to
   establish a financial partnership with the State MFCUs to share some of
   the operating costs of the MFCUs. In 1979, administrative control of
   the MFCUs was transferred from the Health Care Financing Administration
   (HCFA) to the OIG's Office of Investigation, which currently certifies
   and funds the units and reviews the grants. Superfund Audits -- The
   Superfund Audit statute, 42 U.S.C. 9611(k), requires all Inspectors
   General to conduct annual audits of all monies derived from the Fund,
   and an annual audit report is required to be submitted to Congress.
   Child Support Enforcement -- The Child Support Recovery Act (18 U.S.C.
   Section 228), has made interstate delinquency on court-ordered child
   support a Federal crime. The appropriation for the OIG specifically
   authorizes the Inspector General to conduct investigations under
   Section 228. Secretarial Security and Protection Services --
   Responsibility for security and protection services for the Secretary,
   and selected Department executives such as the Surgeon General, has
   been assigned to the HHS OIG by delegation from the Secretary and
   deputation from the Justice Department. Secretarial protection is now
   explicitly recognized in the IG's appropriation. CFO Audits -- The
   Chief Financial Officer's Act of 1990 (31 U.S.C. Section 3515), as
   amended by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, directed the
   heads of covered executive agencies to submit to the Office of
   Management and Budget an annual audited financial statement covering
   all of the agency's accounts and activities. In addition to the
   agency-wide financial statement, the law also directed OMB to identify
   those components required to have individual audited financial
   statements. At HHS, these include HCFA, ACF, FDA, and NIH. A portion of
   OIG's financial statement audit work is funded by the audited program
   agencies, through reimbursable agreements with the HHS OIG. The Health
   Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created
   Sections 1128C and 1128D of the Social Security Act, authorizing the
   HHS OIG to
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 6 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General conduct investigations, audits, and evaluations relating to
   health care fraud, generally not limited to HHS programs. HIPAA
   expanded the OIG duties to include coordination of Federal, State and
   local enforcement efforts targeting health care fraud; to provide
   industry guidance concerning fraudulent health care practices; and to
   establish a national data bank to report final adverse actions against
   health care providers. Significantly, HIPAA authorizes the OIG to
   investigate cases that involve private (vs. Federally- funded) health
   care fraud, but present policies restrict the investigative focus to
   cases of fraud affecting Federally-funded programs. THE FORMATIVE YEARS
   The first HEW Inspector General, Thomas D. Morris, had been appointed
   while a senior staff member of the Brookings Institution, where he
   served as a management expert with a distinguished record of executive
   positions in the military, industry, and government. In keeping with
   statutory requirements of the HEW Inspector General Act, Morris was
   nominated by President Jimmy Carter and received Senate confirmation in
   1977. Significantly, Morris had also served as Assistant Comptroller
   General of the United States and Assistant Director of the U.S. Bureau
   of the Budget (now OMB). The choice of Morris for IG was accompanied by
   the appointment of a highly qualified deputy, Charles F. C. Ruff, who
   had been the special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution
   Force. This first Inspector General's Office was completed by three
   other appointments: Edward Stepnick, Assistant Inspector General for
   Auditing; Nathan Dick, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations;
   and Bryan Mitchell, Assistant Inspector General for Health Care and
   Systems Review. By all accounts, Morris was an accomplished and
   extremely conscientious manager, whose legendary handwritten
   task-assignment notes to his staff would mysteriously appear on
   employees' desks after every weekend, even after Christmas. Morris had
   come into the Department on the back of a tiger --- HEW. The Fountain
   hearings of 1976 painted a picture of a hopelessly inadequate number of
   HEW staff overwhelmed by an ever-increasing backlog of ongoing audits
   and investigations directed at attempting to keep the perpetrators of
   fraud, waste and abuse at bay. Morris' first Report to Congress had
   estimated that between $6.3 to $7.4 billion Federal dollars were lost
   to health care fraud and abuse annually, yet HEW had only ten
   investigators. With the unprecedented surge in Federal aid program
   spending and health care costs increasing annually, something clearly
   had to be done, and the Secretary of HEW, Joseph Califano, had taken
   the first steps with the 1977 Departmental re-organization which merged
   the
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 7 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General Social Security Administration's Investigative Branch into
   OIG's Office of Investigations. In October 1977, the Medicare and
   Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments were passed by Congress, and
   HEW was directed to establish State Medicare/Medicaid Fraud Control
   Units (MFCUs). Morris also launched several investigative initiatives,
   of which three are especially noteworthy: Project Integrity, which
   screened Medicaid provider charges for improper billing; Project Match,
   which identified fraudulent or ineligible welfare payments; and Project
   Cross-Check, which identified individuals who had defaulted on their
   student loans. All of these projects used state-of-the-art computer
   search and analysis tools to obtain the necessary information, making
   it clear that the OIG had formally entered the computer age. Pundits
   often remark that "no good deed goes unpunished." When Morris issued
   the first IG Annual Report, some in Congress reacted to the data by
   suggesting that HEW's budget be cut by the same amounts as those of the
   waste, fraud, and abuse reported. Although such drastic cuts were not
   made, HEW program officials rued the OIG's reporting of the fraud,
   waste, and abuse data, especially since most of the amount represented
   waste, which would have required legislation to correct. Around the
   same time, OMB officials were recommending increases in IG staffing,
   but action on these recommendations had been stymied by President
   Carter's imposition of a Government- wide hiring freeze. Dick Kusserow,
   the next IG to be appointed after Morris, remarked that the $7.4
   billion figure reported that first year continued to "haunt" the OIG
   many years later.9 Significantly, the IG's Annual Report the following
   year provided more carefully calculated figures which indicated that
   only fifteen percent of the losses were due to intentional fraud, abuse
   of services, or program violations. Morris served as the Inspector
   General for two years (1977  1979) before returning to the private
   sector. He resigned shortly after President Carter's removal of
   Secretary Joseph Califano, a long-time friend of Morris. In the
   18-month interim between Morris' resignation and the appointment of the
   next IG, Richard B. Lowe III and Bryan Mitchell served as the Acting
   Inspector General for HHS. 1979 was a year of dramatic changes for the
   OIG. Secretary Califano had overhauled HEW and eliminated the original
   Social Rehabilitation Services organization. Its functions were
   distributed among several new agencies: the Social Security
   Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the
   Family Support Administration, and the Office of Human Development
   Services, which included the Head Start Program, the Children's Bureau,
   the Youth Program, and the Aging Program. The first HHS OIG toll-free
   Hotline for fraud, waste, and abuse reporting was established in
   January 1979, and had a nomadic existence for its first few years. The
   Hotline was 9 Interview of Dick Kusserow, January 11, 2001.

   General established first in the Executive Assistant IG's office, later
   moved to the Office of Investigations, and finally settled in the
   Office of Evaluation and Inspections, where it remains today. In 1980,
   Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory over Jimmy Carter and the
   resulting change of administration would be felt by all the Federal
   agencies and organizations -- especially by the Inspectors General.
   Also in 1980, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW)
   was transformed into the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
   and the Education component became a separate agency, the Department of
   Education. Buffeted by the prevailing forces, the OIG was struggling to
   define itself and establish its credibility. DEFINING THE TERRITORY The
   unique role of the IG has been described as "straddling a barbed wire
   fence"10 because the IG must interact routinely with the Secretary and
   other Department officials, yet remain independent and objective to
   effectively evaluate and investigate Department and agency programs.
   Also critically important is the fact that Inspectors General in
   establishment agencies are appointed by the President, who alone has
   the power to remove them, albeit not without written notification to
   the Congress. This precarious position was spotlighted in 1981 when
   President Reagan dismissed all fifteen Inspectors General, an action
   which Paul Light described as having a "chilling effect"11 on the new
   IGs' sense of security. Not only were all inspectors general removed,
   but an OIG hiring freeze was also put into place for six months.
   President Reagan had campaigned in the 1980 election on a platform
   pledged to root out fraud, waste and abuse, and one of his first
   decisions as a newly-elected President was to hire "meaner junkyard
   dogs12" for the IG positions. Of the fifteen IGs removed at the time,
   five were brought back and either reinstated at the same agencies, or
   reassigned to other agencies. June Gibbs Brown was one of the five to
   be brought back and was appointed as IG to NASA. Richard ("Dick")
   Kusserow, a former FBI agent, was appointed by President Reagan to fill
   the vacancy at the HHS OIG. A June 1982 article in The Washingtonian
   identified HHS IG Richard P. Kusserow as one of the five "junkyard
   dogs," who served key roles in Reagan's war on 10 "Monitoring
   Government," by Paul C. Light, 1993, The Brookings Institution. 11

   President Reagan's removal of all Federal Inspectors General received a
   great deal of criticism, especially from those who saw the IGs as the
   only mechanism for real accountability in the Government. Washington
   Post columnist Matthew S. Watson decried the removals, and suggested a
   fixed term of eight years for the position, noting that only "the
   inspectors general can report that the king has no clothes."13 Creation
   of the PCIE The mass firings of 1981, otherwise known as "The Big
   Raid," were not completely detrimental to the mission of the Inspectors
   General. Out of the ashes of the IG firestorm rose a new and beneficial
   creation, the newly-formed "President's Council on Integrity and
   Efficiency (PCIE)," which continues to provide a government-wide forum
   for sharing knowledge and resources. Established by President Reagan in
   Executive Order 12301, the PCIE was envisioned as a means of
   establishing a continuing dialogue among Federal IGs that would enable
   them to increase their efficiency through collaboration and
   coordination of government-wide efforts to fight fraud, waste and
   abuse. The PCIE coordinates inter-agency policy issues, sets
   professional standards for OIG work, coordinates studies on topics of
   Government-wide concern, and provides training for OIG executives,
   managers, and staff. Currently, the PCIE is composed of twenty-nine
   Presidentially-appointed Inspectors General, and various other Federal
   officials including 13 Matthew Watson, "The Fraud Fighters..."

   Personnel Management, and the Director of the FBI's Criminal Division.
   In addition to sharing of mission-related information and strategies,
   the PCIE helps foster collegial relationships and esprit de corps among
   Inspectors General. The HHS IG has played a prominent role in the PCIE,
   with two IGs, Kusserow and Brown, serving as the Vice Chair under the
   Chair of the PCIE. The permanent Chair of the PCIE is the Deputy
   Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
   First Tasks, Friends and Foes The 1980s were marked by transitions,
   internationally as well as nationally. In Berlin the wall came down,
   and on Wall Street the markets went up -- the U.S. economy was booming.
   Terrorism, though not the "bio" variety, became a household word.
   Solidarity was born and Communism was dying, and the Iran-Iraq War was
   in its early stages and jeopardizing the world's oil supplies. Not
   insignificantly, another Federal agency scandal was looming on the
   horizon  this time at the Department for Housing and Urban Development
   (HUD). The HUD scandal of 1989 was instructive for all Federal
   inspectors general, since it demonstrated how a management team laden
   with political appointees far out of proportion to its work force might
   be inclined to disregard any interference from its IG. HUD managers had
   fabricated accomplishments and obfuscated misspent funds in their
   annual reports, and had rebuffed any attempts at oversight by HUD OIG
   Paul Adams. Congressional hearings exposed a nest of
   influence-peddling, slush funds, and illegal perks. The decade also
   heralded an era of unparalleled technological innovation, as prophesied
   in Alvin Toffler's best-sellers "Future Shock" and "The Third Wave."
   From industry leaders and bureaucrats to dayworkers, Americans began to
   dream of jobs made easier through the use of robotics, powerful
   computers and advances in electronic communication. For the HHS OIG,
   the expanding uses of computer technology was a sorcerer's apprentice:
   although use of computer cross-checks enabled auditors and
   investigators to identify certain types of fraud more easily,
   concurrent electronic billing also created new opportunities for
   unscrupulous providers to obscure unnecessary Medicare and Medicaid
   charges. The Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1978 had solidified the
   partnership between HHS and the States, but the challenge remained to
   support State programs yet provide adequate oversight. In the
   scientific and medical communities, the identification of the Acquired
   Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 signaled the beginning of
   what would soon be termed an "epidemic." At that early date, it was
   still considered a rare disease affecting very few patients. Few
   realized at that time the potential budgetary impact of the disease: in
   2001, AIDS-related programs cost the Federal Government $10.8 billion.

   reputation. He served as Inspector General from 1981 to 1992, and
   during that time amply demonstrated his abilities to win the support of
   the Secretary, the Congress, and other Federal agencies. By focusing on
   tangible goals, Kusserow was able to fulfill the spirit of the IG Act,
   forging the OIG into a highly productive and efficient organization
   that serves as a reliable information resource for Congress. Kusserow's
   stature among the Federal IGs was based on several factors, including a
   high rate of return on operating expenses; high quality and credibility
   of OIG annual and semi-annual reports; and frequent testimony before
   Congress. This last factor served to convince Congress that the OIG was
   a necessary entity; in 1990, the OIG testified before Congress
   twenty-four times. Change in Federal bureaucracies, as in any other
   venue, does not happen in a void. The decade of the 1980s was marked by
   the birth of managed care, tremendous growth in health insurance plans,
   and dramatic increases in the cost of prescription drugs and health
   care. The HHS Office of Inspector General was also establishing itself
   as a force to be reckoned with. Legislative and political events of the
   time helped to solidify the OIG's presence, and several important
   pieces of legislation define this era. The Federal Manager's Financial
   Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982, the imposition of civil monetary
   penalties under the Social Security Act, and the Consolidated Omnibus
   Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) and its 1986 Amendments, and
   the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987
   all provided authorities that extended the OIG's influence and
   increased its effectiveness. In 1987, the GAO issued a report to the
   Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Energy and
   Commerce recommending that the HHS OIG be involved in criminal
   investigations relating to FDA activities.14 By 1988, the benefits of
   having an Inspector General Office in Federal agencies were widely
   accepted. The institution of the Inspector General had become a
   permanent fixture on the bureaucratic landscape, and with good reason.
   The Federal OIGs were already proving that they were earning their
   keep, as shown by PCIE Progress report data15 that demonstrated almost
   $120 billion in cost savings and recoveries over an eight-year period.
   The OIG's efforts to fight waste, fraud, and abuse met some challenges
   along the way. In early 1989, the HHS OIG and FDA signed a memorandum
   of understanding under which the OIG agreed to investigate cases of
   criminal fraud against FDA programs, including 14 "HHS Inspector
   General Should Be Involved in Criminal Investigations," the
   Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Energy and
   Commerce, GAO/HRD-88-8, November1987. 15 PCIE/ECIE Progress Reports to
   the President, FY 1991-1999.

   General fraud in generic drug approvals. Later that year, Douglas
   Kmiec, the Assistant Attorney General for legal counsel at the
   Department of Justice, questioned an OIG's authority to investigations
   "pursuant to regulatory statutes,"16 in a document that became known
   simply as the "Kmiec Memo." Though the memo specifically addressed
   programs of the Labor Department, it had a powerful effect on
   investigative operations of all Federal OIGs. Very generally, the Kmiec
   Memo interpreted the IG Act as directing IGs to investigate "employees
   and operations" of the Department, as well as contractors, grantees and
   other recipients of Department monies. However, the IG was precluded
   from conducting investigations pursuant to the regulatory statutes of
   the Department. Instead, the Inspector General would have an oversight
   authority only in those matters  monitoring the program agency charged
   with enforcing those statutes. This opinion had the effect of
   curtailing much of the HHS OIG's work involving fraud in FDA's
   regulatory programs. Despite this more limited interpretation of the
   HHS OIG's investigative jurisdiction, significant progress was made
   during Kusserow's eleven-year tenure. His personal dynamism increased
   the visibility of the office, and his professional affiliations brought
   credibility to his role. He served as President of the Association of
   Federal Investigators in 1984, and was a speaker at numerous national
   conferences and events. Before his resignation in 1992, he was able to
   witness OIG achievements in all of the traditional indicators of
   success: cost savings ($5.9B), return-on-investment per dollar ($72),
   sanctions (1700) and staffing (1426). ORGANIZATIONAL EVOLUTION The
   Office of Inspector General grew steadily in size and function in its
   first two decades. The first OIG was composed of the Audit Agency and
   the Office of Investigations and Security, both of which had existed in
   one form or another from the creation of the Department. In addition, a
   new office was added, the Office of Health Care and Systems Review.
   Although the Audit and Investigations components have retained their
   original functions, this latter component (Health Care and Systems
   Review) eventually became the Office of Evaluation and Inspections. The
   Audit Agency held the longest tenure as a HEW organization: it was
   created in 1965, the same year Medicare and Medicaid came into
   existence. Although there have always been differences in the actual
   visibility of each agency OIG owing in large degree to the personality
   and charisma of the individual inspector general, all Federal OIGs have
   the dual statutory functions of audit and investigation of the agency's
   programs and activities. The HHS OIG and some others include an
   additional 16 Cf: 3/9/89 memo from Douglas Kmiec, Asst. Attorney
   General, Office Of Legal Counsel, to Jerry Thorn, Acting Solicitor,
   Department of Labor.

   General evaluation function, one that has been critical to the HHS
   OIG's reputation and credibility. In addition, the Office of Counsel to
   the IG (OCIG) is distinctive for the important role it plays in
   providing industry guidance and corporate integrity agreements. Office
   of Audit Services (OAS) Edward Stepnik, the first Assistant IG for the
   HEW Audit Agency (as it was then called), oversaw an organization that
   divided its audit efforts among three main categories: extramural
   (universities, non-profits receiving HHS funding); State and local
   units; and Social Security. Later, under the direction of Tom
   Roslewicz, new computer capabilities were harnessed to enhance
   productivity of OIG's limited staffing and travel budgets. The
   automation of HHS systems enabled the use of new analytical techniques
   and stratified sampling pilot projects, and the development of HEWCAS
   (Health, Education, and Welfare Computer Audit System) in 1978
   definitively brought the Agency into the computer age. In 1981, OMB
   guidance began requiring that State and local governments arrange for
   audits of their operations by non-Federal auditors. Single audits
   proved to be a reliable method of determining that organizations met
   Federal accountability requirements, and their use quickly expanded
   with the Single Audit Act of 1984. As a result, the Office of Audit
   Services was able to redirect its resources to internal controls and
   reviews of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department's three
   massive programs  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Chief
   Financial Officer Audit Act of 1990 had a dramatic impact both on the
   OIG and on how the Federal agencies would view the OIG mandate. The Act
   reinforced the OIG's authority to audit Federal agencies from a
   management performance perspective as well as from a fiscal accounting
   perspective, and required the preparation and audit of agency-wide
   financial statements. That same year, the HEW Audit Agency took its
   present name, the Office of Audit Services (OAS). The increased efforts
   to improve accountability for Federal funds grew throughout the 1990's
   and still a high priority of the Administration today. Today, OAS is a
   critical cost-saving component within the OIG and currently employs
   almost 700 staff. OAS audits make a significant contribution to the
   estimated $16.5 billion in annual savings for Medicare, Medicaid, and
   other Departmental programs, as the result of OIG work. Office of
   Investigations (OI) The Office of Investigations traces its operational
   timeline back to April 1973, when the Office of Investigations and
   Security (OIS) was created by HEW Secretary Casper Weinberger and put
   under the control of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and
   Management. Although this action was within the authority of the
   Secretary and a Federal Register Notice was published announcing the
   establishment of the new office, controversy emerged after prominent
   Washington columnist Jack Anderson criticized the Secretary for
   creating a "Plumber's Unit." Subsequent Congressional hearings created
   the
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 14 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General undeserved impression that the Office was clandestine and
   unauthorized, and OIS staffing was reduced as a result, leaving a total
   of only ten investigators. Nathan ("Don") Dick was appointed as
   Assistant IG for Investigations and head of the new office, which
   consisted of only the twenty-six staff of the Office of Investigations
   in 1977. Within six months, seven regional offices were added. The
   number of regional offices was ten at the highest point, but later
   decreased to eight due to consolidation of resources. In the early
   days, regional offices were required to submit criminal cases to the
   HEW Assistant Secretary for review, since OIS did not have its own
   criminal investigators, and relied on the FBI and State law enforcement
   agencies to do the actual investigations. One of the earliest OIG cases
   was presented in the Southern Regional District of New York to the
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani. HEW Secretary Richard S.
   Schweiker's reorganization of the Agency in 1982 was a boon to the OIS,
   which nearly doubled in size after the Social Security Administration's
   Investigation Branch merged into the OIG's workforce. From that point,
   OIS was shortened to "Office of Investigations (OI)" and increased both
   its size and visibility. In 1983, HCFA's Office of Health Financing
   Integrity (OHFI) was merged into the OIG, eventually adding almost 200
   staff to OI. Jack Hartwig has served in the Office of Investigations
   continuously since 1979, and is currently the Deputy IG for
   Investigations. Hartwig also cites 1985 as a pivotal year for OI
   because it marked the first deputation of an OI Agent by the U.S.
   Marshals Service, conferring upon OI Agents law enforcement
   capabilities, including the authority to carry firearms, make arrests,
   and enforce search warrants. Office of Evaluation and Inspections (OEI)
   Precursors of the Office of Evaluation and Inspections can be found in
   several earlier organizations. The Office of Health Care Systems
   Review, headed by Assistant IG Bryan Mitchell, was one of the original
   components of the first HEW Inspector General's Office in 1977. It was
   merged with other offices and re-named several times over the years,
   first as the Office of Program Inspections, next as the Office of
   Systems Integrity, later as the Office of Analysis and Inspections, and
   finally as the present Office of Evaluation and Inspections.
   Departmental evaluations are conducted by, or prepared under the
   supervision of, numerous offices within the agencies of the Department.
   Generally, their agendas are coordinated by the Assistant Secretary for
   Planning and Evaluation. Studies and analyses are commonly out-sourced
   to contractors, who normally take two or three years to complete the
   studies. In 1977, Secretary Califano realized that he needed a more
   focused information resource, and created an office that would provide
   program assessments to the Secretary from the point of service
   delivery, and with a quick turnaround. This was called the Office of
   Service Delivery Assessment (SDA). While part of the OIG
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 15 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General function, it consisted of small units within each of the
   Department's regional offices, under the immediate supervision of the
   Principal Regional Official. Michael Mangano served first as the
   Director of the Philadelphia Office, and later as Director of the SDA
   headquarters office in Washington, D.C. The SDA's function was to visit
   service sites and report on beneficiary and local service provider
   satisfaction; by all accounts, this function was very effectively
   performed. However, since administrative and hiring authorities resided
   in the regions, this at times created conflicting lines of authority in
   relation to the IG's purview. In 1982, Secretary Schweiker was faced
   with a need to cut staffing levels, and the SDA office was one of the
   selected targets. SDA staffing was decimated, with over half the
   positions eliminated, and the remaining twenty staff were assigned to
   the OIG. In 1985, it was renamed the Office of Analysis and
   Inspections. Mangano was instrumental in guiding the evolution of this
   office, in which he served almost continuously from 1983 through 1994,
   as the Deputy IG for the Office of Analysis and Inspections. By 1988,
   these transformations had culminated in the present-day Office of
   Evaluation and Inspections. George Grob has been the Deputy IG for this
   component since 1994. OEI has broadened its evaluation scope over the
   years and is renowned for issuing reports on topics with far-reaching
   impact that extends beyond Departmental program providers and consumers
   to the entire health care community. Examples are OEI reports on organ
   donation, tissue banks, human subject protection, and HIV/AIDS. Office
   of Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) Prior to 1996, the OIG
   obtained legal guidance from a designated division within the Office of
   the Secretary's (OS) Office of the General Counsel (OGC). However,
   after passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
   Act in 1996, the expanded scope of OIG responsibilities resulting from
   HIPAA's legislative mandates necessitated greater legal support than
   the OGC was able to provide. June Gibbs Brown, HHS IG in 1997,
   exercised her statutory prerogative for a separate Office of Counsel
   assigned exclusively to OIG matters, and housed within the OIG. This
   discrete function was in keeping with the intent of the original IG Act
   to ensure the Inspector General's autonomy and impartiality. Prior to
   HIPAA, the OGC division assigned to serve the IG had been cut in half,
   leaving only fourteen staff. However, the newly-formed Office of
   Counsel to the Inspector General (OCIG) absorbed the OIG's Office of
   Litigation Coordination, Office of Enforcement and Compliance, and
   twelve additional regional administrative staff. OCIG has been an
   integral part of the OIG functions, specifically charged with the
   HIPAA-mandated provision of industry guidance, monitoring of corporate
   integrity agreements, as well as provision of legal counsel and
   representation for OIG staff in health care fraud enforcement. OCIG
   Chief Counsel D. McCarty ("Mac") Thornton

   General notes that while most other inspectors general have an in-house
   counsel, they function mainly as a legal advice branch. In contrast,
   what has defined the HHS OIG in the 1990s is its ability to influence
   behavior of outside groups, especially through voluntary fraud and
   abuse prevention and compliance. The success of this OIG goal was
   measured in a 1999 survey done by the American Hospital Association,
   indicating that 96% of their members had undertaken active compliance
   programs. Office of Management and Policy (OMP) The Office of
   Management and Policy was known simply as the Executive Management
   office in its early years. From its inception, the office has provided
   administrative support, public affairs liaison, and operations and
   technological support. The Office's Directorship was later elevated to
   an SES level, and the first Assistant Inspector General of the office
   was Jane Tebbut. Today, the OMP's main functions are operation of the
   OIG Executive Secretariat, which provides correspondence control;
   formulation and execution of the OIG budget; development of OIG policy;
   dissemination of OIG information; liaison with the Department,
   Congress, and external organizations, and management of OIG information
   technology resources. The latter function has been particularly
   critical to the OIG's efficiency and effectiveness. The OMP also
   assists in preparing Congressional testimony, publishes public affairs
   documents and recruitment materials. Deputy IG for OMP Dennis Duquette,
   who has headed the Office since 1995, credits former IG Dick Kusserow
   with laying the groundwork for a robust OIG organization by setting
   tangible goals and raising the visibility of the office. Duquette
   describes OMP as a service organization, whose goal is to help OIG
   auditors, investigators, and evaluators to be as effective as possible.
   BALANCING OIG ROLES The Department of Health and Human Services
   continued to evolve and expand in the 1990s in response to changing
   public and Congressional expectations. For the first time in American
   history, the health care industry was becoming big business, on a par
   with automotive and manufacturing industries, and by the end of the
   decade, accounted for almost 14% of the economy. The number of
   single-family households was on the rise, and the percentage of
   minorities, women and the elderly living at poverty levels was at an
   all-time high. Changing demographics and economic indicators required
   new approaches to Federal social services, and in 1991, Secretary
   Sullivan authorized the creation of a new operating division within the
   Department that would combine the Family Support Administration and
   Office of Human Development Service functions. The new office was
   called the Administration for Children and Families, and administers
   Temporary Assistance for

   General Needy Families (formerly Aid to Families and Dependent
   Children), the Head Start Program, and aid programs for Native
   Americans, child welfare, and community services. Donna E. Shalala was
   sworn in as Secretary of HHS in early 1993, but Dick Kusserow's
   retirement from Federal service in 1992 had left a void in the OIG,
   which was not to be filled until late 1993. June Gibbs Brown, a
   seasoned veteran who had served as IG for NASA, Department of the
   Interior, and DOD, was waiting in the wings to be confirmed as the
   third HHS Inspector General. In the meantime, the OIG along with the
   rest of the Federal Government, was enduring a modified hiring freeze
   and stagnant budgets which permitted few projects to be initiated.
   Bryan Mitchell, a longtime Deputy Inspector General, served as Acting
   Inspector General for the OIG until June Gibbs Brown's confirmation.
   Focusing on Accountability June Gibbs Brown was sworn in as HHS
   Inspector General just as the National Performance Review (NPR) was
   beginning to cause tremors in Federal management circles. With a goal
   of "reinventing Government," Federal agencies were encouraged to become
   more accountable, an effect of increasing trends toward Deming-based
   total quality management principles. Fortunately, the OIG's cost
   savings accomplishments at this time were unprecedented. Projects such
   as LABSCAM, which identified medically unnecessary laboratory tests,
   reaped impressive results from investigative receivables  in the first
   year alone, an $100 million settlement agreement was reached. Total
   savings in taxpayer dollars in 1994 were $6 billion, a record amount.
   Although the OIG had accomplished a great deal, Brown recognized that
   there was still room for improvement in OIG office functions as well as
   productivity. June Gibbs Brown was well-equipped for the job as HHS IG.
   An attorney as well as a certified public accountant, her long
   experience as an inspector general for various Federal agencies made
   her ideally qualified for the HHS IG position. Equally important was
   her personal integrity and commitment, which resulted a strong working
   relationship with Secretary Shalala. Brown began her term at HHS at a
   time when the OIG budget was declining and the workforce was shrinking
   due to hiring freezes, buyouts, and the normal attrition. By late 1995,
   the Federal workforce had been furloughed for almost a month while
   Congress debated the budget. Under these circumstances, Brown's
   innovative and collaborative approach to the OIG mission became all the
   more noticeable. The OIG was becoming a tighter, more efficient,
   organization. One of the critical elements of this process was a
   gradual change in the organizational culture of the OIG. IG Brown
   actively encouraged greater support and involvement among components
   that had previously tended to operate more or less independently of
   each other. This greater
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 18 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General collaboration between components had the effect of maximizing
   staff resources and resulted in greater productivity. To use
   technological advances to fullest advantage, a Internal Resource
   Management (IRM) Strategic Plan was prepared for the first time, and
   formed the basis for the future IRM Office. Greater emphasis on
   inter-office collaboration in the work planning process was to yield
   enormous benefits for OIG and ensured a steady stream of innovative
   reports, projects and initiatives that were highly valued by the
   Department, Congress and the general public. Similarly, consensus
   development among components in planning and execution of the budget
   brought a fresh approach to the traditional processes. IG Brown
   believed that the success of the OIG was dependent upon its ability to
   maintain cooperative partnerships, not only among the components of the
   OIG and operating divisions of HHS, but with other Federal agencies,
   State and local entities, and the health care community at large. An
   example of this was cross training for OIG audit staff at the Federal
   Law Enforcement Training Center. Also during this time, the OIG's
   Office of Investigations was able to obtain full law enforcement
   authority pursuant to blanket deputation from DOJ. Under Brown's
   leadership, the OIG established working relationships that facilitated
   provider compliance and quality improvement, engendered a climate of
   teamwork within the OIG and the Department, and allowed for employee
   cross-training and sharing of resources. To strengthen employee morale,
   an OIG Newsletter was created and continues to be a source of esprit de
   corps at the OIG. Brown also demonstrated her concern for employee
   welfare by instituting periodic employee surveys and initiating
   alternative work scheduling. The results were apparent in the increase
   in productivity  greater cost savings, and more prosecutions and
   sanctions. HHS OIG Milestones After a quarter of a century of battling
   waste, fraud, and abuse, the HHS OIG has a large number of significant
   cases and subsequent settlements to its credit. Of these, the most
   noteworthy are the National Medical Enterprises case, which at that
   time was the largest health care settlement ever and netted over $370
   million for the Government coffers, and the Columbia/HCA case, which
   obtained a unprecedented $745 million in settlement monies. Another
   important case that stands out among investigative accomplishments is
   the Caremark, Inc. case involving kickbacks and fraud in human growth
   hormones and home infusion, which was settled for $161 million. But not
   all benefits and accomplishments can be represented solely by a dollar
   value. Many reports done by the OIG brought much-needed national
   attention to previously low-profile issues including addiction and
   alcoholism in the Social Security Insurance program; abuses of durable
   medical equipment billing; patient dumping practices; problems in
   managed care administration; insufficient FDA monitoring of blood
   establishments, and many other critical patient safety and health care
   quality issues.

   ___________________ 19 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General Two events were to have a tremendous impact on HHS in 1995. The
   first was the separation of the Social Security Administration and its
   re-designation as a separate agency. This event had an adverse effect
   on OIG staffing, since SSA took 260 OIG staff with them. The second
   event was the implementation of Operation Restore Trust (ORT), a
   demonstration project involving five States, multiple Federal agencies,
   and the nursing home, home health, and DME industries. Operation
   Restore Trust was one of the most persuasive arguments for increasing
   OIG funding, because of its extraordinary success and visibility. In
   fact, it was so successful that it has since been expanded to all
   States. ORT also changed the way the OIG does business, placing a far
   greater emphasis on interdisciplinary teams and partnerships both
   internally and with other Federal agencies, State and local law
   enforcement entities. The original two-year demonstration project
   accomplished $188 million in receivables, 74 criminal convictions, 58
   civil settlements, and 218 exclusions. IG Brown testified numerous
   times before Congress on this and other OIG work and consistently made
   a case for a stable source of funding for the OIG. In 1996, an
   opportunity presented itself in the form of the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Health Insurance
   Accountability and Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was the portal
   through which the HHS OIG moved into a new era. The Act not only
   guaranteed a stable funding source for the OIG, but also provided for
   funding increases. Almost immediately, the IG exercised her statutory
   authority by creating a new component within OIG, the OIG Office of
   Counsel. The new HIPAA funding also permitted OIG to open offices in
   six more States in 1997, raising the number of States with an IG
   presence to twenty-six. This number continued to grow, eventually
   increasing the number of States with OIG offices to forty-seven by
   2001, with plans to expand to all fifty States, the District of
   Columbia, and Puerto Rico in 2002. To keep up with the increasing
   workload in 1997, HIPAA funds were used to hire 240 new staff, which
   brought total OIG staffing levels from 929 to 1203 within a year. These
   changes dramatically enhanced OIG capabilities for initiating new
   projects and studies and concluding those already in existence. In
   2001, OIG staffing is robust, and numbers almost 1500. HIPAA permitted
   the OIG to achieve many of its expressed goals. In keeping with the
   IG's support for voluntary compliance, the OIG began a program of
   voluntary compliance guidance for hospitals, nursing homes, and other
   health care providers and suppliers. Also, as part of fraud settlement
   agreements, providers and other health care entities have mandatory
   compliance obligations. Other HIPAA-mandated initiatives include the
   Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (a national adverse
   action data bank), and the HCFA Medicare Integrity Program (MIP). At
   the same time, large settlements with abusive and fraudulent providers
   continued apace. An example was the 1996 settlement with ABC Home
   Health, a comprehensive investigation that resulted in $225 million in
   recoveries to the Government.
   _______________________________________________________________________
   ___________________ 20 A Brief History of the HHS Office of Inspector
   General By 1997, the OIG was receiving national attention for its
   cost-saving initiatives and innovative and far-reaching audits and
   evaluations. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) took many of the
   OIG's Red Book recommendations and made them law. Some of these are
   specific fraud, waste and abuse prevention measures; others represented
   broad restructuring of programs that made them less vulnerable to
   abuse, such as changing reimbursement from cost-based to prospective
   payment for nursing homes and home health. The legislation had
   especially significant impact on nursing homes, home health agencies,
   and DME suppliers and according to the Congressional Budget Office,
   saved almost $70 billion over a five year period. The HCFA was
   beginning to be seen as a "problem child" within the Department, owing
   in great part to a monumental workload that outpaced its ability to
   recruit and retain qualified staff. The OIG's HCFA Financial Statement
   Review was designed to hone in on the most serious weaknesses in HCFA's
   oversight process and produced a financial statement review and error
   rate report. The 14% improper payment rate reported in 1996 was viewed
   with alarm by Congress and the Department, and the OIG assisted HCFA in
   cutting the rate by half (7%) within four years. The combined effect of
   the BBA, the large settlements, and the reduction of the payment error
   rate was to greatly reduce wasteful Medicare expenditures. The
   Congressional Budget Office cited anti-fraud activities as one of the
   reasons underlying a thirty-year extension of the life of the Medicare
   Trust Fund. The OIG's last two years of the century were marked with
   special projects aimed at protecting consumers, patients, and
   vulnerable populations. The Save Our Children project breathed new life
   into child support enforcement, resulting in 393 convictions and over
   $22.8 million in restitutions and settlements over a six-year period.
   The New York Foster care agency was fined for failure to provide case
   management for children, and enforcement of the Emergency Medical
   Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) statute brought in almost $2
   million in settlements. The OIG Hotline was ringing off the hook: by
   1998, the Hotline received as many as 50,000 calls a month. The Health
   Care Fraud Control Account (HCFAC) program was beginning to pay off for
   OIG, too, and the rate-of-return had increased to 118 to one by 1999.
   Meanwhile, the OIG's success in obtaining criminal and civil
   settlements continued, and included $140 million from the Health Care
   Services Corporation, and $38.5 million from Pennsylvania Blue Shield.
   More recently, in 2000, the nation's largest provider of dialysis
   facilities, Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., settled with the
   Federal Government for $486 million in recoveries for kickbacks,
   improper billings and other fraud. External organizations were also
   sharing their resources with OIG to achieve common goals, and there is
   no better example of this than the HHS partnership with the AARP in the
   "Who Pays? You Pay" campaign. This initiative provided nationwide
   training to seniors to enable them to identify health care fraud,
   waste, and abuse. Advocacy groups were also appreciative of the OIG
   reports on institutional review boards (IRBs), which

   is still acknowledged by FDA as one of the first alerts to endemic
   human subject protection problems, has had a far-reaching effect on
   government oversight and policies on IRBs. HHS OIG in the 21st Century
   The accomplishments of the HHS OIG over the past quarter of a century
   are undisputed. The OIG's work in audits, evaluations, and
   investigations has earned the respect of the academic community, other
   Federal agencies, the patient advocacy organizations, and the health
   care industry. In addition, the organization is characterized to a high
   degree by the perceived value of OIG involvement in development of
   regulatory and legislative proposals. But if numbers alone can tell a
   story, the evidence is ample: in FY 2000, we reported savings of over
   $15 billion, comprising $14 billion in implemented recommendations,
   $142 million in audit disallowances, and $1.2 billion in recoveries
   from investigations. Implicit in these figures are substantial numbers
   of exclusions (3,350), convictions (414) and civil actions (357)
   against individuals or entities engaged in fraud against, or abuse of,
   Federal programs. The HHS OIG's credibility is built upon the solid
   foundation of its reports, reviews and recommendations, which reflect
   the national thirst for quantifiable results, and have become the
   mainstay of the Office's work. These annual and semi-annual reports --
   "The Red Book" (OIG's cost savings recommendations), "The Orange Book"
   (OIG's non- monetary recommendations), and the Semi-Annual reports,
   address program management reviews, economy and efficiency of
   Department administration, and program integrity. The "Red" and
   "Orange" books are summaries of all of the OIG work in a given year,
   while the semi-annual reports are comparable to a Departmental "report
   card" for program cost effectiveness and efficiency. As we look to the
   future, the OIG bears the heavy burden of providing the most accurate
   audits and recommendations that will figure prominently in the
   sustained preservation of the Medicare Trust Fund. Previous OIG cost
   recoveries have contributed significantly to an estimated preservation
   of the Trust Fund through the year 2029. Over the past twenty-five
   years, HHS OIG staff members have made significant contributions to
   what is now, in 2001, a vital and dynamic IG organization. The
   increased emphasis on expert qualification and experience in hiring of
   staff has created a powerful organizational infrastructure that is
   capable of responding swiftly to new tasks and marshalling its
   component resources to accomplish OIG objectives. The HHS OIG now has
   the distinction of being the largest, and quite possibly the most
   effective, Federal IG office. When June Gibbs Brown retired from
   Federal Service on January 3, 2001, she left behind a legacy of
   teamwork, partnership and a highly motivated OIG workforce, which is
   well-equipped to face the future challenges. In the twenty-first
   century, these will be myriad.
