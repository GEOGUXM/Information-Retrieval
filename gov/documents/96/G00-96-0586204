   Its a dirty job but someone has to do it--S.K.Worm, the official
   annelid, or worm, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural
   Resources Conservation Service answers students questions about soil.
   Even their teachers cant wiggle their way out of this one! Slither
   your way through these soiled questions and earn a very special
   diploma. You might even get hooked on Soil!

   Hello, worm lovers and soil supporters!
   It is I, S.K. Worm. The S.K. stands for "Scientific Knowledge." But you
   can call me Skworm, as in squirm around and wiggle all over the place.

   I'm the official annelid, or worm, of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. And it's my job
   to make you and everybody else naturally resourceful about natural
   resources. Let's get started!
