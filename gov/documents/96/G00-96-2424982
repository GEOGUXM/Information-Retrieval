                     User Feedback on Classification Web

   This pilot version of Classification Web is being made available to the
    library community by the Library of Congress Cataloging Distribution
    Service (CDS). The intent of the pilot is to solicit feedback on this
   platform's viability as a future subscription product. We would greatly
      appreciate your completing this questionnaire to provide specific
   information about your experience with Classification Web. You may also
       send comments to the pilot test coordinator, Cheryl C. Cook at
   ccoo@loc.gov. For additional information on CDS and its products check

                               Prizes, Prizes!

    This survey can be completed at any point during the three-month test
     period and please only complete it once. As an incentive to provide
     feedback, every week 10 users who complete a questionnaire will be
     selected at random to receive a complimentary gift. The winner will
     have a choice of a Library of Congress mug or a Library of Congress
   calendar. Check out this week's prize winners now posted on the CDS Web
