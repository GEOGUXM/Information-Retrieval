Multi-program Workshops on the Arid Southwest

   Purpose of the Project: To focus multidisciplinary research having to
   do with the arid land surface of the Southwestern United States by
   sponsoring several workshops. The intent is to increase communication
   and collaboration among researchers and between the research and
   land-management communities.

   Approach: Provide partial funding for workshops that successfully
   integrate several disciplines and demonstrate a connection with land
   managers, as described in a short proposal.

   Project co-chiefs: Dave Miller and Rich Reynolds, U.S. Geological
