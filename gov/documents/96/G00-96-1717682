   The Search and Rescue capabilities of Nevada Wing Civil Air Patrol have
   always been highly ranked among CAP wings.

   Under Wing Commander Col. Matt Wallace, the level of training and
   safety in the state has rapidly improved.  Executive Officers Lt. Col
   James Nicholson and Lt. Col Carl Steinhoff  have made great strides in
   making certain their respective areas receive what they need to
   complete their assigned missions.

     In addition,  there is a very large list of invaluable Wing staff
     who work to ensure that everything Nevada Wing CAP does is
     professional and safe.

     What makes Nevada Wing so special is the dedication each member has
     to one another.  Go on a Search and Rescue (SAR) base, and the great
     connection between people is clear.   The dedication to the Cadet
     Program is strong and growing by leaps and bounds.  People are the
     most important asset of the Nevada Wing.

     Aerospace Education

     Civil Air Patrol has an outstanding aerospace education program
     focused not only on members, but on the general public as well. CAP
     has a congressional tasking to stimulate public interest in
     aerospace issues. Each year, CAP sponsors nearly 200 workshops in
     colleges and universities across the nation which reach more than
     5,000 educators. These workshops highlight basic aerospace knowledge
     and focus on advances in aerospace technology. Textbooks, learning
     tools, and visual aids geared to stimulate interest in aerospace
     matters are also provided for teachers to use in their classrooms.
     CAP sponsors the annual National Congress on Aviation and Space
     Education, the premier aerospace education conference held in the
     nation, involving over 1,000 educators from around the nation and
     often overseas.

     Cadet Programs

     The CAP Cadet Program continues to introduce thousands of young
     people between the ages of 12 and 18 to aviation, and offers them
     outstanding summer programs including some that offer an opportunity
     to solo in a light airplane at low cost. The CAP Cadet Program is
     designed to motivate and develop well-rounded young people, who in
     turn will become model citizens and the future leaders of our
     nation. CAP cadets progress at their own pace through a 15-step
     program including aerospace education, leadership training, physical
     fitness and moral leadership. Cadets can compete for academic
     scholarships to further their studies in such areas as engineering,
     science, aircraft mechanics and aerospace medicine. They can also
     compete for scholarships leading to solo flight training. Many
     outstanding cadets have an opportunity to go overseas in exchange
     programs with youth in other countries, and some of these exchange
     cadets even experience flying opportunities with foreign air forces.

     Many of today's leaders, in and out of aviation, have benefited
     greatly from their experiences as Civil Air Patrol cadets. Each
     graduating class of the U.S. Air Force Academy is heavily populated
     with former CAP cadets--up to 10 percent in recent years. West Point
     and the U.S. Naval Academy also admit many CAP cadets each year. CAP
     cadets who enlist in the Air Force are immediately promoted two pay
     grades (to E-3) if they have completed the second phase of CAP cadet
     training.

     1994 marked the introduction of the CAP Drug Demand Reduction
     Program (DDR). Targeted toward Active, Guard, and Reserve Air Force
     family members and members of the local community (typically within
     30 miles of an Air Force installation), units participating in DDR
     actively perform the following activities:
     * Promoting CAP as an alternative lifestyle.
     * Encouraging youth to remain in school.
     * Educating youth on the dangers of drugs.
     * Providing alternative activities to drugs.

     Emergency Services

     In 2001, CAP is still best known for its search and rescue mission.
     Civil Air Patrol air and ground teams perform 85 percent of inland
     search-and-rescue missions for the Air Force's Air Rescue
     Coordination Center. These volunteers donate their time and labor,
     receiving reimbursement for fuel and oil only, thus saving the
     taxpayers millions of dollars. More than 100 lives are saved every
     year by CAP members on search and rescue missions!

     CAP’s disaster relief missions, such as those during hurricanes and
     floods, often don't make headlines, but CAP provides both air and
     ground transportation and an extensive communications network. CAP
     members also fly disaster relief officials to remote locations and
     support local, state and national disaster relief organizations with
     manpower and leadership. CAP ground teams provide vital assistance
     to disaster relief operations.

     The CAP Emergency Communications Network spans the country with a
     data and voice net built to survive the loss of civil
     communications. With one of the most sophisticated communications
     networks in the nation, CAP supports local, state, and federal
     agencies during disaster relief, search and rescue and many other
     emergencies. The fleet of 530 CAP-owned aircraft communicates on
     CAP's own dedicated frequencies, while new systems coordinate and
     track search flights via sophisticated datalink.

     The youth-centered CAP Drug Demand Reduction Program is only one of
     Civil Air Patrol’s activities in our country’s "War on Drugs." Since
     1986, CAP has made major contributions to the counterdrug fight by
     providing aerial reconnaissance, airborne communications support,
     and airlift of law enforcement personnel. In 1995, CAP units flew
     nearly 32,000 hours in support of counterdrug efforts.

     As the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, it’s not surprising
     that Civil Air Patrol performs vital Air Force missions upon
     request. This support includes air search and rescue on USAF
     directed missions, light transport, communications support and
     low-altitude route surveys.

     All in all, there are numerous reasons for enthusiastic,
     aviation-oriented volunteers to join one of this country’s premier
     service organizations. Please read on to learn how to join the Civil
     Air Patrol and find out some of the benefits of CAP membership.

     Membership Benefits

     REWARDS & RECOGNITION As a CAP volunteer, your rewards are not
     monetary, but they are as tangible as money in the bank. Nothing
     compares to the sense of satisfaction that comes with a job well
     done, particularly if that job is saving lives or aiding
     communities. As a CAP member, you will be recognized as a vital
     member of a national team with a tremendous heritage of serving
     those in need--and doing it well. Advancement in Civil Air Patrol is
     clearly visible to your friends, family and business associates by
     the distinctive CAP uniforms with their military-style grade
     insignia, ribbons and badges. Some members choose to quietly serve
     and not wear a uniform.

     TRAINING Civil Air Patrol offers aerospace education and a wide
     variety of leadership and technical training opportunities for all
     CAP members, including Air Force correspondence courses. Special
     training is also conducted for those participating in search and
     rescue as mission pilots, observers or ground team members.
     Communications training is highly specialized and presents unique
     opportunities to network with other communicators from around the
     country. These new skills, and the self-confidence that goes with
     them, make you even more valuable in the workplace and in other
     community activities.

     UNIFORMS Civil Air Patrol members are easily recognized in the
     community since they wear a variety of distinctive uniforms. Since
     CAP is the official US Air Force auxiliary, members are also
     authorized to wear the Air Force uniform with distinguishing CAP
     badges and insignia. Wearing Air Force blue is a tremendous way to
     publicly demonstrate support and affiliation with this branch of our
     Armed Forces.

     MEETINGS AND CONVENTIONS CAP members gather regularly at meetings
     and conventions around the country. There is also a national
     convention held in a different city every year. Air travel to and
     from the convention may be provided by the Air Force if available.

     INTERNATIONAL CADET EXCHANGE PROGRAM (IACE) Each year a limited
     number of cadets and senior member escorts travel to a variety of
     foreign countries as part of an aviation cadet exchange program to
     further a program of international goodwill and understanding.

     CAP SUPPLY DEPOT Civil Air Patrol operates a depot in Amarillo,
     Texas, which carries a large stock of aircraft parts and equipment
     at discount to members for their own aircraft. Communications
     equipment of all kinds is also available.

     RENTAL CAR DISCOUNTS The Hertz Corporation offers rental car
     discounts to CAP members for both business and pleasure travel. A
     special Hertz identification card is furnished to each member upon
     request. Rates and discounts may be obtained by calling Hertz at
     1-800-654-3131.

     CIVIL AIR PATROL VISA CREDIT CARD The CAP affinity VISA card offers
     senior members and the parents of cadets an opportunity to apply for
     a credit card that actually supports CAP. Each time the card is used
     in a transaction, a donation is made by the bank to support CAP. The
     CAP emblem and the member’s grade are embossed on the front of this
     distinctive credit card.
