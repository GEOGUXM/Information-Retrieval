   The U.S. General Accounting Office is the oversight and investigative
   arm of Congress. Our mission is to support Congress in meeting its
   constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and
   accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the
   American people. Since 1921, GAO has been providing Congress with the
   fact-based research and analysis on virtually the full range of federal
   programs and policies. For example, in 2000 alone, we published nearly
   1,200 reports and testified more than 260 times before dozens of
   congressional committees.
