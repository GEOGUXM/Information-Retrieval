   AGENCY: Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

   ACTION: Notice of Report for Public Comment.

   SUMMARY: On July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348)
   was signed into law, there-by creating the National Commission for the
   Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One
   of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical
   principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and
   behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines
   which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in
   accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the
   Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between
   biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine
   practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit
   criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research
   involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the
   selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv)
   the nature and definition of informed consent in various research
   settings.

   The Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles
   identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is
   the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were
   held in February 1976 at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont
   Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the
   Commission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a
   statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist
   in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research
   with human subjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register,
   and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends that it may
   be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional
   Review Boards, and Federal employees. The two-volume Appendix,
   containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted
   the Commission in fulfilling this part of its charge, is available as
   DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014, for sale by the
   Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
   Washington, D.C. 20402.

   Unlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does
   not make specific recommendations for administrative action by the
   Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission
   recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a
   statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests public
   comment on this recommendation.

    Ethical Principles & Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects

   Scientific research has produced substantial social benefits. It has
   also posed some troubling ethical questions. Public attention was drawn
   to these questions by reported abuses of human subjects in biomedical
   experiments, especially during the Second World War. During the
   Nuremberg War Crime Trials, the Nuremberg code was drafted as a set of
   standards for judging physicians and scientists who had conducted
   biomedical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. This code
   became the prototype of many later codes(1)
   intended to assure that research involving human subjects would be
   carried out in an ethical manner.

   The codes consist of rules, some general, others specific, that guide
   the investigators or the reviewers of research in their work. Such
   rules often are inadequate to cover complex situations; at times they
   come into conflict, and they are frequently difficult to interpret or
   apply. Broader ethical principles will provide a basis on which
   specific rules may be formulated, criticized and interpreted.

   Three principles, or general prescriptive judgments, that are relevant
   to research involving human subjects are identified in this statement.
   Other principles may also be relevant. These three are comprehensive,
   however, and are stated at a level of generalization that should assist
   scientists, subjects, reviewers and interested citizens to understand
   the ethical issues inherent in research involving human subjects. These
   principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute
   particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical
   framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising
   from research involving human subjects.

   This statement consists of a distinction between research and practice,
   a discussion of the three basic ethical principles, and remarks about
   the application of these principles.
     __________________________________________________________________

               Part A: Boundaries Between Practice & Research

   A. Boundaries Between Practice and Research

   It is important to distinguish between biomedical and behavioral
   research, on the one hand, and the practice of accepted therapy on the
   other, in order to know what activities ought to undergo review for the
   protection of human subjects of research. The distinction between
   research and practice is blurred partly because both often occur
   together (as in research designed to evaluate a therapy) and partly
   because notable departures from standard practice are often called
   "experimental" when the terms "experimental" and "research" are not
   carefully defined.

   For the most part, the term "practice" refers to interventions that are
   designed solely to enhance the well-being of an individual patient or
   client and that have a reasonable expectation of success. The purpose
   of medical or behavioral practice is to provide diagnosis, preventive
   treatment or therapy to particular individuals.(2)
   By contrast, the term "research' designates an activity designed to
   test an hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and thereby to
   develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge (expressed, for
   example, in theories, principles, and statements of relationships).
   Research is usually described in a formal protocol that sets forth an
   objective and a set of procedures designed to reach that objective.

   When a clinician departs in a significant way from standard or accepted
   practice, the innovation does not, in and of itself, constitute
   research. The fact that a procedure is "experimental," in the sense of
   new, untested or different, does not automatically place it in the
   category of research. Radically new procedures of this description
   should, however, be made the object of formal research at an early
   stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective. Thus,
   it is the responsibility of medical practice committees, for example,
   to insist that a major innovation be incorporated into a formal
   research project.(3)

   Research and practice may be carried on together when research is
   designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a therapy. This need
   not cause any confusion regarding whether or not the activity requires
   review; the general rule is that if there is any element of research in
   an activity, that activity should undergo review for the protection of
   human subjects.

                      Part B: Basic Ethical Principles

   B. Basic Ethical Principles

   The expression "basic ethical principles" refers to those general
   judgments that serve as a basic justification for the many particular
   ethical prescriptions and evaluations of human actions. Three basic
   principles, among those generally accepted in our cultural tradition,
   are particularly relevant to the ethics of research involving human
   subjects: the principles of respect of persons, beneficence and
   justice.

   1. Respect for Persons. -- Respect for persons incorporates at least
   two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated as
   autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy
   are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus
   divides into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to
   acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with
   diminished autonomy.

   An autonomous person is an individual capable of deliberation about
   personal goals and of acting under the direction of such deliberation.
   To respect autonomy is to give weight to autonomous persons' considered
   opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions
   unless they are clearly detrimental to others. To show lack of respect
   for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person's considered
   judgments, to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered
   judgments, or to withhold information necessary to make a considered
   judgment, when there are no compelling reasons to do so.

   However, not every human being is capable of self-determination. The
   capacity for self-determination matures during an individual's life,
   and some individuals lose this capacity wholly or in part because of
   illness, mental disability, or circumstances that severely restrict
   liberty. Respect for the immature and the incapacitated may require
   protecting them as they mature or while they are incapacitated.

   Some persons are in need of extensive protection, even to the point of
   excluding them from activities which may harm them; other persons
   require little protection beyond making sure they undertake activities
   freely and with awareness of possible adverse consequence. The extent
   of protection afforded should depend upon the risk of harm and the
   likelihood of benefit. The judgment that any individual lacks autonomy
   should be periodically reevaluated and will vary in different
   situations.

   In most cases of research involving human subjects, respect for persons
   demands that subjects enter into the research voluntarily and with
   adequate information. In some situations, however, application of the
   principle is not obvious. The involvement of prisoners as subjects of
   research provides an instructive example. On the one hand, it would
   seem that the principle of respect for persons requires that prisoners
   not be deprived of the opportunity to volunteer for research. On the
   other hand, under prison conditions they may be subtly coerced or
   unduly influenced to engage in research activities for which they would
   not otherwise volunteer. Respect for persons would then dictate that
   prisoners be protected. Whether to allow prisoners to "volunteer" or to
   "protect" them presents a dilemma. Respecting persons, in most hard
   cases, is often a matter of balancing competing claims urged by the
   principle of respect itself.

   2. Beneficence. -- Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by
   respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by
   making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under
   the principle of beneficence. The term "beneficence" is often
   understood to cover acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict
   obligation. In this document, beneficence is understood in a stronger
   sense, as an obligation. Two general rules have been formulated as
   complementary expressions of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do
   not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible
   harms.

   The Hippocratic maxim "do no harm" has long been a fundamental
   principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of
   research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of
   the benefits that might come to others. However, even avoiding harm
   requires learning what is harmful; and, in the process of obtaining
   this information, persons may be exposed to risk of harm. Further, the
   Hippocratic Oath requires physicians to benefit their patients
   "according to their best judgment." Learning what will in fact benefit
   may require exposing persons to risk. The problem posed by these
   imperatives is to decide when it is justifiable to seek certain
   benefits despite the risks involved, and when the benefits should be
   foregone because of the risks.

   The obligations of beneficence affect both individual investigators and
   society at large, because they extend both to particular research
   projects and to the entire enterprise of research. In the case of
   particular projects, investigators and members of their institutions
   are obliged to give forethought to the maximization of benefits and the
   reduction of risk that might occur from the research investigation. In
   the case of scientific research in general, members of the larger
   society are obliged to recognize the longer term benefits and risks
   that may result from the improvement of knowledge and from the
   development of novel medical, psychotherapeutic, and social procedures.

   The principle of beneficence often occupies a well-defined justifying
   role in many areas of research involving human subjects. An example is
   found in research involving children. Effective ways of treating
   childhood diseases and fostering healthy development are benefits that
   serve to justify research involving children -- even when individual
   research subjects are not direct beneficiaries. Research also makes it
   possible to avoid the harm that may result from the application of
   previously accepted routine practices that on closer investigation turn
   out to be dangerous. But the role of the principle of beneficence is
   not always so unambiguous. A difficult ethical problem remains, for
   example, about research that presents more than minimal risk without
   immediate prospect of direct benefit to the children involved. Some
   have argued that such research is inadmissible, while others have
   pointed out that this limit would rule out much research promising
   great benefit to children in the future. Here again, as with all hard
   cases, the different claims covered by the principle of beneficence may
   come into conflict and force difficult choices.

   3. Justice. -- Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear
   its burdens? This is a question of justice, in the sense of "fairness
   in distribution" or "what is deserved." An injustice occurs when some
   benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or
   when some burden is imposed unduly. Another way of conceiving the
   principle of justice is that equals ought to be treated equally.
   However, this statement requires explication. Who is equal and who is
   unequal? What considerations justify departure from equal distribution?
   Almost all commentators allow that distinctions based on experience,
   age, deprivation, competence, merit and position do sometimes
   constitute criteria justifying differential treatment for certain
   purposes. It is necessary, then, to explain in what respects people
   should be treated equally. There are several widely accepted
   formulations of just ways to distribute burdens and benefits. Each
   formulation mentions some relevant property on the basis of which
   burdens and benefits should be distributed. These formulations are (1)
   to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to
   individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4)
   to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each
   person according to merit.

   Questions of justice have long been associated with social practices
   such as punishment, taxation and political representation. Until
   recently these questions have not generally been associated with
   scientific research. However, they are foreshadowed even in the
   earliest reflections on the ethics of research involving human
   subjects. For example, during the 19th and early 20th centuries the
   burdens of serving as research subjects fell largely upon poor ward
   patients, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed primarily
   to private patients. Subsequently, the exploitation of unwilling
   prisoners as research subjects in Nazi concentration camps was
   condemned as a particularly flagrant injustice. In this country, in the
   1940's, the Tuskegee syphilis study used disadvantaged, rural black men
   to study the untreated course of a disease that is by no means confined
   to that population. These subjects were deprived of demonstrably
   effective treatment in order not to interrupt the project, long after
   such treatment became generally available.

   Against this historical background, it can be seen how conceptions of
   justice are relevant to research involving human subjects. For example,
   the selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order to
   determine whether some classes (e.g., welfare patients, particular
   racial and ethnic minorities, or persons confined to institutions) are
   being systematically selected simply because of their easy
   availability, their compromised position, or their manipulability,
   rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being studied.
   Finally, whenever research supported by public funds leads to the
   development of therapeutic devices and procedures, justice demands both
   that these not provide advantages only to those who can afford them and
   that such research should not unduly involve persons from groups
   unlikely to be among the beneficiaries of subsequent applications of
   the research.
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Part C: Applications

   C. Applications

   Applications of the general principles to the conduct of research leads
   to consideration of the following requirements: informed consent,
   risk/benefit assessment, and the selection of subjects of research.

   1. Informed Consent. -- Respect for persons requires that subjects, to
   the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose
   what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided
   when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.

   While the importance of informed consent is unquestioned, controversy
   prevails over the nature and possibility of an informed consent.
   Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the consent process can
   be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension
   and voluntariness.

   Information. Most codes of research establish specific items for
   disclosure intended to assure that subjects are given sufficient
   information. These items generally include: the research procedure,
   their purposes, risks and anticipated benefits, alternative procedures
   (where therapy is involved), and a statement offering the subject the
   opportunity to ask questions and to withdraw at any time from the
   research. Additional items have been proposed, including how subjects
   are selected, the person responsible for the research, etc.

   However, a simple listing of items does not answer the question of what
   the standard should be for judging how much and what sort of
   information should be provided. One standard frequently invoked in
   medical practice, namely the information commonly provided by
   practitioners in the field or in the locale, is inadequate since
   research takes place precisely when a common understanding does not
   exist. Another standard, currently popular in malpractice law, requires
   the practitioner to reveal the information that reasonable persons
   would wish to know in order to make a decision regarding their care.
   This, too, seems insufficient since the research subject, being in
   essence a volunteer, may wish to know considerably more about risks
   gratuitously undertaken than do patients who deliver themselves into
   the hand of a clinician for needed care. It may be that a standard of
   "the reasonable volunteer" should be proposed: the extent and nature of
   information should be such that persons, knowing that the procedure is
   neither necessary for their care nor perhaps fully understood, can
   decide whether they wish to participate in the furthering of knowledge.
   Even when some direct benefit to them is anticipated, the subjects
   should understand clearly the range of risk and the voluntary nature of
   participation.

   A special problem of consent arises where informing subjects of some
   pertinent aspect of the research is likely to impair the validity of
   the research. In many cases, it is sufficient to indicate to subjects
   that they are being invited to participate in research of which some
   features will not be revealed until the research is concluded. In all
   cases of research involving incomplete disclosure, such research is
   justified only if it is clear that (1) incomplete disclosure is truly
   necessary to accomplish the goals of the research, (2) there are no
   undisclosed risks to subjects that are more than minimal, and (3) there
   is an adequate plan for debriefing subjects, when appropriate, and for
   dissemination of research results to them. Information about risks
   should never be withheld for the purpose of eliciting the cooperation
   of subjects, and truthful answers should always be given to direct
   questions about the research. Care should be taken to distinguish cases
   in which disclosure would destroy or invalidate the research from cases
   in which disclosure would simply inconvenience the investigator.

   Comprehension. The manner and context in which information is conveyed
   is as important as the information itself. For example, presenting
   information in a disorganized and rapid fashion, allowing too little
   time for consideration or curtailing opportunities for questioning, all
   may adversely affect a subject's ability to make an informed choice.

   Because the subject's ability to understand is a function of
   intelligence, rationality, maturity and language, it is necessary to
   adapt the presentation of the information to the subject's capacities.
   Investigators are responsible for ascertaining that the subject has
   comprehended the information. While there is always an obligation to
   ascertain that the information about risk to subjects is complete and
   adequately comprehended, when the risks are more serious, that
   obligation increases. On occasion, it may be suitable to give some oral
   or written tests of comprehension.

   Special provision may need to be made when comprehension is severely
   limited -- for example, by conditions of immaturity or mental
   disability. Each class of subjects that one might consider as
   incompetent (e.g., infants and young children, mentally disable
   patients, the terminally ill and the comatose) should be considered on
   its own terms. Even for these persons, however, respect requires giving
   them the opportunity to choose to the extent they are able, whether or
   not to participate in research. The objections of these subjects to
   involvement should be honored, unless the research entails providing
   them a therapy unavailable elsewhere. Respect for persons also requires
   seeking the permission of other parties in order to protect the
   subjects from harm. Such persons are thus respected both by
   acknowledging their own wishes and by the use of third parties to
   protect them from harm.

   The third parties chosen should be those who are most likely to
   understand the incompetent subject's situation and to act in that
   person's best interest. The person authorized to act on behalf of the
   subject should be given an opportunity to observe the research as it
   proceeds in order to be able to withdraw the subject from the research,
   if such action appears in the subject's best interest.

   Voluntariness. An agreement to participate in research constitutes a
   valid consent only if voluntarily given. This element of informed
   consent requires conditions free of coercion and undue influence.
   Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented
   by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue
   influence, by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive,
   unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in
   order to obtain compliance. Also, inducements that would ordinarily be
   acceptable may become undue influences if the subject is especially
   vulnerable.

   Unjustifiable pressures usually occur when persons in positions of
   authority or commanding influence -- especially where possible
   sanctions are involved -- urge a course of action for a subject. A
   continuum of such influencing factors exists, however, and it is
   impossible to state precisely where justifiable persuasion ends and
   undue influence begins. But undue influence would include actions such
   as manipulating a person's choice through the controlling influence of
   a close relative and threatening to withdraw health services to which
   an individual would otherwise be entitle.

   2. Assessment of Risks and Benefits. -- The assessment of risks and
   benefits requires a careful arrayal of relevant data, including, in
   some cases, alternative ways of obtaining the benefits sought in the
   research. Thus, the assessment presents both an opportunity and a
   responsibility to gather systematic and comprehensive information about
   proposed research. For the investigator, it is a means to examine
   whether the proposed research is properly designed. For a review
   committee, it is a method for determining whether the risks that will
   be presented to subjects are justified. For prospective subjects, the
   assessment will assist the determination whether or not to participate.

   The Nature and Scope of Risks and Benefits. The requirement that
   research be justified on the basis of a favorable risk/benefit
   assessment bears a close relation to the principle of beneficence, just
   as the moral requirement that informed consent be obtained is derived
   primarily from the principle of respect for persons. The term "risk"
   refers to a possibility that harm may occur. However, when expressions
   such as "small risk" or "high risk" are used, they usually refer (often
   ambiguously) both to the chance (probability) of experiencing a harm
   and the severity (magnitude) of the envisioned harm.

   The term "benefit" is used in the research context to refer to
   something of positive value related to health or welfare. Unlike,
   "risk," "benefit" is not a term that expresses probabilities. Risk is
   properly contrasted to probability of benefits, and benefits are
   properly contrasted with harms rather than risks of harm. Accordingly,
   so-called risk/benefit assessments are concerned with the probabilities
   and magnitudes of possible harm and anticipated benefits. Many kinds of
   possible harms and benefits need to be taken into account. There are,
   for example, risks of psychological harm, physical harm, legal harm,
   social harm and economic harm and the corresponding benefits. While the
   most likely types of harms to research subjects are those of
   psychological or physical pain or injury, other possible kinds should
   not be overlooked.

   Risks and benefits of research may affect the individual subjects, the
   families of the individual subjects, and society at large (or special
   groups of subjects in society). Previous codes and Federal regulations
   have required that risks to subjects be outweighed by the sum of both
   the anticipated benefit to the subject, if any, and the anticipated
   benefit to society in the form of knowledge to be gained from the
   research. In balancing these different elements, the risks and benefits
   affecting the immediate research subject will normally carry special
   weight. On the other hand, interests other than those of the subject
   may on some occasions be sufficient by themselves to justify the risks
   involved in the research, so long as the subjects' rights have been
   protected. Beneficence thus requires that we protect against risk of
   harm to subjects and also that we be concerned about the loss of the
   substantial benefits that might be gained from research.

   The Systematic Assessment of Risks and Benefits. It is commonly said
   that benefits and risks must be "balanced" and shown to be "in a
   favorable ratio." The metaphorical character of these terms draws
   attention to the difficulty of making precise judgments. Only on rare
   occasions will quantitative techniques be available for the scrutiny of
   research protocols. However, the idea of systematic, nonarbitrary
   analysis of risks and benefits should be emulated insofar as possible.
   This ideal requires those making decisions about the justifiability of
   research to be thorough in the accumulation and assessment of
   information about all aspects of the research, and to consider
   alternatives systematically. This procedure renders the assessment of
   research more rigorous and precise, while making communication between
   review board members and investigators less subject to
   misinterpretation, misinformation and conflicting judgments. Thus,
   there should first be a determination of the validity of the
   presuppositions of the research; then the nature, probability and
   magnitude of risk should be distinguished with as much clarity as
   possible. The method of ascertaining risks should be explicit,
   especially where there is no alternative to the use of such vague
   categories as small or slight risk. It should also be determined
   whether an investigator's estimates of the probability of harm or
   benefits are reasonable, as judged by known facts or other available
   studies.

   Finally, assessment of the justifiability of research should reflect at
   least the following considerations: (i) Brutal or inhumane treatment of
   human subjects is never morally justified. (ii) Risks should be reduced
   to those necessary to achieve the research objective. It should be
   determined whether it is in fact necessary to use human subjects at
   all. Risk can perhaps never be entirely eliminated, but it can often be
   reduced by careful attention to alternative procedures. (iii) When
   research involves significant risk of serious impairment, review
   committees should be extraordinarily insistent on the justification of
   the risk (looking usually to the likelihood of benefit to the subject
   -- or, in some rare cases, to the manifest voluntariness of the
   participation). (iv) When vulnerable populations are involved in
   research, the appropriateness of involving them should itself be
   demonstrated. A number of variables go into such judgments, including
   the nature and degree of risk, the condition of the particular
   population involved, and the nature and level of the anticipated
   benefits. (v) Relevant risks and benefits must be thoroughly arrayed in
   documents and procedures used in the informed consent process.

   3. Selection of Subjects. -- Just as the principle of respect for
   persons finds expression in the requirements for consent, and the
   principle of beneficence in risk/benefit assessment, the principle of
   justice gives rise to moral requirements that there be fair procedures
   and outcomes in the selection of research subjects.

   Justice is relevant to the selection of subjects of research at two
   levels: the social and the individual. Individual justice in the
   selection of subjects would require that researchers exhibit fairness:
   thus, they should not offer potentially beneficial research only to
   some patients who are in their favor or select only "undesirable"
   persons for risky research. Social justice requires that distinction be
   drawn between classes of subjects that ought, and ought not, to
   participate in any particular kind of research, based on the ability of
   members of that class to bear burdens and on the appropriateness of
   placing further burdens on already burdened persons. Thus, it can be
   considered a matter of social justice that there is an order of
   preference in the selection of classes of subjects (e.g., adults before
   children) and that some classes of potential subjects (e.g., the
   institutionalized mentally infirm or prisoners) may be involved as
   research subjects, if at all, only on certain conditions.

   Injustice may appear in the selection of subjects, even if individual
   subjects are selected fairly by investigators and treated fairly in the
   course of research. Thus injustice arises from social, racial, sexual
   and cultural biases institutionalized in society. Thus, even if
   individual researchers are treating their research subjects fairly, and
   even if IRBs are taking care to assure that subjects are selected
   fairly within a particular institution, unjust social patterns may
   nevertheless appear in the overall distribution of the burdens and
   benefits of research. Although individual institutions or investigators
   may not be able to resolve a problem that is pervasive in their social
   setting, they can consider distributive justice in selecting research
   subjects.

   Some populations, especially institutionalized ones, are already
   burdened in many ways by their infirmities and environments. When
   research is proposed that involves risks and does not include a
   therapeutic component, other less burdened classes of persons should be
   called upon first to accept these risks of research, except where the
   research is directly related to the specific conditions of the class
   involved. Also, even though public funds for research may often flow in
   the same directions as public funds for health care, it seems unfair
   that populations dependent on public health care constitute a pool of
   preferred research subjects if more advantaged populations are likely
   to be the recipients of the benefits.

   One special instance of injustice results from the involvement of
   vulnerable subjects. Certain groups, such as racial minorities, the
   economically disadvantaged, the very sick, and the institutionalized
   may continually be sought as research subjects, owing to their ready
   availability in settings where research is conducted. Given their
   dependent status and their frequently compromised capacity for free
   consent, they should be protected against the danger of being involved
   in research solely for administrative convenience, or because they are
   easy to manipulate as a result of their illness or socioeconomic
   condition.

   Since 1945, various codes for the proper and responsible conduct of
   human experimentation in medical research have been adopted by
   different organizations. The best known of these codes are the
   Nuremberg Code of 1947, the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 (revised in
   1975), and the 1971 Guidelines (codified into Federal Regulations in
   1974) issued by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
   Codes for the conduct of social and behavioral research have also been
   adopted, the best known being that of the American Psychological
   Association, published in 1973.

   Although practice usually involves interventions designed solely to
   enhance the well-being of a particular individual, interventions are
   sometimes applied to one individual for the enhancement of the
   well-being of another (e.g., blood donation, skin grafts, organ
   transplants) or an intervention may have the dual purpose of enhancing
   the well-being of a particular individual, and, at the same time,
   providing some benefit to others (e.g., vaccination, which protects
   both the person who is vaccinated and society generally). The fact that
   some forms of practice have elements other than immediate benefit to
   the individual receiving an intervention, however, should not confuse
   the general distinction between research and practice. Even when a
   procedure applied in practice may benefit some other person, it remains
   an intervention designed to enhance the well-being of a particular
   individual or groups of individuals; thus, it is practice and need not
   be reviewed as research.

   Because the problems related to social experimentation may differ
   substantially from those of biomedical and behavioral research, the
   Commission specifically declines to make any policy determination
   regarding such research at this time. Rather, the Commission believes
   that the problem ought to be addressed by one of its successor bodies.
