   Laboratory Director Dr. Edward Stone discusses NASA's current
   assessment of Mars program management and its possible effects on JPL's
   future. Q Activity surrounding JPL's Mars program seems to be picking
   up on a lot of fronts. Can you tell us what is going on? A You're
   right. There's a great deal going on. Let's start with the E S S ONS
   review boards. There are currently four separate NASA reviews underway.
   One, headed up by Tony Spear [JPL retired Mars Pathfinder project
   manager], examines the faster, better, cheap- er approach to project
   implementation. A second is part two of the Stephenson report. Part
   one, as you will recall, examined the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter.
   Part two broadens out to look E A RNE D at other NASA programs.
