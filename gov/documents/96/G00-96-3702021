                    Common Criteria Testing Laboratories

   NIAP approved Common Criteria Testing Laboratories (CCTLs) are IT
   security testing laboratories that are accredited by the NIST National
   Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) and meet
   CCEVS-specific requirements to conduct IT security evaluations for
   conformance to the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security
   Evaluation, International Standard ISO/IEC 15408:1999.

   The CCTLs on the NIAP Approved Laboratories List are:

   These laboratories must meet the requirements of:
     * NIST Handbook 150, Procedures and General Requirements;
     * NIST Handbook 150-20, Information Technology Security TestingCommon
       Criteria;
     * Specific criteria for IT security evaluations and other
       requirements of the scheme as defined by the NIAP Validation Body.

   CCTLs enter into contractual agreements with sponsors to conduct
   security evaluations of IT products and protection profiles using
   NIAP-approved test methods derived from the Common Criteria, Common
   Methodology and other technology-based sources. The IT security
   evaluations are carried out in accordance with the policies and
   procedures of the scheme. CCTLs must observe the highest standards of
   impartiality, integrity, and commercial confidentiality, and operate
   within the guidelines established by the scheme.

   To become a CCTL, a testing laboratory must go through a series of
   steps that involve both the NIAP Validation Body and NVLAP.
   Accreditation by NVLAP is the primary requirement for achieving CCTL
   status. Scheme requirements that cannot be satisfied by NVLAP
   accreditation are addressed by the NIAP Validation Body. At present,
   there are only three scheme-specific requirements imposed by the
   Validation Body. NIAP approved CCTLs:
     * must reside within the U.S. and be a legal entity, duly organized
       and incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing under the
       laws of the state where the laboratory intends to do business;
     * must agree to accept U.S. Government technical oversight and
       validation of evaluation-related activities in accordance with the
       policies and procedures established by the NIAP Common Criteria
       Scheme;
     * must agree to accept U.S. Government participants in selected
       Common Criteria evaluations conducted by the laboratory in
       accordance with the policies and procedures established by the NIAP
       Common Criteria Scheme.

   A testing laboratory becomes a CCTL when the laboratory is approved by
   the Validation Body and is listed on the NIAP Approved Laboratories
   List.

   To avoid unnecessary expense and delay in becoming a NIAP-approved
   testing laboratory, it is strongly recommended that prospective CCTLs
   ensure that they are able to satisfy the scheme-specific requirements
   prior to seeking accreditation from NVLAP. This can be accomplished by
   sending a letter of intent to the NIAP Validation Body prior to
   entering the NVLAP process.

   Information Technology SecurityOrganization, Management, and Concept of
   Operations and Scheme Publication #4 Common Criteria Evaluation and
   Validation Scheme for Information Technology SecurityGuidance to Common
