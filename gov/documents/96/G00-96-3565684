   Atmospheric modeling and simulation studies have been invaluable in the
   development of our current level of understanding of the fundamental
   processes of radiation, chemistry, and dynamics that ultimately
   determine the circulation, thermal structure, and distribution of
   constituents in the Earth's atmosphere. Many of these studies have
   treated these processes independently or have suppressed important
   couplings between the processes. This approach was a conscious strategy
   adopted to make the studies tractable and often relied on assumptions
   that the couplings were weak enough to neglect. Recently however, there
   has been increased awareness that many phenomena of interest may
   involve subtle and complex interactions among these processes. Notable
   examples are the annual formation and decay of the Antarctic ozone hole
   and the downward trend in mid-latitude ozone in the lower stratosphere.
   At the same time, there has been increased emphasis on global change
   studies which attempt to assess long-term (decadal or longer) impact on
   the Earth's atmosphere from both anthropogenic and natural changes.
   Clearly, these studies must rely on simulation models which incorporate
   all of the relevant processes and correctly represent the interactions
   between those processes.

   There has been an ongoing effort at the Langley Research Center to
   develop and utilize a three-dimensional atmospheric simulation model
   with fully-coupled radiation, chemistry, and dynamics for studies of
   atmospheric chemistry and transport. We have been successful recently
   in conducting simulations with a coupled model with which it is
   feasible to run multi-year simulations on reasonable time-scales.
   During the next three years, we will focus on understanding the annual
   and interannual variations in ozone, water vapor and other key
   constituents in the lower stratosphere/upper troposphere and the
   relationship of these variations to the extent of PSC processing,
   aerosol loading, and to the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation
   (QBO) and the El Nino-Southern oscillation (ENSO). In addition we will
   perform perturbation studies to assess the impact of: (1) large
   injections of volcanic aerosol; and (2) aircraft fleet emissions. This
   research will serve to establish strategies for future long-term
   modeling simulations with changing source gas emissions (CO2, CH4,
   CFCs, H2O, and NOx).

   These studies are conducted primarily with a general circulation model
   (GCM) with coupled radiation, chemistry, and dynamics. Concurrently,
   observational analysis using various data sources are used to evaluate
   the fidelity of the model in representing atmospheric processes and to
   complement the science studies being investigated with the model. The
   overall objective of this work is to improve our understanding of
   atmospheric chemistry and transport processes and to translate that
   understanding into improved predictive models for use in global change
   studies.
