     The AOML Environmental Data Server (ENVIDS) provides interactive,
     on-line access to various oceanographic and atmospheric datasets
     residing at AOML. The in-house datasets include Atlantic Expendable
     Bathythermograph (XBT), Global Lagrangian Drifting Buoy, Hurricane
     Flight Level, and Atlantic Hurricane Tracks (North Atlantic Best
     Track and Synoptic). Other available datasets include Pacific
     Conductivitiy/Temperature/Depth Recorder (CTD) and World Ocean Atlas
     1998.

     This project was made possible in part by the support of the
     Environmental Services Data and Imformation Management (ESDIM).

     SEAKEYS and CREWS marine environmental monitoring stations
     provide near real-time in situ hourly measurements for many
     meteorological
     and oceanographic parameters including wind speed, wind direction,
     wind
     gusts, air temperature, barometric pressure, sea temperature,
     salinity,
     UV-B, photosynthetically active radiation, tide, fluorometry and
     transmissometry. These data are screened by a suite of expert
     systems to
     support data quality review, and to model and predict biological
     events,
     such as coral bleaching, near coral reef areas. The CREWS network is
     being expanded through 2007 to cover all major US coral reef areas.
