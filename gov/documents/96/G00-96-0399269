Surging Glacier in Denali National Park and Preserve Attracts Media Attention
                                  in Alaska

        The Tokositna Glacier in the Denali National Park and Preserve was
   reported to be surging in an Associated Press release dated April 22nd.
   Tokositna Glacier is a 23-miles long, medium sized glacier, on the
   south flank of the Mount McKinley massif (see the satellite image). The
   USGS has documented the behavior of the Tokositna Glacier for more then
   four decades. Austin Post (USGS-retired) identified the Tokositna
   Glacier as a possible surge-type glacier in an article published in
   1969 and began aerial photo documentation during 1957 while working
   with the University of Washington. USGS aerial-photo documentation by
   Post, Krimmel, and Mayo contains 190 aerial photos of Tokositna Glacier
   dating from 1966 through 1987. Since 1957, Tokositna Glacier has had at
   least two notable events that displaced the lower reaches of the
   glacier by about 2 kilometers (the 1971 aerial photo shows the
   Tokositna in surge). These events failed to reactive all of the
   stagnant ice at the terminus and produce an advance of the terminus. In
   a 1978 paper, Larry Mayo (USGS - retired) identified the Tokositna as a
   type example of "pulsing" glacier. A pulsing glacier experiences
   flow-speed increases that are intermediate between the 10-fold increase
   that defines a surge-type glacier and the seasonal speed changes
   associated with "normal" glacier flow. Guy Adema, Denali National Park
   and Preserve glaciologist, has suggested the current event will begin
   advancing the terminus into the Tokositna River within a month. If this
   occurs, it will be an exciting exception to the 50-year history of
   Tokositna Glacier flow events and demonstrate that a single glacier can
   undergo a broad range of flow instabilities. If the current event is a
   full surge of the Tokositna Glacier, the outburst flood that is
   associated with the culmination of a surge should be larger than those
   associated with pulses. However, a 3-kilometer advance of the terminus
   that could form a glacier dammed lake in the lower Kanikuta valley, is
   very unlikely in light of the 50 year observational history of
   Tokositna Glacier.

        The surge of Tokositna Glacier is not unique. On a short
   reconnaissance flight last summer, Austin Post observed that the
   terminus of Hayes Glacier (on Mt. Spurr) was advancing due to a surge,
   a small glacier was surging in the Boomerang Creek drainage on the
   north flank of the Wrangell Mountains, and the Steller Lobe (the
   western one-third of the Bering Glacier piedmont lobe) is rapidly
   advancing into a glacier dammed lake (Berg Lake) from which it has been
   retreating for decades. The Steller tributary to the Bering system has
   not previously been considered a surge-type glacier. However, the
   reported rapid advance into Berg Lake may reveal a previously
   unrecognized aspect of its behavior. Other reported surge activity
   include the Yentna Glacier (also on the south flank of the McKinley
   massif) which was surging last summer and the Lacuna Glacier (a large
   tributary to the lower Yentna) is surging at this time. See the
   satellite image for the locations of the Yentna and Lacuna Glaciers.
