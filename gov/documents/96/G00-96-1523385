                              BRD Publications

     The USGS Biological Resources Discipline (BRD) publishes scientific
     and technical articles and reports resulting from the research
     performed by our scientists and partners. These articles appear in
     professional journals around the world.

                           Guidelines for Authors

     Reports are published in two report series: Biological Science
     Reports and Information and Technology Reports.

     Biological Science Reports: This series records the significant
     findings resulting from sponsored and co-sponsored research
     programs. They may include extensive data or theoretical analyses.
     Papers in this series are are held to the same peer-review and high
     quality standards as their journal counterparts.

     Information and Technology Reports: These reports are intended for
     publication of book-length monographs; synthesis documents;
     compilations of conference and workshop papers; important planning
     and reference materials such as strategic plans, standard operating
     procedures, protocols, handbooks, and manuals; and data compilations
     such as tables and bibliographies. Papers in this series are held to
     the same peer-review and high quality standards as their journal
     counterparts.

     Guidelines for authors and production staff are available here.

                     National Status and Trends Reports

     BRD regularly reports on the status and trends of biological
     resources across the country. The Status and Trends of the Nation's
     Biological Resources is a two-volume, peer-reviewed report written
     in non-technical language, representing a broad-based partnering
     effortwith contributions from nearly 200 authors representing the
     federal government, academic, and non-governmental communities.
     Released in the summer of 1999, the report synthesizes current
     information on the status and trends of our biological resources
     with a historical perspective of ecosystems across the country to
     assess how the Nation's resources are changing. An Executive Summary
     is also available separately.

     A hard copy of the report can be obtained through the U.S.
     Government Superintendent of Documents by phone (202) 512-1800 or
     fax (202) 512-2250 (stock # 024-001-03603-7, cost $98.00).

     An earlier effort, Our Living Resources, was published in 1995 by
     the National Biological Service, the forerunner to BRD. This report
     contains almost 200 articles describing inventory and monitoring
     efforts that measure the distribution, abundance, and health of the
     Nation's plants, animals, and ecosystems. Get Acrobat Reader
