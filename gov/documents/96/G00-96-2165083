Ex-Im Bank Direct Loan Program

   Purpose

   Ex-Im Bank offers fixed-rate loans directly to foreign buyers of U.S.
   goods and services to help U.S. exporters compete against foreign
   suppliers offering officially supported export credits and to fill in
   gaps in the availability of private export financing.

   Program Description

   Ex-Im Bank will consider extending to a company's foreign customer a
   fixed-rate loan covering up to 85 percent of the value of all eligible
   goods and services in the U.S. supply contract (please see the "Foreign
   Content Policy Fact Sheet (EBD-M-04a)" for more details.. The buyer
   must make a cash payment to the U.S. exporter of the remaining15
   percent.

   At the preliminary stage, Ex-Im Bank frequently offers the option of
   guarantee support or a direct loan.

   Eligible Exports

   Capital equipment, large-scale projects, and related services are
   eligible for direct loan financing.

   Ex-Im Bank direct loans generally involve loan amounts over $10 million
   or a repayment term of five or more years. Transactions involving loan
   amounts of $10 million or less are ordinarily financed by a domestic
   financing institution or third party, and Ex-Im Bank support takes the
   form of a guarantee.

   Eligible Borrowers

   The borrower must be a creditworthy entity in a country eligible for
   Ex-Im Bank assistance. The borrower may be an entity other than the
   buyer. Generally, on government or government-sponsored projects, Ex-Im
   Bank looks for a host government guarantee. Private sector borrowers
   may be considered on their own merits or may offer a creditworthy bank
   as a guarantor. Ex-Im Bank will also consider doing project finance
   where the risk of the project is taken. Applicants should consult with
   Ex-Im Bank about any special conditions that may apply to the importing
   country.

   Financing Terms

   Cash Payment

   Ex-Im Bank requires that the buyer make a cash payment to the exporter
   equal to at least 15 percent of the U.S. supply contract. The 15% cash
   payment can either be borrowed from a lender or the exporter at market
   terms, or from the buyer's own funds.  The cash payment may be paid in
   a lump sum before disbursement of the financing, or it may be paid in
   installments equal to at least 15 percent of the value of each
   completed shipment and related disbursement under the contract. The
   alternative selected is negotiated between the buyer and seller.

   Coverage

   Ex-Im Bank will consider extending a loan to the foreign borrower
   covering up to 85 percent of the value of all eligible goods and
   services in the U.S. supply contract..

   Repayment

   Repayment terms on transactions supported by direct loans normally
   range from five to ten years, depending on the export value, the
   product or project being financed, the importing country and the terms
   offered by officially supported competitors. The maximum repayment term
   is five years for relatively rich countries and ten years for
   relatively poor countries. Exceptions exist to these general guidelines
   by agreement among the OECD countries.

   Payments are usually made in semiannual installments beginning six
   months after final delivery, the mid-point of deliveries or completion
   of the project, whichever is appropriate.

   Interest Rates

   Interest rates on direct loans are fixed for the life of the loan at
   the time of Ex-Im Bank's Final Commitment. Interest is payable on the
   installment dates on outstanding balances.

   Ex-Im Bank charges the minimum OECD rate applicable to the category of
   the importing country and the repayment period.

   Fees

   The fees described below are not incurred until Ex-Im Bank authorizes a
   Final Commitment.

   Commitment fee. Ex-Im Bank charges the borrower a commitment fee of
   one-half of one percent per annum on the undisbursed balance of a
   direct loan. This fee begins to accrue 60 days after Ex-Im Bank's Final
   Commitment for the loan.

   Exposure fee. Ex-Im Bank charges an exposure fee calculated and payable
   as the direct loan is disbursed or in an up-front lump sum payment. The
   fee may be financed by Ex-Im Bank. The parties to the transaction,
   other than Ex-Im Bank but including the borrower or exporter, must
   determine who will be obligated to pay the exposure fee to Ex-Im Bank
   and must notify Ex-Im Bank of such determination at the time of
   application for a final commitment.

   Ex-Im Bank does not charge for legal services when loan documents are
   prepared by Ex-Im Bank staff. In complex cases in which Ex-Im Bank
   decides that it needs the assistance of outside counsel in the
   preparation of loan documents, Ex-Im Bank will require the borrower to
   pay the legal fees incurred.

   Documentation and Utilization

   The loan agreement sets forth transaction-specific provisions, as well
   as standard Ex-Im Bank terms and conditions which are not subject to
   negotiation.

   When Ex-Im Bank extends a direct loan to a borrower, Ex-Im Bank enters
   into a loan agreement with the borrower and requests the issuance of a
   promissory note by the borrower. The utilization procedures are
   detailed in an annex to the loan agreement.

   Conditions Affecting the Sales Contract

   Certain conditions (in addition to the conditions precedent to the
   availability of the loan) set forth in the loan agreement may have an
   effect upon the sales contract between the exporter and the buyer
   (foreign borrower). The exporter should discuss these conditions with
   the buyer during the negotiation of the sales contract:

   Exporter's Certificate. Ex-Im Bank requires an up-front certification
   from the exporter as to (1) the U.S. and foreign content of the goods
   and services being financed, and (2) the exporter's compliance with
   other legal requirements.

   Transportation. Exports financed under a direct loan that are
   transported by ocean vessel must be shipped in vessels of U.S.
   registry, unless the foreign buyer obtains a waiver of this requirement
   from the U.S Maritime Administration. Borrowers are to address waiver
   requests to the Director, Office of Market Development, Maritime
   Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street S.W.,
   Washington, D.C. 20590.

   Ocean freight or air freight costs for goods shipped on vessels or
   aircraft of non-U.S. registry are considered foreign costs, even if (in
   the case of ocean shipments) the borrower has obtained a Maritime
   Administration waiver.

   Insurance. The borrower is required to obtain insurance against marine
   and transit hazards on all shipments of items financed by Ex-Im Bank.
   U.S. insurers should be given a nondiscriminatory opportunity to bid
   for such insurance business. Premiums for hazard insurance paid to U.S.
   insurance companies are eligible for Ex-Im Bank financing.

   Progress payments. To be eligible for Ex-Im Bank financing, progress
   payments must be payable over the product manufacturing period or the
   project construction period, according to a purchase contract approved
   by Ex-Im Bank. The contract must provide for progress payments at times
   and in amounts that have a reasonable relationship, in Ex-Im Bank's
   judgment, to amounts expended by the U.S. supplier.

   Conditions Precedent to the Availability of the Loan

   Before drawing down the loan, the borrower must satisfy the conditions
   precedent to the availability of the loan specified in the loan
   agreement. Among such conditions, the borrower is usually required to
   provide Ex-Im Bank with such documents as promissory notes, evidence of
   the borrower's authority to enter into the loan agreement, a legal
   opinion, an acquisition list of the items to be financed and a copy of
   any necessary authorizations from the authorities in the borrower's
   country. When the borrower has complied with all of these conditions,
   Ex-Im Bank will make the loan available to the borrower.

   Conditions Precedent to the Drawdown of the Loan

   Once the conditions precedent to the availability of the loan have been
   satisfied, the borrower may request a drawdown. The request is made on
   a Request for Disbursement form (a copy of which is attached to the
   loan agreement), which must be accompanied by copies of the paid
   invoices, an Exporter's Certificate (submitted before the first
   disbursement), and copies of the bills of lading. In addition, it is a
   requirement of each drawdown that all exposure and commitment fees and
   other applicable costs and expenses required to be paid have been paid,
   and that the borrower not be in default under the loan agreement.

   Details of the procedures to be followed by the borrower in requesting
   drawdowns are set forth in the loan agreement. Two procedures are
   available to the borrower:

   Reimbursement. The borrower may from time to time request that Ex-Im
   Bank make disbursements to its account in a commercial bank in the U.S.
   as reimbursement for the financed portion of payments the borrower has
   made to the exporter.

   Letter of credit. The borrower may request that a commercial bank in
   the United States acceptable to Ex-Im Bank issue, confirm, or advise
   letters of credit (L/C) in favor of the exporter(s). The L/C bank pays
   the exporter when presented with the documents specified in the letter
   of credit. Ex-Im Bank reimburses the L/C bank for Ex-Im Bank's share of
   such payments.

   Aggregate drawdowns under the agreement cannot exceed the percentage of
   the eligible goods and services specified in the loan agreement and
   financed under the loan.
