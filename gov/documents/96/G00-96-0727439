                               The VOA Charter

   To protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the
   organization's mission, the VOA Charter was drafted in 1960 and later
   signed into law (Public Law 94-350) on July 12, 1976, by President
   Gerald Ford.  It reads:

   The long-range interests of the United States are served by
   communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be
   effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of
   listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America
   (VOA) broadcasts.

     1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative
     source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and
     comprehensive.

     2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American
     society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive
     projection of significant American thought and institutions.

     3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and
     effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and
     opinion on these policies.
