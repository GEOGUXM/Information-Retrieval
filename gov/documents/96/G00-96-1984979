   This is the Web site for the 1999 results from California's
   Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program. These results are
   final.
   At the state level a total of 6.4% (272,935) student records do not
   include a language fluency designation. The scores for those records
   are not included in group summaries for LEP or for non-LEP reports at
   the state, county, district or school levels. The missing scores are
   not evenly distributed across county, district or school reports. The
   reports for "all" students, for economically disadvantaged and not
   economically disadvantaged students, and for males and females,a re not
   affected by the LEP data discrepancies.
   This is the Web site for the 1999 results from California's
   Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program. At this site you
   will find results for the Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition,
   Form T (Stanford 9), the STAR augmentation in English language arts and
   mathematics, and the Spanish Assessment of Basic Education, 2^nd
   Edition (SABE/2).

   The STAR program was authorized by Senate Bill  (SB 376) in October
   1997.  As required by statute, the California State Board of Education
   designated a test, the Stanford 9, in November 1997.  This test was
   first administered statewide in Spring 1998.  The Stanford 9 is a
   multiple-choice test that allows comparisons to be made to a national
   sample of students. School districts in California are required to test
   all students in grades 2 through 11. The only exemptions allowed by SB
   376 are for special education students whose Individual Education Plans
   (IEPs) explicitly exempted them from such testing and for students
   whose parent or guardian submitted a written request for exemption. In
   grades 2 through 8, testing is required in reading, mathematics,
   written expression, and spelling. In grades 9 through 11 testing is
   required in reading, writing, mathematics, science, and history/social
   science.  In 1999, students were tested between March 15 and May 25.

   In 1999 two additions were made to the STAR program.  Test items were
   added in language arts and mathematics in order to create two
   additional tests, the STAR augmentation; and the SABE/2 was designated
   by the State Board of Education for use with Spanish speaking limited
   English proficient students.

   For additional information regarding these three tests, please see More
   About Star.

   STAR Reports

   At this site results are provided by grade level and content area for
   schools, districts, counties, and the state for the Stanford 9, the
   STAR augmentation, and the SABE/2.  Stanford 9 and STAR augmentation
   results (revision posted September 30, 1999) are reported for seven
   groups:
     * all students
     * students who are limited English proficient
     * students who are not limited English proficient
     * males
     * females
     * students who are economically disadvantaged
     * students who are not economically disadvantaged

   SABE/2 results (revision posted September 15, 1999) are reported for:
     * all Spanish speaking limited English proficient students who were
       tested
     * Spanish speaking limited English proficient students enrolled in
       California schools fewer than 12 months

   Stanford 9 scores include: for grades 2 through 8, reading, written
   expression (language), spelling, and mathematics; and for grades 9
   through 11, reading, writing (language), mathematics, science, and
   social science. The STAR augmentation results are reported for grades 2
   through 11, language arts and for grades 2 through 7 and grade 11
   mathematics. For grades 8, 9, and 10, mathematics scores are reported
   at grade 8 for algebra I and 1st  year integrated mathematics; at grade
   9 for geometry and 2nd year integrated mathematics; and at grade 10,
   for algebra II and 3rd year integrated mathematics. These are the
   mathematics courses specified by California's content standards for
   grades 8, 9, and 10. The numbers of students taking the tests, but not
   scores, will be reported at grade 8 for geometry, algebra II, 2nd year
   integrated mathematics and 3rd year integrated mathematics; at grade 9
   for algebra I, 1st year integrated mathematics, algebra II, and 3rd
   year integrated mathematics; and at grade 10, for algebra I, 1st year
   integrated mathematics, geometry, and 2nd year integrated mathematics.
   SABE/2 results are reported for total reading, mathematics, and
   language for grades 2-11, and spelling for grades 2-8.

   No individual student results are provided here.  Individual student
   results are confidential and can be reviewed only by the teacher,
   parent or guardian, and the student. To protect privacy asterisks
   appear in place of test scores wherever those scores are based on 10 or
   fewer students.

   For additional information regarding the types of scores reported,
   comparing 1998 and 1999 test results, understanding and interpreting
   results, and other related information, please see About Scores and
   More About Star.

   Viewing Reports

   To access the STAR reports, click on School, District, County, and
   State Reports for the Stanford 9 and augmented STAR or for SABE/2.
   Follow the directions to retrieve the desired report for the state or a
   specific county, district, or school.  These reports may be printed,
   but may not appear as you see them when printed in standard portrait
   format.  Adjust your print setting to landscape (sideways) mode for
   better results.
