                                  Barriers

Welcome!

   The Prototype Surface Barrier project is managed by the Hydrology
   Group, which is part of the Environmental Technology Division, at
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), located in Richland,
   Washington (see locator map). PNNL is operated for the U.S. Department
   of Energy by Battelle.

   The main function of a surface barrier is to ensure that buried wastes
   are contained and protected from environmental and biotic forces.
   Surface barriers have been identified as a critical component in
   management of buried wastes and other sources of subsurface
   contamination. Barrier technology, particularly for long-term
   deployment, remains largely unproven at the field scale. For this
   reason, the single greatest research and development need related to
   the use of surface barrier technology in managing hazardous wastes is
   to document field performance and case histories.

   A barrier development program was initiated at the Hanford Site in the
   mid-1980s as a result of recommendations from the Final Environmental
   Impact Statement for the Disposal of Hanford Defense High-Level,
   Transuranic, and Tank Wastes. The barrier program was organized to
   develop the technology for permanent, long-term containment of
   near-surface radioactive waste. After nearly 10 years of research, a
   multi-layered earthen barrier was developed and a prototype barrier was
   constructed in 1994 over an existing waste site (crib B-57 in the 200
   BP1-Operable Unit in 200 E Area near the BY tank Farm). Testing for
   complete water balance, including accurately measured drainage from
   cover and sideslopes was started in October 1994 and has been ongoing
   since that time.
