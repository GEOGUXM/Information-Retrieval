   Welcome to my web site.  What to know what I've been up to?  Check out
   my journal page, or you can look at a small article describing my Life
   as an Astronomer.   If you're trying to find me, check my travel
   schedule.

   If you're interested, you can look at my published papers, posters and
   press releases.  Presently I'm located at the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory, where I am working on a variety of astronomical
   interferometers in support of NASA's Origins program.  For zooming
   around the Web, see my list of bookmarks.

   The Keck technical photo album archive is once again available.  A
   directory of my online documents is also available, including current
   research projects.
