   [pizel.gif] BERKELEY, CA Â— Seventy-five meters beneath the surface of a
   site in Idaho where radioactive waste has been stored for more than 40
   years, microorganisms living in the pores and crevices of dry basaltic
   rock are able to reduce a toxic form of chromium to a much less toxic
   form -- and they do so faster in the presence of volatile organic
   wastes.

   Hoi-Ying Holman and her colleagues Dale Perry, Michael Martin, Wayne
   McKinney, and Jennie Hunter-Cevera of the Department of Energy's
   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made the discovery by examining
   core samples from beneath the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at
   DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. By using
   infrared spectromicroscopy at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source
   (ALS), they were able to follow the reduction of toxic metals among
   populations of living organisms on minerals for the first time. The
   researchers will discuss their findings in the forthcoming
   October/November issue of Geomicrobiology Journal.

  SPATIALLY RESOLVED INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY OF A BASALT SURFACE SHOWS A STRONG
 CORRELATION BETWEEN CONCENTRATIONS OF BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES CHARACTERISTIC OF
          MICROBES (TOP) AND PEAK CONCENTRATIONS OF REDUCED CHROMIUM (BELOW).

   "We have shown that organic vapor may accelerate the transformation of
   mobile, toxic chromium pollutants into less mobile, less toxic, stable
   compounds," says Holman, a chemist and engineer with Berkeley Lab's
   Earth Sciences Division and the Center for Environmental Biotechnology
   (CEB). "This should help in the design and implementation of new,
   environmentally benign remediation techniques for cleaning up mixed
   waste sites."

   The Idaho site is polluted with mixtures of hexavalent chromium and
   other inorganic ions, radionuclides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and
   volatile organic compounds. Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) is carcinogenic,
   mutagenic, and highly toxic to living organisms because it occurs in
   soluble chromates that readily cross cell membranes. Once inside the
   cell, these ions are reduced (electrons are added) first to pentavalent
   chromium (Cr5+), then to trivalent chromium (Cr3+), which disrupts DNA
   replication.

   Outside the cell, however, trivalent chromium is much less toxic,
   because it is insoluble and can't cross cell membranes. "Polyvalent
   metal ions at this and other polluted sites are reduced on the surfaces
   of geologic materials -- that's been known for some time," Holman says,
   "but there were two views of how this happens."

   The dry Columbia River basalts are limited in organic carbon and other
   nutrients, Holman says, but dense clusters of microorganisms live in
   the pores and fractures of the rock. "When water infiltrates from rain
   or melting snow, a burst of nutrients reaches them through fissures in
   the rock, and they bloom like flowers in the desert" -- suggesting that
   microbes might play a role in metal-ion reactions.

   It was uncertain which microorganisms might be involved in a biological
   reduction mechanism and what metabolic processes were important,
   however. An alternate, chemical-mechanism hypothesis proposed that
   metal oxides such as iron oxides in basalt could help catalyze
   reductions with no help from living microbes.

   To determine which mechanism was at work, Holman and her colleagues
   obtained basalt core samples beneath the site from the unsaturated rock
   above the water table. From these, Tamas Torok, a CEB microbiologist
   with the Lab's Life Sciences Division, isolated and purified 85 strains
   of microorganisms, many tolerant of hexavalent chromium and able to
   reduce it -- especially in the presence of toluene (C7H8), another of
   the site's contaminants, which is a common product of leaking fuel
   tanks.

   These chemical reactions typically proceeded through one or more steps,
   and many of the organisms encountered bottlenecks that slowed the
   process. One strain of bacteria, Arthrobacter oxydans, emerged as the
   most effective.

   Arthrobacter oxydans tends to concentrate in areas rich in magnetite,
   an iron-oxide compound common in basalt; the researchers had to
   eliminate the possibility that the magnetite itself was responsible for
   the reduction. They tested to see if reactions would proceed on
   sterilized magnetite under realistic environmental conditions: in an
   aerobic atmosphere, at room temperature, and in the dark.

   Arthrobacter oxydans was reintroduced on some of the sterilized
   magnetite samples. Dilute chromate solution was applied to both the
   abiotic (barren) and biotic (inhabited) magnetite samples; in a
   separate set of tests, the samples were also bathed in a tenuous vapor
   of toluene.

   Working on the ALS's infrared beamline over a five-day period, the
   researchers applied Fourier-transform spectromicroscopy to observe the
   steps in the reduction process and the precise location of reduced
   chromium.

   "The infrared is the end of the spectrum not usually associated with
   synchrotrons," says Holman, "but for us it's perfect -- and not only
   because it's nondestructive of organisms. You have an extremely
   complicated spectrum in the ten-micrometer region," which is the
   dimension of the beam. "We identified markers in this spectral region
   that tracked the key compounds that undergo changes. We could resolve
   the spectrum in time, to follow the different steps of the reduction,
   and also in space, to see exactly where the reactions were happening."

   On the samples with no living bacteria, no changes were evident. On
   samples with living Arthrobacter oxydans, in the absence of toluene,
   chromium reduction was weak.

   But where Arthrobacter oxydans had been exposed to toluene, infrared
   spectromicroscopy showed that hexavalent chromium and toluene had been
   replaced by pentavalent chromium and products of hydrocarbon
   degradation, in association with biomolecules -- right where the
   bacteria were concentrated.

   Was this microbial reduction an accurate reflection of what happened at
   the waste site? "We now needed to study natural communities in the
   basalt," Holman says, and to do so she had to devise a unique diamond
   saw that could cut thin slices from fresh basalt cores, slowly, at cool
   temperatures, under aseptic conditions.

   Over a period of four months the slices of native rock, with their
   resident communities of microbes still in place, were exposed to
   solutions of hexavalent chromium and toluene vapor. At first, infrared
   spectromicroscopy showed no evidence of reduction, and it appeared that
   many of the organisms were dying. But after four months,
   chromium-tolerant and chromium-reducing natural microorganisms were
   seen to be thriving -- in association with trivalent chromium.

   Says Holman, "As far as we know, this is the first time that infrared
   synchrotron studies have been used to follow the steps in the
   transformation of toxic chromium on mineral surfaces."

   The Berkeley Lab is a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory
   located in Berkeley, California. It conducts unclassified scientific
   research and is managed by the University of California.
