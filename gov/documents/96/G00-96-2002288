   Frequently Asked Questions

   1. What is CalWORKs?

   The California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)
   is California's welfare reform program. It was created in response to
   federal legislation that totally revised the welfare system, as we knew
   it. With an emphasis on promoting economic self-sufficiency and a
   "work-first" philosophy, CalWORKs revamps the welfare system by
   implementing strict time limits on the collection of public assistance.
   2. As a California employer, why should I hire a welfare recipient?

   There are a number of reasons why hiring a welfare recipient makes good
   business sense. With California facing a tight labor market, welfare
   recipients offer a motivated and committed workforce that can be
   trained for specific industries. In addition, there are tax credits
   available for each eligible job seeker that you hire. The tax credits
   can range up to $8,500 per employee hired. All in all, it makes good
   business sense, because hiring a welfare recipient means investing in
   your company and the community in which you live and work.
   3. I'm a small business owner and I need someone who will be
   dependable. I'm concerned about hiring someone that might not stay with
   the job. Will I be able to depend on the welfare recipient?

   One of the myths about welfare recipients is that they are less
   dependable and consistent in their work habits. This has proven to be
   erroneous. United Airlines looked at the retention rate among its new
   hires and saw that for 760 welfare recipients hired for entry-level
   jobs since the spring of 1997, almost three-quarters were still with
   the company. Among entry-level hires that did not come from the welfare
   rolls, fewer than half remained with the company a year after starting.
   In addition to United, other companies such as UPS have found new hires
   from welfare recipients have outlasted other employees hired by 15
   percent.
   4. How does California's welfare challenge compare to other states?

   As the state with the largest population of welfare recipients, it is
   estimated that California will need to find jobs for 600,000 to 700,000
   welfare recipients. These jobs will need to come from employers, both
   large and small. Providing jobs for welfare recipients who are eager,
   dependable and trainable makes good business sense and good sense for
   our communities.
   5. What are the different tax credits available when you hire a welfare
   recipient?

   Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit
   is available to employers who hire long-term recipients of aid. As long
   as the employee remains on the job for a minimum of 180 days or 400
   hours, the employer can claim 35 percent of the first year of qualified
   wages up to $10,000 (or a tax credit of $3,500); and 50 percent for the
   second year of qualified wages up to $10,000 (or a tax credit of
   $5,000).
   Another tax credit available to employers hiring welfare recipients is
   the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The tax credits available are:
     * Twenty-five percent on the first year of qualified wages up to
       $6,000 (a credit of $1,500) if the individual is retained less than
       400 hours, but at least 120 hours.
     * Forty percent for the employee retained 400 hours (a credit of
       $2,400).

   For qualified summer youth ages 16 through 17 who reside in federally
   designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, the tax credits
   are:
     * Twenty-five percent on the first year of qualified wages up to
       $3,000 (a credit of $750) if the individual is retained less than
       400 hours but at least 120 hours.
     * Forty percent on the first year of qualified wages up to $3,000 (a
       credit of $1,200) if the individual is retained 400 hours.

   6. I'm a business owner who is willing to train workers to do the job.
   Will the government help subsidize on some of my training costs?

   Yes, through your local area agencies, you can find the support you
   need to successfully integrate welfare workers into your workforce. The
   following resources are available to you or your welfare-to-work
   employees:
     * Wage subsidies
     * On-the-job training
     * Job readiness services
     * Job placement services
     * Post-employment services
     * Job retention services
     * Supportive services

   For further information on supportive services contact your local
   welfare offices and Private Industry Councils / Service Delivery Areas.
