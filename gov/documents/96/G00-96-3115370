   Freedom of Information Act

   Like all federal agencies, the Department of Labor (DOL) is required
   under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose records
   requested in writing by any person. However, agencies may withhold
   information pursuant to nine exemptions and three exclusions contained
   in the statute. FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does not
   create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, or by
   state or local government agencies.

   Consult our Guide for Requesting FOIA Records and list of Individual
   Components & Responsible FOIA Officials if you plan to make a FOIA
   request. We also encourage you to browse About DOL, Newsroom, and
   Statistics, Research, & Publications, which contain information already
   available to the public. Below are links to our Department's FOIA
   resources. We have also compiled a listing of other FOIA resources.
