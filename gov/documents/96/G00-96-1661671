King County Solid Waste Disposal Stations

   The King County Solid Waste Disposal stations are locations around King
   County, outside of Seattle, where hauling companies, businesses and
   King County residents dispose of solid waste, yard waste and recyclable
   materials. The transfer stations serve as conduits to gather solid
   waste and separate recyclable materials from general waste before the
   material is transported to the Cedar Hills Landfill.
