   All Former Commission Employees:

   Legislation was recently passed that may be applicable to former
   Commission employees.

   Title III, Section 302 of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000
   (Public Law 106-518) amended Section 996(b) of Title 28, United States
   Code (U.S.C.), subjecting the U.S. Sentencing Commission to the
   provisions under Chapter 63 of Title 5, U.S.C. Chapter 63 authorizes
   the accrual and use of various types of leave by employees in the
   Federal service and covers Commission employees, not including officers
   appointed by the President or intermittent employees who do not have an
   established regular tour of duty. This legislation also contains a
   savings provision that entitles former Commission employees to receive
   credit for sick leave accrued under the Commission's former leave
   system, subject to limitations.

   This sick leave balance can be restored to you in the event that you
   are reappointed to a federal government agency or if you are currently
   employed by another federal agency and covered under the provisions of
   Chapter 63 of Title 5, United States Code.

   If you are a former Commission employee, please call the Office of
   Human Resources at (202) 502-4515 for possible recredit of your sick
   leave. All recredits of sick leave must be supported by documentation
   of your sick leave balance.
