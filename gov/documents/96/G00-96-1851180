   Y2K: The National Pipeline software templates (both attribute and
   metadata templates) have been tested and evaluated for the Windows95,
   Windows98, and WindowsNT environments. They were developed using the
   latest Microsoft development tools (Visual Basic 6.0) including the
   latest Y2K patches. Additionally, we have also tested date entries
   within the software, and have found all aspects to be functional. We
   are confident that both templates are Y2K compliant.

   Download times can vary substantially, depending upon your connection
   speed, Internet traffic and web server activity. The Internet can be
   slow, but once you have downloaded, installation only takes minutes.
   For the available softwares, download times are provided assuming that
   bandwidth is fully available for the specified connection speed.
   Depending on traffic conditions, you may experience slower download
   times. If you experience trouble downloading, please try at a different
   time, as download problems usually relate to heavy internet or server
   traffic.
