      Notes:

      Addresses:
      For clarity, street and mailing addresses are separated by a bullet ().
      Due to the rotational nature of Foreign Service assignments, it is most
      important that correspondence to a Foreign Service post be addressed to
      a section, or position, rather than to an officer by name. This will
      eliminate delays, resulting from the forwarding of official mail to
      personnel who have transferred. For example, correspondence concerning
      commercial matters should be addressed simply "Commercial Section"
      followed by the name and correct mailing address of the post.
      Telephones:
      Country codes in brackets [ ] and city codes in parentheses ( ) must be
      dialed with all telephone and Fax numbers when calling from the United
      States.

        Telephoning a Foreign Service Post:
        Dial international access code + country code + city code + local
        number:
        Example: 011 + [61] + (6) + 2705000.

      Some international calls will require operator assistance because the
      country is not an international direct dial country. The telephone
      listing for these countries will not be preceded by a country code and
      city code (always shown in brackets and parentheses).
