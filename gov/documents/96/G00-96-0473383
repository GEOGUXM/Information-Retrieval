   a cent research at Los Alamos has codified several prop- set of common
   test problems, including the problem erties that help to minimize the
   effects of the viscosity where the previous viscosity fails. The
   research can be away from shock waves; an artificial viscosity was then
   split into two sections: developing the discrete operators developed
   that satisfied these properties and was shown required to calculate the
