   Privacy Statement

   Of the information we learn about you from your visit to "NIH.gov," we
     store only the following: the domain name from which you access the
      Internet, the date and time you access our site, and the Internet
   address of the web site from which you direct-linked to our site. This
    information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various
      sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to
     visitors. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional
                  information will be collected about you.

   When inquiries are E-mailed to us, we store the question and the E-mail
      address information so that we can respond electronically. Unless
    otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends
    questions or comments to our web site. We will not obtain information
   that will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our site,
             unless you chose to provide such information to us.

                               About "Cookies"
    While visiting sites within the NIH.GOV domain, you may occasionally
     encounter a Web page that employs cookies. A cookie is a small file
     that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our
   server to "remember" specific information about your session while you
                               are connected.

   Requests to send cookies from NIH Web pages are not designed to collect
      information about you, but only about your browser "session." The
   cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of these Web
      pages. The cookie and the information about your session will be
   destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browser--it is not
         permanently stored on your computer. Unless an NIH web page
    specifically notifies you otherwise, we will not collect and maintain
                       personal information about you.

   To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after
       you have finished conducting business with a Web site that uses
    cookies. If you are concerned about the potential use of information
     gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to
     prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have
            settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies.

   Questions about NIH privacy policies should be sent to the NIH Privacy
                                Act Officer.
