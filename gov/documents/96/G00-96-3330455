   CASE INFORMATION

   U.S. Court of Appeals
     * Internet Access to Dockets via PACER

     * PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) provides public
       access to D.C. Circuit docket sheets through the court's Internet
       site in a web-based format. Docket sheets provide case information
       as of the previous day. There is an access fee of $.07 per page for
       access to PACER. Contact the PACER Service Center to set up an
       account.


     Orders and Judgments via PACER
     * With the exception of orders filed under seal and some scheduling
       orders generated by the Court's docketing system, all orders and
       judgments, including Clerk's orders, issued on or after June 1,
       2001, are now available via PACER.  A small "image" icon appears
       next to the docket entry for any order or judgment that can be
       viewed online. The date of issuance is also a link to the image
       file (in PDF format).  Search capabilities will be available at a
       later date.  A PACER account is required (available from the PACER
       Service Center), and the usual $ .07 per page PACER fee applies
       (published opinions remain available without charge). (7/01)

     * Recent opinions may be searched by date of issue or you may search
       the full text of opinions.


     Internet Access to the U.S. Party/Case Index
     * The U.S. Party/Case Index is a national index to federal cases,
       maintained as part of the PACER Service Center.  The Index is
       searchable by party name, and search results show party name, case
       number, the court where the case was filed, and the filing date
       [more info ...].


     Telephone Access using AVIS
     * The Appellate Voice Information System (AVIS) is an automated voice
       response system which provides case information in response to
       touch-tone telephone inquiries. Callers receive up-to-date docket
       information including the parties names; opening and closing dates;
       judgments and mandates issuance dates; and oral argument dates,
       times and panels.  AVIS can be accessed by dialing 1-800-552-8261

     Bulletin Board Access using ABBS
     * The Appellate Bulletin Board Service (ABBS) is a nationally
       standard electronic bulletin board which provides public access to
       D.C. Circuit opinions and docket sheets. These materials can be
       viewed on-line or downloaded to your local PC. Most items are
       available in both WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII formats. Opinions are
       added to ABBS shortly after they become available to the public,
       generally 10:00 a.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. Docket sheets provide
       case information as of the previous day.
     * ABBS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Access is on a
       first come - first served basis. Each user is limited to 15
       minutes. ABBS users need a computer or terminal, a modem, and

       protocol in order to access the system. Terminal emulation of vt100
       is recommended for best results and the communications software
       should be configured for full duplex, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and
       no parity.
     * There is a 60Â¢ per minute charge to access ABBS. Contact the PACER
       Service Center to set up an account. Once a user id and password
