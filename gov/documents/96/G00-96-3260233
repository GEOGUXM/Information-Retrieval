Supplemental Appropriations Request

   Supplemental Appropriations Request (139k)  This reflects the

   It includes the Department of Energy as well as other executive
   agencies.

   DOE Justifications (373k)  This contains the supporting justification
   materials for DOE's portion of the supplemental.

Summary Budget Documents

   the Department's budget request.

   Performance Plan (1.4M)  The plan reflects the Department's proposed
   performance goals for FY 2001, as well as the goals for FY 2000.

   Summary Table (21k)  This is a short tabular summarization of the
   request by appropriation account, business line, and first-tier
   organization.

   Control Table  This is a somewhat longer tabular summarization of the
   request at the level we call decision units. It is available in
   appropriation (85k) account or first tier organization (93k) order.

   Statistical Table (145k)  This table shows the budget request at the
   level at which Congress controls our spending. In most areas, it is

   summarization by decision unit broken out by the various laboratories
   at which DOE does work.

   State Table (346k) (preliminary)  The state table is similar to the
   lab table, except it is broken out by each state in which DOE does
   work, rather than by laboratory.

Detailed Budget Justifications

   Due to the large overall size of these files, they are broken into
   somewhat more bite size pieces. Select the piece you are interested in
   from the list below.

   Note: Where large appropriation accounts are broken into subsections
   below (Energy Supply, Science, Weapons Activities, etc.), there are
   links within the PDF files connecting the sections together. Under some
   combinations of browser and acrobat reader versions, we have found that
   these links do not work. If you receive a 404 File Not Found error
   message, try hitting the back button on the browser and trying again.
