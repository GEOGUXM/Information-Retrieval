   CTEP sponsors many of the clinical trials involving novel anticancer
   agents, and provides the support for development of these agents.
   However, CTEP is not involved with direct patient care. The Cancer
   Centers and Cooperative groups are designed and equipped to provide
   quality direct care for patients on clinical trials protocols.

   If you are interested in potentially participating in a clinical trial,
   contact your personal physician. Have your physician contact the
   nearest Cancer Center or Cooperative Group for more information about
   the possibility of entering an appropriate clinical trial.

   Complete information on current clinical trials can be obtained through
   the PDQ Database, as well as through the clinical trials-related links
   below. In addition, we have provided some links to selected General
