                              National Strategy

     The January 7, 2000 version of the National Plan for Information
     System Protection, Version 1.0 (National Plan), is the first attempt
     of the U.S. Government to develop a plan to defend its cyberspace.
     America is vulnerable to cyber attacks because it has become
     dependent upon computer networks for many essential services,
     including water, electricity, gas, voice and data communications,
     rail and aviation.

     The first version of the National Plan focuses on the efforts being
     undertaken by the Federal government to protect the Nation's
     critical cyber-based infrastructures. Subsequent versions of the
     National Plan will incorporate a broader range of concerns,
     including the specific roles that industry and state and local
     governments will play in protecting privately owned infrastructures.
