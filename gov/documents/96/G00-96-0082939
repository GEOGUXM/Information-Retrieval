Vendor Registration

   Before registering as a new vendor, please be sure to check the
   Registered Companies List to see if your company has already been
   registered in the Buy Accessible database. If you cannot find your
   company name in the dropdown list of vendors, you will be able to add
   your company as a new vendor in the Buy Accessible database.

   If your company is already listed as a vendor, your registration to be
   added as a new user will automatically be forwarded to the designated
   primary "Buy Accessible" administrator in your company. It is then up
   to the primary administrator to verify your information and decide
   whether or not you will be given access to add products to your
   company's profile. Your companies primary administrator name is
   included in the return email confirmation you receive after you
   register. Because your company profile information is maintained by
   your company's primary administrator, our web team cannot determine the
   length of time it will take to process your registration request.
   However, if you have not received notice of a status decision within 48
   business hours, please email buy.accessible@gsa.gov with your
   information.

   If your company is not listed and you proceed to register your company,
   you will be automatically assigned as the primary administrator for
   your business. As primary administrator, you have the option to update
   and maintain the information that you provide in your Buy Accessible
   company profile.
