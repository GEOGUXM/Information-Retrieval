Summary

   Programs can be executed both interactively and in batch mode on NERSC
   computers. Interactive computing is used primarily to test and debug
   programs. Use of the batch system allows the most efficient and fairest
   use of system resources.

   Quotas on system resources - such as memory, disk space and CPU runtime
   - are applied to individual users and their jobs. The quotas are set to
   higher values for batch jobs in order to accommodate production runs.
