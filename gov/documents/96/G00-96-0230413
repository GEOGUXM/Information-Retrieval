                                               Drug-Induced Liver Toxicity

   Serious harm to the liver caused by drugs, and by the combination of
   drugs and other substances is an important public health problem. As
   Americans ingest combinations of prescription and over-the-counter
   drugs, herbal remedies, dietary supplements and alcohol, the
   possibilities for harm and liver injury increases. Many of these
   products are chemicals that are processed and detoxified by the liver.
   These chemical processes may produce substances that injure liver cells
   in some people and result in impaired liver functioning.

   Although such adverse reactions are uncommon, they may be very serious
   and cause the sudden onset of liver failure or even death. Among
   patients with acute liver failure evaluated at liver transplantation
   centers in the United States, ingestion of drugs has become the leading
   cause for liver failure, exceeding all other causes combined. Serious
   drug-induced liver injury is also the leading single cause for
   withdrawal of drugs from the market.

   This  web site includes the study documents, program, and presentations
   made at the conference "Drug-Induced Liver Disease: A National and
   Global Problem",  held February 12-13, 2001, in Chantilly VA. The
   conference was co-sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
   the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), and
   academic consultants in liver disease represented by the American
   Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).

   Organizing and presenting this conference was not intended as an end in
   itself. It was meant to initiate in the public arena  continuing
   cooperative efforts to identify and define the issues, to develop and
   agree upon research agendas, and to educate physicians and patients.
   Future postings at this web page includes presenting results of the
   workshop discussion groups, and proposing  research and educational
   work to be done.
