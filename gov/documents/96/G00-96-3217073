   The mission of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service is
   to provide highly-trained and mobile health professionals who carry out
   programs to promote the health of the Nation. Health Services Officers
   must understand and prevent disease and injury, assure safe and
   effective drugs and medical devices, deliver health services to
   underserved populations, and furnish health expertise in time of war or
   other national or international emergencies.
   Health Services Officers are an important component of the USPHS
   Commissioned Corps. Approximately ten percent of all commissioned
   officers are HSOs, serving in all agencies of the USPHS, including the
   Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services
   Administration (HRSA), Indian Health Service (IHS), Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH),
   Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Agency of
   Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), Substance Abuse and Mental
   Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Office of the
   Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). Many HSOs serve in other Federal
   agencies such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), U.S.
   Coast Guard (CG), Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP),Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),
   Agency for International Development(AID), and State Department.
   HSOs hold over fifty types of qualifying degrees from accredited
   clinical, scientific, technical, and administrative programs.
   Professionals from the Health Services category provide a wide variety
   of professional skills and training to accomplish the mission of the
   USPHS. Disciplines represented within the Health Services category
   include the biological, physical, environmental and social sciences,
   optometry, social work, podiatry, medical technology, dental hygiene,
   medical records administration, physician assistant, computer science,
   health education, healthcare administration, and other public health
   specialties.
