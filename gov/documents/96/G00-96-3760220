                          TPSX Updates and Patches
   _______________________________________________________________________

   The TPSX database is continually being updated, expanded and corrected.
   As the database is changed, the new files will be made available here
   for download. Please check this page at least once a month for new
   updates.

   Instructions:
    1. Download the latest update file
    2. Copy it to your TPSX subdirectory (e.g., "C:\TPSX", or "C:\Program
       Files\TPSX")
    3. Exit the TPSX program if it is running
    4. Execute the self extracting update file from a DOS prompt or from
       the Windows "File Run..." menu
    5. Answer "YES" to overwrite the older files
    6. That will complete the update

   You must be a registered TPSX user with a valid Registration Name and
