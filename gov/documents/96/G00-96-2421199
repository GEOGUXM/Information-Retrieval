   Welcome Banner

     This site is the product of collaboration between the Office of High
     Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) and the NOAA Central
     Library.

     Principal developers are Janet Ward of HPCC and Skip Theberge of the
     NOAA Central Library.

     Janet Ward -- Site concept, graphics and computer artwork, software
     development, and system integration.

     Skip Theberge -- Collection development, site content, image
     digitization, and database construction.

     Sarmah Sarnor (HPCC) -- HTML page construction

     Carla Wallace (NOAA Central Library) -- Interaction with public,
     hard copy distribution and archival.

     Without the generosity and cooperation of many photographers working
     throughout NOAA, members of other government agencies, and private
     citizens who have given access to their collections, this site would
     not be possible. Visit "Meet the Photographers" to be introduced to
     these talented and public-spirited individuals.
