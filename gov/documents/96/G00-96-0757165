   Summary of another Web site


   Freshwater flow and salinity in the Delta, in San Francisco Bay, and in
   the ocean near the Golden Gate, vary considerably from year to year.
   Movies illustrate the large-scale, long term climate forces causing
   these variations.
     * The hydroclimatology movies show:
          + weather maps;
          + daily precipitation totals;
          + daily freshwater flows from the Delta to San Francisco Bay;
            and
          + daily temperatures.

     * The salinity movies show:
          + maps of average salinity in the Delta, San Francisco Bay, and
            Golden Gate; and
          + daily freshwater flows from the Delta to San Francisco Bay.
     * Movies are available for each year from 1981 to 1995, including
       several El Ni単o and La Ni単a seasons.
