             The second United States Microgravity Laboratory (USML-2)
             Spacelab mission will be the prime payload on STS-73. The 16-day
             flight will continue a cooperative effort of the U.S.
             government, universities and industry to push back the frontiers
             of science and technology in "microgravity", the near-weightless
             environment of space.

             Some of the experiments being carried on the USML-2 payload were
             suggested by the results of the first USML mission that flew
             aboard Columbia in 1992 during STS-50. The USML-1 mission
             provided new insights into theoretical models of fluid physics,
             the role of gravity in combustion and flame spreading, and how
             gravity affects the formation of semiconductor crystals. Data
             collected from several protein crystals grown on USML-1 have
             enabled scientists to determine the molecular structures of
             those proteins.

             USML-2 builds on that foundation. Technical knowledge gained has
             been incorporated into the mission plan to enhance procedures
             and operations. Where possible, experiment teams have refined
             their hardware to increase scientific understanding of basic
             physical processes on Earth and in space, as well as to prepare
             for more advanced operations aboard the international Space
             Station and other future space programs.

   Launch:

             Friday, October 20, 1995 at 9:53:00 a.m. EDT. Launch window was
             2 hours 30 min. The countdown clock picked up at 7:30pm at the
             T-11 hour mark with a scheduled T-0 at 9:50 a.m. Loading of fuel
             was completed at 3:53am. The crew suited up at 6:00am and
             traveled out to Launch Pad LC-39B. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             10/18/1995).

             At the post-launch press conference, Jim Harrington, Director of
             Shuttle Operations mentioned the launch countdown went
             relatively smoothly. At the beginning of the count there was a
             problem with one of 3 redundant sensors on Liquid Oxygen (LOX)
             portion of the External Tank toggling from wet to dry. The
             sensor was bypassed. After tanking, one of the relief valves in
             the LOX storage area had a slow leak internally that will be
             fixed during ground operations. There was also a fire alarm that
             went off accidently at the 155ft level during the later part of
             the count while the close out crew was still on the pad. No fire
             was detected. Also, a right hand mid joint heater trimmed down
             and the launch team switched over to the backup system. Finally,
             the range command destruct system lost communications between
             the ROCC and the antenna. A contingency plan was work and the
             count was picked back up.
             The launch scheduled for October 15 10:46 a.m EDT was scrubbed
             at 1:25pm EDT due to weather conditions at KSC that were
             unacceptabledue for launch. Due to the scheduled launch of the
             Atlas launch vehicle on Tuesday morning (10/17/95), the next
             available time frame in which Columbia could have been launched
             was Thursday, Oct. 19 at 9:49 a.m. EDT. Bad weather delayed the
             Atlas launch which slipped the launch of Columbia till Friday.
             The launch window extended until 12:19 p.m. that day. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 10/16/1995). Fueling operations had started
             around 1:20 a.m. EDT with the loading of 1/2 million gallons of
             liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the External Tank and
             were completed at 4:03am. Since the available launch period
             extended to 1:35 p.m. EDT based on the Transoceanic Abort
             Landing (TAL) lighting conditions at Ben Guerir, Morocco the
             crew was boarded one hour later than planned to provide a
             increased opportunity for favorable weather towards the end of
             the launch window. They departed the Operations and Checkout
             Building (O&C) at 7:20am EDT.

             On 10/14/95, the Mission Management Team closed the two open
             issues with flight hardware which caused a one day postponement
             of the launch of Columbia on Mission STS-73. The issue with a
             duct on the main engines was resolved by technicians taking
             ultrasonic measurements of the duct to verify adequate wall
             thickness. That work along with additional data analysis have
             allowed engine managers to conclude that there are 3 good SSMEs
             on Columbia. The issue with a General Purpose Computer (GPC) was
             resolved by removing and replacing the suspect unit. The new GPC
             installed in Columbia has been tested and approved for flight
             support. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/14/1995).

             On 10/13/95, NASA managers postponed the launch of Space Shuttle
             Columbia on Mission STS-73 to 10/15/95 in order to work an issue
             with the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and another with the
             orbiter's onboard computer (GPC). The issue with the Shuttle
             main engines involves inspection work that is required because
             of a crack found in a high pressure oxidizer duct on a main
             engine (SSME SN# 2015) being tested at the Stennis Space Center
             in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi on 10/11/95. Inspection of the
             failed duct indicates the crack happened in a weld area and was
             due to the duct wall being too thin. The work on Columbia
             involves ultrasonic inspection of the welds on each engine's
             high pressure oxidizer duct to ensure proper wall thickness.
             There are seven different welds on each engine duct.

             A separate issue was worked by the launch team with one of
             Columbia's General Purpose Computers (GPC). During prelaunch
             testing, the ground crew noticed an unusual response in the data
             transmission between the GPC and associated electronics
             hardware.

             The launch scheduled for Saturday, 10/7/95 at 9:41am EDT was
             scrubbed at 10:05am EDT ( T-minus 20 minute mark ) by KSC Launch
             Director Jim Harrington and the Mission Management Team due to a
             problem with one of Columbia's two Master Events Controllers
             (MEC). The MECs control all critical functions that occur on the
             Shuttle at T-0 and through flight, including routing commands
             from the Shuttle s onboard computers to fire the explosive bolts
             that hold the solid rocket boosters to the Mobile Launch
             Platform (MLP) and the pyrotechnics that separate the boosters
             from the external tank during flight. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 10/07/1995).

             The countdown had started and proceeded with little difficulty.
             During tanking operations, the only minor problem was an
             overvoltage failure of a ground pump (Primary Pump 126). Tanking
             was picked up using the backup pump 127 and the count proceeded
             normally. The flight crew had departed the Operations and
             Checkout Building for Pad 39-B at 6:25am EDT and was onboard
             Columbia. At 8:56am (T-minus 29 minute mark), the launch team
             called a Launch Commit Criteria violation due to a failed self
             test on B-Core (Port 1, bit 5) of Columbia's Master Events
             Controller #1. The four cores are all redundant allowing the
             Shuttle quad-redundancy. Launch commit criteria rules require
             all four cores to be operating properly for safe flight. The
             launch countdown was placed on hold at the T-minus 20 minute
             mark while commands were issued to determine if the problem was
             with the controller or with instrumentation. It was determined
             the problem was with the controller which will need to be
             replaced.

             At this time, the external tank will be drained and purged, the
             Rotating Service Structure (RSS) moved back around the vehicle
             and preparations made to gain access to the aft engine
             compartment to remove and replace the MEC. The MEC is scheduled
             to be removed on Monday 10/9/95 and the replacement MEC tested
             on Tuesday 10/10/95. Some of the experiments in the USML-2
             spacelab module must be serviced before another launch attempt
             can be made and the onboard cryogenic tanks must be off-loaded
             and then re-loaded with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen
             reactants.

             The launch on 10/6/95 was scrubbed at 3:33am for a minimum of 24
             hours due to a problem in the orbiters #1 hydraulic system which
             services Columbia's nose wheel steering system. On 10/6/95,
             during pre-launch checkout, engineers noticed a problem with the
             volume of hydraulic fluid in the system. They will cycle the
             hydraulic system's fill and dump valve and run a compressibility
             test. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/06/1995).

             The launch scheduled for 10/5/95 was posponed 24 hours due to
             bad weather from Hurricane Opal. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             10/05/1995) The launch attempt of Columbia on September 28, 1995
             at 9:35 a.m was scrubbed due to indications of a hydrogen leak
             in Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) #1 (SN#-2037) . The scrub
             was called at 4 a.m. on 9/28/95. The hydrogen main fuel valve
             needed to be replaced which delayed the launch approximately one
             week. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/28/1995).

             During the launch postponement press conference, Jim Harrington,
             KSC Launch Director and John Plowden, Rocketdyne Site Director
             reported that Tanking operations had begun approximately an hour
             later than planned primarily due to lightning in the area of the
             launch pad. Liquid hydrogen was in recirculation for about 30
             minutes and the main fuel valve had begun to chill down. When it
             reached the temperature of -10F degrees the valve started to
             leak. Tanking operations were stopped when the temperature on
             the valve reached the Launch Commit Criteria cuttoff limit of
             -250F degrees at the downstream side of the valve. Normal
             temperature on the valve runs at -100F to -150F degrees.

             This would have been the first launch of SSME engine SN#-2037
             and the failed valve but it had been thru 7 static firings
             during ground tests. The engine and valve were last tested at
             cryogenic temperatures during hot firing June 15, 1995 at
             Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. A failure of this nature
             has occured only once before during the STS-2 tanking test. That
             failure was due to metallic contamination in the downstream seal
             of the valve. The valve is accessable via the AFT engine
             compartment. It weighs about 75 pounds with a flow path of 2.5
             inches. It will be replaced at the pad. The bad valve will be
             sent back to the Rocketdyne factory in California for testing.

             The launch countdown had begun at 4am on Monday, September 25,
             1995 and the crew arrived at the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility
             (SLF) at 8:20 a.m. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/25/1995).

             RTV backfilling for both solid rocket boosters of Space Shuttle
             Columbia was performed on 9/5/95. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             9/05/1995). Earlier, on 8/8/95, engineering analysis indicated
             that the No. 2 main engine on Columbia was unacceptable for
             flight and was removed and replaced with an engine originally
             slated to fly on mission STS-74. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             8/08/1995). The replacement engine does not have a block one
             liquid oxygen pump. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 8/15/1995).

             Wheels stop at 6:46:16 EST (MET 15days 21hr 53min 16sec).

             Two landing opportunities were possible for a landing on
             11/5/95.. Columbia took the first opportunity which began with a
             deorbit engine firing by Columbia at 5:46 a.m. EST, on the
             mission's 255th orbit, leading to a touchdown at the Kennedy
             Space Center.at 6:45 a.m. EST. The second opportunity would have
             begun with a deorbit burn at 7:20 a.m. EST on orbit 256 leading
             to a 8:19 a.m. EST touchdown. Mission duration was 17hours short
             of the existing shuttle record set by Endeavour.

   Mission Highlights:

             The seven-member crew will work in two 12-hour shifts, for 16
             days conducting 14 major experiments and a variety of other
             medical and engineering investigations. The experiments are part
             of the planned operations of the United States Microgravity
