                         LANSCE Neutron EDM Experiment

   The LANSCE experiment to search for the EDM of the neutron proposes a
   sensitivity of 4 x 10**-28 e-cm. It uses the cold neutron beam from a
   coupled liquid hydrogen moderator and a 10-cm x 10-cm supermirror guide
   to illuminate a superthermal 4He source. Systematic errors are
   suppressed by the addition of trace amounts of 3He as a magnetometer.
