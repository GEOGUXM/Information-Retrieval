   U.S. Coastal Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise
   This project, within the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program's
   National Assessment, seeks to objectively determine the relative risks
   due to future sea-level rise for the U.S. Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf
   of Mexico coasts. Through

   the use of a coastal vulnerability index, or CVI, the relative risk
   that physical changes will occur as sea-level rises is quantified based
   on the following criteria: tidal range, wave height, coastal slope,
   shoreline change, geomorphology, and historical rate of relative
   sea-level rise.
   This approach combines a coastal system's susceptibility to change with
   its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, and
   yields a relative measure of the system's natural vulnerability to the
   effects of sea-level rise.
