         The airplanes and helicopters of the Aircraft Operations Center
   (AOC) are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global
   environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's
   environment.

         NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around
   the world; over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic
   pack ice. These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne
   platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data
   essential to their research.

                                 AOC people

                      On behalf of all the employees of
                        the NOAA Aircraft Operations
                       Center, welcome to the cutting
                          edge of weather research

         NOAA demonstrates a challenging and multi-disciplinary approach
   to meeting the responsibilities as the "Earth Systems Agency". The
   Aircraft Operations Center provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and
   professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever
   they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain,
   assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion,
   investigating oil spills, flight checking aeronautical charts, or
   improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to
   operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.
