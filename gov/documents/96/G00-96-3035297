     The Healthcare Information Division (HID), a division of the Office
     of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), collects and
     disseminates data from licensed health facilities in California and
     acts as a clearinghouse for information on healthcare cost, quality
     and access.

     collection of emergency department and ambulatory surgery data.
