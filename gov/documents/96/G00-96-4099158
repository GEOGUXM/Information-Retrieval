        river with a moderate current. The ramp grade becomes steeper at the
        river bank into the water. The approach to the ramp is narrow. No
        designated disabled parking. This site is primarily used for river
        rafting take outs, but the ramp can accommodate motor boat launching
        and loading. However, the steep grade at, and below the waterline,
        may give trailerable boats difficulty.
