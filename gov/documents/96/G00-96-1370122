                         ABOUT THE TARTARUS DATABASE
     __________________________________________________________________

   The TARTARUS database contains the output of a standard processing of
   ASCA observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The products include
   images, light curves and spectra and are available as gzipped files,
   mainly in fits format, collected into a tar archive. Currently, these
   tar files are ordered by ASCA sequence (processing) number and are
   available here.
   More detailed information regarding tartarus and the processing can be
   found below.
