   specific projects, for summer research in a NASA-university cooperative
   program. Fellows will conduct projects of mutual interest to the fellow
   and GSFC. Each fellow will work with a Center colleague and will be
   associated directly with the aeronautics and space program and the
   concomitant basic research problems. Special courses, seminars,
   workshops, lectures, and the like are included in each cooperative
   program. Fellows may be invited to reapply for a second summer. The
   selectees include teaching or research faculty, preferably with a
   minimum of 2 year's teaching experience. Fellows are encouraged to
   continue their research when they return to their universities, to
   include space research concepts in their courses and also to encourage
   their students to become involved in space research. The program is
   operated in collaboration with the American Society for Engineering
   Education (ASEE).
