   In July 2000, the Presidio Trust began a public process to plan for the
   Presidio's future. This web site provides information and resources
   that will help you participate in this important effort.

                                 PTIP UPDATE

   The three month public comment period for the Draft Presidio Trust
   Implementation Plan (PTIP) and Draft Environmental Impact Statement
   (EIS) closed on Thursday, October 25, 2001. The Trust received 90 oral
   comments at public hearings and more than 3,500 letters. These comments
   are available for review in the Presidio Trust Library, 34 Graham
   Street, on the Main Post.

   The Trust will take the next several months to assess the comments,
   prepare responses, and modify the documents. We anticipate that a final
   plan will be published in the spring of 2002.

   We express our thanks to the community for your participation in this
   process, and for the thoughtful opinions expressed.
