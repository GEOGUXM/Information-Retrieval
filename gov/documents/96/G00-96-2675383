   ProjectTitle: Hermetic Packages and Feedthroughs for Neural Prostheses,
   1997

                               WORK STATEMENT

   ARTICLE C.1 BACKGROUND

   The Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP) of the National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supports the development of
   implants for the purpose of forming in-going and out-going connections
   with the nervous system. Such implants are needed for the development
   of neural prostheses for individuals with sensory and motor
   disabilities. The implanted elements of these prostheses include
   electrodes that interface with the biological tissue, a power and
   telemetry receiver, control electronics, and a biocompatible package
   for the implanted electronics. The development of a microsized,
   biocompatible package for neural prosthetic implants is the focus of
   this work.

   Implanted electronic circuitry must function reliably for the lifetime
   of the recipient. Experience in the pacemaker industry suggests that
   hermetic packaging of electronic components is needed to achieve such
   reliability. The goal of this project is to develop hermetic packaging
   techniques that can be used to protect the electronic circuitry needed
   for telemetry and powering of microelectrodes, as might be used in the
   central nervous system, and macroelectrodes, such as cuff or
   intramuscular electrodes for peripheral prostheses. Compared to cardiac
   pacemakers, the required packages are 100 to 1,000 times smaller in
   volume and require a greater number of feedthroughs.

   Research has demonstrated that feedthroughs can be fabricated on planar
   silicon substrates at a linear density of a feedthrough every 4 microns
   using batch fabrication techniques. Several of these feedthroughs can
   be tied in parallel if a low resistance path is required. A glass
   capsule has been anodically bonded to the silicon base to produce a
   microhermetic package. In-vitro testing of these packages at
   accelerated temperatures suggests that they will function reliably at
   body temperature for over 40 years.

   Hermetic packages for specific neural prosthesis applications will now
   be designed and developed. The mean-time-to-failure for the packages
   will be determined by means of accelerated testing. In-vivo testing of
   the packages will also be conducted using hermetic packages that
   include a telemetry system and moisture sensors to permit monitoring of
   package integrity in an animal model. Based on the results of
   accelerated and in-vivo testing, failure mechanisms for hermetic seals
   will be studied. New materials and process methods will be devised to
   eliminate these failures. The investigators will also cooperate with
   other neural prosthesis investigators to develop complete implant
   systems for specific applications utilizing either micro or
   macroelectrodes.

   This Request for Proposals represents a competitive renewal of an
   ongoing research contract (N01 NS4-2319, The University of Michigan).

   ARTICLE C.2. STATEMENT OF WORK

   Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to develop and demonstrate the reliability
   of implantable, microsized, hermetic packages and feedthroughs for use
   in neural prostheses.

   Specifically, the contractor shall:

   A. Develop a microsized hermetic package with multiple feedthroughs for
       use with implantable micro and/or macroelectrodes.

   1. The packaging method shall be compatible with package volumes
       ranging from 10 to 100 cubic millimeters.
       2. The package sealing techniques shall not harm electronic
       components that cannot tolerate temperatures greater than 360
       degrees C.
       3. At least 12 feedthroughs on a pitch of 125 microns or less shall
       be provided.
       4. Feedthrough terminations shall be suitable for making
       connections to integrated and discrete microelectrodes utilizing
       wirebonding or other techniques.
       5. Strain relief of wires as they leave the package shall be
       incorporated into the package design.
       6. The package shall permit coupling of power and information to
       the implant by an electromagnetic link.
       7. The package design shall incorporate remote monitoring of
       package integrity by electronic or other means.
       8. The packaging method shall be compatible with volume production.
       9. Consideration shall be given to including a micromachined
       microelectrode as an integral part of the package.

   B. Develop a telemetry system that permits remote monitoring of the
   internal package humidity in implants in unrestrained animals.

   C. Test the package and feedthroughs by accelerated in-vitro testing
   and also by in-vivo testing in a nonprimate animal model for at least 1
   year.

   D Based on the testing results redesign the package as needed to
   eliminate failure modes.

   E. Identify a collaborating group involved in chronic stimulating or
   recording in the central or peripheral nervous system and cooperate
   with them in the development of a suitable microhermetic package and
   the supporting electronics needed to provide chronic in-going or
   out-going connections.
