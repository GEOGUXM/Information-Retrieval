                               Constituent Feedback

        With the growing use of the Internet, more and more people can carry
        on almost real-time communications with others around the world.
        While this has its distinct benefits, it also carries some potential
        pitfalls, including spamming, or the use of e-mail to deluge users
        with junk mail or electronic advertising. With this in mind, I
        decided that it was important that constituents be able to contact
        me electronically, so I have set up this Feedback form on my Web
        page. This allows the same, near instantaneous communication as
        e-mail while helping to ensure that constituents are served first
        and that junk mail is filtered out.
