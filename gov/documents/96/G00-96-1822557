   OLYMPIA - The Puyallup Rose Society has been honored by the House of
   Representatives in a resolution sponsored by Reps. Sarah Casada and
   Dave Morell, both Republican legislators from Puyallup. House
   Resolution 4685 passed the House unanimously.

   "For the past decade, the Puyallup Rose Society has been an important
   part of our community," said Casada. "And I am sure this is just the
   first of many decades to come for this outstanding civic organization."

   "We have people who travel great distances to be a part of our rose
   society," commented Morell. "With over 300 members, they make a
   valuable contribution to our community by preserving the history of the
   rose and sharing with all of us their respect and appreciation for rose
   culture."

   Morell noted that the non-profit Puyallup Rose Society is one of nearly
   400 local chapters and affiliates of the American Rose Society, both
   dedicated to the cultivation and enjoyment of roses.

   "Society members are mostly home gardeners who find great enjoyment in
   growing roses," Casada explained. "Their knowledge and appreciation of
   rose culture is immense."
