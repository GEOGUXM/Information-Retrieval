   Software Descriptions
   dco.wk1 is a spreadsheet for calculating recombination frequencies and
   detecting associations of markers or genes in a segregating haploid
   population based on double crossover events. DCO originally was written
   in Lotus-123 for DOS but works well in Windows versions. (Skinner, D.
   Z. and Leong, S. A. 1990. A Lotus 1-2-3 macro system to analyze
   segregation data of haploids. Fung. Genet. Newslet. 37:40. )
   sco.wk1 is a spreadsheet for calculating recombination frequencies and
   detecting associations of markers or genes in a segregating haploid
   population based on single crossover events. SCO originally was written
   in Lotus-123 for DOS but works well in Widows versions. (Skinner, D. Z.
   and Leong, S. A. 1990. A Lotus 1-2-3 macro system to analyze
   segregation data of haploids. Fung. Genet. Newslet. 37:40. )
   dco.sco.info.txt Is an instruction file for dco.wk1 and sco.wk1.
   gda.bas is a BASIC program that carries out a General Diallel Analysis.
   The program combines analysis techniques of several published methods
   to provide an extensive analysis. (Skinner, D. Z. and Stuteville, D. L.
   1988. GDA: A computer program to analyze a diallel cross of homozygous
   or heterozygous parents. J. Hered. 79:215-216. )
   gdainfo.txt is the instruction manual for GDA.
