                           Design & Analysis Tools

   The Icing Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center has a comprehensive,
   multi-disciplinary research effort aimed at development of Design and
   Analysis Tools that can aid aircraft manufacturers, sub system
   manufacturers, certification authorities, the military, and other
   government agencies in assessing the behavior of aircraft systems in an
   icing environment. These tools consist of computational and
   experimental simulation methods that are validated, robust, and well
   documented. In addition, these tools are supported through the creation
   of extensive databases used for validation, correlation, and
   similitude.

                           Tools and Methods chart

   1. Computational Tools
    Goal: To develop validated tools for predicting ice growth, ice
   protection system behavior, and the effects of ice contamination for
   design, analysis, and certification.
    Approach: To improve current ice accretion and ice protection system
   prediction methods to allow use of codes for design and certification
   over a broad range of icing conditions, aircraft geometries, and flow
   conditions. This approach also ensures that codes are accurate, robust,
   fast, and easy to use.
   2. Experimental Methods
    Goals: To develop experimental methods for simulating the elements of
   an icing encounter and to develop test techniques for use in icing
   research and certification.
    Approach: Improve current capabilities and develop innovative methods
   to quantify ice feature characteristics, measure the effects of iced
   aircraft performance, evaluate ice protection system behavior, and
   improve knowledge of ice accretion physics.
   3. Experimental Databases
    Goals: To develop databases for use in code validation, aircraft
   response modeling, facilities development, and similitude analysis for
   aircraft design.
    Approach: To create "benchmark" quality public databases, evaluate
   ice protection sysem behavior, measure the effects of ice on aircraft
   performance, improve knowledge on natural ice growth, extend current
   icing scaling capabilities to a broader range of icing conditions, and
   expand understanding of exceedance conditions.
   Graphic Inset Current software codes created and maintained by the
   Icing Branch include ice accretion prediction codes (LEWICE and LEWICE
   3D) and icing aero codes (SmaggIce).
