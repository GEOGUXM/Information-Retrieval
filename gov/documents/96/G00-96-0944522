   All NOAA Employees

                                                                     From:
   VADM Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr. , USN (Ret.)
   Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere

                                                                  Subject:
   IT Security Awareness Training

        It is important that every NOAA employee and contractor employee
        receive awareness training in Information Technology (IT) Security.
        IT Security is everyone's business, and we all need to be aware of
        the threats to our IT systems and data, and to know the things we
        all can do to reduce our vulnerability to these threats. I therefore
        strongly encourage each of you to complete the online NOAA IT
        Security Awareness Training Course no later than February 28, 2002.
        I ask that all NOAA supervisors and Contracting Officer's Technical
        Representatives assure that this training is completed as soon as
        possible.

        I understand that over 7,500 NOAA employees and contractor employees
        have already taken this course since it went online in early
        December, and I commend all of you! I look forward to receiving the
        word that we have all completed training!

        You will find the NOAA IT Security Awareness Training Course on the
        Web at https://www.csp.noaa.gov/noaa/ITSAC2001/index.htm. It is
        accessible from NOAA internal networks. If you are accessing the Web
        site from another network, you will have to log in using your NOAA
        email user ID and your email password. Contact the NOAA IT Security
        Office at 301-713-9111 if you have problems accessing the tutorial
        or printing the certificate of completion.
