                              PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   In September 2000, the Extra Credit Teacher Home Purchase Program was
   created with an initial allocation of $64 million in tax-exempt bond
   authority. In January 2001, the California Debt Limit Allocation
   Committee (CDLAC) approved a $100 million allocation for the Extra
   Credit Program for homeownership assistance to teachers and principals
   for program year 2001. The homeownership assistance will help teachers
   and principals willing to serve in low performing schools to purchase a
   home.

   Under the Extra Credit Teacher Home Purchase Program, teachers and
   principals who commit to serve in designated low performing schools for
   five years will qualify for tax credits or reduced interest rate loans
   to purchase a home. As an example, tax credits under the Program are
   worth approximately $37,000 over the life of a 30-year, $150,000
   mortgage - an annual savings of $1,800.

   Through each jurisdiction administering the program, eligible teachers
   and principals will also be guaranteed at least $7,500 in local
   downpayment assistance.

   The purpose of the Extra Credit program is to help attract and retain
   qualified teachers and principals to serve in low performing schools.
   The program targets a scarce public resource to those schools that
   struggle the most, and to those teachers and principals who are fully
   qualified to help those schools achieve success.

Program Details

   The following jurisdictions have received an allocation of tax credits
   or mortgage revenue bonds from CDLAC to be used to support a program to
   recruit and retain teachers and principals agreeing to serve in low
   performing schools: Sacramento, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Los Angeles
   , Orange, San Bernardino, and Santa Cruz counties, and the cities of
   San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland. The California Housing Finance
   Agency administers the program on a statewide basis and has made the
   program available to all areas in the state. Top priority for funding
   was given to programs that match the State awarded allocation with
   local homeownership assistance (such as assistance for down-payments
   and closing costs). Priority is also given to programs that indicate
   the highest need for recruitment and retention and most effectively
   utilize the allocation to retain and recruit qualified teachers and
   principals.

How do Teachers and Principals Apply?

   Eligible teachers and principals will apply through participating
   mortgage brokers and lenders, and should contact their local
   jurisdiction to receive specific information about the program
   administered in that area and the list of participating lenders.

What the Program Offers

   The program will provide eligible teachers and principals mortgage
   assistance in the form of either an annual reduction of their federal
   income taxes with a tax credit (mortgage credit certificate program),
   or a reduced interest rate mortgage loan (mortgage revenue bond).

     What is a Mortgage Credit Certificate or Mortgage Revenue Bond Loan?
     * Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC): For a family with a $150,000, 8%
       fixed interest rate mortgage, the credit (roughly 15% of their
       mortgage interest payment) would be approximately $37,000 over the
       life of the mortgage with an annual savings of up to $1,800. The
       credit would be highest in the early years of the loan, when there
       is more interest paid by the homeowner.

     Through the use of an MCC, eligible home buyers increase their
     ability to qualify for a mortgage loan. MCC recipients may take 15%
     of their annual mortgage interest payments as a dollar-for-dollar
     tax credit, thereby reducing their federal income tax bill. The home
     buyer may adjust his or her federal income tax withholding, thereby
     increasing income available to pay the mortgage. If the home buyer
     does not pay enough tax during the year to use the full credit, the
     unused credit can be carried over to future years for up to three
     years.

     * Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB): For a family with a $150,000 mortgage
       loan, the mortgage interest rate would be reduced by approximately
       1%, which would result in savings of approximately $37,000 over the
       life of the loan.

     An MRB is a below market interest rate mortgage. For example, if
     conventional mortgage rates are 8%, an MRB loan could be as low as
     7%.

Basic Eligibility Requirements for Teachers and Principals

     * To qualify, the teacher or principal must be a first-time home
       buyer, or have not owned a home within the last three years. (This
       means the teacher or principal must not have owned a home in any
       state within the last three years.)
     * The teacher or principal must have a combined family annual income
       of 115% or less of the county or statewide median income, whichever
       is higher, for a family of three or more and 100% or less for a
       family of one to two persons. (Please see the area-specific income
       limits listed below each jurisdiction.)
     * Home purchase price limits are set at up to 90% of the area average
       purchase price for existing and new homes. These limits are
       established by the public agencies that will run the program, based
       on information provided by the Internal Revenue Service. (Please
       see the area-specific purchase price limits listed below each
       jurisdiction.)
     * All eligible teachers and principals must agree to serve for a
       minimum of five years in a Low Performing School. [For the purposes
       of this program, a Low Performing School is designated as a K-12
       public school ranked in the bottom 30% based on the most recent
       Academic Performance Index (API), i.e. schools that have received
       an API statewide ranking of a 1, 2 or 3.]
