What is SPD?

   porthole The commercial development of the space frontier is one of the
   greatest opportunities facing America. It is the growth of business
   into space that will bring the benefits of space down to Earth and
   enrich the everyday lives of all Americans. NASA is encouraging
   businesses to seize this opportunity through its Space Product
   Development Office, to ensure the continued economic growth of the U.S.
   and to bring the opportunities for new advances, technological
   understanding, products, and jobs to the public.

   This effort is one of NASA's major goals, and the goal of the Space
   Product Development Office is to help American business explore the
   potential  and reap the rewards  of doing business in space. This not
   only ensures improvements to our everyday lives, but also establishes a
   commercial demand for space. Doing this, however, requires that seeds
   be planted with American businesses.

   These seeds are in the form of alliances with industry and academia
   through Commercial Space Centers that support the full spectrum of
   commercial research. These Centers, located at academic institutions
   such as universities, are currently funded by NASA and charged with
   developing industry partners to pursue specific areas of commercial
   research. These partners have to help pay an increasing portion of the
   funding for operations and research, since the ultimate goal is to
   generate a demand for doing business in space.
