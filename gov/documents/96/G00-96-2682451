Truckers: Don't Let Your Profits Go Up in Smoke

   keep on truckin According to estimates by Argonne National Laboratory,
   the average long-haul truck idles away up to $1,790 in profits each
   year. Instead of letting their engines idle, operators of class 7 and 8
   trucks should consider using separate devices for cab heating and
   cooling and engine-block warming.

   Actual savings will depend greatly on individual circumstances.
   Operators can figure their own savings by using a worksheet available
   from Argonne.

   Auxiliary devices are efficient, inexpensive to operate, and readily
   available. Using them could reduce annual fuel costs by over $1,500 and
   maintenance costs by over $275 per truck, without sacrificing comfort
   or convenience. The payback period for such devices could be as short
   as one year, depending on use.

   Devices on the market include direct-fired burners for cab and
   engine-block heating, thermal storage devices for heating and cooling,
   and auxiliary power units for heating, cooling, and electrical power.
   Typically, they consume 80-90% less fuel than a truck diesel engine.
   About 20-30% of Canadian long-haul tractors already have these
   energy-saving devices.

   Transportation analysts have shown that the annual savings quickly
   offsets the initial cost of auxiliary equipment. Their analyses assumed
   the average heavy-duty freight-hauling (Class 8) truck averages 6 hours
   of idling a day and 43 weeks of use per year. This amounts to about
   1,830 hours of engine idling annually. If auxiliary devices replaced
   idling for 1,450 of those hours (a conservative estimate) and used 85%
   less fuel, operators would save 1,230 gallons of fuel, or about $1,500
   (at $1.25 per gallon). Less engine wear would also significantly
   decrease the cost for preventive maintenance and overhauls, adding over
   $275 in estimated annual savings.

   The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies,
   consistent with its mission to reduce petroleum consumption, emissions,
   and dependence on foreign oil, has begun a program to inform truck
   operators about the significant advantages of reduced idling. An
   exhibit showing these advantages and staffed by Argonne experts will
   appear at truck shows nationwide during the next two years.

   Reducing idling would have significant environmental and economic
   benefits on the national level as well. If all class 7 and 8 long-haul
   trucks (about 480,000 vehicles) used these devices, the total fuel
   savings would be as much as 0.6% of all fuel used for surface
   transportation in the United States. Furthermore, reducing idling is
   important for reducing air pollution. Assuming 1,830 hours of idling a
   year, a single truck emits about 22 tons of carbon dioxide, a
   greenhouse gas; 390 pounds of carbon monoxide; and 1,024 pounds of
   nitrogen oxides.

   Thus, by reducing idling, truckers have the opportunity to create a
   rare win-win-win situation: a win for their own wallets, a win for the
   nation in increased energy efficiency, and a win for the environment.
