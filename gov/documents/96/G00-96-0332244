   BL1.4.3: 10-micron spot size achieved for high spatial resolution FTIR
                              spectromicroscopy

     Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).

     Beamline 1.4.3

     through a 10 micron pin hole being scanned on microscope stage.
     There are no other apertures in the optical path. This graph
     demonstrates the small spot size achieved using the synchrotron IR
     beam.



     We have made measurements to determine the small spot sizes
     achievable with the infrared spectromiscroscopy set-up on Beamline
     1.4.3. The software can take an area scan by moving the sample stage
     with micron spatial resolution under the focused IR beam and
     acquiring FTIR spectra at each point. To determine the actual
     focused spot size of the synchrotron beam and compare it to the
     internal Globar IR source, we used a 10 micron pin hole and measured
     the transmitted spectra as a function of the pin hole position. No
     other beam-defining apertures were used.

     By integrating over the measured energies, we obtain an intensity
     value. The intensity as a function of pin hole position is shown
     above in Figure 1. We clearly have a nice small spot being produced
     by our optics. In Figure 2 (below) we plot the x and y profiles of
     this spot along with fits to a Gaussian line-shape. The data fits
     very well to a Gaussian line-shape with resultant widths of 10
     microns in x and 8 microns in y. This spot size is becoming roughly
     diffraction-limited for the low-energy end of our detection
     capabilities (1000cm^-1 = 10 micron wavelength).

     Figure 2. Peak shape profiles in the x (left panel) and y (right
     panel) directions. We observe a well-defined Gaussian peak shape
     with widths of 10 microns in x and 8 microns in y.



     When we compare the above measurements to similar measurements made
     with a Globar IR source, the brightness advantages of the
     synchrotron become readily apparent. The Globar has a much broader
     peak profile of around 100 microns in width simply due to the non
     point-like source properties of this glowing filament source making
     a better focus impossible. Therefore, while the overall amount of
     light passing through the optical system from the Globar and the
     synchrotron sources is comparable, nearly all of the synchrotron
     light can be focused onto a 10 micron spot. To achieve a similar
     spatial resolution using the conventional Globar source, one must
     simply mask down the apertures and throw away a factor of 100 in
     signal intensity. We measure improvements of several hundred in
     intensity through small pin-holes (5mm and smaller) for the
     synchrotron source compared to the Globar.

     When high spatial resolution infrared experiments are of interest,
     Beamline 1.4.3 provides a huge gain in the available signal.
