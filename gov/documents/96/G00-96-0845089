      Vehicle Registration & VLF

   AB 527 (Kehoe)

                     Chapter # 201

   This bill would lower from $35 to $10 the cost of a replacement decal
   (adhesive sticker) displaying the particular branch of service or
   battle campaign of the owner of a Veterans' Organization special
   interest license plate. (Chapter # 201)

   AB 677 (Steinberg)

                     Chapter #708

   This bill would delete reference to the $6 application fee paid for a
   permanent disabled person parking placard, a substitute or a temporary
   "travel" placard, fees which, pursuant to a court decision, have not
   been collected for years. This bill would also require that the
   permanent parking placard have a contrasting color on part of the
   placard that would change at renewal. In addition, this bill would
   broaden certain anti-discrimination provisions of the California
   Government Code by requiring full and equal access to benefits
   administered by the state or any state agency. (Chapter # 708)

   AB 854 (Briggs)

                     Chapter #335

   This bill would delete the January 1, 2002 sunset date extending the
   provision that a smog certificate issued to a licensed dealer is valid
   for two years or until the vehicle is sold and registered to a retail
   buyer, whichever occurs first. (Chapter # 335)

   AB 984 (Papan)

                     Chapter #592

   This bill would provide an exemption from state and local sales and use
   taxes for the sale and leaseback of public transportation vehicles,
   vessels and related equipment until January 1, 2004. (Chapter # 592)

   AB 1258 (Wiggins)

   This bill would allow car rental companies to rent non-California
   registered vehicles for intrastate use until December 31, 2001.
   (Chapter # 465) (Urgency) (Effective October 3, 2001).

   SB 22 (Chesbro)

   Chapter # 5

   This bill would discontinue the VLF rebate process effective July 1,
   2001, creating savings of approximately $8,338,638 in DMV costs. The
   bill also repeals specified "triggers" that would have incrementally
   increased the amount of subsequent offsets based on General Fund
   projections and establishes a single 67.5% offset, effective July 1,
   2000. (Chapter # 5)

   SB 100 (Johannessen)

   Chapter #871

   This bill creates a special exemption for individuals who make and
   operate "homemade" and kit car vehicles that use engines, transmissions
   and exhaust systems from older model vehicles. The bill contains
   500-vehicle limitation, which could be deemed unconstitutional.
   (Chapter 871)

   SB 106 (Sher)

   Chapter #175

   This bill would eliminate the sunset date on the Abandoned Vehicle
   Abatement Program that allows counties to establish a vehicle
   registration surcharge to fund vehicle abatements. The bill allows the
   abatement authority to extend the fee collections in increments of up
   to 10 years, if the board of supervisors of the county, by a two-thirds
   vote, adopts resolutions to extend the fee. The bill also includes more
   stringent measures for holding the service authorities accountable for
   the fees collected. (Chapter # 175)

   SB 964 (Costa)

   Chapter #497

   This bill would allow cotton module movers to operate on state highways
   during specified times of the year and in specified counties, provided
   these vehicles are operated in compliance with driver license, size,
   brake, and light requirements, even when exceeding weight limits
   established for other vehicles. (Chapter # 497)

   SB 1173 (Johannessen)

   Chapter # 94

   This bill would allow engine casings from Harley-Davidson motorcycles
   to be resold, rather than destroyed upon replacement, which is the
   requirement under current law. (Chapter # 94)
        __________________________________________________________________

      Driver Licensing and Financial Responsibility

   AB 67 (Firebaugh)

                    Chapter #658

   This bill would allow motorhomes up to 45 feet in length to operate on
   specified roadways in California. The drivers would be required to
   obtain a non-commercial Class B license with a motorhome endorsement
   and submit a medical questionnaire as part of the testing process.
   (Chapter # 658)

   AB 360 ( Wesson)

                    Chapter #480

   This bill would make various changes to the vehicle impoundment
   procedures provided in the California Vehicle Code, including the
   conditions that allow for an early release of a vehicle, information
   that is provided to the public regarding the process, and educational
   requirements. (Chapter # 480)

   AB 1078 (Jackson)

                    Chapter #849

   This bill would remove the ten year limit on certain vehicular
   manslaughter convictions that are used as "prior" violations by the
   courts to increase penalties when sentencing DUI (driving under the
   influence of alcohol or drugs) offenders. In doing so, the bill would
   establish an alternate felony/misdemeanor for any person convicted of a
   DUI or DUI involving injury when the offender has ever been convicted
   of one of these offenses. (Chapter # 849)

   SB 42 (Speier)

                    Chapter # 84

   This bill would make technical corrections to earlier legislation (SB
   567), operative on January 1, 2002, that prohibits a parent or legal
   guardian from allowing his or her child or ward from being transported
   upon a highway without using a child passenger restraint system. This
   bill also moves existing language that regulates the accident reporting
   responsibilities of transit drivers to a more appropriate location in
   the Vehicle Code. (Chapter # 84) (Urgency) (Effective July 19, 2001)

   SB 108 (Speier)

                    Chapter #740

   This bill would enact the Organ and Tissue Donor Registry Act of 2001
   and establish an Organ and Tissue Donor Registry in the California
   Health and Human Services Agency. The bill removes existing provisions
   of law which mandate the DMV to provide a "donor card" to all driver
   license and identification card holders. Instead, DMV must provide a
   form with instructions for mailing the completed form to the California
   Health and Human Services Agency. Implementation is contingent upon the
   Director of Finance making a determination that sufficient monetary
   donations have been collected to support the development costs of
   establishing the registry and to defray the administrative costs for
   the first year of operation. (Chapter #740)

   SB 237 (Vincent)

                    Chapter #300

   This bill would require the placement of roadside signs on major state
   highways relating to the illegal abandonment or dumping of animals. The
   Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to include a question on
   the driver license written test, on a rotating basis, dealing with the
   abandonment and/or dumping of animals. This information must be and
   included in the California Driver's Handbook. (Chapter # 300)

   SB 255 (Speier)

   Chapter #855

   This bill makes it an infraction to leave a child under the age of six
   unattended in a motor vehicle and creates a fund for public education
   regarding the dangers of leaving a child in a vehicle. This bill also
   provides for the distribution of the fines. (Chapter #855)

   SB 485 (Public Safety Comm.)

   Chapter #473

   This bill makes needed corrections to Vehicle Code provisions that
   would codify existing DMV practice of treating specified out-of-state
   driving under the influence (DUI) related offenses as priors for
   specified enhanced DUI penalties. Revises the scope and reporting
   requirements of a DMV study regarding ignition interlock devices; and,
   clarifies various provisions pertaining to ignition interlock devices.
   (Chapter # 473)

   SB 776 (Torlakson)

   Chapter #857

   This bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to review
   scientific and empirical evidence on the effectiveness of programs,
   procedures, sanctions, fines, and fees in current law relating to the
   offense of driving under the influence. The bill would also require the
   department to report its findings and recommendations to the
   Legislature on or before July 1, 2002. (Chapter # 857)

   SB 871 (Burton)

   Chapter #298

   This bill would clarify the responsibilities of motor carriers to
   ensure existing provisions relating to drug and alcohol screening for
   commercial vehicle drivers are followed and would establish additional
   sanctions for non-compliance. (Chapter # 298)
        __________________________________________________________________

      Occupational Licensing & Law Enforcement

   AB 509 (Leach)

                        Chapter #457

   This bill would remove the requirement that a person must be authorized
   by a court to attend traffic violator school, allowing drivers to
   voluntarily attend such programs. (Chapter # 457)

   AB 871 (Cox)

                        Chapter #460

   This bill would allow a nonprofit agency to process the sale of
   vehicles donated to another nonprofit agency and, in consideration of
   those services, to retain a portion of the proceeds. The bill also
   establishes specific record keeping criteria for the nonprofit agencies
   in order to facilitate the DMV's audit responsibilities. (Chapter #
   460)

   SB 481 (Speier)

                        Chapter #441

   This bill would establish additional consumer protection measures
   designed to ensure that vehicle dealers sell a vehicle at its
   advertised selling price regardless of whether the purchaser is aware
   of the advertised price. The bill also would require dealers to
   disclose that the California tire fee is among those specified items,
   such as sales tax and registration fees, that may be excluded from the
   advertised price of a vehicle. (Chapter # 441)

   SB 1100 (Johannessen)

                        Chapter # 93

   This bill would modify existing law that requires applicants who intend
   to sell used vehicles on a retail or wholesale basis to first
   successfully complete an education program and written test. Current
   law also requires most dealers to successfully complete a "refresher"
   course every two years after the issuance of the license. This bill
   would exempt from the "refresher" course requirement wholesale-only
   dealers, who, during a one-year period, deal with less than 50 vehicles
   subject to registration. (Chapter # 93)
        __________________________________________________________________

      Records Access & Confidentiality

   AB 84 (Hertzberg)

                          Chapter #809

   This bill would make trial court employees, county psychiatric social
   workers and their spouses and children eligible for special home
   address confidentiality; and, authorize attorneys to obtain
   confidential home address information, which is not currently available
   to them. (Chapter # 809)

   AB 370 (Wright)

                          Chapter #676

   This bill would extend until January 1, 2004 a pilot program
   authorizing the release of confidential home address information to
   private universities for parking enforcement purposes. (Chapter # 676)

   AB 606 (Negrete-McLeod)

                          Chapter #363

   This bill is existing law which provides that the home addresses of
   specified state officers and employees that appears in any record of
   the Department of Motor Vehicles is confidential. This bill would add
   to that list state employees employed as: (a) Licensing Registration
   Examiner, Department of Motor Vehicles. (b) Motor Carrier Specialist 1,
   California Highway Patrol. (c) Museum Security Officer and Supervising
   Museum Security Officer. Note: AB 1029 and AB 84 also amend Section
   1808.4. Due to "chaptering-out" problems, the confidentiality
   provisions of AB 606 will no longer authorize this special protection
   for these employment groups as of January 1, 2002. (Chapter # 363)
   (Urgency) (Effective September 27, 2001)

   AB 1014 (Papan)

   Chapter #355

   This bill would require state and local agencies to assist the public
   in making requests for public records and to state the estimated date
   and time when the records would be made available. (Chapter # 355)

   AB 1029 (Oropeza)

   Chapter #486

   This bill would make nonsworn law enforcement personnel designated by
   the chief of police or sheriff as being in a "sensitive" position, and
   their spouses and children, eligible for special address
   confidentiality in DMV records. (Chapter # 486)

   AB 1078 (Jackson)

   Chapter #849

   This bill would remove the ten year limit on certain vehicular
   manslaughter convictions that are used as "prior" violations by the
   courts to increase penalties when sentencing DUI (driving under the
   influence of alcohol or drugs) offenders. In doing so, the bill would
   establish an alternate felony/misdemeanor for any person convicted of a
   DUI or DUI involving injury when the offender has ever been convicted
   of one of these offenses. (Chapter # 849)

   SB 46 (Polanco)

   Chapter #127

   This bill authorizes DMV to establish business partner relationships
   with private sector businesses for the purpose of completing vehicle
   registration and titling transactions. This concept was identified in
   the Governor's 1999/2000 budget as an "innovative" concept that would
   improve the level of DMV service provided to our customers. The
   authority to establish such partnerships will not result in the
   elimination or downsizing of civil service positions, but will maximize
   the existing resources available to improve customer service and reduce
   wait times for our customers. (Chapter # 127) (Urgency: Effective: July
   30, 2001)

   SB 168 (Bowen)

   Chapter #720

   This bill would help reduce identity theft by restricting the use of
   Social Security numbers as identifiers by persons and entities, other
   than state and local agencies, and by requiring credit reporting
   agencies to place security alerts and security freezes on an
   individual's credit report upon notification. (Chapter # 720)
        __________________________________________________________________

      Trucking Industry & International Registration Plan

   AB 1280 (Reyes)

                      Chapter #504

   This bill would update California laws pertaining to the operation of
   commercial motor vehicles to conform to federal guidelines. The bill
   would also establish additional violations for which sanctions against
   a commercial driver or the employer of a commercial driver could be
   taken. (Chapter # 504)

   AB 1472 (Longville)

                      Chapter #826

   This bill would amend various Vehicle Code and Revenue and Taxation
   Code sections to make technical changes pertaining to the gross vehicle
   weight fee system for trucks and the permanent trailer identification
   plate program. (Chapter # 826)

   AB 1621 (Cardenas)

                      Chapter #868

   This bill would, in regard to vehicles registered under the
   International Registration Plan (IRP) and Partial Year Registration
   Program (PYR), deem a December 31 expiration date to actually occur in
   the subsequent calendar year when applying any future legislated
   reductions or increases in the vehicle license fee (VLF). This would
   make these vehicles subject to VLF fee reductions or increases one year
   earlier than are currently provided. (Chapter # 868)

   SB 734 (Karnette)

   Chapter #539

   This bill (DMV's proposal B-01-16) would allow DMV to issue a "Hunter's
   Permit" for the operation of unregistered and unladen California-based
   International Registration Plan vehicles. The bill also authorizes DMV
   to assess interest and penalty rates when apportioned fees are
   underpaid and establishes the IRP membership fee at a level that will
   cover California's actual costs. The bill codifies current policy
   pertaining to the collection of IRP fees, and ensures that trailer
   manufacturers, distributors, transporters and dealers continue to fall
   under the department's occupational licensing program. (Chapter # 539)
        __________________________________________________________________

      Transportation Omnibus Issues

   AB 1707 (Transportation Committee)

                                     Chapter #739

   This bill is an "omnibus" bill and would make various technical changes
   and corrections to the Streets and Highways Code and the Vehicle Code.
   This bill would: · discontinue requiring course providers of mature
   driver programs to transmit copies of each certificate that is
   distributed to a participant to the department. · no longer require
   mature driver course providers to report the records of enrolled
   students and the records of the satisfactory course completion to the
   department. · clarify that community colleges drivers are exempt from
   holding a Schoolbus Certificate or School Pupil Activity Bus
   Certificate when transporting enrolled students. · clarifies that
   vehicles used to transport pupils of small community college districts
   are not to be classified as "school buses" unless they are transporting
   students who are in the 12th -grade level or below and are not
   currently enrolled in college. · repeal sections of the Vehicle Code,
   which have been superseded by other statutes that address firefighter
   equipment and commercial fees. · Clarifies that a dealer who provides a
   vehicle to a customer for a test-drive cannot allow the customer to
   keep the vehicle more than seven (7) days. (Chapter # 739)

   SB 290 (Transportation Committee)

                                     Chapter #825

   This bill is an "omnibus" measure for 2001. The bill: · increases the
   weight of the commercial vehicle owned by a disabled person that is
   entitled to an exemption from weight fees to one that weighs less than
   8,001 pounds unladen (was 6,001). The bill also makes a corresponding
   change in a provision governing nonresident daily commuters. · applies
   the same calculation method for figuring penalties in fractions of a
   dollar on vessel transactions as that already used for figuring vehicle
   penalties. The penalty will be rounded up to the nearest dollar if the
   penalty amount equals or exceeds 50 cents. · entitles an instruction
   permit holder to operate a vehicle for 24 months, rather than 12
   months, from the date of the application. · provides that electronic
   data regarding a driver's financial responsibility status will be
   available to law enforcement only when the department provides the
   capability. · provides that the name of the insurance company is
   required to be included on the evidence provided by a driver upon
   request, as well as the number of the insurance policy, as evidence of
   financial responsibility. · provides that a driver must present
   evidence of financial responsibility to a "traffic collision
   investigator" upon demand. · Removes the $20 returned check charge
   imposed on motor carriers and, instead, applies the standard returned
   check charge used by the department in all returned check situations.
