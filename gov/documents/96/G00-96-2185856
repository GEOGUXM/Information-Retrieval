         ADVISORY FOR GASOLINE DISPENSING FACILITY (GDF) APPLICANTS

          NEW equipment requirements for new and modified stations

   On November 17, 1999, the District's Board of Directors approved
   revisions to Regulation 8, Rule 7: Gasoline Dispensing Facilities.
   Several of these new provisions place restrictions on equipment
   installed after June 1, 2000.

   The following equipment may not be installed within the BAAQMD after
   June 1, 2000:
     * Currently certified coaxial Phase I vapor recovery systems (Section
       8-7-301.8)
     * Vacuum assist (bootless nozzle) Phase II vapor recovery systems
       that are not compatible with refueling vehicles equipped with
       On-board Vapor Recovery (ORVR) controls. Only the Healy 600 ORVR
       and Healy 800 systems currently meet this standard. All other
       vacuum assist systems, including the Gilbarco VaporVac and the
       Dresser Wayne WayneVac, have yet to be certified as
       ORVR-compatible, and may no longer be installed in the District.
       (Section 8-7-302.11).

   These requirements only apply to new and modified stations. In-place
   equipment may continue to be operated, and in some cases components
   such as nozzles or dispensers may be replaced with like equipment.
   Applicants holding Authorities to Construct (A/Cs) for coaxial Phase I
   systems and bootless Phase II systems should contact the District to
   determine if their A/C needs to be modified for use after June 1.

   In addition , all equipment installed after June 1, 2000 must meet the
   following requirements:
     * All new gasoline storage tank fill tubes must be equipped with an
       anti-rotational coupler or swivel adapter (Section 8-7-301.9)
     * Any drain valves on new spill boxes installed on Phase I vapor
       pipes must be plugged (Section 8-7-301.12)
     * All nozzles on new balance-systems must have vapor check valves,
       and may not be operated in conjunction with remote vapor valves.
       (Section 8-7-302.7)
     * Connectors between the vapor riser and the internal dispenser
       piping must be at least one inch in diameter (nominal) and
       compatible with gasoline. (Section 8-7-302.10).

   If you have further questions about this advisory or the new
   requirements, please contact either the technician handling your
   application or Scott Owen at (415) 749-4693.
