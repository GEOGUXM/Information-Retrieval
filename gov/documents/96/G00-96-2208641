                                   Preface

   This volume--part of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) annual
   report to the House and Senate Committees on the Budget--is intended to
   help inform policymakers about options for the federal budget. The
   report presents a broad range of possibilities, focusing on the effects
   of paying down the debt, options to cut spending or to increase it, and
   options to cut taxes or to increase revenues.

   The broad proposals and specific policy options addressed in this
   volume come from many sources. In keeping with CBO's mandate to provide
   objective and impartial analysis, the discussion of each proposal or
   option presents the cases for and against it. The inclusion or
   exclusion of a particular idea does not represent an endorsement or
   rejection by CBO. As a nonpartisan Congressional agency, CBO does not
   make recommendations about policy.

   The report begins with an introduction that discusses how the emergence
   of large surpluses has transformed the budget debate, presents
   rationales for the budget options presented, and explains how to use
   this volume. Part One (Chapter 1) looks at the costs and benefits of
   paying down federal debt held by the public. Part Two (Chapters 2
   through 5) examines options for spending. Chapter 2 is a broad
   discussion of proposals that would expand federal programs for
   retirement, health, and education. Chapter 3, in similar fashion,
   discusses proposals that would increase spending for physical capital
   and information. Chapter 4 provides an overview of defense spending and
   presents specific options to increase or decrease it. Chapter 5
   includes numerous options to cut nondefense spending, organized by the
   functional categories of the budget--international affairs; general
   science, space, and technology; and so on. Each functional category is
   introduced by a page of background information about recent spending
   trends in that function. Part Three (Chapters 6 and 7) looks at revenue
   options. Chapter 6 presents a broad discussion of significant proposals
   for cutting taxes. Chapter 7 contains specific options for increasing
   revenues, which follow the one-page format used in Chapter 5. Appendix
   A discusses the usefulness of agencies' reports under the Government
   Performance and Results Act for assessing budget options. Appendix B
   contains the scorekeeping guidelines used to enforce the requirements
   of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (as amended). Appendix C lists
   contributors to this report.

   This volume is available in multiple formats on CBO's Web site
   (www.cbo.gov), including an "interactive" version with enhanced search
   capability.
