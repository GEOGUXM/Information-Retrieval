   NIST STB Simulation

                NIST ATSC Set-top Box Simulation Environment

   The NIST STB simulation is a collection of Java classes that
   encapsulate the functions of a generic ATSC STB. These classes are
   provided to the API implementation as services. A special class within
   the STB simulation manages and controls access to this Java-based
   simulation. The STB simulation is composed of two modules, the STB
   simulation control and the Java simulation classes. The simulation
   control boots the STB simulation and performs initialization. Tasks
   include managing the JVM, running applications, and creating simulation
   and HAL managers.

   The Java simulation classes are largely composed of manager and
   datatype objects. The manager objects maintain the ATSC/MPEG table data
   as well as STB functionality. The datatype objects are constructs that
   represent ATSC/MPEG table data, as well as data carousel objects. For
   example, an ATSCVirtualChannel object contains the information for a
   virtual channel. The datatype objects act as simple data repositories
   that map ATSC data into Java types. The Java simulation also includes
   classes to read the raw ATSC ancillary data extracted from a bitstream.
   The NIST STB simulation does not process the MPEG transport stream,
   however, but relies on an external program to extract the ATSC data
   tables from that stream and provide them as input to the simulation.
   The format of this input stream has been defined by NIST and contains
   only updated versions of the ATSC and MPEG tables, with no audio or
   video streams present.

                              Simulation Design

   The typical flow of control within the simulation modules is as
   follows. The boot process creates a JVM, the STB Simulation Manager,
   and HAL Data Manager. The STB Simulation Manager starts an ATSC Reader
   object and creates the simulation data manager objects. The ATSC
   ancillary data is read in, decoded and used to populate the simulation
   tables. The HAL collects and merges table data and provides high-level
   objects to the API implementation through the DataManager object. The
   API implementation uses these objects to fulfill the requirements of
   the API definitions.
