                        Market Conditions Assessment

   The first phase of the LATCÂ’s market conditions assessment is
   complete.  Five focus groups were selected to gather broad-based input
   that will be used to update the LATC's strategic plan in 2002.  The
   first group, representing the insurance/legal market segments, met in
   Sacramento on May 23, 2001.  General topic areas of discussion
   included:  industry perceptions; current trends/technology; the
   changing scope of practice and boundaries of the profession; views on
   education, the examination, and continuing education; enforcement
   issues; and communication / outreach strategies for various audiences.

   The other four groups, made up of landscape architects with varying
   years and types of practice, municipalities, and allied
   professionals/developers, met on June 6, 8, 14, and 15.  The results of
   the assessment will be presented to the LATC at its August meeting.
   Licensees will receive a survey shortly thereafter, developed using
   data from the focus groups, to gather as much insight as possible on
   the key issues facing landscape architects in today's market.

   Results from the market conditions assessment and LATC future
   strategies will be published in early 2002.

                               Consumer Guides

   Three new consumer guides are now available to the public.  The guides
   offer important information about the services provided by landscape
   architects, contract requirements, tips on selecting landscape
   professionals, and how to file a complaint in the event something goes
   wrong.  The booklets focus on residential, private development and
   public sector projects.  The guides are located under "Publications,
   Laws & Regulations Page".

                        Technical Expert Recruitment

   Consumer complaints against landscape architects are investigated by
   the LATC.  Some cases require the opinion of a technical expert to
   determine whether the landscape architect's action(s) deviated from
   accepted standards of practice.  In an effort to update its database of
   qualified experts, the LATC is asking interested parties to apply by
   sending in a resume/vitae.

   Technical experts must:
     * Have a current, valid landscape architect license;
     * Have a minimum of five years of professional landscape
       architectural experiences;
     * Have knowledge of the standards of practice for landscape
       architects;
     * Be able to interpet the Landscape Architects Practice Act and
       review and understand investigative documents;
     * Be able to write clear, concise, succinct and organized expert
       opinions; and,
     * Be available to testify at administrative and criminal hearings.

   Resumes/vitaes may be sent to:
        Landscape Architects Technical Committee

        400 R Street, Suite 4000
