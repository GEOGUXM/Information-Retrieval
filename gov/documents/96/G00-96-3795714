   MODIS has a full complement of On-Board Calibrators (OBCs) that
   generate various stimuli to provide radiometric, spectral and spatial
   calibration of the MODIS  instrument. We identify the four OBCs as the
   Blackbody (BB), Solar Diffuser SD), Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor
   (SDSM), and the Spectroradiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA).

   The BB is the prime calibration source for the thermal bands located
   from 3.5 µm to 14.4 µm, while the SD provides a diffuse,
   solar-illuminated calibration source or the visible, near infrared, and
   shortwave infrared bands (0.4 µm < = lambda < 2.2 µm). The SDSM tracks
   changes in the reflectance of the SD via reference to the sun so that
   potential instrument changes are not incorrectly attributed to changes
   in this calibration source.

   The SRCA is a very complex, multifunction calibration instrument that
   provided in-flight spectral, radiometric and spatial calibration.

   Two additional calibration techniques that MODIS will use are views of
   the moon and deep space. The advantage of "looking" at the moon is that
   it enables MODIS to view an object that is roughly the same brightness
   as the Earth. Like the on-board Solar Diffuser, the moon is illuminated
   by the sun; however, unlike the Solar Diffuser or the Earth, the moon
   is not expected to change over the lifetime of the MODIS mission.
   "Looking" at the moon provides a second method for tracking degradation
   of the Solar Diffuser.

   "Looking" at deep space provides a photon input signal of zero, which
   will be used as an additional point of reference for calibration.
   (Stars are too dim to be "seen" by MODIS.)
