   The primary goals of the North Dakota Tracer Experiment are to
   understand how Photo of NOAA/C and staff. thunderstorms produce
   hailstones and to devise improved seeding strategies to suppress hail
   formation. One of the most difficult problems in cloud seeding
   operations is that very little is usually known about where silver
   iodide seeding aerosols actually go after being released and whether
   they reach the desired target areas of the clouds in adequate
   concentrations. The NDTE research is focused on using tracer materials
   to reduce these uncertainties. The project's field experiments were
   conducted near Bismarck in the summer of 1993. ETL used the
   polarization capabilities of its NOAA/C radar to detect and track
   microwave chaff fibers that were that were released with the seeding
   agent and revealed the material's movement and dispersion inside the
   storm clouds.
