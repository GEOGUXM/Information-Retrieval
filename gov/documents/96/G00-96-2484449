   Executive Summary

   The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) have become an integral
   component of the provision of NASA information to academia, industry,
   and the public, and as an enabling set of technologies for the internal
   NASA information technology environment. This document provides a set
   of web "Best Practices" (WBP) for all NASA entities engaged in the
   development and maintenance of World Wide Web resources. The Best
   Practices defined in this document are applicable to all NASA
   Enterprises, Centers, and project and program offices and have been
   created under the auspices of the NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO).

   This Best Practices document is organized into the following chapters:
    1. Site Design
    2. Page Design
    3. Site Accountability
    4. Site Security
    5. Accessibility
    6. Web Marketing
    7. Site Search
    8. Authoring Tools

   These Best Practices facilitate consistent, reliable, and efficient
   deployment of WWW services throughout the Agency. These criteria should
   be viewed as baseline recommendations. References to applicable
   government and NASA policies and standards are included to highlight
   "requirements." This document will continue to be reviewed and revised
   by the NASA WWW community.
