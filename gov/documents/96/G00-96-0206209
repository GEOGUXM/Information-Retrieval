   Federal Highway Chief Schimmoller Places Landmark First Call to 511 in
   Kentucky


   Federal Highway Administration Deputy Executive Director Vincent F.
   Schimmoller today joined Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton in placing the
   nations historic first telephone call to 511 Americas traveler
   information telephone number.


   Schimmoller commended the citizens of the Cincinnati and northern
   Kentucky metropolitan area for their vision and national leadership in
   connecting to 511. While easy access to current local traveler
   information does not resolve congestion, it does return control to
   travelers who will be able to make informed choices about time, mode
   and route of travel.  Ultimately 511 will lead to saved lives, time and
   money and improve the quality of life for Americas travelers, he said.


   The northern Kentucky-Cincinnati metropolitan area is the first region
   in the country to adopt the national dialing code.  Several more
   jurisdictions are expected to implement 511 later this year.  To
   facilitate national implementation of 511, the U.S. Department of
   Transportation (DOT) is working with a coalition that includes the
   American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the
   Intelligent Transportation Society of America, and the American Public
   Transportation Association.


   The concept of a national traveler information telephone number
   developed from a growing awareness that even greater benefit could be
   derived from the nations multimillion-dollar investments in Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS) by delivering local traveler information
   directly to the public by telephone.  In 1999 DOT petitioned the
   Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a three-digit telephone
   number, and on July 21, 2000, the FCC assigned 511 for local traveler
   information.


   At the time the department submitted its petition, more than 300
   traveler information telephone numbers existed nationwide.  As area
   codes proliferated and American travel continued to increase, it became
   clear that a single three-digit national number would be useful in
   providing motorists with local traveler information anytime and
   anywhere.


   Five-one-one implementation is eligible for regular federal-aid highway
   funding.  In addition, the department has established a grant program
   to assist transportation agencies in planning and converting to 511.
   Additional information on 511 and the 511-implementation assistance
   grant program is on the Internet at www.its.dot.gov.
