        [v.gif] ast amounts of dangerous materials and large areas of
       contaminated land have accumulated during the last four or five
   decades. These materials and areas are a legacy left behind by the Cold
    War and the rapid development of energy resources. To deal with this
       legacy-to reduce the risks it presents-is one of society's most
                             pressing problems.

   To dispose of the materials that cannot be reused, to store and recycle
       the materials that can be put to use, to clean up contaminated
     areas-all these tasks must be done safely and efficiently. And they
       must be done openly, in full public view, to help everyone feel
           confident that the risks have been dealt with properly.

       The Waste Legacy Program brings the capabilities of a national
     laboratory to these tasks. Sandia National Laboratories has a long
   history of successful work in waste disposal and environmental cleanup.
     Sandia has developed efficient techniques and instruments for doing
    these tasks. We have worked in cooperation with regulatory agencies,
    citizen groups, scientific-oversight groups, and other stakeholders.
     Along the way, Sandia has learned many lessons and created many new
    abilities. The Waste Legacy Program takes advantage of these lessons
    and abilities as it solves waste-legacy problems in the United States
                                 and abroad.

      The Waste Legacy Program is led primarily by two groups at Sandia
    National Laboratories. The Geoscience and Environment Center and the
       Nuclear Waste Management Program Center. This web site provides
      information on these two groups as well as the main projects and
                  capabilities in the Waste Legacy program.

     The Waste Legacy Program is made of two general types of activities

                Global Nuclear Materials and Waste Management
   Domestic and international repositories (spent nuclear fuel, high-level
                 waste, transuranic waste), transportation,
    nonproliferation/transparency, storage, orphan waste and speical-case
                 waste, low-level and mixed low-level waste.

                            Environmental Quality
      Long-term stewardship and monitoring, environmental restoration,
         environmental research and technology, and waste retrieval.

             The types of work performed in these areas include:

     Decision analysis

     Environmental remediation and waste management technology development

     Geoscience research and development

     Information/data management

     Micro-sensors

     Performance Assessment

     Quality Assurance

     Regulatory interaction and analysis

     Site characterization and large-scale subsurface field-testing

     Subsurface monitoring

     System integration and optimization

     Transportation packaging design and testing

     Waste characterization
