                     Salary Commission Privacy Statement

   Thank you for visiting the Web site of the Washington Citizens
   Commission on Salaries for Elected Officials' (Salary Commission). This
   statement establishes how the Salary Commission will handle information
   we learn about you from your visit. Please be assured that we are
   committed to protecting your privacy when visiting our Web site and
   when conducting business with our agency. The Salary Commission is
   further directed to safeguard users' privacy under Executive Order
   00-03 concerning public records privacy protections. Please keep in
   mind, however, that most official business conducted with our agency is
   governed by Washington's open public records law and is subject to
   disclosure.
       _______________________________________________________________

   Our Policy. We will collect no personal information about you when you
   visit our Web site unless you choose to give that information to us
   through an e-mail message or survey. If you are conducting business
   with the Salary Commission, we will ask for only the information needed
   to complete the transaction or required by law.
       _______________________________________________________________

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically. When you access our Web
   site, no information that identifies you personally is automatically
   collected. To provide the best possible service, the Salary Commission
   uses software that automatically gathers and stores statistical
   information about how our Web site is being used. We do not use
   cookies* to track individual user visits and the data we collect does
   not reveal your personal identity.

   *A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer's hard drive
   at the direction of the host server of the Web site you are visiting.
   The file contains information about your visit to that site.

   If you simply browse through our Web site, read pages, or download
   information, we automatically collect and store information about your
   visit including:
     * The date and time you visited
     * The name of the Internet domain you used to access the Internet
       (such as internetserviceprovider.com, aol.com, universityxxx.edu,
       etc.) and IP address (not your e-mail address) from which you are
       accessing our site.
     * The pages you visited
     * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site
     * The address of the Web site you came from if you linked to our Web
       site from another Web site

   If You Send Us Personal information. You do not have to give us
   personal information to visit our Web site. Visitors to the Salary
   Commission's Web site may decline to participate in any activity that
   asks for personal (or any) information, such as surveys or e-mail. If

   normally be included as part of the message. You also may be sending us
   personal information (for example, your name, street address, or
   telephone number).

   In all instances, we use the information you send us only to reply to
   your message or to help us get the information or service you
   requested. As with written correspondence, we are required to save a
   copy of all e-mails sent this office for a period of time. We do not,
   however, extract or compile personal information from e-mails sent to
   us unless it is needed to complete or respond to your request. We do
   not create individual profiles from the information you provide, nor do
   we collect information for commercial marketing.
