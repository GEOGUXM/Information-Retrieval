       "Gift of the people of the United States of America" reads the
            inscription in Pashtu and Dari on U.S. food aid bags.
   [bag1.GIF] The United States has led the international community's
   response to the suffering of the Afghan people, supplying more than 80
   percent of total UN World Food Program (WFP) food aid.  For FY 2001,
   which ended on Sept. 30, 2001, the United States provided nearly $184
   million in humanitarian aid to vulnerable Afghans, including about
   $99.8 million in food aid from USDA.  On Oct. 4, 2001, President Bush
   announced that the United States is prepared to contribute an
   additional $320 million in humanitarian assistance to the region.

   The United States is also playing a leading role in coordinating the
   international effort to assist in rebuilding Afghanistan and build a
   lasting partnership. On January 21, 2002, at the International
   Conference for Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan, the United
   States pledged $297 million as the initial U.S. contribution in this
   relief and recovery effort.
