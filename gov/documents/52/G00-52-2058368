   The Chicago/Romeoville National Weather Service Forecast Office issues
   generalized weather forecasts out to 5 days for north central and
   northeast Illinois and far northwest Indiana. Other offices (including
   Quad Cities, Lincoln, St. Louis and Paducah) issue forecasts for the
   remainder of Illinois and Indiana.

   These forecasts are the product of a mix of scientific models and
   forecaster experience. The models run twice a day and so routine
   forecasts are issued in the early morning and mid afternoon (4 am and 4
   pm). Updated forecasts are issued as conditions warrant.
