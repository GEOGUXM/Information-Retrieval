Summary

   NERSC provides users with permanent file storage ($HOME directory) and
   temporary scratch file space (in $SCRATCH on the IBM SP and in /usr/tmp
   and $TMPDIR on the Cray systems).

   Long-term archival storage is available on the HPSS mass storage
   systems. HPSS is accessible via hsi and the pftp interface utility from
   NERSC's compute platforms and by ftp from remote sites.

   The Andrew File System (AFS), a distributed file system, can be
   accessed from the Crays through an NFS/AFS gateway.
