                 Smoot Group Education/Outreach/Visitor Page

   The Smoot Group is engaged in the development of education material
   about cosmology and astrophysics. We also run a training and guest
   program for students, teachers, and researchers.

Education Topics

     * Formation of the Elements
     * Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) the relic radiation from the big
       bang begining of the Universe.
     * Antimatter in the Universe (Physics 24 Lecture by George Smoot 1999

       Lecture by Andrwe Jaffe 1997 Feb 27)
     * Active Galactic Nuclei There are some galaxies that have nuclei
       that outshine the whole rest of the galaxy by a large portion. They
       are thought to be powered by supermassive (millions or more solar
       mass) black holes.
     * Popular Talk on cosmology and observing the early Universe given by
       George Smoot at the (January) 1997 Partners In Science Conference
       sponsored by Research Corporation , a foundation for the
