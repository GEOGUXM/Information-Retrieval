   Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) offers the public the
   ability to query court dockets and other information through a dial-up
   connection from a personal computer or terminal.
   Usage for PACER is $0.60 per minute. Billing begins from the time you
   log in and ends when you log out. Billing will be administered by the
   PACER Billing Center in San Antonio Texas. For questions regarding
   billing, please call 1-800-676-6856.
   Set up your modem to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, No Parity, Full Duplex,
   Protocol XModem, Terminal Emulation vt100, vt102, or Ansi.
   For NEW Users: You will be receiving your login and password shortly.
   Note: it is very important that you log out properly. Use "q" to quit a
   menu option and "99" at the pacer main menu to log out. Failure to do
   so, will result in "idle time" which is still billed to you.
