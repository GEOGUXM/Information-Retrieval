                  New York State Pesticide Monitoring Homepage

   In 1997 the U.S Geological Survey and the New York State Department of
   Environmental Conservation (DEC) began a cooperative program to assess
   the presence and distribution of pesticides in surface and ground
   waters of New York State. This program was initiated as part of the
   DEC's response to the mandate presented in the Pesticide Reporting Law
   ECL 33-0714 to provide an understanding of the health and environmental
   impacts of pesticide use in the State. Ultimately this program will
   provide DEC with information in all areas of the state, especially
   those areas where pesticides are heavily applied or where local waters
   are used as drinking water.
