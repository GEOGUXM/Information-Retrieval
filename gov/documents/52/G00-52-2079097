   Welcome to the Science and Technology Awards and Recognition System
   (STARs). The Laboratory Science and Technology Office (LSTO), by
   request of Jeff Wadsworth, Deputy Director of Science and Technology,
   has put together a beta-system to gather award and recognition
   information from laboratory employees. This information will be
   available for the public in the near future.

   Award Organizations
   For a listing of our current awards and honors we are collecting, click
   award descriptions. You will find a listing of award organizations and
   honors that are currently entered into our system. For a brief
   description about the organization, click any hyperlink.

   Current STARs Recipients
   We would like to ask for your assistance in verifying that the
   information we have currently stored into our system is correct. The
   best way to see if you are in the system is to run an Award Report. You
   can select Award Reports from the menu options and type your name as
   the award recipient. Click Generate Report to view any awards we may
   currently have stored. If no information is retrieved, no awards are
   listed. You can also run Report for All Award Recipients from LLNL.
   This will generate a list with all employees who are entered into the
   system. Again, please look for your name to verify you are not in the
   system incorrectly or if an award or honor is missing.

   Submitting Awards
   If an award and recognition has not been submitted, please go to the
   Submit Award menu option and complete the form. The submittal form is
   easy to follow. Please complete the form accurately with as much detail
   as possible. Once submitted, the information will be forwarded to your
   directorate contact for verification and accuracy. Once approved by
   your directorate, the information will be approved and submitted into
   STARs.

   Updating Award Information
   If any award information is incorrect or needs to be updated, please
   send email to Nancy Campos or Pamela Harris with the correct and/or
   updated information. Again, information will be verified by your
   directorate before the award is corrected and/or updated.

   Forum
   If you would like to participate in the Discussion Area about current
   development, adding award categories, or general comments, please
   submit your feedback. All suggestions and comments are welcome. All
   comments will submitted to the STARs Commitee for review.

   If you need immediate assistance, please call Pamela Harris at 3-9110.

             For technical questions or comments, please contact
                          webmaster@stars.llnl.gov
