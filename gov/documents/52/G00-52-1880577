   RELEASE: 01-107AR

   NASA AMES KEPLER MISSION SELECTED FOR DISCOVERY PROGRAM

   NASA has selected the Kepler Mission, a project based at Ames Research
   Center, Moffett Field, Calif., as one of the next two new NASA
   Discovery missions.

   Scheduled for launch in 2006, the Kepler Mission will use a unique
   spaceborne telescope specifically designed to search for Earth-like
   planets around stars beyond our solar system.

   "The Kepler Mission will, for the first time, enable humans to search
   our galaxy for Earth-size or even smaller planets," said principal
   investigator William Borucki of Ames. "With this cutting-edge
   capability, Kepler may help us answer one of the most enduring
   questions humans have asked throughout history: are there others like
   us in the universe?"

   To date, about 80 extra-solar planets have been discovered. However,
   these are all gaseous-giant planets similar to Jupiter, which are
   probably composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and unlikely to harbor
   life. None of the planet detection methods used so far has the
   capability of finding Earth-size planets - those that are 30 to 600
   times less massive than Jupiter. None of the giants discovered to date
   has liquid water or even a solid surface.

   The Kepler Mission is different from previous ways of looking for
   planets; it will look for the transit signature of planets. A transit
   occurs each time a planet crosses the line-of-sight between the
   planet's parent star that it is orbiting and the observer. When this
   happens, the planet blocks some of the light from its star, resulting
   in a periodic dimming. This periodic signature is used to detect the
   planet and to determine its size and its orbit.

   Three transits of a star, all with a consistent period, brightness
   change and duration, provide a robust method of detection and planet
   confirmation. The measured orbit of the planet and the known properties
   of the parent star are used to determine if each planet discovered is
   in the habitable zone, that is, at the distance from its star where
   liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet.

   The Kepler Mission will hunt for planets using a specialized one-meter
   diameter telescope called a photometer to measure the small changes in
   brightness caused by the transits.

   The key technology at the heart of the photometer is a set of charged
   coupled devices (CCDs) that measures the brightness of hundreds of
   thousands of stars at the same time. CCDs are the silicon
   light-sensitive chips that are used in todays TV cameras, camcorders
   and digital cameras. Kepler must monitor many thousands of stars
   simultaneously, since the chance of any one planet being aligned along
   the line-of-sight is only about 1/2 of a percent.

   "From monitoring 100,000 stars similar to our sun for four years, the
   Kepler team expects to find many hundreds of terrestrial-type planets,"
   said David Koch of NASA Ames, the mission's deputy principal
   investigator.

   The Kepler Mission will continuously view an amount of sky about equal
   to the size of a human hand held at arm's length or about equal in area
   to two scoops of the sky made with the Big Dipper constellation. In
   comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope can view only the amount of sky
   equal to a grain of sand held at arms length, and then only for about a
   half-hour at a time.

   "One of Ames' most important efforts is our work in the field of
   astrobiology - the study of life in the universe. Kepler's goal of
   finding planets that might harbor life represents a major step in
   advancing astrobiology research," said Dr. Harry McDonald, Ames Center
   Director.

   "The Kepler mission represents a cornerstone in our effort to search
   for evidence of life in the universe, and will pave the way for future
   more complex space projects. I am very proud of the years of work
   invested by the Kepler team leading to this selection," said Scott
   Hubbard, Ames' Deputy Director for Research.

   The industrial partner for development of the hardware is Ball
   Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo. Kepler's selection
   involves a delayed start of development of up to one year due to
   funding constraints in the Discovery program.

   NASA selected the two missions from 26 proposals made in early 2001.
   The missions must stay within the Discovery Program's development cost
   cap of about $299 million.

   The Discovery Program emphasizes lower-cost, highly focused scientific
   missions. The past Discovery missions are NEAR Shoemaker, Mars
   Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector, all of which successfully completed
   their missions. Stardust and Genesis are in space; both have begun
   collecting science data, although Stardust has not yet arrived at its
   target comet. CONTOUR is scheduled to launch next summer, Deep Impact
   in January 2004 and MESSENGER in March 2004. ASPERA-3 and NetLander are
   Discovery Missions-of-Opportunity that are under development.
