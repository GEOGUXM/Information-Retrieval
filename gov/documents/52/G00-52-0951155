A Message from the Director

   Following recommendations from the NASA advisory committees, the
   HEASARC was established in 1990 to archive the data from X-ray and
   Gamma-ray astronomy missions including the ASCA, Compton GRO, ROSAT,
   XTE , EUVE and BeppoSAX observatories. HEASARC is also responsible for
   restoring datasets from historic missions flown since the field of
   X-ray and Gamma-ray astronomy began in the 1960s. We retain and
   distribute not only all of the data from NASAs high energy astrophysics
   missions, but also that from European and Japanese satellites.
   Currently the HEASARC data holding total over 1 Terrabyte of data, with
   all of these data available for immediate ftp download via our W3Browse
   and Skyview user interfaces. The HEASARC is currently one of the
   largest online astronomy archives. But the HEASARC is more than just an
   archive for X-ray and Gamma-ray astronomy data. To effectively use
   these multi-mission data it is important to provide a mission
   independent infrastructure for their access and analysis. To do this
   the HEASARC has pioneered the setting of software and data format
   standards across many different missions.

   This multimission approach both saves money through the reuse of
   software and promotes a multi-mission/multi-wavelength approach to the
   data analysis. As we look forward to the major X-ray and Gamma-ray
   observatories Chandra Observatory, XMM, Astro-E and Integral to be
   launched around the turn of the century, the infrastructure laid down
   by the HEASARC provides a sound basis for the future. Over the coming
   years we plan to build on the current infrastructure to provide more
   value-added interfaces to the archive, that will provide on demand
   higher level products in the most usefull form required.

   As Director of the HEASARC I am responsible for all aspects of the
   HEASARC operations. I welcome and encourage comments (both positive and
   negative) from our community of users. The HEASARC Users Group (HUG)
   meets once per year to give me advice and feedback on the HEASARC
   activities. I also monitor the Feedback e-mail line and I encourage you
   to send in comments and suggestions.
