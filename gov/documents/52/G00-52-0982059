   CFC REGULATIONS REMAIN IN EFFECT Local Federations must submit a
   Combined Federal Campaign Federation application. The information that
   your federation provides must apply to the federation entity rather
   than to individual member agencies. If this is the first time your
   federation is applying or if your federation was found ineligible last
   year and was not listed as a federation in the CFC Donor Guide, then
   you must submit a completed Federation Application for your federation
   and Local Unaffiliated & Federation Member application for each of your
   member agencies. In case your federation is found not eligible and you
   wish to be considered as an unaffiliated member, you must submit a
   Local Unaffiliated & Federation Member application for your federation
   with all attachments by the application deadline. Do not forget to
   include attachment C that documents how your organization (not member
   agencies) provides real benefits and services to the public. If you
   have been previously accepted as a federation, you must submit a
   completed Federation Application and Local Unaffiliated & Federation
   Member Application for your new member agencies. The following criteria
   as outlined in the 5CFR Part 950.303 must be met: * Your local
   federation must have 15 or more eligible member agencies. * Eligibility
   must be re-established yearly, and an updated member list must be
   provided. 950.303(c) and 950.303(e)(1) * Your local federation, having
   been properly established, may certify your member agencies as eligible
   to be included on a local list and receive funds. 950.303(d) You must
   ensure that your member organizations comply with all eligibility
   requirements OR identify to the LFCC any member agencies that fail to
   meet such requirements. The LFCC may require any member agency of a
   local federation to supply independent evidence of its eligibility.
   After an opportunity for a hearing on the record, the Director may
   decertify any local federation at any time when such local federation
   falsely certifies the eligibility of any of its member agencies. * Your
   federation and member agencies must include their IRS Employee
   Identification Number within the description. * "Doing Business As"
   name and Legal Name for your federation and member agencies will be
   printed in the donor guide. If a DBA name is used, a copy of the IRS
   letter needs to be included in the application. 2001 Chicago Area
