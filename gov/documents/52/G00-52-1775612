     number of controlled studies on near-term, ground-based measurements
     of the effect in a limited number of controlled studies on near-term
     missions and (iii) extend existing preliminary work to develop
     improved techniques so that a wider array of materials and their
     parameters can be efficiently tested in multiple-sample testing
     procedures.
