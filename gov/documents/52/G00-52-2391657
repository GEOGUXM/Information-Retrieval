   USGS Albany Water, Gas, & Light

             Ground-water monitoring in the Albany, Georgia area

              Working together to protect Albany's water supply

   Irrigation in a pecan grove Long-term heavy pumping from the Claiborne,
   Clayton, and Upper Cretaceous aquifers, which underlie the Upper
   Floridan aquifer, has resulted in significant water-level declines in
   these deep aquifers in the Albany area. These declines have raised
   concern over the ability of the deeper aquifers to meet the increasing
   demand for potable water supply. To provide additional water and reduce
   the demand on the deeper aquifers, the Albany Water Gas, and Light
   Commission (WGL) is developing a large well field southwest of Albany.
   The supply wells at this location will primarily tap the Upper Floridan
   aquifer, a karstic unit that is the uppermost reliable source of water
   in the area. Because of local recharge to the aquifer, water quality
   may be affected by land use. The ground-water flow system and water
   quality of the Upper Floridan aquifer in the vicinity of the wellfield
   is complex. Monitoring is necessary to detect changes in the water
   level and water quality. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in
   cooperation with WGL, is conducting a monitoring program for early
   detection of water-level declines and water-quality changes.
