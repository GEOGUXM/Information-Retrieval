   My Picture

   Gregg Rabideau is a researcher and developer in the Artificial
   Intelligence Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California
   Institute of Technology. He is working on new planning and scheduling
   technologies for several space projects sponsored by NASA. His research
   interests include soft real-time re-planning and plan optimization. He
   holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of
   Illinois where he graduated with highest honors. Gregg is the software
   lead for the ASPEN planning and scheduling system which received
   Honorable Mention in the 1999 NASA Software of the Year Competition and
   was a contributor to the Remote Agent System which was co-winner in the
   same competition.
