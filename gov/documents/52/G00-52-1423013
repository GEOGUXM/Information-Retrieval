List Servers (Automated E-mail Groups)
Hosted by the California Energy Commission
       _______________________________________________________________

     In general, list servers are automated e-mail systems where a single
     e-mail sent to a list's main address can be automatically
     distributed to an entire group of subscribers. The Commission hosts
     a number of list servers that are used to distribute information on
     various topics about Commission programs, workshops, etc. The
     Commission's lists are not used for general discussion of these
     topic areas. Most items below are linked to their respective
     sections for more information about those program areas.
     If your computer supports forms, you can subscribe below by entering
     your e-mail address then click on subscribe and the list(s) you wish
     to subscribe to. Click the unsubscribe button and the list name(s)
     to delete your name from any list. Please make sure you type your
     e-mail address correctly.
     After you've subscribed, you will receive a welcome message from the
     list. If you do not receive a welcome message to the list, your
     e-mail address may not have been entered properly. So, please retry
     after a couple of days.
     PLEASE ONLY SUBSCRIBE TO LISTS THAT INTEREST YOU. DON'T SIMPLY CHECK
     ALL BOXES UNLESS YOU WISH TO RECEIVE MAIL ON ALL THESE LISTS.
     PLEASE UNSUBSCRIBE IF YOU ARE CLOSING/MOVING YOUR E-MAIL ACCOUNT!
     Note: Because many people do not close accounts when they move, or
     who use "free" e-mail accounts (such as yahoo.com) that have a limit
     on the number of messages they can receive or store, if we receive a
     notice back from your e-mail server saying mail is undeliverable, we
     will delete your name from all list servers.
