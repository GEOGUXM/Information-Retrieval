   Thank you for visiting the HELP Committee's web site. Protecting
   personal privacy has always been a top priority for me. I believe all
   web sites should post a concise privacy policy explaining their
   practices, in order for the individual to decide for him/herself
   whether to continue surfing that site. My privacy policy for the
   Committee's web site is explained below.

   In summary, this web site does not collect personal information about
   you and you are not added to any e-mail lists. We do not share, sell,
   or otherwise distribute for commercial or political purposes any
   information that is collected [see below]. If you e-mail the Webmaster,
   your message is forwarded to the appropriate office. We cannot be
   responsible for your e-mail once it has been forwarded. However, all
   Senate offices adhere to a high standard of privacy.

   Senate rules require that this web site be hosted on an official Senate
   server. The server, and this site, are provided as a public service by
   the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, the Office of the U.S.
   Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,
   and Pensions of the United States Senate.

   Can I use/copy information I find here?    |
   Back

   Information presented on this site is considered public information and
   may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified. Use of
   appropriate byline/source credits is requested. Graphics and

   be used without her permission.

   What information is collected?    |
   Back

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, this government computer system employs
   software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
   attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
   These acts are unauthorized and may be federal crimes, punishable under
   the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National information
   Infrastructure Protection Act.

   Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts
   are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data
   logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular
   destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records
   Administration guidelines.

   For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes.
   This government computer system uses software programs to create
   summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what
   information is of most and least interest on a site; determining
   technical design specifications; and identifying system performance or
   problem areas.

   Is this site OK for children?    |
   Back

   While we encourage children to use this site for educational purposes,
   we also encourage their parents to stay in close touch with their kids
   as they explore the Internet. For more information and resources for

   What are cookies and does this web site use cookies?    | Back

   "Cookies" are small files stored on your computer that assign a
   numerical user ID and store other information about your online visit
   to particular sites. No, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
   Pensions does not use cookies to track your visits.

   What about links to other sites?    |
   Back

   The Committee's web site has links to other sites on the Internet.
   These include both government agencies and private-sector sites. If you
   link to a site that does not include the "senate.gov" in its URL
   [location or address], you have left the Senate's web server and are no
   longer covered by the Senate's privacy policies. You should consult the
   privacy policy of each site to review how they use information about
   your visit.

   Who should I contact if I have a question?    |

   to report a broken link, e-mail:

   If you have a question about a Senator's position on a particular
   issue, contact the Senator through his/her personal web site. If the
   Senator is a Member of this Committee, you can get to his/her personal

   Members page. Otherwise, you can access any Senator's web site through
   the Senate's main page at www.senate.gov
