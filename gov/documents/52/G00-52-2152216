      Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling.

                               Sun Activities

   The Sun's energy is the principal driver of all of Earth's atmospheric
   events, from weather patterns in the lower layers, through auroras in
   the upper layers, to the space weather environment of energetic
   particles at the altitudes of orbiting satellites. The energy
   originates from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in the Sun's
   core (nucleosynthesis). Over millions of years, the energy is
   transported outward to the visible surface, where it is radiated into
   space.

   The Sun contains the vast majority of all matter within our solar
   system. It is mostly hydrogen, with some helium and smaller amounts of
   other elements.

   Image of corona The visible surface of the Sun is called the
   photosphere. The Sun's atmosphere has two transparent layers. The
   chromosphere is just above the photosphere. The corona is the outer
   part of the Sun's atmosphere. In the outer region of the corona,
   particles travel away from the Sun and stretch far out into space. The
   chromosphere and corona can only be seen during solar eclipses, or with
   instruments that simulate a solar eclipse.

   The SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) spacecraft is currently
   in position at the L1 point. Once of its instruments, LASCO, is a
   visible-light coronagraph, a device that blocks the bright light from
   the Sun's surface, allowing the details in the corona to be clearly
   seen.

   In one of LASCO's images of activity on the Sun, shown here, blobs of
   plasma (the solar wind stream) can be seen to be emitted from the Sun.

   international cooperation between the European Space Agency (ESA) and
   NASA.
