      Years in Review
      Many people realize that the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General is
      the top law enforcement office in the state, yet they are unfamiliar
      with the extent of work that the Office performs. From taking drugs off
      the streets to exposing consumer scams and defending our laws in court,
      the Office performs a wide range of duties to protect Pennsylvanians.
      Attorney General Mike Fisher's Office compiled the Years in Review to
      detail the accomplishments of the Office. Each of these reports will
      familiarize you with the many ways that the Office of Attorney General
      protects and helps citizens of the Commonwealth.
