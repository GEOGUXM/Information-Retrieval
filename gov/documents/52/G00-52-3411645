                   A message from the Attending Physician:

     Recent misleading news reports regarding the anthrax vaccination of
     Capitol Hill workers have been circulating and causing great
     concern. In response to this, the Office of the Attending Physician
     (OAP) has crafted the following letter. This letter should clarify
     these recent articles and answer your questions concerning the
     anthrax vaccination.

     The OAP has been working closely with experts from the CDC, NIH, and
     DoD to ensure the continued health and safety of every individual on
     this campus. Please feel free to contact the OAP if you have
     continuing concerns regarding anthrax.

     December 19, 2001

     Since the 15th of October, The Office of the Attending Physician
     (OAP) has had an ongoing dialogue with experts from the CDC, HHS,
     NIH and DOD about the management of individuals who have potentially
     been highly exposed to anthrax through the inhalational route. After
     careful consideration of this issue, HHS has created broad
     guidelines regarding anthrax immunization and extended antibiotic
     treatment (www.hhs.gov/news) for those individuals. However, more
     specific recommendations have been made for the United States
     Capitol complex as outlined below.

     Specifically, the OAP has recommended vaccination and an extension
     of antibiotic course for approximately 70 people in the
     Daschle/Feingold office suite on October 15 where the contaminated
     letter was opened. This is based on the high level of anthrax which
     was released in that localized area. This group has been identified
     and notified.

     For those other individuals who have completed or are completing a
     60-day course of antibiotics, the OAP recommends that no further
     antibiotics or vaccinations be initiated.

     Experts from the CDC will be available on December 19, 2001 in the
     Russell Caucus Room from Noon to 3:00 PM to answer specific
     questions people may have.

     To Summarize:
     - Immunization and antibiotic extension is recommended by the OAP
     only for those approximately 70 individuals who were physically in
     the Daschle/Feingold rooms on October 15, 2001 where nasal swabs
     were positive.
     - The vaccine will be given as part of a CDC research protocol and
     will require obtaining informed consent from all participants, since
     the vaccine is not FDA approved for post exposure prophylaxis. The
     vaccine, however, is not experimental and has been proven to be
     safe.
     - It is recommended that all other individuals who have received 60
     days of prophylactic antibiotics stop once their 60 days is
     complete.
     - The OAP will continue to be available to answer questions for
     individuals who have come off antibiotic therapy as well as all
     other Capitol Hill staff who have health concerns regarding anthrax.
     We can be reached at (202) 225-5421.
     - A copy of this letter will be posted on the Chief Administrative
     Officers Web site, www.house.gov for use by your primary care
     physician should he/she have further questions.
