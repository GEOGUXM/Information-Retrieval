                                                         Estuary Restoration Act
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Act

   The Estuary Restoration Act, signed into law in November of 2000, was
   sponsored by the late Senator John Chafee (R-RI) and Representative
   Wayne Gilchrest (D-MD) (download Act as pdf - 26 pages, 168K). The Act
   creates a strong federal commitment and provides resources to restore
   habitat in America's estuaries. The Act promotes the restoration of one
   million acres of estuarine habitat over the next ten years by
   leveraging limited federal resources with state and local funding.
   Specifically, the Act makes restoring our Nation's estuaries a national
   priority, funds estuarine habitat restoration projects, restores and
   protects vital habitats, strengthens local, regional, and national
   economies, improves our quality of life and preserves a way of life,
   culture and history.

   Estuary Habitat Restoration Council

   One of the key features of the Act is the creation of an Estuary
   Habitat Restoration Council. The Council is made up of the Secretaries
   of five federal agencies: Army Corps of Engineers, National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and
   Wildlife Service and Department of Agriculture. In addition, the
   President may appoint ex-officio representatives (non-voting). The
   Council's responsibilities include developing and submitting to
   Congress of the National Strategy for Estuary Habitat Restoration,
   evaluating and recommending project proposals for funding.

   The National Strategy for Estuary Habitat Restoration

   The Act requires the completion of the National Strategy within the
   first year of the passage of the Act (by November 7, 2001), with a goal
   of restoring one million acres of estuarine habitat by the year 2010.
   The Act also requires that the National Strategy address specific
   issues. Although there is substantial overlap, the Draft National
   Strategy presented here is not the National Strategy required by the
   Act. It is our hope that the Draft National Strategy, which represents
   the work of dozens of agencies and organizations, will be useful to the
   Council as they work to complete the National Strategy within the
   required timeframe.

   Funding

   The Act authorizes $275 million over five years for estuary habitat
   restoration projects. Projects eligible for funding must have a
   non-federal sponsor, and the maximum federal share of funding is 65%.
   However, until the National Strategy has been submitted to Congress,
   the maximum federal share of funding for a selected project is only
   25%.
