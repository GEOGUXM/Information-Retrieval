                          HISTORICAL INFORMATION ON
                 FORMER COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS MEMBERS
                      THAT HAVE ATTAINED HIGHER OFFICE

       Throughout its history, many famous Americans have served on the
        Committee on Ways and Means.  The long and distinguished list
       includes 8 Presidents of the United States, 8 Vice Presidents, 4
         Justices of the Supreme Court, 34 Cabinet members, and quite
      interestingly, 21 Speakers of the House of Representatives.  This
     latter figure represents nearly one-half of the 51 Speakers who have
                    served since 1789 through the present.

      Below is a full list of major positions held by former members of
                       the Committee on Ways and Means.

      The following Presidential portraits have already been included in
        the Chairmen's portrait pages:  James K. Polk (D-TN), Millard
                Fillmore (W-NY), William McKinley, Jr. (R-NY).
