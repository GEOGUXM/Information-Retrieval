   Introduction:

   Manufacturing Statistics involves the application of statistical tools
   and techniques to evaluate, improve, qualify, and optimize
   manufacturing processes and products.
   Statistical process and quality control (SP&QC)
       SP&QC uses statistical techniques to measure and analyze the
       variation in processes and the quality of processes, with the
       intent to monitor product quality and maintain processes to fixed
       targets.  Experiments in manufacturing are frequently conducted to
       characterize, improve, qualify, and optimize manufacturing
       processes and product performance and reliability.  Before an
       experiment can be conducted, an experimental design must be
       carefully planned to ensure that experimental objectives can be
       accomplished, assumptions required for hypotheses testing and data
       analysis are valid, randomization requirements are met, and the
       experiment is reproducible.
       Design of experiments
       Design of experiment refers to the specific manner in which the
       experiment will be conducted and the plans for data collection and
       analysis.  Data from statistical process and quality control and
       from experiments or product testing must be appropriately analyzed
       before results can be determined and conclusions drawn.
       Statistical Modeling
       Statistical Modeling involves the appropriate application of
       statistical analysis techniques, each requiring certain assumptions
       be met, to perform hypothesis tests, interpret the data, and draw
       valid conclusions.
