   Oklahoma FEB Members:


   As we approach the new fiscal year, the Federal Executive Board has
   reorganized some of our Councils and structure in order to ensure
   continuity of leadership and to better serve our membership.  At the
   same time, the new structure will provide opportunities for development
   of leadership competencies for some of your most promising employees.


   In designing this new approach to filling Council Chair positions, we
   were cognizant of the time requirement and the difficulty in releasing
   high-performing employees from the workplace.  In order to minimize the
   time away and maximize the development opportunity, the following
   criteria were established:


    1. The selected Chairs will serve a term of two years with meetings
       each month that will last from one to two hours.
    2. The Chairs will attend FEB luncheons (held every other month).
    3. The Chairs will meet with the FEB Executive Director for one hour
       (every other month) for a Council Chair meeting to discuss
       cross-cutting agency initiatives and efforts in which the Councils
       can assist each other to enhance expected results and avoid
       duplication of efforts.


   There will be a total time investment of two meetings each month for a
   time commitment of two years (a total of 48 meetings in two years).
   This allows the individual approximately 6‑12 months necessary to
   transition into the new experience and become acquainted with the
   members and organizations involved; the remainder of the 24 months will
   allow them to apply their gained knowledge to achieve effective
   results.


   Initially there will be six FEB Councils participating in this
   program.  Council Chairs will be selected by the Executive Policy
   Council from resumes submitted by Federal employees that must be
   endorsed by an agency official at the local level.  This is to ensure
   the employees have managerial support in their development and that the
   individuals will receive the appropriate leadership credit for their
   efforts.  The required resume format is attached to this letter.


   What this will do for your agency?  Provide a unique developmental
   opportunity for a promising employee with no additional budgetary
   requirements.  The experience will assist in developing leadership
   competencies which include:  Leading change, leading people, results
   driven, business acumen, and building coalitions/communications.  (See
   the attached outline for detailed information.)  The FEB’s Executive
   Policy Council will provide annual feedback on the employee’s
   accomplishments and leadership competencies.


   What this will do for the FEB?  Increase the efficiency and
   effectiveness of FEB Councils.  Create a source of new ideas and
   energy, ensuring effective leadership for the Councils to assist in the
   accomplishment of FEB objectives.  Provide professional leadership for
   each of our councils in the pursuit of established performance
   objectives.


   What this will do for the employee?  Provide an opportunity to enhance
   managerial qualifications through inter-agency and inter-governmental
   efforts pursued by the Councils.  Contacts will be with individuals in
   other Federal agencies, other levels of government, and potentially
   other geographic locations, which broaden the network opportunities for
   the individuals beyond what is possible from their employing agency.
   The selected Chairs will be provided an opportunity to develop or
   enhance skills.  This will also afford them the chance to develop or
   enhance skills in teamwork and cooperation, problem solving, work
   environment development, communications, building alliances,
   interpersonal relationships, and strategic planning.


   If you have questions regarding this initiative, please call LeAnn
   Jenkins at (405) 231-4167.


   Sincerely,


   Lindy Ritz

   Chairperson
