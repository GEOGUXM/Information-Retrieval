        "Earth science data captures the heartbeat of a living planet, with
       each beat corresponding to a season or annual cycle. Our planet is best
       studied in a truly three-dimensional, dynamically animated medium, one
       made possible by our supercomputers, high-speed networks, scientific
       visualization techniques, and information management tools," stated Dr.
       Milton Halem, Chief, Earth and Space Data Computing Division (ESDCD).

       Over 1,000 U.S. scientists use Goddard Space Flight Center
       supercomputers to develop Earth system models, both mathematical
       abstractions of processes and assimilations of observation data. The
       ESDCD has created networks and transparent interfaces so that
       scientists have direct access to our visualization tools and display
       their results at their own remote locations. "We are bringing the
       ability to handle data over time and parameter space. It is information
       that the scientific specialist and public can appreciate at different
       levels. It has the same universal quality as music or art," said Dr.
       Halem.

       The civil servants and contractors of the ESDCD enable NASA-supported
       scientists to increase their understanding of Earth, the solar system,
       and the universe through computational modeling and processing of
       spaceborne observations. The Division is committed to providing the
       science community with access to state-of-the-art high-performance
       computing and networking, mass storage and information systems
       technologies, and the computational science expertise of a staff
       dedicated to supporting that community. The computational services of
       the ESDCD primarily support the Mission to Planet Earth enterprise,
       and, to a lesser extent, components within the space sciences.
       Moreover, ESDCD activities in the High Performance Computing and
       Communications (HPCC) Program and the Digital Library Technology arena
       are substantial components of aeronautical and advanced technology
       efforts.
