   Notes on the search query and the results:
     The search is not case sensitive.
       Example: the query 'Garzoglio' or 'garzoglio' are the same.
     The query does not need to match exactly to get information back
       (smart match).
       Example:
          the University query 'Penn' or 'Pennsylvania' or 'Pennsylvania
            State' are the same.
          the Author Name query 'Robert' gives you the authors whose name
            is "Robert" or "Roberto".
          the Title query 'chi2' gives you all the titles that contain
            chi2. To make this kind of searches, though, it is better to
            use the Keywords query: for example titles that contain
            1^3P[2]won't match the query 'chi2'.
     Both Italian and English name of the Universities are allowed.
       Example: the query 'Genova' or 'Genoa' gives you all the thesis
       made with the "Universita` degli Studi di Genova"
