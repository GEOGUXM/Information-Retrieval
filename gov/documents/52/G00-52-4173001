   We are pleased to present the USGS FY 2000 - 2005 Strategic Plan. This
   revised plan reflects an agency in transition, building on its proud
   120-year history of impartial scientific excellence, to become more
   flexible and responsive in addressing challenges and opportunities of
   the 21st Century. Our plan reflects a renewed commitment to meeting the
   needs of our partners and customers and to cultivating an atmosphere of
   innovation and creativity that will foster and reward the broad-scale,
   integrated science we believe is needed by decision makers and the
   public.
   To bring about these changes, we are streamlining our organization and
   emphasizing performance and accountability. The USGS is committed to
   ensuring timely delivery of information to those who need our products
   by using all the applicable tools of the emerging information
   technology. Finally, we will ensure the relevance and usefulness of our
   science by better listening to our customers and integrating our strong
   capabilities in geology, biology, hydrology, and geography. Each of
   these disciplines has developed a science plan that establishes the
   foundation for their strategic directions.
   With this USGS strategic plan, we are embarking on an exciting future,
   by developing and implementing new operational practices, a more
   efficient structure, and creative new ways of measuring progress toward
   achieving the USGS mission and goals. We are pleased to be the science
   agency for the Department of the Interior and for a large number of
   other Federal, State, and local agencies. We look forward to expanding
   this role in the next century.
