      Site Requirements
              __________________________________________________________________

       [ball.gray.gif] You must have the latest version of Netscape or
                             Internet Explorer.

    [ball.gray.gif] To view case document images, you must have an image
                              viewer installed.

      There are many types of image viewers available. When configured
    properly and completely win98, by default, has a tiff (image) viewer
    installed and it is set to work automatically with your computer and
                                  browser.

        If your browser does not load an image viewer by default when
     requesting tiff documents from our site, you may need to install an
   image viewer. It is more likely you already have an image (tiff) viewer
            and your browser or O.S. is not configured correctly.

       THE COURT CAN NOT PROVIDE COMPUTER CONSULTING. Please consult a
   competent computer professional about any computer or Internet problems
                             you may encounter.
