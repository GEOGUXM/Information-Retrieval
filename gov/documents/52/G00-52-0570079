                           Leave/Time & Attendance

   Leave

   Did you know that all full-time and part-time employees on an
   appointment of 90 days or more are eligible to earn annual and sick
   leave? So, you're planning to use leave this pay period? What kind of
   leave will it be? Not to fret, the answers are just a click away.

   The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides government-wide
   leadership on federal leave policies and programs. Look to them for
   overall guidance on Leave Administration Programs including information
   on Family Friendly Leave Policies.  DOC's overall procedural guidance
   is found in the DOC Leave Administration Handbook.

   The OPM-71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence (formerly SF-71) is
   the only form authorized by DOC for requesting and approving leave. It
   is a matter for supervisory discretion whether or when an employee is
   required to submit an OPM-71 except for Family Friendly Leave. All
   instances of use of Family Friendly Leave must be requested and
   approved with an OPM-71.

   Expecting a little bundle of joy soon? Read the Maternity Frequently
   Asked Questions to know your leave entitlements. If your happy event is
   by adoption, check out OPM's Adoption Benefits Guide.

   Leave without pay (LWOP) is a temporary period of nonduty and nonpay
   time granted at an employee's request. Employees on Student
   appointments often work full-time when not attending school and are
   placed on LWOP during school time. Learn more about the varied Effects
   of LWOP.

   Employees who are facing periods of absence due to medical emergencies
   can be authorized to receive donated annual leave through the DOC Leave
   Transfer Program. The DOC Electronic Forms Website has PDF versions of
   both the CD-504, Recipient's Leave Transfer Application and the CD-505,
   Donor's Leave Transfer Application. Here are the Approved Leave
   Donation Recipients in NOAA.

   Payment for Annual Leave.

   Time and Attendance

   It's the end of the pay period and you've just received your group's
   time sheets. Lucky you -- the Timekeeper. You have just 2 days to enter
   the T&A information and transmit the data so that your co-workers are
   paid in a timely manner. Your role is extremely important, though
   sadly, often taken for granted. We appreciate your diligence and we're
   here to help you and the supervisors certifying employee's duty time.

   It takes several reference guides to cover the timekeeping function.
   It's not enough to just have the DOC Time and Attendance Manual (dated
   July, 1994) and to know the T&A software screens and the general coding
   rules. Supervisors and timekeepers also need to know the rules
   governing overtime pay and compensatory time, Sunday pay, and holiday
   pay. Still others need to learn the ins and outs of Night Differentials
   and Hazard pay. Start with the DOC Leave Administration Handbook and
   Time & Attendance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). Work your way on
   to the DOC Pay Manual covering Premium Pay. Also familiarize yourself
   with Overtime Pay for Travel and the Biweekly Earnings Limitation.

   Seems like alot to learn? It is, but hang in there...

   If your organization offers an Alternative Work Schedule (AWS), you
   will have to apply some of the rules you've learned within the context
   of the AWS. Learn more from OPM's Handbook on Alternative Work
   Schedules and Section 3 of the DOC Leave Handbook.

   Here's a handy reference of the T&A Transaction Codes.

   When ol' Mother Nature blows and snows, review this information on T&A
   Coding for Inclement Weather Site Closures.

   If you're a new or fairly inexperienced timekeeper and want to learn
   the ins and out of Time and Attendance, sign up for one of our training
   courses.  Here's the 2002 T&A Training Schedule for Silver Spring,
   Maryland and the 2002 T&A Training Schedule for Boulder, CO.

   Call the staff in the Time and Attendance Services Office if you have
   any questions.
