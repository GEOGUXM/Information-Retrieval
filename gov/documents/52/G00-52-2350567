    Although not a member of any political party, when it is necessary to
     associate with a caucus for the purposes of committee assignments,
   Congressman Sanders caucuses with the Democrats. As far as seniority is
   concerned, the Congressman is considered more senior than every member
           elected after his freshman Congress, the 101st (1990).

   Congressman Sanders is currently the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee
   on International Monetary Policy and Trade. It is believed that this is
      the first time an unaffiliated Congressman has become part of the
               leadership of a major Congressional committee.
