    The Mouse Mammary Video

   This video was produced at the University of California, Santa Cruz in
   a research laboratory working on the regulation of mammary development
   in the laboratory mouse. The video is intended to help researchers, who
   may be new to mammary gland research, master certain specialized
   surgical techniques, as well as acquainting experienced researchers
   with new or unfamiliar procedures. It also contains information on the
   development and lactation cycle of the mammary gland in mice, as well
   as tips on basic surgical techniques such as instruments, anesthesia,
   suturing, and shipping viable tissues.

   The price for the 75 minute production is low, only $40 in the US,
   including shipping and handling-slightly higher for PAL and
   international orders. The video represents an entirely non-profit
   enterprise, being funded in part by a grant from the University of
   California, enabling us to keep the price remarkably low for a
   production of this type. Revenues in excess of post-production costs,
   if any, will be used to repay cost overruns during production, and to
   provide resources for future productions, if this proves to be useful.

   For ordering information, and for more details about the video, please
   see: http://www.biology.ucsc.edu/mamvid

   If you purchase a copy and find it helpful, please spread the word-we
   do not have an advertising budget! If you have questions not answered
   on the website, please contact Dr. Charles Daniel at

   April 10,1999

    The Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology is proud to announce the launching
    of the Web-based Histology Atlas. The Atlas will provide histological images
    and associated information. The goal of the Atlas is to disseminate
    high-resolution mammary gland histology images to researchers and educators
    around the world via the Internet. The project is a collaboration with the
    Center for Information Technology at the NIH. The project was sponsored by
    NIDDK and NCI.
