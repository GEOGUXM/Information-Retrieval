      The Consent Decree between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the
   Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety (CCNS) requires that seven albedo
   TLDs be placed on the north, south, and east sides of TA-18. The albedo
    TLDs were to be placed within 60 days of March 25, 1997 and are to be
                    operated for a period of five years.

         The albedo dosimeters are sited at the following locations:

     The LANL 8823 personnel dosimeters that are used are accredited for
     personnel dosimetry for all the radiation categories described here
       under the Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program
     (DOELAP). Sixteen albedo TLD dosimeters were emplaced to determine
      neutron radiation levels. The dosimeters are designed to measure
    external radiation when worn by workers or other individuals that may
       receive a radiation dose, and so they are calibrated to include
         backscatter from the body. This was taken into account for
   environmental monitoring by placing these dosimeters on 20 cm x 20 cm x
                           15 cm Lucite phantoms.

   Two dosimeters are located at stations 1-7. On a normal, routine basis,
       these locations have no restrictions in terms of public access.
     However, some operations at TA-18 can produce a dose of more than 1
   mrem at Pajarito Road or at the TA-36 road to Kappa Site. A few times a
    year, when large operations are conducted, these roads are closed to
    public access. During road closures, one dosimeter at each station is
       taken out of the field and placed in a vault. Thus, we have one
        measurement that represents the full calendar quarter and one
   measurement that represents the time period during the calendar quarter
                when a member of the public could be present.

     Each dosimeter contains eight TLD chips, and are made of different
   materials according to what they are intended to measure. TLD E8 is LiF
     and is enriched in the isotope Li-6 that makes it more sensitive to
    thermal neutrons. TLD E7 is also LiF, but depleted in Li-6 making it
                 relatively insensitive to thermal neutrons.

     The dosimeter holder has different filters over the various TLDs to
   alter their responses to different types and energies of radiation. The
    TLD pair E7 and E8 with the opening on the back of the cadmium box is
                            the albedo dosimeter.

     The dosimeter is designed to internally provide an estimate of the
   neutron correction factor (NCF), which is the ratio of the true neutron
   dose to the corrected albedo reading in dosimeter E8. This is used when
    individuals are exposed to a number of different neutron fields with
    different energy spectra in their work assignments. For monitoring at
       TA-18, however, the monitoring locations exhibit fairly similar
    thermalized spectra. For situations such as this, it is more accurate
   to measure the neutron correction factor directly. The measurements are
      discussed in the memorandum ESH-17:00-322. As a result, a neutron
        correction factor of 0.145 is used in the TA-18 neutron dose
                      calculation, as discussed below.

   The tables present the light readings from each dosimeter, after being
      adjusted for fading (when required), the reader corrections, and
                     individual chip correction factors.

   The background radiation signal that the dosimeters would receive while
      they were not in the field has been subtracted in determining the
     neutron doses. The light readings for TLDs E7 and E8 were corrected
    using empirical formulas. For TLD E7, the added signal that this TLD
     would receive from background radiation is 1.84 + 0.16 * (number of
     days of exposure). The corresponding formula for TLD E8 is 2.872 +
                    0.265 * (number of days of exposure).

    The procedure used to calculate the neutron dose is to determine the
   albedo response. TLDs E7 and E8 were first corrected for the radiation
   they received while not in the field, as described above. TLD E8, which
     is sensitive to thermal neutron radiation and photon radiation, was
    corrected for background photon radiation by subtracting E7 (which is
   only sensitive to photon radiation) from E8, to form the net (neutron)
     signal in E8, called E8N. The value E8N was then multiplied by the
            neutron correction factor to obtain the neutron dose.
