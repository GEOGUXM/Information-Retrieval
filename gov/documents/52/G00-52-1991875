   than the amount requested in Section V. (2) Interest Rate: As required
   in Government Code Section 14529.6(b)(8), the interest rate shall be
   set at the rate paid on money in the Pooled Money Investment Account
   (PMIA) during the period of time that the money is loaned. The PMIA

   revenue sources is prohibited. All payments on the principal plus
   interest or penalties shall be deposited to the State Highway Account
   (Government Code Section 14529.6(b)(12)). The Department of
   Transportation shall notify the Borrower at least 30 days in advance of
   the date a payment is due with the amount of principal and/or interest

   the outstanding loan and/or interest may be made in advance of the
   repayment schedule stated in Section V without penalty. (6) Cause to
   Rescind: Should the project(s) funded from this loan fail to go to
