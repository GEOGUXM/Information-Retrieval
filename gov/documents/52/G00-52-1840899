   Background on GOES

                                  LAUNCHED

   The fourth in a series of five of the most sophisticated weather
   spacecraft ever built, soared into space this morning at 3:07 a.m. EDT
   from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla.

   The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-L
   spacecraft was carried in space aboard a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIA
   rocket. Twenty-seven minutes later, the spacecraft separated from the
   Centaur stage. At approximately 4:22 a.m., controllers successfully
   deployed the outer panel of the solar array, making the spacecraft
   power positive and allowing the batteries to charge.

   "We're off to a great start," said Martin Davis, GOES project manager
   at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. "The spacecraft
   is now in transfer orbit and all data indicates we have a healthy
   spacecraft."

   The spacecraft is a three-axis internally stabilized weather spacecraft
   that has the dual capability of providing pictures while performing
   atmospheric sounding at the same time. Once in orbit the spacecraft is
   to be designated GOES-11 and will complete its 90 day checkout in time
   for availability during the 2000 hurricane season.

   Throughout the next 17 days, NASA and the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) controllers are scheduled to perform
   several apogee motor firings and adjust maneuvers, culminating with the
   spacecraft arriving in a geosynchronous orbit 22,240 miles (35,788
   kilometers) above the Earth's equator at 104 degrees West Longitude.
   Controllers will operate the spacecraft from the NOAA Satellite
   Operations Control Center in Suitland, Md.The first of several burns to
   move the spacecraft into its final orbit begin approximately 20 hours
   after liftoff, when controllers perform the first apogee motor firing,
   lasting for 53 minutes. goesLlaunch3.jpg (16253 bytes)

   The second firing is scheduled for approximately four days after
   liftoff and will last for 30 minutes.

   The third and final apogee motor firing is scheduled for approximately
   six days after liftoff, and will last for approximately six minutes.
   Apogee is the point at which a spacecraft is farthest from the Earth
   and at its minimum velocity. Apogee burns are designed to boost GOES-L
   from its transfer orbit to geosynchronous orbit.

   The primary objective of the GOES-L launch is to provide a full
   capability spacecraft in an on-orbit storage condition, to assure
   continuity in services from a two-spacecraft constellation.

   GOES-L was built and launched for NOAA under technical guidance and
   project management by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

   Background on GOES

   The GOES system is a basic element of U.S. weather monitoring and
   forecast operations and is a key component of NOAA's National Weather
   Service operations and modernization program. Spacecraft and
   ground-based systems work together to accomplish the GOES mission of
   providing weather imagery and quantitative sounding data that form a
   continuous and reliable stream of environmental information used for
   weather forecasting and related services.

   The new series of GOES satellites provides significant improvements
   over the previous GOES system in weather imagery and atmospheric
   sounding information. This enhanced system improves weather services,
   particularly the forecasting of life- and property-threatening severe
   storms.

   GOES I-M represents the next generation of meteorological satellites
   and introduces two new features. The first feature, flexible scan,
   offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures
   of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term
   forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and
   independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather
   forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to
   increase the accuracy of their forecasts.
