   What is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)?
   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. Section 552, is a
   federal law established in 1966 to give private citizens greater access
   to government information. It requires that federal agencies disclose
   the fullest possible amount of information to the public, subject to
   certain exemptions.

   NCLIS Mission:
   The U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science is an

   policy addressing the library and informational needs of the Nation. It
   is composed of fourteen members appointed by the President, with advice
