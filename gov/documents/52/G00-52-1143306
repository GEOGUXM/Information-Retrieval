   SLR satellite missions are categorized by their primary application
   (i.e. geodetic, earth sensing, radio navigation, experimental/special).


   Geodetic Satellites

   Geodetic Missions
   The geodetic satellites are so named for their contribution to geodesy.
   Geodesy is a branch of applied mathematics that determines by
   observations and measurements the exact positions of points on the
   earth's surface; the shape and size of the earth; and the variations of
   the terrestrial gravity and magnetic fields. Read on.


                                                  Earth Sensing Satellites

   Earth Sensing Missions
   The earth sensing satellites carry experiments designed to sense the
   earth (i.e acquire data on worldwide environmental changes such as the
   green house effect, ozone layer depletion, tropical rain forest
   deforestation, and abnormal climatic conditions), in order to
   contribute to international global environmental monitoring. Read on.
   Radio Navigation Satellites

   Radio Navigation Missions
   The radio navigation satellites (Global Positioning System (GPS), and
   GLObal'naya Navigatsionnay Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS)) are United
   States and Russian satellite constellations, respectively. Read on.

                                           Experimental/Special Satellites

   Experimental Missions
   The experimental satellites carry diverse experiments that do not fit
   into one of the other mission classifications (i.e. geodetic, earth
   sensing, positioning). These satellites are irregularly shaped objects
   in relatively low altitude orbits. Read on.
