               History of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network

   The CHTN was formed in 1987 by three organizations along with a
   subcontract with the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). In 1991 the
   Pediatric Division became an independent group and an additional adult
   collection center was added to the CHTN. All six organizations that
   currently comprise the CHTN have extensive experience in providing
   human tissues for research.

   The Ohio State University (OSU) has had an internal tissue procurement
   service sponsored by their Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1975 and
   it joined the CHTN in 1987. Daniel Sedmak, M.D., is the principal
   investigator for this Midwestern Division of the CHTN.

   The Pediatric Division, located at Children's Hospital of Columbus
   under the direction of Stephen J. Qualman, M.D., obtains most of its
   specimens through Children's Oncology Group institutions. Sixty percent
   of all pediatric cancer patients in the United States are treated at
   C.O.G. institutions.

   The University of Alabama at Birmingham's (UAB) Tissue Procurement
   Facility has supplied fresh and snap-frozen human tissues to
   investigators within and outside their Comprehensive Cancer Center
   since 1978. UAB joined the CHTN in 1987. William E. Grizzle, M.D.,
   Ph.D., the principal investigator for this Southern Division of the
   CHTN, is a board-certified clinical and anatomic pathologist as well as
   a funded medical researcher.

   The University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) serves as the Eastern Division
   of the CHTN under the direction of Principal Investigator, Dr. Virginia
   LiVolsi, Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, who has served
   as the Eastern Division P.I. since the inception of the CHTN. During
   that time, the Eastern Division has expanded its tissue procurement
   network to include numerous hospitals in the Eastern region.

   The University of Virginia has had a tissue procurement service since
   1993. It served the NCI as a major tissue supplier for the Cancer
   Genome Anatomy Project. Dr. Christopher Moskaluk, Assistant Professor
   of Pathology, serves as the Principal Investigator of the Mid-Atlantic
   Division.

   Vanderbilt University's Tissue Procurement Facility operated as a
   subcontract tissue procurement site for the CHTN for six years before
   becoming the Western Division of the CHTN in 2001. Dr. Mary Kay
   Washington, Professor of Pathology, is currently the Principal
   Investigator of the Western Division.
