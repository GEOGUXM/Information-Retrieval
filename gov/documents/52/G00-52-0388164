                  Mayor Issues Letter to All City Employees

   (January 28, 2002) Today Mayor Martin Chavez sent the following letter
                             to City employees:

     January 28, 2002

     Dear City Employees:

     By now you have heard or read about the cuts that I recommended
     Friday to the City Council in order that we may balance the general
     fund for this fiscal year. This decision to layoff some of your
     co-workers, and some of the finest public employees is the hardest
     of my public career; but I have to do my job, the budget must and
     will be balanced. The days of smoke and mirrors are over.

     Since I took office in December there has been a fair amount of
     speculation about what cuts I would propose. I understand the unease
     that this might have created, but I did want to make sure that your
     Councilors, the budget team and I had the right information, the
     best numbers and a sound strategy to deal with this critical issue
     facing our city.

     Many of you have worked hard to help us to try to find an equitable
     solution. I appreciate the efforts of all city employees and all the
     great suggestions that have been made in the last few months. Thanks
     to you, these layoffs will be less than 3% of all general fund
     budgeted positions, while in the private sector they are averaging
     from 10% to 15%. However, the City Council and I take no comfort
     that for the affected families, percentages mean very little.

     Those of you who will be laid off have my personnel commitment that
     the Department of Human Resources and other agencies will do their
     utmost to make sure that you receive all the assistance that you
     need to find new employment, and that we will work with all the
     major employers of this community to find you new opportunities. We
     will not leave our fellow employees out in the cold.

     Today, the Council and I start the process of balancing the budget.
     We will do it equitably, not at the expense of non-union employees,
     not by raising every single city fee, and not by unnecessary delays
     that will cost the city more jobs with each pay period that goes by.
     We will all work long and hard to reach a fair solution, because
     Albuquerque and its citizens have so much to offer. Our City has a
     bright future.

     Mayor's Signature
     Mayor Martin J. Chavez
