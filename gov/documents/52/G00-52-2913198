   Daniel S. Katz is the Applications Project Element Manager for the
   Remote Exploration and Experimentation (REE) Project at the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, which
   he joined in 1996. Previous roles at JPL include: Senior Member of the
   Information Systems and Computer Sciences Staff in the Advanced
   Computing Discipline, Team Leader for MOD Tool (a tool for the
   integrated design of microwave and millimeter-wave instruments), and
   Contact Scientist for a grand challenge team working in geophysics in
   NASA's Earth and Space Science (ESS) project. From 1993 to 1996 he was
   employed by Cray Research (and later by Silicon Graphics) as a
   Computational Scientist on-site at JPL and Caltech, specializing in
   parallel implementation of computational electromagnetic algorithms.

   His research interests include: numerical methods, algorithms, and
   programming applied to supercomputing, parallel computing, and cluster
   computing; fault-tolerant computing; and computational methods in both
   electromagnetic wave propagation and geophysics. He received his B.S.,
   M.S., and Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering from Northwestern
   University, Evanston, Illinois, in 1988, 1990, and 1994, respectively.
   His work is documented in numerous book chapters, journal and
   conference publications, and NASA Tech Briefs. He is a senior member of
   the IEEE, designed and maintained (until 2001) the original website for
   the IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society, and serves on the IEEE Task
   Force on Cluster Computing's Advisory Committee.
