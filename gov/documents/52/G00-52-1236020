                             What's New at DOE?

   The East Branch Extension - Phase I project web pages are now
   available. The project pages include a site map, project description,
   team members, conceptual drawings, computer renderings and a slide show
   presentation.

   The Project Geology Branch has been temporarily relocated to the 2nd
   floor of the River City Bank building until remodeling is completed on
   the 5th floor of the Resources building. Phone numbers have changed as
   a result.
