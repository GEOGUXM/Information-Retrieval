Pen and eyeglasses on a book. Tax and Wage Reporting

   If you have employees, you are responsible for several federal, state,
   and local taxes. Some of these taxes apply to employers, some are
   levied upon employees, and some apply to both employers and
   employees. Employment taxes are:
     * Federal income tax withholding
     * Social security and Medicare taxes
     * Federal unemployment tax act (FUTA) tax

   In addition, you are responsible for timely payment or deposit of the
   employment taxes withheld from employees, your matching share of social
   security and Medicare taxes, and any federal unemployment tax act
   (FUTA) tax. The employer's share of the social security, Medicare, and
   all of the FUTA tax deposits are deductible. Be careful to only deduct
   the employer's share of the social security and Medicare taxes. Do not
   deduct gross wages (before deductions for income tax withholding,
   social security, and Medicare) plus the employee's share of social
   security and Medicare. That would be deducting social security and
   Medicare twice. Either deduct gross wages plus the employer's share of
   social security and Medicare, or net wages plus all payments for social
   security and Medicare. For further information about your federal
   requirements with regard to employees, refer to the Reporting section
   or refer to Publication 15, Circular E, Employer's Tax Guide (PDF).

Minimum Wage

   The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime
   pay, recordkeeping, and child labor standards that affect over 100
   million full- and part-time workers in the private sector and in
   federal, state and local governments. Please refer to the Department of
   Labor's Small Business Handbook Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay*.

New Hire Reporting

   New Hire Reporting is the process by which employers report information
   on newly hired employees to a designated state agency shortly after the
   date of hire. For more information, please refer to the Federal Parent
   Locator Service's document Three Things Every Employer Must Know About
   Child Support (PDF).

Poster Requirements

   Some of the statutes and regulations enforced by agencies within the
   Department of Labor (DOL) require that notices be posted in the
   workplace. The DOL Poster Page* provides a list of the required posters
   and links to information about them. For a summary of the requirements,
   refer to Workplace Poster Requirements for Small Businesses and Other
   Employers*.
