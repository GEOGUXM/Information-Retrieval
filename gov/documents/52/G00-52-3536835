                       OSHA RECORDKEEPING RULE TAKES EFFECT

      Simpler, easier to follow requirements for tracking workplace injuries
      and illnesses are now in force for 1.4 million employers covered by
      OSHA's new recordkeeping rule.

      "The new recordkeeping system is easier for employers to understand,
      better protects employee privacy in sensitive cases and will yield more
      accurate injury and illness data," said OSHA Administrator John L.
      Henshaw. "The new OSHA forms are smaller; they fit on legal size paper.
      We've also clarified and simplified the instructions for filling out
      the forms."

      Last month, OSHA mailed forms to employers likely to be covered by the
      rule. In addition, new recordkeeping forms, training materials, fact
      sheets and other assistance are available on OSHA's website at
      www.osha-slc.gov/recordkeeping/index.html to help employers make the
      transition to the new system. Employers can also access the web version
      of a satellite training broadcast the agency aired on Dec. 12, 2001.
      The OSHA website also includes frequently asked questions as well as a
      listing of recordkeeping coordinators and local OSHA offices if
      employers have further questions or need more information.

      As employers switch from the old recordkeeping system to the new one,
      they will need to post their 2001 summary of injuries and illnesses
      during the month of February. Beginning in 2003, the annual summary is
      to be posted for three months-February, March and April.
