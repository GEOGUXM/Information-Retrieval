   "For his pioneering work in applying single-electron tunneling (SET)
   quantum mechanical principles to fundamental electrical metrology,
   realizing the first SET pump having parts per billion accuracy, and
   demonstrating the feasibility of a SET-based capacitance standard."

   Keller came to NIST as a postdoctoral research fellow in 1995 and was
   made a staff member of the NIST Electromagnetic Technology Division in
   1996. His research is directed toward using the fundamental quantum
   properties of nature to create new standards and tools for measurement
   science. His issue is whether it is possible to "count" electrons with
   sufficient accuracy to enable measurement applications of so-called
   single-electron tunneling devices.
