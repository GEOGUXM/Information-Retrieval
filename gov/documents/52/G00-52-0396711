   Understanding Gravity and Microgravity

   In his "thought experiment,"
   Isaac Newton hypothesized that
   by placing a cannon at the top of
   a very tall mountain and firing a
   cannonball at a high enough
   velocity, the cannonball could be
   made to orbit the Earth.

   Gravity is such an accepted part of our lives that we rarely think
   about it even though it affects everything we do. Any time we drop or
   throw something and watch it fall to the ground, we see gravity in
   action. Although gravity is a universal force, there are times when it
   is not desirable to conduct scientific research under its full
   influence. In these cases, scientists perform their experiments in
   microgravity - a condition in which the effects of gravity are greatly
   reduced, sometimes described as "weightlessness."

   Any object in freefall experiences microgravity conditions, which occur
   when the object falls toward the Earth with an acceleration equal to
   that due to gravity alone (approximately 9.8 meters per second squared
   [m/s2], or 1 g at Earth's surface).

   Brief periods of microgravity can be achieved on Earth by dropping
   objects from tall structures. Longer periods are created through the
   use of airplanes, rockets, and spacecraft. The microgravity environment
   associated with the space shuttle is a result of the spacecraft being
   in orbit, which is a state of continuous freefall around the Earth.

   Newton offered a thought experiment to explain how an object could stay
   in orbit while falling toward the Earth. He imagined a cannon at the
   top of a tall mountain that fired cannonballs. Each cannonball was
   acted upon by two forces: the force from the explosion and the force of
   gravity. The combination of the two forces would cause the cannonballs
   to travel in an arc. If the cannonballs were fired with more and more
   energy, they would hit the ground farther and farther away from the
   cannon. If the cannonball was fired with enough energy, it would fall
   entirely around the Earth and return to its starting point, completing
   an orbit.

   Instead of being fired from a cannon atop a mountain, a spacecraft is
   launched in a trajectory that arcs above the Earth. When a particular
   speed and altitude are attained, the craft's falling path will be
   parallel to the curvature of the Earth, and a microgravity environment
   is established.

   This microgravity environment gives researchers a unique opportunity to
   study the fundamental states of matter - solids, liquids, and gases -
   and the forces that affect them. In microgravity, researchers can
   isolate and study the influence of gravity on physical processes, as
   well as phenomena that are normally masked by gravity and thus
   difficult, if not impossible, to study on Earth.
