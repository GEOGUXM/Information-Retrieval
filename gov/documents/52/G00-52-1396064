   Application Submission Authority:
   A jurisdiction's chief executive officer or designee is responsible for
   certifying the accuracy of its online application and electronically
   submitting it to DOJ, requesting payments, dispersing funds, and
   ensuring compliance with applicable program standards and requirements.
   The chief executive is the jurisdiction's highest-ranking
   administrative or elected official, such as the mayor, city manager,
   county executive, or state governor. Designees are typically higher
   level managers in the chief executive's office or in one of the
   participating law enforcement agencies. Federal payments are sent
   electronically to the jurisdiction's bank account, identified during
   the registration process.

                    Option 1: Single-level Application
   A Single-level Application is designed for smaller jurisdictions with
   only one participating law enforcement agency or for larger
   jurisdictions, where only one of several law enforcement agencies has
   decided to participate. This option is managed exclusively through an
   online "Jurisdiction Handbook," created during the jurisdiction
   registration process.

                    Option 2: Multi-level Application

   A Multi-level Application is designed for a larger jurisdiction that
   determines it wants one or more of its eligible law enforcement
   agencies (LEA's) to directly participate in the online application
   process.
   This option requires a primary point of contact for the jurisdiction
   that coordinates the BVP program, and additional points of contact
   within each participating LEA. This option combines the use of an
   online "Jurisdiction Handbook," created during the jurisdiction
   registration process and a "Law Enforcement Agency Handbook" for each
   participating LEA, created during the law enforcement agency
   registration process.
