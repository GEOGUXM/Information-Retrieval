     * With the aid of diagrams, explain the relative positions of the
       Sun, Earth, and Moon
       at the times of lunar and solar eclipses.

     Girl Scout Merit Badge Requirements

     During Eclipse 99, the National Air and Space Musem in Washington,
     D.C., will have a camp-in for local cadette and senior Girl Scouts.
     During this camp-in, the participants will work on the "Space
     Exploration" Interest Project. The requirements that they will try
     to complete:

     Skill Builder #2

   Learn about the history of Space Exploration.

     Skill Builder #3

     * Learn more about the Sun and the Moon and their relationship to
       Earth.
     * Demonstrate what happens during a solar and/or lunar eclipse.
     * Learn to read an ocean tide chart.
     * Identify a tale or superstition about the Sun or the Moon. Discuss
       whether or not this is a valid or even measurable belief.

     Technology #1

   Find out about the capabilities of today's telescopes. If possible,
   visit an observatory or a site on the Web to learn more about
   telescopes.

     Service Project

   Ask prospective participants to read the Space Explorer Interest
   Project. Then choose a Service Project, and come with a written
   description of how they would implement it.

     Career Exploration

     * Investigate at least two of the following careers and show how they
       are linked to the space program: biomedical engineering,
       meteorology, ceramics, chemistry, industrial engineering, materials
       science, metallurgy, optical engineering, physiology, and
       photography.
     * Plan to attend a "space camp" or astronomy camp to get more
       hands-on experience.
