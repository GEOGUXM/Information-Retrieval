                 6 March 2001: Solar Wind Layers Impede Cosmic Ray Access to Solar
                 System
                 Dr. Len Burlaga reports the identification of discrete disturbed
                 regions in the distant solar wind that scatter cosmic rays and impede
                 their access to the inner solar system and the region of the Earth.
                 Variations of cosmic ray flux into our atmosphere are thought to
                 produce variations in the electrical and ice nucleation properties of
                 our atmosphere, possibly affecting our weather.

                 26 January 2001: IMAGE Mission Featured on Science Cover
                 The Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)
                 mission is a cover story in Science magazine. A paper by PI Jim Burch
                 et al. chronicles the pioneering new observations of space weather made
                 by IMAGE. Never before have we been able to see the plasma clouds
                 swirling around the earth as they form and dissipate during geospace
                 storms. This first publication on IMAGE results features images of the
                 cold plasmas in scattered extreme ultraviolet sunlight, and the hot
                 plasmas of the ring current in energetic neutral atom glow, as shown in
                 the linked image. On the left is a blue EUV image showing formation of
                 a spiral plasma tail on the left side of the plasmasphere, around the
                 Earth. The plasmasphere temperature is around 5000째C or 9000째F. On the
                 right is an image of the "ring" of hot plasma just outside the
                 plasmasphere, carrying electrical current around the Earth. The
                 temperature of the ring current is nearly 1 Billion 째C or 1.8 Billion
                 째F. Of course, these images don't do justice to the dynamic behavior of
                 these two important plasma regions near the Earth. Please visit the
                 IMAGE site for more information about this exciting mission, and watch
                 for further science articles in a special issue of Geophysical Research
                 Letters (American Geophysical Union).

                 9 January 2001: Discovery of Solar Wind Low Energy Neutral Atoms by the
                 IMAGE/LENA imager.
                 The signal that is observed by the LENA imager when it looks toward the
                 sun has been conclusively shown to consist mainly of energetic neutral
                 atoms from the solar wind. These atoms are formed when solar wind ions
                 exchange electrons with slow interplanetary atoms, producing a fast
                 atom and a slow ion. They are seen even when the sun is beyond the
                 field of view of the LENA imager, because the solar wind envelops the
                 magnetosphere and exchanges charge with the extended geocorona or
                 exosphere of the Earth. These results are reported in a paper to appear
                 shortly in the Journal of Geophysical Research.

                 November 2000: Popular Science chooses Cluster Mission among the "Best
                 of Whats New 2000"
                 As Cluster II NASA project scientist, Dr. Melvyn Goldstein recently
                 traveled to New York city to accept an award from the magazine Popular
                 Science on behalf of the Cluster II project, as summarized in a Code
                 692 Science Nugget. Popular Science has designated Cluster II as one of
                 100 projects selected as the "Best of Whats New 2000. More information
                 about the Cluster II project can be found here. Commissioning of the
                 four Cluster spacecraft is continuing. Almost all of the instruments
                 have been turned on and have begun to collect data. Very little
                 processed data is yet available. However, some processed data from the
                 Wide Band Data (WBD) instrument run by the Univiversity of Iowa can be
                 viewed at their web site
