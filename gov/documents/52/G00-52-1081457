   Rich Interaction Environments

   The power of the computer meets the power of the imagination.

   Challenges
   - To take what we know we can do and apply the technology to solving
     real problems
   - To create computers that learn from and adapt to us as we go about
     our daily lives
   - To create computers that are socially aware
   - More About Challenges
   Benefits
   - No learning curve-we get the benefits while giving full attention to
     our daily tasks
   - Improved health and safety
   - Prevent potential tragedies
   - Immediate enhancement of our everyday lives
   - More About Benefits

      Imagine...
        * a computer that understands you
        * a computer that adapts to you
        * a computer that responds to your touch.

   This is the computer that RIE can build. With RIE, you don't need to
   understand the computer...the computer understands and responds to YOU.
   This is the world of pervasive computing, which weaves computing into
   the very fabric of our lives.

   Imagine...
     * You sit down at a computer you've never used before. Before you can
       do your work, you need to understand how this computer is
       configured, where the software and files you need are located. You
       spend time finding what you need and learning how to get it to do
       what you want it to do.
     * Now imagine you sit down at that same computer with RIE. This
       computer does the work for you. It responds to you; it adapts to
       you and your needs and skill level. All you have to do is...your
       work!

   RIE offers computing without the hassle. And RIE can put us into a
   computing space without a computer as we know it...computing away from
   the desktop.

   Imagine...
     * a device in your car that warns you if you're too still or show
       signs of drowsiness.
     * a smart key that reads your blood alcohol level...and won't let you
       start your car if it's too high.
     * sensors in your clothing that read your blood pressure, heart rate,
       pulse, respiration rate, etc., let you know when you need
       medication, and contact your doctor if there's an emergency.

   All of these tools and more like them exist. And at PNNL the RIE staff
   can put these tools to work for you. PNNL has the capabilities and
   accepts the challenge to apply these existing technologies to solving
   real problems. RIE staff have already achieved considerable success in
   developing pervasive computing tools.

   Detailed plan of Capability Development at PNNL Researchers in RIE at
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory attempt to overcome the
   limitations especially evident in pervasive computing environments by
   developing capability in four areas: multimodal interaction, contextual
   adaptation, socially-aware software, and enriched multimedia
   communication capabilities. We intend to rely not only on our
   breakthroughs in related areas, but also on solutions that we acquire
   off-the-shelf and in collaboration with external partners.
