          Grass-Roots Gurus Funds - a practical application of symbiotic
          intelligence

        A popular article about how online communties literally playing in
                the stock market are the source for investments for mutual
                funds (for example, StockJungle.com). The article closes
                with a summary of how Norman Johnson's work might explain
                the better performance of the collectives, even though
                they don't have experts.

          Diversity in Decentralized Systems:Enabling Self-Organizing
          Solutions

        by N.L. Johnson. Presented at the Decentralization II Conference,
                UCLA, November 19-20, 1999 (LA-UR 99-6281) PDF file
                (168K).

          This paper was presented to a group of social scientists
          (anthropology, political science, economics, business, etc.)
          concerned with how decentralization influences the functioning
          of organizations. This paper contains careful definitions of
          terms, such as agent, local/global, robust/fragile,
          self-organizing, chaotic/stable, diversity and common world view
          (context). The advantages and disadvantages of decentralized
          systems are presented.
