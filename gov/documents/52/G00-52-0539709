   About the Custom News Service
   The Custom News Service is available to anyone wishing to know about
   new NSF publications. Here are some basic points about how it works.
   For more information, please see our Custom News Service help pages.
     * To subscribe, you need an Internet email account.
     * Once you subscribe, you will get an email from us confirming your
       subscription. If you don't hear from us, send a message to
       webmaster@nsf.gov.
     * After subscribing, be sure to create your "profile" of publications
       you want to be told about.
     * This automatically creates a custom web page for you, which you
       access using your Internet email account.
     * You must visit this web page at least once every twelve months to
       keep your subscription current.
     * You can choose to be notified via email when new documents matching
       your profile are added to the NSF Online Document System. Emails
       include links to the electronic location of each document, and/or
       full text of short documents.
     * A weekly email alert listing all documents added the previous week
       is available under "Notification Options" when you set up or modify
       your profile.

   We hope you will find this service useful. If you have any questions or
   comments, please send them to webmaster@nsf.gov.
