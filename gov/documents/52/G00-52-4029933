   [tom_with_unit3.jpg] The C-ACT Web Site sports a new look for 2001,
   with an expanded collection of individual Team Sites within the C-ACT
   Group. The site now brings together four of the five Teams of the
   Applied Chemical Technologies Group, which should help you to
   understand how our scientists use various tools to examine real-world
   problems and come up with real solutions. The site is now more
   technologically rich; some pages have short movie clips playing within
   the HTML page, others have links to files on a streaming server, and
   still others provide a link to PDF forms for LANL employees that help
   them get things done easier and more efficiently.


                       C-ACT brings the site together

                  Supercritical Fluids Experimentation Team

                          Materials Separation Team

                    Biological & Chemical Technology Lab

                      Materials Testing & Compatibility

   In addition to all this, you can now check out our fully animated
   version of the C-ACT site by clicking the animated Flash graphic at the
   bottom of each left-hand navigation bar.

   In addition to the regular crew of Full Moon Consulting, kudos go out
   to the following who provided immeasurable assistance:

   Mike Maikranz: Assistant Designer in the design and development of the
   original Polymer Filtration web site. Designed the animation that plays
   at the bottom of the PF Main Page.

   Regina Gallegos: Assistant Designer in the design and development of
   the original Polymer Filtration web site. Assisted with management and
   dissemination of search engine queries.

   Michelle Schmick, SpearedFish Design Studios: Creative Consultant hired
   as a subcontractor under the Full Moon Consulting contract with LANL.
   Michelle designed the interface to the existing site, creating versions
   for the C-ACT Group, SCF, PF, and BIO/CHEM Teams. She also designed
   initial Flash animations for the CO[2] recycle process and interactive
   map to TA-46.
