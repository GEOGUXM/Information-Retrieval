May 2001

   Visitors in Bartholdi Park gaze at the Conservatory and see glass being
   installed in the Palm House. Looking up from their work, Botanic Garden
   staff members see "the light at the end of the tunnel." Here's a quick
   update on what's finished, in progress, and coming up:
     * The East and West Galleries
       With new walls, skylights, ceilings, lights, flooring, and doors
       now installed, the galleries are listed as substantially complete.
       The decorative radiator grilles, original to the building, have
       been beautifully refinished and most have been reinstalled. Only a
       few final items remain, such as installation of the mullions in the
       windows.
     * The Orangerie
       Finish work on the new ceilings is proceeding. The glass partitions
       and doors that define the foyer have been installed.
     * The "Low Houses"
       The Garden Primeval, World Deserts, Medicinal Plants, Plant
       Exploration, Oasis, and Orchid houses are substantially complete.
       All custom interior hardscapes, e.g., rocks, trees, pools, and
       walkways, have been installed. Work on door installation, lights,
       computer control systems, shade cloth, electrical wiring, and fine
       tuning of special plumbing systems is nearly complete or in the
       testing stages. In the houses on the west side, workers
       intermittently feel a gentle mist as the environmental control
       system cycles the system on and off. The shade cloth moves, the
       vents open, the mist sprays, and air circulates--all in response to
       measurements from sensors. The system is being tested now to see if
       it performs as designed.
     * New "Connecting Houses"
       Finish work on the edging and paving for the beds and walkways is
       ongoing in the Plant Adaptations and Rare and Endangered Species
       areas. These are new glasshouse spaces that connect the old
       Subtropical House with the East and West Low Houses. In addition to
       buffering the Garden Court from extreme seasonal heat and cold
       drafts, they provide access through the Conservatory when the
       Galleries are closed and routes for fully accessible pathways.
     * Palm House and Garden Court
       In what appears to be a giant metal beehive of activity, workers
       can be seen moving at all levels across the framework to install
       the remaining glass outside and the conduit, wiring, plumbing, and
       electronic devices inside that will operate the lights, audio, and
       misting systems. Finish work on the pools, pumping systems, and
       ducting will soon begin. Similar work is ongoing in the Garden
       Court. All construction is scheduled to be completed by mid-July in
       the Garden Court and mid-August in the Palm House.
     * Planting and Interior Signage
       The first plants have been installed! Eight large trees, including
       some historic plants, were installed by the contractor in the Plant
       Exploration House during the week of May 14. They are being
       monitored and appear to be recovering well from the shock of being
       transplanted. Planting of large trees by the contractor will
       continue through June in the remaining low houses and through July
       and August in the Garden Court and Jungle (Palm House). In all of
       the houses, beginning in July and approximately three to four weeks
       following contractor installation, the Botanic Garden staff will
       install the remaining plants in successive waves of activity.
       Planting will continue through the fall and into November, but the
       pace of the progress will depend somewhat on summer heat levels.
       Installation of the interior wayfinding and interpretive signage,
       which is now being fabricated, is expected in October and November.
     * Interior Courtyards and Exterior Landscaping
       Installation of infrastructure and utilities, such as irrigation
       systems, plumbing, and foundations for pools, and paving, is under
       way or will proceed throughout the summer and fall under a schedule
       that is separate from the Conservatory building project. Final
       planting will not begin in the courtyards and exterior beds of the
       Conservatory until Fall of 2001.

   Opening Date!
   Plans now call for the Conservatory to open to the public on Tuesday,
   December 11, at 10 a.m. A formal public dedication will take place
   early in December. The date of the dedication has not yet been decided.
