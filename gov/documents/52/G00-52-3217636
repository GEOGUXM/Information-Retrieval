      This region (NOAA Active Region AR6659, June 10, 1991) produced some of
      the most powerful flares ever recorded and remained active over many
      days. It also illustrates how magnetic shear (twisting of the Sun's
      magnetic field), is related to solar flares.

      The data shown here were taken with the Marshall Space Flight Center's
      Vector Magnetograph and the co-aligned Hydrogen alpha (H-alpha)
      telescope. The vector magnetograph looks at light with a wavelength of
      525.0 nanometers produced by iron in the solar photosphere. The H-alpha
      telescope is sensitive to the spectral line at 656.3 nanometers,
      originating in the Sun's chromosphere, the layer of the solar
      atmosphere just above the photosphere. Thus, the magnetic fields traced
      by the chromospheric structures in the H-alpha image overlay the
      photospheric field measured by the vector magnetograph.

      The sequence of images shown above spans more than a nine hour period
      from 12:07 to 21:20 Universal Time (UT), (7:07am to 4:20pm central
      daylight savings time). The data include two M-class flares: an M6.4
      flare starting at 13:53 UT and ending at 15:27 UT; and an M3.2 flare
      starting at 16:53 UT and ending at 18:01 UT.

      The H-alpha images are displayed in the left-hand panel of the
      animation. The magnetic field measurements are displayed on top of the
      H-alpha image in the right-hand panel. The solid lines are "neutral
      lines" that separate areas with opposite magnetic polarity (positive
      from negative or north from south). The tickmarks point in the
      direction of the horizontal, or transverse, component of the magnetic
      field. Normally the transverse field is directed across (or
      perpendicular to) the neutral lines so that the magnetic field lines
      travel from the positive polarity regions directly to the negative
      polarity regions. In this example we see several areas where the
      tickmarks are directed almost parallel to the neutral lines. The
      magnetic field is said to be sheared in these regions.

      Over the last few years we have found that flaring activity is closely
      associated with sheared magnetic fields. Measurements of magnetic shear
      in and around sunspots allows us to predict the occurance of many large
      solar flares.
