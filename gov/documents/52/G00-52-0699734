   Attorney Assistance Disbursement Procedures Clerk of Court 02/13/2001

                           Disbursement Procedures

   To avoid some of the delays the clerk's office has experienced in
   disbursing funds, the following information is being provided to assist
   attorneys in preparing judgements and orders for disbursement.
   Civil Disbursements
   Amounts of $5,000.00 or more that are deposited as security with the
   Court are deposited into interest bearing accounts; therefore, orders
   for disbursements for amounts of $5,000.00 or more must include the
   following information:
   (1) The amount of principal to be disbursed;
   (2) If more than one payee, the name of each payee and the amount each
   payee is to receive;
   (3) A provision that the Clerk of Court shall disburse any accrued
   interest;
   (3) If more than one payee, the percentage of interest each payee is to
   receive.
   Please note that if the security is deposited into an interest bearing
   account and the order does not mention disbursement of interest, only
   the principal amount will be released and a second order for
   disbursement of interest will be required.
   In addition to the order, the IRS requires the completion of form W-9
   (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) when
   disbursements are made for money that is deposited into interest
   bearing accounts. The original W-9 form must be submitted to the Fiscal
   Department, along with a memorandum or note indicating the case name
   and number. The W-9 form should not be attached to the original
   judgement or order when submitted for to the Court for approval. The
   Fiscal Department will hold the W-9 until a signed copy of the
   judgement or the order is received. W-9 forms can be obtained from the
   IRS, the Fiscal Department, or from the Court's website at
   www.cacd.uscourts.gov.
   Any amounts deposited as security with the Court that are less than
   $5,000.00 are deposited into the general registry which is a
   non-interest bearing account. Disbursements from that type of account
   do not require a W-9 form.
   Criminal Disbursements
   The disbursement requirements for Judgment and Probation/Commitment
   Orders are handled the same way as disbursements for orders and
   judgments. Since 1997, all amounts deposited as security in the amount
   of $5,000.00 or more are deposited into interest bearing accounts;
   therefore, when a bond is exonerated upon surrender or if a bond is
   ordered exonerated, and the deposit for that bond was placed in an
   interest bearing account, the order must include language that
   disbursement is for the principal amount, "together with any accrued
   interest, if applicable." An exact amount of interest is not required.
   Please note that prior to 1997, all money deposited as security,
   regardless of the amount, was deposited in the general, non-interest
   bearing, registry account.
   Criminal form CR-7 (Affidavit re Appearance Bond, Cash Security) has
   been amended to include the social security number of the owner of the
   cash security. If an attorney or authorized agent of the owner of the
   cash security is making the deposit, the attorney or authorized agent
   must know the social security number of the owner of the cash security.
   The affidavit, which is completed at the Fiscal Department at the time
   the cash is deposited as security, is needed only if the cash security
   is placed into an interest bearing account. Form CR-7 can be obtained
   from the Court's website at www.cacd.uscourts.gov.
   If you have any questions regarding disbursement orders please contact
   Regina Newcomer, Fiscal Assistant Supervisor, at 213-894-3676.
