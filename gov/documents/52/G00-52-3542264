   Rod Paige was confirmed by the United States Senate as the 7th
   Secretary of Education on January 20, 2001, following the inauguration
   of President George W. Bush.

   Born in Monticello, Mississippi, Secretary Paige is the son of public
   school educators. He earned a bachelor's degree from Jackson State
   University in Mississippi and a Master's degree and a doctorate from
   Indiana University.

   Although Secretary Paige first distinguished himself coaching
   college-level athletics, he always has been committed to public
   education and the preparation of teachers to excel in their profession.
   He served for a decade as Dean of the College of Education at Texas
   Southern University. He also established the university's Center for
   Excellence in Urban Education, a research facility that concentrates on
   issues related to instruction and management in urban school systems.

   As a trustee and an officer of the Board of Education of the Houston
   Independent School District (HISD) from 1989 to 1994, Secretary Paige
   coauthored the board's A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions, a
   statement of purpose and goals for the school district that called for
   fundamental reform through decentralization, a focus on instruction,
   accountability at all levels, and development of a core curriculum. A
   Declaration of Beliefs and Visions was the catalyst that launched the
   ongoing, comprehensive restructuring of HISD.

   Secretary Paige became the superintendent of schools of HISD in 1994.
   As superintendent, Secretary Paige created the Peer Examination,
   Evaluation, and Redesign (PEER) program, which solicits recommendations
   from business and community professionals for strengthening school
   support services and programs. He launched a system of charter schools
   that have broad authority in decisions regarding staffing, textbooks,
   and materials. He saw to it that HISD paid teachers salaries
   competitive with those offered by other large Texas school districts.
   Secretary Paige made HISD the first school district in the state to
   institute performance contracts modeled on those in the private sector,
   whereby senior staff members' continued employment with HISD is based
   on their performance. He also introduced teacher incentive pay, which
   rewards teachers for outstanding performance and creative solutions to
   educational problems.

   Secretary Paige has served on review committees of the Texas Education
   Agency and the State Board of Education's Task Force on High School
   Education, and he has chaired the Youth Employment Issues Subcommittee
   of the National Commission for Employment Policy of the U.S. Department
   of Labor. He is a member of the National Association for the
   Advancement of Colored People. He is a former member of the Houston Job
   Training Partnership Council, the Community Advisory Board of Texas
   Commerce Bank, the American Leadership Forum, and the Board of
   Directors of the Texas Business and Education Coalition. Inside Houston
   named Secretary Paige one of "Houston's 25 most powerful people" in
   guiding the city's growth and prosperity.

   Secretary Paige has been active on the Education Commission of the
   States, as well as the Council of the Great City Schools, which
   bestowed on him its Richard R. Green Award as the outstanding urban
   educator of 1999. In 2000 Secretary Paige received the Harold W.
   McGraw, Jr., Prize in Education for his extraordinary commitment to the
   improvement of education and the National Association of Black School
   Educators' Superintendent of the Year award. In 2001, he was named the
   National Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of
   School Administrators.
