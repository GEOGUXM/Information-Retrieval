      Privacy Policy

         This policy describes the cityofhouston.gov privacy practices regarding
         information collected from visitors to the site. It contains
         information about what data is collected and how that information is
         used. The cityofhouston.gov privacy policy applies only to this Web
         site. When you follow a link to another site, even the sites of state
         agencies and local governments, this policy will not apply. You should
         check the privacy policy of each of these sites if you have concerns
         about how they handle personally identifiable information. This policy
         may be updated periodically, so please check back from time to time.
         Collection and Use of Information

         cityofhouston.gov does not sell or rent personally identifiable
         information. Please be aware that when you provide information to any
         government entity, however, that information may be subject to the
         Texas Public Information Act and applicable federal legislation.
         Information about the Texas Public Information Act is available from
         the Office of the Attorney General at
         http://www.oag.state.tx.us/opinopen/opengovt.htm. Each governmental
         body must be contacted directly about the records they keep and their
         use of personally identifiable information.

         The cityofhouston.gov Web site utilizes server logs and log analysis
         tools to create summary statistics about the use of the Web site. The
         summary statistics are used for purposes such as assessing what
         information is of most interest to users, determining technical design
         specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

         For online government transactions conducted on the cityofhouston.gov
         Web site, you will be asked to enter certain information about yourself
         and/or the organization with which you are affiliated. The specifics of
         this information will vary as required by the type of transaction and
         the governmental body involved. In each case, the information requested
         will include the same information that would be requested if you
         performed the identical transaction in person rather than online.
         Whenever personal information is requested from you on this site, there
         will be an indication of whether your disclosure of such information is
         mandatory or optional. Information collected in the course of the
         transaction is used for the following purposes:
           * To conduct online transactions with the appropriate government
             entities (e.g., the payment of sales tax or the renewal of a
             license or permit).
           * To send you an e-mail confirming your transaction.
           * To forward new product announcements or content features to you,
             only if you have chosen to request this service.

         cityofhouston.gov may be required by law enforcement or judicial
         authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the
         appropriate governmental authorities. cityofhouston.gov fully
         cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use
         our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to
         law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe
         to be unlawful.
         Security

         This site uses a secure server for conducting online transactions. All
         credit card and other payment information that you transmit to us will
         be protected by 128-bit encryption technology, provided your browser is
         properly configured and your computer is operating properly. Security
         technology requires that you have a reasonably current browser that is
         capable of supporting 128-bit encryption. Current browsers such as
         these will activate the appropriate security features when you enter an
         online transaction through this site. In general, you can determine
         whether you are on a secure site by looking at the symbol at the bottom
         of your browser screen. You can be sure you are using a secure server
         if the key is unbroken or the lock is locked.

         We limit employee access to personally identifiable information to only
         those employees who need access to perform a specific job. All
         employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

         of your transaction. The cookie will be destroyed after a few minutes
         of inactivity, successfully completing a transaction or when the
