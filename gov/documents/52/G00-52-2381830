                           Monitoring Data Entry System

   The Monitoring Data Entry System provides a portable, user-friendly way
    of entering and transfering monitoring data and schedule information
       to/from contract monitors via conventional phone lines and the
   internet. It was revolutionary when it was conceived in 1993 and it is
    still the only system of its kind used for broadcast monitoring data
                                   entry.

   In late 1993 IBB and AllPen Software developed an application for the
   Apple Newton MessagePad product that facilitated monitoring according
   to a pre-determined schedule WITHOUT the use of paper forms. At the end
   of a monitoring week, the data could be retrieved by internet e-mail
   message or a phone call from Washington or a regional Technical
   Monitoring Office. The same phone call resulted in the monitor's
   schedule being automatically updated.

   In November 1995 we conducted a week-long meeting in St. Petersburg,
   Russia with a group of 20 Russian/CIS contract monitors where we
   distributed the first Newtons.

   Here is a picture of some of 'the guys' getting their first look at the
   Newton and using it to monitor.

   In 2001 IBB replaced the Newton-based system with one based on the Palm
   OS. As the rugged Newtons are gradually phased out they will be
   replaced by Palm units.
