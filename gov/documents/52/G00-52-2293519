                 Lightning - The Under-rated Weather Hazard

     The Threat

     Lightning is the #2 storm killer in the U.S., killing more than
     hurricanes or tornadoes. Only floods kill more. But the real story
     of lightning isn't the deaths, it's the injuries. Only about 10% of
     those struck are killed; 90% survive. But of the survivors, the
     large majority suffers life-long severe injury. These injuries are
     primarily neurological, with a wide range of symptoms, and are very
     difficult to diagnose. Lightning also causes about $5 billion of
     economic loss each year in the U.S.

     The Solution

     Public education is the key! The vast majority of lightning
     casualties can be easily, quickly, and cheaply avoided, if only the
     public knew what to do. The public needs increased awareness of the
     lightning hazard and increased knowledge of lightning safety.

     Lightning Safety

     Lightning safety is easy. But lightning safety is also inconvenient.
     It requires diligence and continual reinforcement and encouragement.
     Lightning safety is a multi-step process, with each step providing a
     decreasing level of protection plan around the weather, and have a
     lightning safety plan.

                No Place Outside is Safe Near Thunderstorms!
                               [Hidden Spacer]

     Step 1:

   If you are planning to be outside, watch the weather forecast and know
   your local weather patterns. Plan around the weather to avoid the
   lightning hazard.
   [Hidden Spacer]
     Step 2: If you are going to be outside anyway, stay near proper
   shelter and use the 30-30 Rule' to know when to seek proper shelter.

       30-30 Rule'

   When you see lightning, count the time until you hear thunder. If this
   time is 30 seconds or less, seek proper shelter. If you can't see the
   lightning, just hearing the thunder is a good back-up rule. Wait 30
   minutes or more after hearing the last thunder before leaving shelter.

   [Hidden Spacer]
     Step 3:

   Seek proper shelter when required. Don't hesitate, seek shelter
   immediately. The lightning casualty stories are replete with events
   where people were about to make it to shelter when they were struck; if
   they'd just started a minute earlier, they'd have been safe.
   [Hidden Spacer]
       Proper Shelter:

   The best shelter commonly available against lightning is a large fully
   enclosed substantially constructed building, e.g. your typical house.
   Substantially constructed means it has wiring and plumbing in the
   walls. Once inside, stay away from any conducting path to the outside.
   Stay off the corded telephone. Stay away from electrical appliances,
   lighting, and electric sockets. Stay away from plumbing. Don't watch
   lightning from windows or doorways. Inner rooms are generally better.

   If you can't get to a house, a vehicle with a solid metal roof and
   metal sides is a reasonable second choice. As with a house, avoid
   contact with conducting paths going outside: close the windows, lean
   away from the door, put your hands in your lap, don't touch the
   steering wheel, ignition, gear shifter, or radio. Convertibles, cars
   with fiberglass or plastic shells, and open framed vehicles don't count
   as lightning shelters.

                                    MYTH:
    Cars are safe because the rubber tires insulate them from the ground.
                                   TRUTH:
                 Cars are safe because of their metal shell.
                               [Hidden Spacer]
     Step 4:

   If you can't get to proper lightning shelter, at least avoid the most
   dangerous locations and activities. Avoid higher elevations. Avoid
   wide-open areas, including sports fields. Avoid tall isolated objects
   like trees, poles, and light posts. Avoid water-related activities:
   boating, swimming (includes indoor pools), and fishing. Avoid golfing.
   Avoid open vehicles like farm tractors, open construction vehicles,
   riding lawnmowers, golf carts (even with roofs), etc. Avoid unprotected
   open buildings like picnic pavilions, rain shelters, and bus stops.
   Avoid metal fences and metal bleachers.

           DO NOT GO UNDER TREES TO KEEP DRY DURING THUNDERSTORMS!

                               [Hidden Spacer]

     Step 5:

   USE THIS AS A DESPERATE LAST RESORT ONLY! If you've made several bad
   decisions and are outside far away from proper shelter and lightning
   threatens, proceed to the safest location. If lightning is imminent, it
   will sometimes give a very few seconds of warning. Sometimes your hair
   will stand-up on end, or your skin will tingle, or light metal objects
   will vibrate, or you'll hear a crackling or "kee-kee" sound. If this
   happens and you're in a group, spread out so there are several body
   lengths between each person. If one person is struck, the others may
   not be hit and can give first aid. Once you've spread out, use the
   lightning crouch; put your feet together, squat down, tuck your head,
   and cover your ears. When the immediate threat of lightning has passed,
   continue heading to the safest spot possible. Remember, this is a
   desperate last resort; you are much safer having followed the previous
   steps and not gotten into this high-risk situation.

     Step 6:

   All deaths from lightning are cardiac arrest and stopped breathing. CPR
   and mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation are the recommended first aid,
   respectively.

                                    MYTH:
       Lightning victims are electrified. If you touch them, you'll be
                                electrocuted.
                                   TRUTH:
     It is perfectly safe to touch a lightning victim to give them first
                                    aid.



   NO LIGHTNING SAFETY GUIDELINES WILL GIVE 100% GUARANTEED TOTAL SAFETY,
     BUT THESE STEPS WILL HELP YOU AVOID THE VAST MAJORITY OF LIGHTNING
                                 CASUALTIES.
