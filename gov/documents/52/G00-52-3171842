   Daneil Cabrera - Elk Grove Unified School District, CA:  I feel that
   this trip was truly remarkable.  It was educational yet fun.
   Everything I did was always demonstrating a different aspect of
   Japanese day-to-day life or history.  I really enjoyed my trip,
   everything was perfect: the family, the school, especially the food!
   If I had a chance to go again, I would take it.

   Jamal Cool - Lick-Wilmerding High School, San Francisco, CA:  My
   impression about Japanese people were changed very much.  They are more
   like us than we are led to believe by popular media and news.  My stay
   in Japan was extremely enjoyable, the people are friendly, the food is
   great and I felt comfortable everywhere.

   Ian MacLEod - West Hills High School, La Mesa, CA:  I really enjoyed my
   stay in Japan.  This program eliminated the generalizations that we are
   led to believe about the people of Japan.

   Naoko Nakamura - Ibaraki High School, Ibaraki, Japan:  Two weeks was
   too short!  It seemed that we had only just arrived in Sacramento and
   we had to start saying good-bye.  The Scholars Exchange Program was my
   first trip abroad.  Even though I couldn't speak English so well, my
   host family was very nice to me.  They made me feel comfortable and
   made the effort to bring up all kinds of topics we could talk about.
