       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Current Events

   OSEI flood products (FLD) include multichannel color composite imagery
   and single-channel grayscale imagery of enlarged river areas or
   increased sediment flow. Typically, these events are displayed by
   comparison to imagery taken when flooding was not occurring.

      The following image files have recently been added to the Floods
