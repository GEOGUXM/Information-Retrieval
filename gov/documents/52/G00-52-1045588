                               Identity Theft

   Identity theft occurs when a criminal uses another person's personal
   information to take on that person's identity. Identity theft is much
   more than misuse of a Social Security number-it can also include credit
   card and mail fraud. To help victims, SSA provides:
     * hotline numbers,

          + SSA's Fraud Hotline-1-800-269-0271,
          + Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ID Theft Hotline-1-877-IDTHEFT
            (438-4338)

     * up-to-date information about steps you can take to work with credit
       bureaus and law enforcement agencies to reclaim your identity;
     * a replacement card if your Social Security card was stolen;
     * help to correct your earnings records; and
     * a new Social Security number in certain circumstances.

   SSA is taking steps to ensure that Social Security numbers are less
   accessible. We are strengthening our processes for issuing new Social
   Security numbers as well as replacement Social Security cards.
   Additionally, we are partnering with other federal agencies to find
   ways to detect and prevent identity theft.

   Anyone who intentionally uses the Social Security number of another
   person to establish a new identity or defraud the government will be
   prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
