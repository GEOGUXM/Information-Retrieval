            Transboundary Environmental Issues in Central Europe

                                Map Animation

   This study is an initial data-gathering stage of a larger project
   concerned with the socioeconomic impacts from existing and potential
   transboundary environmental degradation in Central Europe. This region
   comprises Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech
   Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Slovakia,
   and Slovenia. The data on transboundary contamination in this region
   are important for further work in anticipating and ameliorating
   potential socioeconomic impacts and hence affecting the stability of
   the transition economy countries of Central Europe.

   This study focused on four primary objectives:
     * Identifying data concerning the major sources of
       contaminants/pollutants in Central Europe;
     * Determining the potential for transboundary environmental
       pollution, by water and air transport, among Central European
       states;
     * Providing a preliminary assessment of existing environmental
       management and infrastructure and describing some of the challenges
       these entities face; and
     * Making recommendations for follow-on activities related to helping
       mitigate the effects of transboundary migration of pollutants in
       Central Europe.

   For the most part, the documentation of environmental contaminants in
   these countries has led to large regional characterization of air and
   water quality or featured site-specific characterization. This study
   focused on the information regarding air and water quality
   characterization.

   The study is documented in the following sections:

     * Air Quality Concerns

     * Water Quality Concerns

     * Environmental Management and Infrastructure (including
       Recommendations)
