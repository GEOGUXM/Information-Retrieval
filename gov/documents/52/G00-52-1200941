                              Benjamin Franklin

   Ben Franklin (1706-1790) Hello kids! Allow me to introduce myself. My
   name is Benjamin Franklin. I will be your guide throughout this site.
   You probably know me best as a Founding Father and from my "shocking"
   kite experiment.

   I have been chosen to represent GPO Access since I was the first public
   librarian in America and my accomplishments have warranted my honorary
   title as "first public printer" of the U.S.
