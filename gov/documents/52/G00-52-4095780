   camera

          Where can I find images taken by Hubble?

   The archive of Hubble images is maintained by the Space Telescope
   Science Institute.


   When is the end of Hubble's mission?

   The current plan is to operate Hubble until 2010. We anticipate a
   mission to Hubble will be required in 2010 either to return it to the
   ground, to raise it to a higher orbit (possibly with the aid of an
   attached booster), or to guide it into a controlled re-entry.

   How many servicing missions remain?

   Space Shuttle Landing SM3A (December, 1999) will be followed by SM3B
   (early 2002) and SM4 (currently scheduled for July, 2003). No further
   missions to Hubble are planned until the final "closeout" mission in
   2010.

   The primary science payload for SM3B is the Advanced Camera for Surveys
   (ACS), a camera with high sensitivity to visible and ultraviolet light.
   ACS will exceed our current camera (WF/PC2) in "discovery power" by a
   factor of 10.

   On SM4 we'll be installing the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the
   most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph ever flown on Hubble, and the
   Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), the first truly "panchromatic" camera on
   Hubble.

                              What's a Hubble?

                  What does Hubble weigh and how big is it?

   Hubble weighs about 24000 lbs on Earth. That would be about 11000 kg.
   It is about the size of a big tractor-trailer truck. To be more
   precise: The length is 13.2 meters (43.5 ft.) and the maximum diatemer
   is 4.2 meters (14 ft.)

   Stack of Cars You can compare this to a car, which weighs around one or
   two tons (roughly 1000 to 2000 kg). Thus, Hubble weighs as much as six
   to twelve cars (depending on their size). It's not really phenomenally
   heavy. To get really heavy stuff, look at big aircraft carriers and
   monster skyscrapers!

How can I see Hubble pass over my area?

Check for Hubble sightings in your area at NASA Sky Watch.

                                                                                    Looking for Hubble

   How fast does Hubble travel?

   At its current altitude, Hubble orbits the earth every 100 minutes,
   with a speed of approximately 17,000 mi/hr or 27,200 km/hr.

   How high up is Hubble?

   The Hubble Space Telescope is a Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite.

   It is located about 320 nautical miles (375 statute miles, 600 km)
   above the surface of the earth.

   Who was Edwin Hubble?

   Hubble, Edwin Powell (1889-1953), an American astronomer, was born in
   Marshfield, Missouri. As a staff member (from 1919) at Mt. Wilson
   Observatory, Hubble used the 100-in. (254-cm) telescope there to
   discover that there are large-scale galaxies beyond the Milky Way and
   that they are distributed almost uniformly in all directions.

   In what is now known as Hubble's Law, he was the first to offer
   observational evidence supporting the theory of the expanding universe.

   What are the main objectives of the Hubble Program?

   The Announcement of Opportunity for The Hubble Space Telescope, dated
   March 1977, cites that the main scientific objectives for Hubble are to
   determine:

     A. The constitution, physical characteristics, and dynamics of
     celestial bodies.

     B. The nature of processes which occur in the extreme physical
     conditions existing in and between astronomical objects.

     C. The history and evolution of the universe.

     D. Whether the laws of nature are universal in the space-time
     continuum.

   What is Hubble's Law?

   Hubble's law is a justice statement that the greater the distance
   between any two galaxies, the greater is their relative speed of
   separation. In other words, the universe is expanding roughly
   uniformly. This empirical finding is more consistent with the big bang
   theory of the universe's origin than with the steady state theory.

   The law was first proposed in 1929 by Edwin Hubble, who observed that
   the more distant a galaxy, the greater is its red shift, and hence its
   velocity relative to our galaxy.

   money How much did Hubble cost to put in orbit?

   Hubble was put into orbit in 1990 from the Space Shuttle Discovery.
   Built 1978-90 at a cost of $1.5 billion, the telescope (named for
   astronomer E.P. Hubble) was expected to provide the clearest view yet
   obtained of the universe.

   A flaw in Hubble's 94.5-in (2.4-m) light-gathering mirror, discovered
   after the telescope was in orbit, initially limited its effectiveness.
   In 1993, however, astronauts repaired the telescope, replaced critical
   instruments, and added corrective optics while in orbit.
