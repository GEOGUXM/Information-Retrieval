   Project Overview

      The Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) is the lead agency for the
      Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's (TNRCC), Clean Rivers
      Program (CRP) for watersheds near Houston (H-GAC Service Area). Under
      this program, H-GAC is required to develop (1996) and implement
      (1997-98) a regional water-quality monitoring program. The objective of
      the monitoring program is to provide the data needed to assess current
      water-quality conditions in the study area. The assessment will be used
      to direct future regulatory and management actions to stream
      reaches/segments impacted by point or non-point sources of
      contaminants. H-GAC's CRP Technical Steering Committee has decided that
      this monitoring program should place emphasis on the application of
      biomonitoring methods to assess water quality in the study area.

      H-GAC lacks regional information on the status of biological aquatic
      communities in the study area. The status of "impacted" aquatic
      communities should be determined in relation to non- or least impacted
      aquatic communities. The first step in this process is to define the
      criteria for a least impacted aquatic community or site and objectively
      test whether the community meets the criteria. The second step is to
      account for the water-quality, physical-habitat, and landuse
      characteristics that account for the degree of impairment or deviation
      the site has from the least-impacted site or sites. The third step is
      to establish an approach that will allow H-GAC to objectively assess
      the status of least-impacted and more impacted sites, as determined in
      the initial status assessment, on a perennial basis to account for
      changes in land use and impact to the aquatic communities. This
      approach will allow H-GAC to determine whether a reference or
      least-impacted site is still classified correctly according to
      reference status, land use, or the primary biological, water-quality
      and physical-habitat characteristics that were used to classify each
      site.

   Background

      H-GAC's service area consists of a 13-county Gulf Coastal Planning
      Region covering 12,500 square miles with a population of about 4.3
      million people. H-GAC is the region-wide voluntary association of 148
      local governments and elected officials in the Gulf Coast Planning
      Region. H-GAC membership includes 13 county governments, 106 cities, 19
      school districts, and 10 soil and water conservation districts --- and
      includes all major general-purpose local governments in the regions.
      H-GAC is governed by a Board of Directors composed of local elected
      officials, who serve on the governing bodies of member governments.
      H-GAC's mission is to serve as the instrument of local government
      cooperation, promoting the region's orderly development and the safety
      and welfare of its citizens.

      The watersheds assigned to H-GAC under the CRP include the San Jacinto
      River Basin, Trinity-San Jacinto Coastal Basin, San Jacinto-Brazos
      Basin, and the Brazos-Colorado Coastal Basin. The majority of the study
      area is within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain Ecoregion that includes
      all of the coastal portions of the area. The Central Plains Ecoregion
      extends into the northeastern part of the area, and the East Central,
      South Central, and Blackland Prairie Ecoregions comprise the extreme
      northwestern part of the area. Significant natural features in the area
      include evergreen forests in the San Jacinto River Basin; extensively
      forested wetland corridors along the Trinity, Brazos, and Colorado
      Rivers, coastal bays and estuaries; and nonforested wetlands in the
      large river floodplains and coastal areas. Croplands and pastures are
      the dominant land uses by study area. Mixed urban, commercial and
      industrial, particularly petrochemical industry along many of the
      water-ways, are the dominant land uses in and around the Greater
      Houston Metropolitan Area.

      The City of Houston is the fourth largest city in the nation and the
      greater Houston metropolitan area is the tenth largest metropolitan
      area in the United States. Current population is about 4.2 million and
      projected to increase to over 8 million people by 2050 with an
      estimated annual water demand of 2.8 million acre feet. The metro area
      has relied principally on ground water that historically provided 80%
      of the area's public water-supply needs. While the area has had
      abundant sources of good quality ground water, its development has
      resulted in lowered water levels, saltwater encroachment, and
      land-surface subsidence. These effects have led to a regulatory
      commitment to increase to 80% the use of surface water in the area and
      to enforce conservation measures to meet the area's future water needs.
      Information is needed describing the quality of surface-water resources
      in the study area for future use as a public water-supply source.

   Objectives

      * Determine the status of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate
      communities and physical habitats at approximately 60 sites in the
      study area.

      * Select a network of least-impacted reference sites and test whether
      the chosen sites meet the criteria for a reference site, and add or
      remove sites from the reference group accordingly.

      * Develop a bioassessment approach that allows H-GAC to objectively
      assess the status of least-impacted sites as determined in the initial
      status assessment, and on a perennial basis accounting for changes in
      land use and impact to the aquatic communities. The approach also will
      be capable of determining whether a reference or least-impacted site is
      still classified correctly according to reference status, land use, or
      the primary biological, water-quality and physical-habitat
      characteristics that were used to classify each site.

   Study Concept/Approach

      The conceptual model for this study is to first conduct an initial
      status survey of stream biota and their physical habitats in place of
      traditional and other means of water-quality assessment. The second
      phase of the study is to choose the most-impacted and least-impacted
      sites based on the assessment of stream biota and determine those
      factors that account for the impacts observed. This phased approach
      provides a cost-effective means to assess a large number of sites
      through bioassessment and focus efforts in this second phase on
      assessing the cause of impact at a selected set of most and least
      impacted sites.
