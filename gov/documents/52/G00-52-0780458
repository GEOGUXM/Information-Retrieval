   About the PO.DAAC:
   The Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC),
   an element of the Earth Observing System Data Information System
   (EOSDIS), is responsible for archiving and distributing data relevant
   to the physical state of the ocean. Most of the products available at
   the PO.DAAC were obtained from satellites and are intended for use in
   oceanographic and interdisciplinary scientific research. However, a
   limited number of educational products are also available. Please refer
   to the on-line data catalog and order form for a listing of available
   PO.DAAC data products.

   Cost of Data:
   All PO.DAAC holdings are free of charge to scientists, educators and
   the community at large. However, any products freely obtained from the
   PO.DAAC may not be redistributed for profit.

   Citing PO.DAAC Data
   When PO.DAAC data are used in a publication, we request that the
   following acknowledgement be given: "These data were obtained from the
   NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center at the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology". We also
   request a reprint of any papers or reports published using data from
   the JPL PO.DAAC. These reprints will be used in our reference archives
   as well as in the determination of future PO.DAAC products.
