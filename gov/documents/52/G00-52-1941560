      understanding of evaluation processes and techniques used to conduct
      evaluations, including self-assessments, and to provide classroom
      laboratory opportunities for application and practice. The course
      addresses protocols for organizing and managing evaluations, techniques
      for gathering information, and tools to organize and process
      information for reporting. Course content is based on requirements and
      guidance in DOE O 151.1 and G 151.1-1.

      Audience:
      The primary intended audience is DOE and DOE-contractor facility/site
      personnel responsible for managing, conducting, and /or reviewing
      evaluations of emergency management programs. The intended audience
      also includes DOE Headquarters response staff as well as individuals
      responsible for emergency management training and oversight.

      Description:
      The training method for this classroom course involves two primary
      instructors presenting information via lecture and demonstration,
      seminar-style discussions, case studies, and student problem-solving
      and role-playing sessions to illustrate and practice techniques and
      skills.

      Course outcomes:
      Upon successful completion, students will understand roles,
      responsibilities, and processes for evaluations of emergency management
      programs and will be able to apply effective methodologies and
      techniques. Upon completion, students will be able to do the following:

       1. Identify requirements and criteria for evaluation of emergency
          management programs and the roles and responsibilities of
          participants.

          during, and after an evaluation.
       3. Demonstrate the use of criteria in the preparation for, conduct of,
          and development of findings for an evaluation.
       4. Demonstrate information gathering and analysis techniques applied
          to evaluations of self-assessments.
       5. Demonstrate means to identify and document findings that are
          "understandable" and "correctable."
       6. Explain the reporting, corrective actions, and follow-up related to
