       Man Sentenced for Unauthorized Access into Computer Systems of
                         Connecticut Consulting Firm

     United States Attorney John A. Danaher III announced that MARKUS P.
   LUKAWINSKY, age 32, of 54970 Avenida Madero, La Quinta, California, was
     sentenced yesterday in federal court in Bridgeport, Connecticut by
      United States District Judge Janet C. Hall. LUKAWINSKY received a
     sentence of twelve months plus one day in prison, to be followed by
   three years supervised release. In addition, LUKAWINSKY was required
      to pay restitution in the amount of $198,458.31 to the Greenwich
                        consulting firm of Mars & Co.
   LUKAWINSKY was originally indicted in November 2000 by a federal grand
      jury sitting in Bridgeport, Connecticut on charges of interstate
    transportation of stolen property and computer intrusion. He pleaded
   guilty to both charges in August 2001 before Judge Hall. At that time,
    LUKAWINSKY admitted that, from May 1999 through January 2000, he had
     transported stolen computer equipment belonging to Mars & Co. worth
   over $21,500 from Greenwich, Connecticut to White Plains, New York, and
     ultimately to La Quinta, California. Also, during approximately the
    same time period, LUKAWINSKY unlawfully accessed or "hacked" into the
   computer systems of Mars & Co. without authorization to read and delete
              electronic mail that belonged to another person.
   According to the evidence proffered at sentencing, LUKAWINSKY initially
     accessed the Mars & Co. computer network without authorization and
   downloaded several encrypted password files. He then used a decryption
        tool to decrypt or "crack" numerous usernames and passwords.
   Thereafter, on at least five occasions, LUKAWINSKY re-connected to the
   Mars & Co. network and logged in as one of the employees whose username
    and password he had compromised. LUKAWINSKY did not compromise any of
   the confidential or proprietary information maintained by Mars & Co. on
                           behalf of its clients.
   At sentencing, Judge Hall found that LUKAWINSKYs actions resulted in a
    total loss of over $198,000 to Mars & Co. That figure represented the
       stolen computer equipment worth approximately $21,500, plus the
       expenditure by Mars & Co. of over $176,000 to conduct a damage
    assessment and restore its computer network (including any corrupted
               data) to its condition prior to the intrusions.
   This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
        prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Shawn J. Chen.
