     Q:  What is the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
            (ATSDR)?

     A:   ATSDR is the principal federal public health agency involved
   with
            hazardous waste issues.  The agency helps prevent or reduce
   the
            harmful effects of exposure to hazardous substances on human
            health.  ATSDR, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and
            Human Services, was created by the Superfund Law in 1980.

     Q:  Where is ATSDR located? How big is it?

     A:   ATSDR's headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia.  The agency has 10
            regional offices and an office in Washington D.C.  The multi-
            disciplinary staff of approximately 400 includes
   epidemiologists,
            physicians, toxicologists, engineers, public health educators,
   health
            communication specialists, and support staff.

     Q:  What does ATSDR do?

     A:   ATSDR conducts a number of activities to help prevent or reduce
            the harmful effects of exposure to hazardous substances,
   including:

     * Advises federal and state agencies, community
       members, and other interested parties on the health
       impacts of Superfund sites and other petitioned sites.
     * Identifies communities where people might be exposed
       to hazardous substances in the environment.
     * Determines the level of public health hazard posed by a
       site.
     * Recommends actions that need to be taken to safeguard
       people's health.
     * Conducts health studies in some communities that are
       located near Superfund sites or in locations where
       people have been exposed to toxic materials.
     * Funds research conducted by colleges, state agencies,
       and others who study the relationship between
       hazardous waste exposure and illnesses.
     * Educates physicians, other health care professionals,
       and community members about the health effects
       of--and how to lessen exposure to--hazardous
       substances.
     * Provides technical support and advice to other federal
       agencies and state and local governments.
     * Maintains registries of people who are exposed to the
       most dangerous substances.

     Q:  What can ATSDR do to help a community that may be
            exposed to hazardous substances?

     A:   ATSDR helps communities in a variety of ways, including:

     * Helps communities by working with them to resolve
       their health concerns.
     * Determines whether the community is or was exposed
       to hazardous substances.
     * Visits the community to hear residents voice their
       health concerns.
     * Educates residents about any health hazards posed by
       environmental contaminants.
     * Works with local health care providers to ensure they
       have the information needed to evaluate possible
       exposures to hazardous substances in their community.
     * Visits a community to draw blood or to collect urine to
       determine if people have been or are being exposed to a
       hazardous substance when such actions are required.
     * Can provide medical monitoring in communities
       exposed to hazardous substances if such action is needed.

     Q:  What can't ATSDR do to help a community?

     A:   ATSDR does not have the legal authority to conduct certain
            activities, such as the following:

     * Cannot provide medical care or treatment to people
       who have been exposed to hazardous substances, even
       if the exposure has made them ill.
     * Cannot provide funds to relocate affected residents or
       to clean up a site.
     * Cannot close down a plant or other business, but can
       make recommendations to the U.S. Environmental
       Protection Agency (EPA).

     Q:  How is ATSDR's role in helping communities different from
           EPA's role?

     A:   Unlike EPA, ATSDR is not a regulatory agency.  ATSDR is a
            public health agency that advises EPA on the health aspects of
            hazardous waste sites or spills.  ATSDR makes recommen-
            dations to EPA when specific actions are needed to protect the
            public's health.  For example, ATSDR might recommend providing
            an alternative water supply, removing contaminated material,
   or
            restricting access to a site.  EPA usually follows these
   recommen-
            dations.  However, ATSDR cannot require EPA to follow its
            recommendations.

     Q:  How does ATSDR become involved with a site?  How can I get
           ATSDR involved with a site?

     A:   ATSDR is required by the Superfund law to become involved with
            all sites that are on or proposed for the National Priorities
   List
            (NPL).  Specifically, ATSDR conducts public health assessments
   of
            NPL sites, as well as of all sites proposed for the NPL. EPA,
   states,
            local governments, or other federal agencies may request
   ATSDR's
            help with a site, such as in cases of accidental spills or
   releases.
            Anyone may request or "petition" that ATSDR to do a health
   con-
            sultation.  Most requests for health consultations come from
   EPA
            and state and local agencies. Anyone may also petition ATSDR
   to
            conduct a public health assessment of a site.  For more
   information
            about how to petition ATSDR to conduct a public health assess-
            ment, call ATSDR's toll-free information line, 1-888-42-ATSDR
            (1-888-422-8737), or send an e-mail request to ATSDRIC@cdc.gov

     Q:  How does ATSDR work with states and local health
            departments?

     A:   ATSDR has cooperative agreements (partnerships) with 23 states
   to
            conduct site-related public health assessments or health
   consul-
            tations, health studies, and health education.  In states that
   have co-
            operative agreements, ATSDR provides technical assistance and
            oversees site evaluations and related activities done by state
   staff.
            ATSDR also assists local health departments.

     Q:  Does ATSDR assist communities located near hazardous waste
            sites that are not on the NPL?

     A:   Yes.  More than half of the sites ATSDR has worked at are not on
            the NPL.

     Q:  What information does ATSDR provide through its Internet
            web site?

     A:   Information that can be accessed through ATSDR's web site in-
            cludes these items: information about ATSDR; a database con-
            taining information on all sites where ATSDR has worked;
   short,
            easy-to-read fact sheets on 60 of the most common contaminants
            at Superfund sites; and links to related sites.
