  New Machine under construction

   We are building up a new machine to take over the exploder from the
   current system. Plans include Apache, PHP, MySQL, FreeBSD, mirrored
   drives, firewall, and a UPS (after all we are in California). We also
   plan to revamp the connection to the newsgroup to improve functionality
   and filtering. This project will proceed slowly but should be completed
   this summer.

  We have a new online web based subscription system

   Please use that to sign up or change your list selection options. Only
   send email to the list maintainer if you cannot use the online system.
   Report problems to the list programmer below.

   The VxWorks Exploder is an email list service for the disucssion of
   Wind River Systems VxWorks (tm) and Tornado (tm) realtime operating
   systems. This exploder is cross-coupled to the usenet newsgroup
   comp.os.vxworks.

   There are three ways to do the list. The list is available via usenet
   newsgroup comp.os.vxworks. In addition, there are two subscription
   email lists that deliver email directly to recipients. The daily digest
   subscription list delivers one email per day containing all the list
   traffic for that day, plus one containing a digest of the newsgroup
   postings. The immediate subscription list delivers a separate email for
   each list article in soft realtime, plus a one-per-day digest of the
   articles originated on the newsgroup side.

   If your posting does not appear in the list, check rejected articles
   accessible via here.

   To join or leave the list use the Subscribing and Unsubscribing link
   above.

   If you really get stuck, send an email request as a last resort to the
   recipient list maintainers: vxwexplo-request@lbl.gov. Specify DIGEST or
   IMMEDIATE or UNSUBSCRIBE when sending requests.

   The list maintainers are Loren Shalz, Bill Brown, and Alan Biocca. The
   list programs are developed and maintained by Alan Biocca. The new
   machine being built to take over the exploder is being setup by James
   McDonald and Alan Biocca.

   The Bug List

     * There is a known problem with the newsgroup digest. It is not
       communicating correctly with our news server, so newsgroup to list
       digests are not currently working.
     * There is a known problem regarding the digest subject lines not
       being displayed in the index files.
     * Articles from the internet to the mail list are not filtered as
       well as we would like for spam.

   Comments and suggestions may be emailed to AKBiocca@LBL.gov.
