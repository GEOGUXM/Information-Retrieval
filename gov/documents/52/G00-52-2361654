   Information for State Employees About the Hiring Freeze
   In response to questions about the hiring freeze, the Department of
   Personnel Administration (DPA) is providing the following links to
   Dept. of Finance Management Memos explaining how the freeze is being
   implemented:
   Initial memo issued 10-23-01.
   Clarifying information issued 12-27-01

   In conjunction with the Department of Finance memo, DPA has issued a
   memo to all State personnel offices establishing a moratorium on
   classification and pay items that have an associated cost, such as
   creating new classifications, modifying classifications,
   reorganizations, and changes to or setting of new allocation
   guidelines. Obligations incurred as a result of the new labor
   agreements are exempt from this moratorium. Also exempt are matters
   essential to public health and safety and demonstrated business needs
   that cannot be dealt with in a less costly manner. DPA approval is
   required for any requests for exemptions from this moratorium.
