   Meme: an information pattern, held in an individual's memory, which is
   capable of being copied to another individual's memory.
   Memetics: the theoretical and empirical science that studies the
   replication, spread and evolution of memes
     __________________________________________________________________

      Cultural evolution, including the evolution of knowledge, can be
      modelled through the same basic principles of variation and selection
      that underly biological evolution. This implies a shift from genes as
      units of biological information to a new type of units of cultural
      information: memes.

      A meme is a cognitive or behavioral pattern that can be transmitted
      from one individual to another one. Since the individual who
      transmitted the meme will continue to carry it, the transmission can be
      interpreted as a replication: a copy of the meme is made in the memory
      of another individual, making him or her into a carrier of the meme.
      This process of self-reproduction (the memetic life-cycle), leading to
      spreading over a growing group of individuals, defines the meme as a
      replicator, similar in that respect to the gene (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz,
      1991).

      Dawkins listed the following three characteristics for any successful
      replicator:

      copying-fidelity:
             the more faithful the copy, the more will remain of the initial
             pattern after several rounds of copying. If a painting is
             reproduced by making photocopies from photocopies, the
             underlying pattern will quickly become unrecognizable.

      fecundity:
             the faster the rate of copying, the more the replicator will
             spread. An industrial printing press can churn out many more
             copies of a text than an office copying machine.

      longevity:
             the longer any instance of the replicating pattern survives, the
             more copies can be made of it. A drawing made by etching lines
             in the sand is likely to be erased before anybody could have
             photographed or otherwise reproduced it.

   Memes versus genes

      In these general characteristics, memes are similar to genes and to
      other replicators, such as computer viruses or crystals. The genetic
      metaphor for cultural transmission is limited, though. Genes can only
      be transmitted from parent to child ("vertical transmission"). Memes
      can be transmitted between any two individuals ("horizontal
      transmission" or "multiple parenting"). In that sense they are more
      similar to parasites or infections (cf. Cullen, 1998).

      For genes to be transmitted, you need a generation. Memes only take
      minutes to replicate, and thus have potentially much higher fecundity
      (see Competition between Memes and Genes). On the other hand, the
      copying-fidelity of memes is in general much lower. If a story is
      spread by being told from person to person, the final version will be
      very different from the original one. It is this variability or
      fuzziness that perhaps distinguishes cultural patterns most strikingly
      from DNA structures: every individual's version of an idea or belief
      will be in some respect different from the others'. That makes it
      difficult to analyse or delimit memes. This does not imply that meme
      evolution cannot be accurately modeled, though. After all, genetics was
      a well-established science long before the precise DNA structure of
      genes was discovered.

      Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain
      techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or
      the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society,
      almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language,
      fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts,
      conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as
      informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited
      amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any
      replication at the level of the genes.

   Modelling memes

      Memetics can be defined as an approach trying to model the evolution of
      memes . Memes undergo processes of variation (mutation, recombination)
      of their internal structure. Different variants will compete for the
      limited memory space available in different individuals. The most fit
      variants will win this competition, and spread most extensively. This
      spreading can in principle be modelled mathematically (see e.g. Boyd &
      Richerson, 1985; Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman, 1981; Lumsden & Wilson,
      1981; Csanyi, 1991; Lynch, 1998), although in practice it will be very
      difficult to determine the exact values of the parameters of the model.
      A more practical, qualitative approach is to formulate specific
      criteria for the fitness of a meme, relative to other memes, taking
      into account the subsequent stages of the memetic life-cycle.

      As is the case with genes, it is not necessary to know the exact coding
      or even the exact size or boundaries of a meme in order to discuss its
      fitness, and thus to make predictions about its further spreading,
      survival or extinction within the population of competing memes. Such
      predictions can be empirically tested. For example, a memetic
      hypothesis might state that simpler memes will spread more quickly.
      This can be tested by observing the spread (perhaps in a controlled
      environment) of two memes that are similar in all respects, except that
      the one is simpler. Theories can also be induced from empirical
      observation of meme behavior "in the wild" (see e.g. Best, 1998). Given
      the differences in variation and selection mechanisms, it is also
      possible to make predictions about the competition between memes and
      genes.

      Variation, replication and selection on the basis of meme fitness
      determine a complex dynamics. This dynamics will be influenced by the
      medium through which memes are communicated, and the copying-fidelity,
      fecundity and longevity it allows. Perhaps the most powerful medium for
      meme transmission is the computer network, and this implies some
      specific characteristics for memes on the net.
