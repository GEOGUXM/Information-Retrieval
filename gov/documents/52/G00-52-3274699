   Cassini arrives at Saturn in July 2004, it will, within its first seven
   months there, complete three flybys of Titan instead of two as
   originally planned. Then, in February 2005, Cassini will resume the
   rest of its four-year prime mission as originally planned, studying the
   planet and its rings, moons and magnetic environment. The changes to
