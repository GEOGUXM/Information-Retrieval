   Summary of another Web site.

   [Waves crashing in Capitola]
     * An ENSO event can cause changes in sea level, but so can winds
       along the central California coast.
     * During some years, the two phenomena reinforce one another, whereas
       in other years they oppose one another.
     * The 1983 ENSO event was accompanied by large sea-level height
       anomalies. Shown here are waves topping the breakwater at Capitola,
       CA and battering Venetian Courts.

   Visit this site to learn more about the ENSO effect on sea-level
   heights in San Francisco, and how it interrelates with climate and the
   effects on the salinity of San Francisco Bay.
