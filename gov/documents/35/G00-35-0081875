    Introduction/Overview

   The last major effort to collect field data on the air quality and
   meteorology processes that lead to high summer smog concentrations in
   the South Coast Air Basin was conducted a decade ago. That program
   (known as the Southern California Air Quality Study or SCAQS) sent out
   aircraft to collect upper-air concentrations and conditions, released
   extra ground-level balloons for information on vertical atmospheric
   characteristics, studied automobile emissions in tunnels, and gathered
   additional measurements of particulates.

   A new field measurement study costing nearly $5 million dollars less
   than the SCAQS program will be executed this summer, this time
   expanding into other air basins and providing another milestone in the
   understanding of urban smog. This summer's effort will cover all of
   Southern California, from Santa Barbara to the Nevada border and south
   into San Diego and Imperial counties, comprising an area of 53,000
   square miles. Over the next two years and beyond, the collected data
   will be extensively analyzed to see how reductions in emissions have
   impacted air quality, and perhaps most importantly, to quantify
   transport of pollutants to neighboring air basins.

   Known as the Southern California Ozone Study or SCOS97, the
   comprehensive effort will further overall understanding of air quality
   and meteorological processes, with the new data to be used for future
   plan revisions by all Southern California air districts. Locally,
   SCOS97 data updates will be integrated into the modeling databases AQMD
   uses to demonstrate ozone attainment and help form the scientific basis
   for the preparation of AQMP revisions.

   Process

   SCOS97's data capture will rely heavily on remote instrumentation such
   as the continuous upper-air meteorological profilers and wide-ranging
   surface measurements of air quality. The field activity is scheduled to
   begin mid-June and run through mid-October. In addition to the
   continuous data, about 15 high smoggy days or "intensive operation
   periods" will be analyzed. During this time four to six aircrafts
   making two to three flights, numerous lidar ("light radar" laser)
   sweeps, and hundreds of balloon soundings will be made. In addition,
   additional VOC data will be collected. The program will deploy the most
   sophisticated, state-of-science measurement devices available.

   Every day during the study period, the SCOS97 Forecast Team will
   provide projections of potential episodes which may occur 48 hours
   later. This information is relayed to the SCOS97 Field Management Team.
   Based on the projected episode types, the Field Management Team will
   make a decision to initiate the additional intensive data collection
   efforts. The projected episode and "Go - No Go " decision are provided
   on this web site also.

   Participants

   An unprecedented cooperative effort has been made among all parties to
   bring this program into fruition. The major participants who have
   brought this program into fruition are the U.S. EPA, California Air
   Resources Board, U.S. Navy, the South Coast and Mojave Desert AQMDs,
   the Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Diego, and Imperial County APCDs, U.S.
   Department of Energy, and the Coordinating Research Council.
