RULE

     TITLE

                                                                  New or Revised

46-2 Attorney Suspension, Disbarment or Other Discipline          New
Note Circuit Advisory Committee Note Regarding Monetary Sanctions
                                                                  Revised

   CIRCUIT RULE 46-2

                            ATTORNEY SUSPENSION,
                       DISBARMENT OR OTHER DISCIPLINE

   (a) Conduct Subject to Discipline. This Court may impose discipline on
   any attorney practicing before this Court who engages in conduct
   violating applicable rules of professional conduct, or who fails to
   comply with rules or orders of this Court. The discipline may consist
   of disbarment, suspension, reprimand, counseling, education, a monetary
   penalty, restitution, or any other action that the Court deems
   appropriate and just.
   (b) Initiation of Disciplinary Proceedings Based on Conduct Before This
   Court. The Chief Judge or a panel of judges may initiate disciplinary
   proceedings based on conduct before this Court by issuing an order to
   show cause under this rule that identifies the basis for imposing
   discipline.
   (c) Reciprocal Discipline. An attorney who practices before this Court
   shall provide the Clerk of this Court with a copy of any order or other
   official notification that the attorney has been subjected to
   suspension or disbarment in another jurisdiction. When this Court
   learns that a member of the bar of this Court has been disbarred or
   suspended from the practice of law by any court or other competent
   authority or resigns during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings,
   the Clerk shall issue an order to show cause why the attorney should
   not be suspended or disbarred from practice in this Court.
   (d) Response. An attorney against whom an order to show cause is issued
   shall have twenty-eight (28) days from the date of this order in which
   to file a response. The attorney may include in the response a request
   for a hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 46(c).
   The failure to request a hearing will be deemed a waiver of any right
   to a hearing. The failure to file a timely response may result in the
   imposition of discipline without further notice.
   (e) Hearings on Disciplinary Charges. If requested, the court will hold
   a hearing on the disciplinary charges, at which the attorney may be
   represented by counsel. The Court may refer the matter to an appellate
   commissioner or other judicial officer to conduct the hearing. In
   appropriate cases, the court may appoint an attorney to prosecute
   charges of misconduct.
   (f) Report and Recommendation. If the matter is referred to an
   appellate commissioner or other judicial officer, that judicial officer
   shall prepare a report and recommendation. The report and
   recommendation shall be served on the attorney, and the attorney shall
   have twenty-one (21) days from the date of the order within which to
   file a response. The report and recommendation together with any
   response shall be presented to a three-judge panel.
   (g) Final Disciplinary Action. The final order in a disciplinary
   proceeding shall be issued by a three-judge panel. If the court disbars
   or suspends the attorney, a copy of the final order shall be furnished
   to the appropriate courts and state disciplinary agencies. If the order
   imposes a sanction of $1,000 or more, the court may furnish a copy of
   the order to the appropriate courts and state disciplinary agencies. If
   a copy of the final order is distributed to other courts or state
   disciplinary agencies, the order will inform the attorney of that
   distribution.
   (h) Reinstatement. A suspended or disbarred attorney may file a
   petition for reinstatement with the Clerk. The petition shall contain a
   concise statement of the circumstances of the disciplinary proceedings,
   the discipline imposed by this Court, and the grounds that justify
   reinstatement of the attorney.
   (i) Monetary Sanctions. Nothing in the rule limits the Court's power to
   impose monetary sanctions as authorized under other existing authority.

                       CIRCUIT ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOTE
                        REGARDING MONETARY SANCTIONS

   The Court may impose monetary sanctions as follows:
   (1) Against a party, its counsel, or both, under FRAP 38, where the
   Court determines that "an appeal is frivolous, it may award just
   damages and single or double costs to the appellee."
   (2) Against a party, its counsel, or both under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1912,
   "[w]here a judgment is affirmed by . . . a court of appeals, the court
   in its discretion may adjudge to the prevailing party just damages for
   his delay, and single or double costs."
   (3) Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1927, where counsel "so multiplies the
   proceedings in any case unreasonably or vexatiously" counsel "may be
   required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses
   and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct."
   (4) Under Circuit Rules 17-3 and 30-2, against counsel who "vexatiously
   and unreasonably increases the cost of litigation by inclusion of
   unnecessary material in the excerpts of record."
   (5) Under Circuit Rule 42-1, against counsel for "failure to prosecute
   an appeal to hearing as required" by FRAP and the Circuit Rules.
   (6) Against counsel for failure to comply with the requirements of FRAP
   28 and Circuit Rules 28-1 through 28-3, dealing with the form and
   content of briefs on appeal. See e.g., Mitchel v. General Electric Co.,
   689 F.2d 877 (9th Cir. 1982).
   (7) Against counsel for conduct that violates the orders or other
   instructions of the Court, or for failure to comply with the Federal
   Rules of Appellate Procedure or any Circuit Rule.

   (8) Under the inherent powers of the Court. See e.g., Chambers v.
   Nasco, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-50 (1991);Roadway Express Inc. v. Piper,
   447 U. S. 752, 764-67 (1980); and Golden Eagle v. Burroughs Corp., 809
   F.2d 584 (9th Cir. 1987).

   (9) As a form of discipline under FRAP 46(c) and Circuit Rule 46-2,
   with notice of such sanctions provided to the appropriate courts and
   state disciplinary agencies when the court deems such notice to be
justified. (Rev. 1/1/2002)
