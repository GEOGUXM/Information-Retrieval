   Summary

   As the largest federal law enforcement agency in the United States, the
       FBI has a significant share of the workload in identifying and
        providing assistance to victims and witnesses.  The Bureau's
   Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) was established to help assist
     those who have suffered, or been threatened with, direct physical,
   emotional, and/or other kinds of harm as a result of a commission of a
                   federal crime investigated by the FBI.

   The FBI provides victims and witnesses with their first, and sometimes
        only, contact with the federal criminal justice system.  The
   Minneapolis Division has three VWAP Specialists who serve as the point
   of contact in such instances.  There is a Victim Specialist assigned to
      the Minneapolis office and to the Rapid City, SD, and Pierre, SD,
   Resident Agencies (RAs), the latter two primarily concerned with Crimes
                             in Indian Country.

        The Minneapolis Division anticipates that several more Victim
      Specialists will be hired to assist with Indian Country criminal
   matters in the near future. Special Agents will also sometimes act as a
    liaison in the coordination of the program's activities and services
                  with outside agencies and organizations.
