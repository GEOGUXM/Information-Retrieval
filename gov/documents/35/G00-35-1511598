                              About GPO Access

   GPO Access is a service of the U.S. Government Printing Office that
   provides free electronic access to a wealth of important information
   products produced by the Federal Government. The information provided
   on this site is the official, published version and the information
   retrieved from
   GPO Access can be used without restriction, unless specifically noted.
   This free service is funded by the Federal Depository Library Program
   and has grown out of Public Law 103-40, known as the Government
   Printing Office Electronic Information Enhancement Act of 1993.

   The free services from
   GPO Access fall within the following categories:
     * Government information databases
     * Permanent Public Access
     * Tools to locate Government information
     * Collections of Government information available through the Federal
       Depository Libraries
     * Federal agency files available for download
     * User Support
     * Biennial Report to Congress on the Status of GPO Access

   Government Information Databases

   GPO Access provides free online use of over 1,500 databases of Federal
   information in over 80 applications. A general search page provides the
   opportunity for searching one or multiple GPO Access databases from a
   single page, while specialized search pages allow you to perform more
   detailed searches. For more information on how to search GPO Access
   databases, check the "Helpful Hints" links available from each
   specialized search page.

   GPO Access databases include:
     * Popular regulatory materials such as the Federal Register and The
       Code of Federal Regulations
     * Critical Congressional products such as the Congressional Record
       and Congressional Bills
     * Important business materials such as Commerce Business Daily
       (CBDNet)

   Permanent Public Access

   Title 44 of the United States Code (44 U.S.C. Section 1911) stipulates
   that public access to official Government information products
   disseminated through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) must
   be maintained permanently in regional depository libraries and by
   depository libraries not served by a regional library. Since online
   products are not physically distributed to depository libraries for
   retention, GPO has assumed responsibility for the provision of
   permanent access to Government information products residing on GPO
   Access servers.

   GPO's Permanent Public Access commitment is also met by bringing
   agency-disseminated Internet resources under the purview of GPO and
   incorporating them into a digital archive. GPO captures copies of
   agency electronic information products, and creates PURLs so that users
   will be automatically redirected to the archived products if the
   information is no longer accessible on the agency Web site.

   public access to official Federal information, go to

   Government Information Available at Depository Libraries

   The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) is a partnership between
   the Federal Government and libraries funded by State or local
   government or private institutions to serve the public in their local
   communities. The FDLP was established by Congress in 1813 to ensure
   that the American public had access to its Government's information.
   GPO Access provides applications to search for items available in
   Federal depository library collections, and to locate depository
   libraries using a state abbreviation or area code.

   Federal Agency Files Available for Download

   Over 7,500 individual Federal agency files, in a variety of formats,
   are available for free download from the Federal Bulletin Board (FBB).
   The FBB enables Federal agencies to provide to the public free,
   immediate, and self-service access to Federal information in electronic
   form. Participating Federal agencies directly add the files to the FBB,
   ensuring the latest official information is available.
