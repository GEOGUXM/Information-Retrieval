         NEW TOPEX/POSEIDON Sea Surface Anomaly data
         T he TOPEX/POSEIDON mission was designed to provide information about
   the changing topography of the world's oceans which, in turn, helps
   scientists to understand the ocean's role in the global climate. The
   TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite was launched in August 1992 and was expected
   to operate through September, 1998. The satellite is currently in
   operation. TOPEX/POSEIDON measures the global ocean topography every 10
   days. Quick Look Images/Data
