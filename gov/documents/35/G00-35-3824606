          Managing Information Flow for Effective Emergency Response
                              (Course #ENC-400)
                               August 17, 2001
                             8 am - 12 noon MDT

      Method of delivery: Classroom

      Duration: Half day (four hours)

      Background:
      This "400-level" course provides management-level knowledge for
      achieving effective communication during response to operational
      emergencies. During exercises as well as actual emergency events,
      communication and the flow of information within and among response
      organizations across the DOE complex have been identified as
      significant performance issues. This course addresses issue resolution
      and promotes more effective emergency communication among DOE and
      contractor response groups. The course focuses on DOE sites and both
      intra- and inter-organization communication.

      Audience:
      The primary intended audience is DOE and DOE-contractor facility/site
      response organization managers, decision makers, supervisors, and key
      technical staff. The target audience also includes DOE Headquarters
      response staff as well as individuals who are responsible for emergency
      management training and oversight.

      Description:
      This course will be presented in a four-hour classroom session. The
      training method involves two primary instructors who illustrate
      communication-management issues and problem-solving tools/techniques by
      presenting information with lecture, seminar-type discussions, case
      studies, and group problem-solving sessions.

      Course outcomes:
      Students will demonstrate the management of communication and
      information flow as a systemic process necessary for effective
      emergency response. Upon completion, students will be able to do the
      following:

       1. Evaluate the impact of communication problems on organization
          credibility and effective emergency response.
       2. Analyze the causes of emergency communication problems.
       3. Examine critical emergency information and the flow of such
          information.
       4. Analyze processes for delivery of critical emergency information
          among organizations.
       5. Apply management tools and techniques to pre-plan and facilitate
          information flow.

      Prerequisites: None (see recommendation below )

      RECOMMENDATION: Students should be familiar with DOE
      notification/communication requirements and have emergency response
      experience.
