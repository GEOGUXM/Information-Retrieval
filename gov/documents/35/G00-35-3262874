                          FLD Shipping and Mail FAQ


   Are deliveries checked for security hazards? All mail, including
   commercial carrier express, UPS, and U.S. Postal Service is security
   scanned (X rayed) by either MASC Shipping & Receiving Unit, Building
   22, or by the Mail staff. image of mail carrier
   How quickly can I find out if my package has been delivered?? MASC
   Shipping & Receiving delivers larger boxes daily to recipients. The
   carrier usually provides a log of the items (by number only-no names)
   when the packages are delivered, but the driver will not wait for items
   to be checked in individually.
   Once the carrier leaves, MASC Shipping & Receiving check, log in, and
   sort by small and large items. Mail staff picks up their items for
   delivery.
   How is Express Mail handled? The Mail staff takes flats and small boxes
   with a copy of the express mail log to the Mail room for sorting. The
   first mail run of the day has been made. The express mail that arrives
   in the morning is delivered that afternoon. Each package is signed for
   by the recipient.
   Can I get help if my package is lost? Both MASC Mail Staff and Shipping
   & Receiving resolve discrepancies and track missing packages with the
   commercial carriers.
   Do all deliveries come at a specified time? UPS and other express mail
   carriers may bring other overnight and ground mail at any time of the
   day to Shipping & Receiving, Bldg. 22. After scanning, it is usually
   left at the Warehouse until the next morning for regular a.m. pickup by
   the Mail staff.
   What happens when shipments arrive late in the day? Sometimes Federal
   Express or UPS will bring late shipments to the Warehouse (afternoon as
   late as 4:00). When this happens, MASC Shipping & Receiving notifies
   the recipient if it is a large box, and will attempt delivery that
   afternoon.
   MASC Shipping & Receiving notifies the Mail Staff to pick up if flats
   or small boxes are received late. The Mail Staff calls recipients if
   the package arrives before 3:15 p.m. The recipient can choose to come
   and get the package or have it delivered the next morning.
