   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do medical officers work in the Public Health Service (PHS)
   Commissioned Corps?

   The 1,300+ medical officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps work
   throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and in
   other Federal agencies/programs.  The majority of medical officers are
   assigned to the following:
     * Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (34%);
     * Indian Health Service (IHS) (24%);
     * National Institutes of Health (NIH) (20%);
     * Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (4.5%);
     * Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) (4%);
     * U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) (4%);
     * Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
       (1.25%); and
     * Bureau of Prisons (BoP) (1.25%).

   What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time and/or civil service work experience in a
       PHS agency at a PHS site at a level commensurate with the duties of
       a commissioned officer);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned an M.D. from a program which, at the
   time the degree was conferred, was accredited by the Council on Medical
   Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association (AMA) or
   you must have earned a D.O. degree from a program which, at the time
   the degree was conferred, was accredited by the Bureau of Professional
   Education of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).  In addition,
   you must have successfully completed one year of postgraduate medical
   education (internship or first year of residency training) in a program
   which, at the time the training was undertaken, was accredited by the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education of the AMA or the
   Department of Education of the AOA.  A current, unrestricted, and valid
   medical license from 1 of the 50 States, Washington D.C., the
   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands or Guam is also
   required.

   What if I just graduated from medical school and I don't have my
   medical license yet?  May I still apply?

   Medical officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps are required to complete
   their first year of internship/residency and are expected by that time
   to have received their medical license.  The only exceptions to this
   requirement are those who have attended the Uniformed Services
   University of Health Sciences as commissioned officers in order to
   receive their medical degree, and officers who are directly
   commissioned out of medical school into an internship/residency program
   sponsored by one of the agencies/programs.

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession, base pay entry date
   (BPED), specialty training, geographic location of your duty station,
   and dependency status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for a
   medical officer in the PHS Commissioned Corps is O-3 (LT).  Medical
   graduates receive 8 years of T & E credit for basic undergraduate and
   professional education toward the M.D. degree and a year of credit for
   each year of internship/residency.  A medical officer commissioned
   after successful completion of a residency program will usually receive
   a total of 11 years of credit.  Additional T & E credit is earned for
   time spent after receipt of the qualifying degree in degree-related
   activities.  This could be:
     * paid or volunteer employment
     * research
     * teaching at the college or university level
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research

   officer's starting rank is calculated, click the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   Am I eligible for any bonuses and/or special pay?

   Yes, medical officers are eligible for both.  Special pays for medical
   officers include the Variable Special Pay (VSP), Retention Special Pay
   (RSP), Board Certified Pay (BCP), Incentive Special Pay (ISP), and
   Multi-year Retention Bonus (MRB).

   VSP is a monthly pay that is available to all medical officers based on
   years of creditable service.  The creditable service entry date (CSED)
   reflects the officer's years of active duty as a medial officer in any
   of the Uniformed Services and/or the years spent participating in an
   accredited medical internship or residency training while not on active
   duty in a Uniformed Service.  VSP rates range from $5,000 to $12,000
   annually, depending on length of creditable service

   RSP is a payment of $15,000 annually for medical officers who execute a
   contract to remain on active duty for a specified term of one or more
   years.  Payment is made in a lump sum usually within 90 days of the
   effective date of the contract.  If other bonus pay contracts are
   negotiated, they will have concurrent dating.

   BCP is a monthly pay based on your CSED and board certification in an
   accredited specialty.  To receive this special pay that ranges from
   $2,500 to $6,000 annually, you must provide documentation in support of
   certification.

   ISP is a special bonus for certain medical officers that is paid
   annually based on medical specialty.  ISP rates, authorized by law,
   range from $2,000 to $36,000 per year for a one-year contract.  There
   is a provision to pay ISP for medical officers who execute an ISP
   contract to stay on active duty for a minimum of one year at an
   isolated hardship site or a hard-to-fill location.  Officers serving at
   the eligible sites are notified of their eligibility when they are
   assigned.  The amount of isolated hardship sites ranges from $11,000 to
   $19,000 annually based on the category of the site.  Payment is made in
   an annual lump sum.

   MRB is payable to medical officers at the rate of $2,000 to $14,000
   depending on the specialty training and the duration of the contract.
   Eligibility requirements for MRB require, among other things, that a
   medical officer enter into a contract to remain on active duty for 2-4
   years.  Please note that MRB and RSP contracts must have concurrent
   dates.

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Physicians Professional
   Advisory Committee (PPAC).  The PPAC includes commissioned corps and
   civil service physicians representing all PHS and non-PHS
   programs/agencies.  It exists to provide advice and consultation to the
   Surgeon General on issues related to the professional practices and
   personnel activities of all PHS medical officers.  The PPAC also
   provides advisory assistance to the Chief Medical Officer and to the
   agency and/or program heads where medical officers work.  All members
   of the medical category may express their concerns and voice their
   opinions through the PPAC.  The missions of the PPAC are to enhance
   communications, foster morale and career satisfaction, respond to the
   changing environment affecting federal health care programs, and
   encourage recruitment and career development, thereby helping U.S.
   physicians provide the best possible medical care and advice to the
   nation.  If interested in joining, contact the PPAC chairperson,
   Gershon H. Bergeisen, at 404-417-8024 or ghb0@cdc.gov.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officers Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill," COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting, usually
   held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet colleagues
   from other agencies/programs, and to exchange scientific and career
   information.  For membership information, please call (301) 731-9080 or
