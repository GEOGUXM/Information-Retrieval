   Leonids Meteor Shower!
     __________________________________________________________________

   "For many years I would go to Griffith Observatory and look at the
   painting of the Leonid shower by the little girl, and dream of the day
   I would see one like that too. We went up the mountain in bumper to
   bumper traffic, got off on a little fire road and experienced the show
   of a lifetime.
   Have a blessed Thanksgiving. We are truly blessed."

   "I just love your "letters." Thank you!
   We stayed up until 3am on Sat down here in Villa Park, at a "star
   party"....but I guess we called it a night too early. We only saw a
   sporatic 50 or so, darn. But so many more than ever before in our
   urban-flatland, Orange County sky, so it was worth it.
   Thanks again, Cathy."

   "I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work and for these
   wonderful news letters. Now that I am teaching my second quater "Whats
   Up Stargazers" class at West Los Angeles College I find your emails
   more helpful and more important than ever. I took my class to Templin
   Hwy for the Leonids and it really was spectacular. How lucky we all are
   to have been able to enjoy such a spectacular natural wonder with all
   of the saddness and war in the world today.
   Each one teach one
   Each one reach one
   And some day all of the world's childern will live in peace!"

   "especially this time of the year, we just have to say thanks to you
   for all the timely info you send our way. it is much appreciated.
   here on the big island of Hawaii, at a dark and quiet field at the
   3,000 elevation on the way up to Mauna Kea at 12:40 am sunday, four of
   us delighted in the spectacular leonid light show. our ooohs and aaahs
   couldn't be heard for miles around. wish you were here."

   "My daughter found a mountain top in Westlake Village and NO one was
   there except she and her friend all night watching the SHOW! I was up
   at 0430 hrs. and got a great shot of the Leonids!! Happy Thanksgiving
   and GOD BLESS AMERICA.
   Respectfully,"

   Thank you again for keeping me on your email list and for sending out
   all the information you do. I use it and enjoy it. Thanks......."

   "Happy thanksgiving to you...thanks for the updates. The NAEP results
   for HI were so predictable....in our travels around the state to
   schools, due to assessments being only in reading and math, science is
   frequently left out totally, taught superficially, or taught in an
   unengaging manner (read the chapter, answer the questions). We have
   been spouting the concern citing the Glenn Commission report and
   others. Our superintendent called the announcement akin to the Sputnik
   challenge...we will see how much accountability is behind the plans for
   improvement. We stayed up to watch the show on Sunday morning in
   Hawaii...spectacular. thanks again...."
