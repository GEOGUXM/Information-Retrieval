   Greetings,

   We would like to mention that a laps-users mailing list is in place.
   This is a discussion forum to allow for the exchange of ideas and
   information among LAPS users and developers about all aspects of LAPS.
   This same laps-users mailing list can be read and posted to with the
   LAPS Users Discussion Forum web page.

   When sending mail, please note these two related addresses,
   laps-bugs@fsl.noaa.gov and laps-users@fsl.noaa.gov. Bug reports and
   other items about your local site should be directed to
   laps-bugs@fsl.noaa.gov; this is sent to FSL LAPS Staff only. Items of
   general and widespread interest should be sent to
   laps-users@fsl.noaa.gov. This is sent to people both within FSL and the
   broad LAPS user community outside of FSL, and is automatically posted
   on the LAPS Users Discussion Forum web page.
