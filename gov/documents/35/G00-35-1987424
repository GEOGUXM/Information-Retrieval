                          FERMI UNIX ENVIRONMENT (FUE)
                                     WP0059

   The Fermi Unix Environment (FUE) is an initiative within the Fermilab
   Computing Division. The FUE mission in brief is to provide a
   cross-department and cross-division structure for the proposal,
   discussion, design and implementation of anything that affects the User
   when operating in a Unix Environment at Fermilab. Clearly many
   activities in this area are the mandate of a single group. FUE provides
   the opportunity for cross-group fertilization, organization and
   working. (More specific FUE status and activities so far are described
   in "Fermi Unix Environment - What's That? (Postscript)" talk which was
   given in 1996 (or so) and is rather out of date).

   FUE meets biweekly at 9 am Fridays in WH7xw.

Scripts and Programs

          The FUE products provide scripts and programs to form a uniform
          environment for users of UNIX Platforms.

Standards Documents

          Documents defining the strategy and standards for UNIX software
          at Fermilab. These are in the series DR in the Computing
          Division Library:

          + DR0004 - UNIX Operating System Certification Process
          + DR0009 - Computing Division UNIX Environment Standards
          + DR0010 - Certified UNIX Operating Systems

Working Groups and Projects

          The UPS suite of tools is organized under the umbrella of FUE.
