   Prologue
   Late in 1997 the Advanced Light Source, designed, built, and operated
   under the leadership of AFRD, became a division of the Laboratory in
   its own right. AFRD maintains a considerable and formally defined
   relationship with the ALS, providing accelerator physics support both
   for day-to-day running and for enhancements. Development of user
   systems such as beamlines, the management and enhancement of the
   scientific program, support of the users, and (as of 1999) operation of
   the machine are among the responsibilities of the ALS Division.

  Advanced Light Source

   Seeing the Future in a New Light

   Contact: ALS Division Director Daniel Chemla (ALS Division) or AFRD
   group leader David Robin (accelerator physics). The ALS is a
   third-generation synchrotron light source based on a low-emittance
   electron storage ring with a nominal energy of 1.9 GeV. As the ALS user
   community has grown and become more diverse in the machines seven
   years of operation, the demands on the accelerator have also grown. For
   instance there are simultaneous demands for longer lifetimes, better
   beam stability, variable polarization sources, more high brightness
   high energy x-ray sources, high brightness femtosecond x-ray pulses,
   etc. The challenge for the accelerator physics group is to meet and
   anticipate the demands of the community without compromising
   accelerator operations.

   One of the main responsibilities of the accelerator physics group is to
   help ensure that the ALS continues to provide high brightness
   synchrotron radiation to users in a stable and reliable manner. To this
   end a large fraction of the weekly accelerator physics group meetings
   are devoted to examining archive data taken during the week prior to
   each meeting. Of the quantities examined are run times, lifetime, beam
   sizes, and orbit motion. This allows us to assess the quality of the
   beam delivered to users and to identify and address problems early. In
   addition we are continually measuring the beating of the betatron
   functions and adjusting magnets before the beating grows large enough
   to impact operation.

   This past year we made significant advances in our understanding of the
   machine. Previously, the energy of the beam was inferred through magnet
   measurements. This is an indirect measurement and somewhat imprecise.
   This year the electron beam energy was measured much more precisely by
   resonantly depolarization of the beam. The beam energy was measured to
   better than 1 part in 10,000. Using this method the fill-to-fill
   reproducibility was measured and found to be very stable.

   In addition, a significant gain in our understanding of the single
   particle dynamics in the ALS was revealed through the technique of
   Frequency Map Analysis (FMA). Using a single turn kicker (pinger)
   magnet and turn-by-turn beam position monitor one could for the first
   time experimentally observe a web of excited betatron resonances. This
   tool provides a global vision of the dynamics and allows us to
   understand and tune the machine to improve the performance (both
   injection and lifetime).

   We are continually trying to improve the performance of the
   accelerator. Over the years there has been a constant demand for longer
   lifetimes in the ALS. To satisfy this demand without sacrificing the
   beam brightness, a third-harmonic RF system was installed in the ring
   in June 1999. Since June much of the accelerator physics shift time has
   been devoted to commissioning the third-harmonic and related systems.
   In some ways the third-harmonic system has made operation of the ALS
   more complicated. Nevertheless as of January 2000, the third-harmonic
   system has produced nearly a 50% increase in lifetime and allowed the
   multibunch run length to increase from 4 to 6 hours. We hope that
   further understanding and improvements will allow for even longer
   lifetimes and run lengths.

   In addition to beam lifetime, advances were made in stabilizing the
   beam orbit with the introduction of a slow (0.1 Hz) vertical global
   orbit feedback system. This system works together with a previously
   existing horizontal orbit feedback system to prevent orbit drift of
   more than 5 microns during a run.

   In 1999 work continued on the elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU),
   a device that can provide variable polarized light to users. Much of
   the effort was devoted to increasing the speed at which the device can
   shift between left and right polarization. The time to shift
   polarization has been reduced from 25 to 8 seconds. (In the near future
   we hope that the time can be reduced to 2 seconds, which is the limit
   of the motors.) Also, a new mode of operation of the EPU was
   successfully tested wherein the moveable jaws of the device can provide
   arbitrary angle linear polarization.

   For the generation of high-brightness, high-energy radiation, a plan is
   in place to install three 5-tesla superconducting dipoles
   (Superbends) in the machine in 2001. Early in 1999 experiments were
   performed to test several key components of the cryosystem design. By
   the end of 1999 the design of the magnet and cryosystem was completed
   and the contract for the first magnet/cryostat assembly was placed.
   Accelerator physics experiments have been on going to help ensure a
   smooth commissioning period.

   Finally, numerical tracking studies showed that it is possible to
   modify the magnetic lattice of the ALS to include a narrow gap
   insertion device in straight section 6. Such a source will be several
   orders of magnitude higher in flux than the present dipole sources and
   is a promising next step for the generation of femtosecond x-rays.
