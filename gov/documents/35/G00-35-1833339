                                   CLIA Program
                    Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
        __________________________________________________________________

        CMS regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on
          humans in the U.S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
           Amendments (CLIA). In total CLIA covers approximately 171,000
         laboratory entities. The Division of Laboratories and Acute Care
       Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center
           for Medicaid and State Operations has the responsibility for
                          implementing the CLIA Program.

         The objective of the CLIA program is to ensure quality laboratory
      testing. Although all clinical laboratories must be properly certified
       to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments, CLIA has no direct Medicare
      or Medicaid program responsibilities. Here are helpful sites related to
                        the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
