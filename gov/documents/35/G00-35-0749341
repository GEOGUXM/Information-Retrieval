   The main purpose of this site is to provide District youth, YOU, with
   information to help you enjoy your community, get involved in your
   community, and learn about others in your community.

   On the left, you'll see links to resource pages including education,
   recreation, special events, youth politics, and more. Please take the
   time to check out the site and let us know what you think about it.
   After all, it's your site and we want to hear your suggestions about
   how we can change or improve the site.
