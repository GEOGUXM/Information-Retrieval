   Systems and Software Independent Verification & Validation
   Identify system and software risks to improve software quality and
   safety; assess and improve systems and software development processes
   and products to reduce cost and/or eliminate software anomalies,
   inconsistencies, deficiencies, and potential failures.
   Systems and Software Engineering Research
   Advance the current state of software engineering in software assurance
   to improve the quality, safety, reliability, cost, and performance of
   software systems. Initiate collaborative efforts with NASA Centers to
   integrate IV&V concepts into all NASA programs that have major
   software-critical components.
   Software Independent Assessments
   Assess systems and software development processes and products to
   identify developmental risks, operational risks and determine overall
   system software criticality.
   Educational Outreach
   Reach out to public schools and higher education to encourage young
   people to pursue science and technology careers.
   Technology Transfer
   Extend the NASA-developed technology knowledge base to other NASA
   components, the commercial software community, software user
   constituencies, and business and academic organizations, both
   nationally and internationally.
