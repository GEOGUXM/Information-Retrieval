         The Energy Commission intends to issue a Request for Qualifications
      (RFQ) by March 2002. This RFQ will solicit technical assistance from a
        team of specialists for the Energy Commission staff to augment their
      current capacity to process energy facility licensing applications and
             conduct energy studies in support of the planning and licensing
       processes. This RFQ is being issued as a result of the temporary, but
           extremely high workload currently being experienced by the Energy
       Commission and will cover this peak workload over the next 1-3 years.
          Once the RFQ is issued, bidders will have 30 days to submit a bid.
      Details on the RFQ will be posted on our Contracts/Funding Information
                                       page at www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/

     In the early 1990s before the StateÂ’s electricity generation
     industry was restructured, the California Energy Commission
     certified 11 power plants, none larger than 240 megawatts. Of these,
     three were never built due to market conditions. Eight plants are
     now generating 996 megawatts (MW) of electricity. No power plant
     applications were filed with the Energy Commission between 1994 and
     1998 because there was so much uncertainty during the restructuring
     of the electricity industry. Electricity deregulation occurred in
     March 1998.
     For an overview of power plants approved or under review since
     deregulation, please see our backgrounder page. Information on the
     peaker projects currently under review are located on another page.

     The California Energy Commission has the statutory authority to site
     and license thermal power plants that are rated at 50 megawatts and
     larger and related transmission lines, fuel supply lines and other
     facilities. For more information about the Commission's Energy
     Facility Siting Procedures, please contact the Commission's Siting
     Division at the address or number below. The Commission's Energy
     Facility Siting and Environmental Committee has policy oversight
     responsibility for the Commission's power plant siting program. The
     policy committee members are Commissioner Robert A. Laurie,
     Presiding member, and Commissioner Robert Pernell, Associate member.

     For information about permits needed for powerplants smaller than 50
     megawatts, contact the CalEPA Cal-Gold Permit Assistance Center in
     the area you are in at: http://www.calgold.ca.gov/pac.asp. Also
