   "The man forced to farm subsoil exposed by erosion has little chance
   for making a satisfactory living, whether prices are up or down."
   Hugh Hammond Bennett (April 15, 1881-July 7, 1960), the father of soil
   conservation in the United States and first Chief of the Soil
   Conservation Service, joined Bureau of Soils in 1903 as a soil
   surveyor. His crusading zeal for conservation was born of his
   experiences studying soils and agriculture nationally and
   internationally. The gullied land as well the less visible evidences of
   what he called sheet erosion convinced him of the need for
   conservation. As evidenced by the passage of the Soil Conservation Act
   of April 27, 1935, and the growth of the Soil Conservation Service into
   the preeminent conservation agency, his success was due in no small
   part to his great skills as a communicator. He became the master of the
   written and the spoken word in the cause of conservation. Hugh H.

   These speeches are but a small selection of the numerous ones he
   presented. Colleagues recall that he polished speeches diligently, just
   as he had the several hundred articles that he published. The speeches
   supplement the articles as a record of his influence on the
   conservation movement and the work of the Service. The Soil
   Conservation Service of Bennett's time harnessed several sciences and
   disciplines to the cause of conservation, worked in locations of widely
   varying agricultural and geographical settings, and performed worked of
   interest to diverse groups. The selection of the following speeches was
   made with a view to covering the diversity of topics and audiences that
   the Chief addressed.
