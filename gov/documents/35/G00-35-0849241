   Child Care Advocate Program

   The Child Care Advocate Program (CCAP) promotes the delivery of quality
   child care in California. In 1984, the State Legislature created CCAP
   to provide a link between child care licensing and the community.

   The CCAP tailors its activities to fit the needs of the local
   community. A Child Care Advocate is assigned to each Child Care
   Licensing office to provide information to parents, child care
   providers, employers, educators, and community groups.

   The Child Care Advocate participates in many community activities and
   special projects in order to:

     * Disseminate information on the State's licensing role.
     * Provide information to the public and parents on child care
       licensing.
     * Act as a liaison to child care resource and referral agencies.
     * Serve as a liaison to local government, business, labor, law
       enforcement, education and child care providers.
     * Assist county government and community agencies in capacity
       building and quality improvement efforts to ensure the availability
       of quality child care.
     * Seek to mediate disputes between the Department and Child Care
       Licensees.
     * Assist in the coordination of complaints and concerns on behalf of
       children in child care.
