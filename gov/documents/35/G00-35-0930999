About Browse Images

   The Browse Image Viewer displays browse images in the Lambert Azimuthal
   Equal Area Projection. However, only a rough order transformation has
   been applied, so the accuracy can only be expected to be accurate
   within a few pixels at full resolution.

   The browse images are not intended for analytical use, but as a visual
   scene selection aid.

About LANDSAT 7 Browse Images

   LANDSAT 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) Browse Images have the
   following properties:
     * Bands 5, 4, and 3 are represented by red, green, and blue
       respectively.
     * Pixels are sub-sampled to 240m resolution from the original 30m
       resolution data.
     * The browse images are JPEG compressed images.
     * Each scene is color-stretched on an individual scene-content basis.
       This may result in mismatched colors between scenes.
     * The LANDSAT 7 archive produces browse images in a raw format, which
       means scan-lines are not aligned, not path-oriented, nor projected
       to a north-up map projection.

About LANDSAT 4 and 5 Browse Images

   LANDSAT 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) Browse Images are not the same as
   Landsat 7 browse images. They have the following properties:
     * Bands 5, 4, and 3 are represented by red, green, and blue
       respectively.
     * Pixels are sub-sampled to 480m resolution from the original 28.5m
       resolution data.
     * The browse images are JPEG compressed images.
     * LANDSAT 4 and 5 images use a 2% linear color-stretch.
     * In single scene view, the LANDSAT 4 and 5 Browse Images will be 1/2
       the size, but roughly cover the same area as a L7 Browse Image.
