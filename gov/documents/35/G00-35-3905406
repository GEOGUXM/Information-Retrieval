Eldercare Locator Provides Critical Service for Caregivers, Families
   _____________________________________________________________________

   The public is increasingly using the Administration on Agings (AoAs)
   nationwide Eldercare Locator service to find programs and supportive
   services to help them care for an older member of their family in their
   homes and communities. The average number of calls increased 15.3
   percent from 9,043 each month in fiscal year 2000, to 10,425 each month
   in fiscal year 2001.

   A national survey, conducted for the AoA found that most people (69
   percent) called the Eldercare Locator (1-800-677-1116) on behalf of a
   member of their family. Many callers are long-distance caregivers
   looking for services and agencies to assist their loved ones,
   relatives, or friends who live in another town or state. The survey
   also found that the majority (96 percent) of callers are overwhelmingly
   satisfied, and 89 percent of the callers are first-time users, and are
   also pleased with the assistance they receive.

   "Seniors and their families are increasingly turning to the Eldercare
   Locator as a reliable source of information to improve their daily
   lives," said HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. "The key to this free
   service is that it puts people in touch with professional aging
   services in every community across the country."

   The survey also showed that as more aging "baby boomers" find
   themselves caring for frail older family members, they often turn to
   the Internet when traditional information resources are not available.
   Long-distance caregivers also rely quite often on the web to identify
   reliable home- and community-based services. This finding prompted the
   AoA to launch an on-line version of the Eldercare Locator on the web,
   providing users with 24-hour access to community assistance resources
   for seniors. This new on-line service can be accessed at
   http://www.eldercare.gov

   In announcing the new service, HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging
   Josefina G. Carbonell said, "The debut of AoAs web-based resource comes
   at a critical time for Americas aging community. Convenient on-line
   access to local services means that we can now provide families with
   critical information when, where and how they need it."

   The website will initially provide consumers with basic contact
   information about elder service agencies in the state and local area
   requested by zip code. The website will gradually expand to provide
   links to the full range of services now available by telephone. Users
   are encouraged to share their opinion on other features they would like
   to see added to the site.

   The toll-free Eldercare Locator service is available Monday through
   Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Eastern Time. Callers should provide the
   Eldercare Locator staff with the either the name of the county and city
   or the zip code of the person requiring assistance. It is also very
   helpful to share a description of the situation so that the staff can
   provide appropriate assistance.

   AoAs Eldercare Locator, administered by the National Association of
   Area Agencies on Aging (N4A), in cooperation with the National
   Association of State Units on Aging, provides callers with names and
   phone numbers of organizations within a desired location, anywhere in
   the country. Currently, callers seek information on a variety of
   services. When calling for themselves, requests include assistance with
   financial issues, insurance needs, legal matters or medical assistance.
   Those who call on behalf of another person were more likely to request
   information on housing, nursing homes, assisted living facilities,
   assistance with in-home services and help with checking on someone who
   lives alone.

   summary of the evaluation is available on the AoA web site:
