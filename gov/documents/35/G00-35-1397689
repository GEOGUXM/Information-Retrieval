   Executive Summary I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A. Overview This report was
   developed for The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) which
   asked The Lewin Group to calculate more current estimates of the
   societal cost of drug abuse. In the context of this report, the phrase
   "drug abuse" is used to refer to consequences of using illicit drugs,
   as well as societal costs pertaining to the enforcement of drug laws.
   This study does not address costs related to abuse of or dependence on
   legal substances that may be termed drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, or
   prescription medications. The most recent previous estimates of drug
   abuse related costs are for 1995 as developed by Harwood et al. (1998).
   In addition to providing new estimates of the societal cost of drug
   abuse, this report provides annual estimates for 1992 through 1998 and
   projections for 1999 and 2000 that are consistently developed, so that
   trends in the overall societal cost and in component costs of drug
   abuse can be evaluated. Projections are only provided for 1999 and
   2000, because there is a significant lag in the availability of the
   base data for estimating the component values. For the majority of
   components, the most recent data available is from 1998. The estimates
   have followed guidelines developed by the U.S. Public Health Service
   for cost-of- illness studies. These guidelines have been applied in
   earlier studies of drug abuse in the U.S. (e.g., for 1992, 1985, 1980,
   and 1977), and to cost-of-illness studies for virtually all of the
   major medical problems. Accordingly, these estimates can be compared
   meaningfully to estimates for diseases, such as cancer, stroke, heart
   disease, diabetes, alcohol abuse and mental illness. The limitations of
   this study should be recognized when applying its findings. This study
   is limited in terms of both the reliability of the estimates presented
   and the scope of the estimates. First, the methods used in this study
   yield seemingly very precise values, however they should be treated as
   approximations, because many of the values were derived by trending
   estimates from previous years or rely on assumptions from previous
   analyses that have not been revisited using recent data. A substantial
   period of time has passed since the calculation of these components was
   fully revisited and primary data was gathered to re-estimate these
   costs. The most recent fully re-estimated value for each of the
   component costs presented here is for 1992. A second limitation of this
   study is the scope. As noted, this study follows guidelines developed
   by the U.S. Public Health Service for cost-of-illness studies. There
   are other approaches that could have been used to develop estimates of
   the cost of drug abuse. These methods examine different facets of the
   economic impacts of drug abuse including intangible impacts of drug
   abuse are not included in this study. In applying the estimates from
   this or other cost-of-illness studies, analysts must consider which
   approach is most appropriate for the particular issue they are
   assessing. Similarly, the results of this study were not designed to
   address specific policies to control drug abuse or the alternatives of
   drug prohibition versus legalization. The purpose of this study has
   been to identify and quantify particular negative consequences from the
   abuse of illicit drugs. These data are likely to inform the evaluation
   of particular policies. However, this study has not undertaken specific
   policy evaluations. 1 Section I. Executive Summary The results of this
   study are summarized in the next five sections. The first section
   presents the overall estimates of the cost of drug abuse for 1992
   through 1998 and projections for 1999 and 2000. Then, sections two
   through four demonstrate how the costs in each of the three major cost
   categories changed between 1992 and 2000. All of the three major cost
   categories contain costs related to crime. The fifth section below
   extracts the crime-related costs from each of the other major cost
   categories and summarizes them. Finally, the sixth section below
   provides a brief discussion of the study's results. B. Overall Costs
   Figure I-1 displays the estimates for 1992 through 1998 overall and for
   the three major categories into which the report divides the costs.
   These three categories are health care costs, productivity losses, and
   other costs. Between 1992 and 1998 the overall cost of drug abuse to
   society increased at a rate of 5.9 percent annually. By 1998 the
   societal cost of drug abuse was $143.4 billion.1 The rate of increase
   in costs was in excess of the combined increase of 3.5 percent for the
   adult population and consumer price index for all services for this
   period. Figure I-1 Overall Cost of Drug Abuse, 1992-1998 (in billions
   of dollars) $160 $143.4 $137.1 $140 $126.5 $131.3 $118.4 $120 $111.5
   $102.2 $100 $80 $60 $40 $20 $0 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998
   Productivity Health Other Figure I-2 displays the proportion of the
   societal costs that were represented by each of the three major
   categories in 1998. The share of the costs represented by each of these
   categories remained fairly constant between 1992 and 1998. The share of
   costs represented by health care declined 1 The 1992 cost of drug abuse
   originally developed by Harwood et al (1998) was re-estimated based on
   more recent data. The revised estimate is $102.2 billion. This estimate
   is 4.6 percent higher than the previous Harwood et al. (1998) estimate
   of $97.7 billion. 2 Section I. Executive Summary slightly from 10.6 to
   9.0 percent. Meanwhile, the share represented by productivity losses
   and other effects increased from 68.0 to 68.7 and from 21.5 to 22.4,
   respectively. Figure I-2 Overall Cost of Drug Abuse, 1998 By Cost
   Category 22% Other 9% Health 69% Productivity Figure I-3 displays the
   projected cost of drug abuse for 1998 through 2000. The estimates for
   1992 through 1998 were generally developed based on detailed observed
   data on the component costs. This was not possible for the 1999 and
   2000 projections, since observed data are generally not yet available
   upon which to base the estimates for these years. Therefore, these
   estimates should be used with caution until they can be re-estimated
   more accurately based on observed data. Figure I-3 Projected Overall
   Cost of Drug Abuse, 1998-2000 (in billions of dollars) $180 $160.7 $160
   $152.5 $143.4 $140 $120 $100 $80 $60 $40 $20 $0 1998 1999 2000
   Productivity Health Other 3 Section I. Executive Summary Between 1998
   and 2000, the economic cost of drug abuse is projected to continue to
   increase at a rate of 5.8 percent annually. By 2000, the economic cost
   of drug abuse is projected to be $160.7 billion. C. Health Care Costs
   Figure I-4 displays the health care related cost of drug abuse for each
   year between 1992 and 2000.2 As noted above the estimates for 1999 and
   2000 are projections. Overall health care costs rose 2.9 percent
   annually between 1992 and 1998. This rate of increase is less than the
   combined rate of increase of population growth and medical inflation as
   measured by the consumer price index for medical services (CPI-M).
   During this period the population grew at one percent annually and the
   CPI-M grew at 4.1 percent annually for a combined annual increase of
   5.1 percent. Figure I-4 Health Care Costs, 1992-20003 (in billions of
   dollars) $16 $14.9 $14 $13.9 $12.9 $12 $10.8 $11.1 $11.3 $11.3 $11.4
   $12.1 $10 $8 $6 $4 $2 $0 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000
   The rate of growth in this category was moderated by declines in
   spending for HIV/AIDS care. In 1992 the largest component of the health
   care costs related to drug abuse was spending to care for HIV/AIDS
   patients. Because of new treatments, the cost of caring for HIV/AIDS
   patients is estimated to have declined from $3.7 to $3.4 billion
   between 1992 and 1998. Table I-1 lists the 2 The 1992 cost of drug
   abuse originally estimated in Harwood et al. (1998) was re-estimated
   based on more recent data. The revised estimate for health care related
   costs is $10.8 billion. The 1992 estimate is 9.0 percent higher than
   the previous Harwood et al. (1998) estimate. The largest source of this
   increase is a revised estimate of spending on drug abuse by the
   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The revised estimate is $671
   million relative to the original estimate of $235 million. The second
   component of health care costs that was revised substantially is
   spending for community-based specialty treatment. The original estimate
   for this component was $2.8 billion. The revised estimate is $3.2
   billion. The revised estimate is based on a study by Mark et al. (1999)
   that was more comprehensive than the original study. 3 1999 and 2000
   values are projections. 4 Section I. Executive Summary components of
   the health care related cost of drug abuse. Meanwhile, spending for
   community- based specialty treatment is estimated to have risen from
   $3.4 to $4.9 billion between 1992 and 1998, a 6.3 percent annual growth
   rate which exceeds the combined increase in population growth and
   medical inflation. Thus, by 1998 community-base specialty treatment
   replaced HIV/AIDS treatment as the largest component of the health care
   cost for drug abuse. Table I-1 Health Care Costs, 1992 and 1998 (in

   Analysis by The Lewin Group, 2001. D. Productivity Losses Figure I-5
   displays the productivity related cost of drug abuse for each year
   between 1992 and 2000.4 As noted above the estimates for 1999 and 2000
   are projections. The estimated productivity loss in 1992 was $69.4
   billion. By 1998, this cost is estimated to have risen to $98.5
   billion, a 6.0 percent annual increase. This rate of increase is
   somewhat higher than the combined 4 The 1992 estimate of productivity
   losses is identical to the Harwood et al. (1998) estimate. 5 Section I.

   annually) and in wage rates (about 3.1 percent annually) of 4.1 percent

   lost productivity related to drug abuse. The cost for all of the
   components of the productivity loss estimate increased in this period.
   The fastest increases were for productivity losses related to drug
   abuse related illness and to incarceration. The losses attributed to
   these components, respectively, increased 8.5 and 9.1 percent annually.

   6.0% Source: Analysis by The Lewin Group, 2001. The productivity loss
   for drug abuse related illness was updated based on two factors. The
   real change was measured based on the change in the number of persons
   reporting more than 100 days of marijuana or cocaine use in their
   lifetime. This measure increased at a 5.2 percent annual rate between
   1992 and 1998. The price change in this component was based on the
   Bureau of 6 Section I. Executive Summary Labor Statistics' (BLS) Hourly
   Compensation Index (HCI). This measure increased at 3.2 percent
   annually for combined increase of 8.5 percent annually. The
   productivity loss related to incarcerations was updated based on the
   change in the number of incarcerations attributable to drug abuse and
   the BLS HCI. The number of persons under incarceration in local jails
   and federal and state prisons increased 6.1 percent annually in this
   period. The estimated number attributable to drug abuse increased at
   5.8 percent annually. E. Cost of Other Effects In addition to the
   health care costs and the costs of lost productivity, there are other
   costs of drug abuse including costs of the criminal justice system,
   costs related to reducing the supply of drugs, and social welfare
   costs. Figure I-6 displays the cost of other effects of drug abuse for
   each year between 1992 and 2000.5 As noted above the estimates for 1999
   and 2000 are projections. Between 1992 and 1998, the costs for the
   other effects of drug abuse rose at a 6.6 percent annual rate. This
   rate is somewhat higher than the combined 3.5 percent annual increase
   in the adult population (one percent annually) and general inflation
   (2.5 percent annually). Figure I-6 Cost of Other Effects, 1992-20003

   1997 1998 1999 2000 Table I-3 shows the components of the cost of other
   effects of drug abuse. The largest rates of increases among the
   components of this category were for police protection and legal
   adjudication costs. These costs increased, respectively, at 9.3 and 8.7
   percent annually during this period. These increases are due to growth
   in overall police protection and legal adjudication 5 The 1992 cost of
   drug abuse originally estimated in Harwood et al. (1998) was
   re-estimated based on more recent data. The revised estimate for the
   cost of other effects is $21.9 billion. This estimate is 19.7 percent
   higher than the previous Harwood et al. (1998) estimate. Estimates of
   the costs of police protection, legal adjudication, corrections,
   federal spending to reduce the supply of drugs, and the cost of private
   legal defense were all revised upward. The revisions were based on the
   availability of more current data. The methodology for calculating the
   components was not changed. 7 Section I. Executive Summary spending as
   well as growth in the proportion of that spending that is attributed to
   drug abuse. Total police protection and legal adjudication costs
   increased at 6.4 and 5.7 percent annually, respectively, during this
   period. Police protection and legal adjudication costs are attributed
   to drug abuse based on the percentage of arrests that are attributed to
   drug abuse. The percentage of arrests attributable to drug abuse
   increased from 12.9 percent in 1992 to 15.3 percent in 1998. Costs for
   two of the components of the cost of other effects declined between
   1992 and 1998. These two components were the cost of property damage
   for victims of crime and social welfare costs. These two components
   represented only 2.4 percent of the cost of other effects in 1992,
   however. Table I-3 Cost of Other Effects, 1992 and 1998 (in millions of

   health care, productivity loss, and other costs are crime-related
   costs. This section aggregates these costs to display the total cost of
   crime related to drug abuse. Figure I-7 displays the crime costs
   related to drug abuse.6 Overall crime related costs rose 6.5 percent
   annually between 1992 and 1998. This rate of increase is greater than
   the combined rate of increase of population growth and general
   inflation. During this period the population grew at one percent
   annually and general price inflation was 2.5 percent annually for a
   combined increase of 3.5 percent. 6 The estimate of $60.8 billion is
   6.3 percent higher than the Harwood et al. (1998) 1992 crime cost
   estimate. The main source of this revision is increases in estimated
   criminal justice system and other public costs of crime based on more
   updated information. 8 Section I. Executive Summary Figure I-7 Crime

   Summary G. Discussion The societal cost of drug abuse in the United
   States was $143.4 billion in 1998. The majority of these costs are
   productivity losses, particularly those related to incarceration, crime
   careers, drug abuse related illness, and premature death. The share of
   the societal cost related to the three major categories of costs and
   that related to crime remained relatively constant between 1992 and
   1998. The overall cost of drug abuse rose 5.9 percent annually between
   1992 and 1998 increasing from $102.2 to $143.4 billion. This increase
   is greater than the combined increase in the adult population and
   consumer prices of 3.5 percent annual growth during that period. The
   primary sources of this increase are increases in productivity losses
   related to incarceration and drug abuse related illness. Between 1998
   and 2000, the societal cost of drug abuse is expected to continuing
   rising at a 5.9 percent annual rate, continuing to outpace the combined
   increase in the adult population and consumer prices which are expected
   to have an annual combined increase of about 3.4 percent in this
   period. 10 Section II. Introduction II. INTRODUCTION A. Purpose of This
   Report This report was developed for The Office of National Drug
   Control Policy (ONDCP) which asked The Lewin Group to develop more
   current estimates of the cost of drug abuse. The most recent previous
   estimates are for 1995 as developed by Harwood et al. (1998). In
   addition to providing the most recent estimate of the societal cost of
   drug abuse available, this report provides a series of estimates for
   1992 through 1998 and projections for 1999 and 2000 that are
   consistently developed, so that trends in the overall societal cost and
   component costs of drug abuse can be evaluated. Projections are only
   provided for 1999 and 2000, because there is a significant lag in the
   availability of the base data for estimating the component values. For
   the majority of components, the most recent data available is from
   1998. The estimates have followed guidelines developed by the U.S.
   Public Health Service for cost-of- illness studies. These guidelines
   have been applied in earlier studies of drug abuse in the U.S. (e.g.,
   for 1992, 1985, 1980, and 1977), and to cost-of-illness studies for
   virtually all of the major medical problems. Accordingly, these
   estimates can be compared meaningfully to estimates for diseases such
   as cancer, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, alcohol abuse and mental
   illness. The National Institute of Health compiles and publishes these
   estimates. There are other approaches that could have been used to
   develop estimates of the cost of drug abuse, such as "willingness to
   pay" (Miller et al., 1991) or the "demographic" approach (Collins and
   Lapsey, 1996). These methods examine different facets of the economic
   impacts of drug abuse. Analysts must consider which approach is most
   appropriate for the particular issue they are assessing. For example,
   the costs of pain, suffering, anxiety, and other intangible impacts of
   drug abuse are not included in this study. Similarly, this study does
   not attempt to tabulate the total amount spent by drug users on illegal
   drugs and this amount is not directly incorporated in other components
   although a portion of what users spend is indirectly included in the
   estimated cost of crime careers.7 Finally, this report provides a
   detailed description of the data sources and methods used to calculate
   the estimates and projections of the societal costs of drug abuse in
   the United States for 1992 through 2000. The present estimates have
   either been developed based on current data (as recent as 1998) or have
   used data up to 1998 to adjust for changes in incidence/prevalence,
   population, and price. These estimates are believed to be indicative of
   the direction and magnitude of changes in drug abuse costs between 1992
   and 1998, but it should be kept in mind that some of the component
   values were not completely re-estimated for this study. As a result, in
   the near future it will be necessary to carefully re-examine the
   scientific literature on several issues that were beyond the scope of
   this study including the relationship between drug abuse and health,
   morbidity, mortality, and crime. 7 For information on what drug users
   spend on illegal drugs, consult the ONDCP report: Rhodes, William, Mary
   Layne, Patrick Johnston, and Lynne Hozik. (2000) What American Users
   Spend on Illegal Drugs 1998-1998. Office of National Drug Control
   Policy, Washington, D.C., December. 11 Section II. Introduction B.
   Scope of This Report This study estimates the economic value of many
   consequences associated with drug abuse. Types of consequences include
   health problems and health care utilization, effects on productivity,
   and other costs including crime and social welfare. In this report, the
   phrase "drug abuse" is used to refer to consequences of using illicit
   drugs, as well as societal costs pertaining to the enforcement of drug
   laws. Illicit drugs include marijuana, cocaine or heroin. This study
   does not address costs related to abuse of or dependence on legal
   substances that may be termed drugs such as alcohol, tobacco, or
   prescription medications. While the abuse of these substances also has
   significant societal costs these costs are not addressed in this study.
   This study did not collect primary data, but rather conducted analyses
   of secondary data sources. Furthermore, this study did not fully
   re-estimate the value of each cost component. When a cost component
   could be fully re-estimated based on simple tabulations of data from a
   published source, the value of the component was re-estimated. However,
   when the information necessary to fully re-estimate a component value
   was not readily available from a published source, trend factors based
   on published statistics whose values are expected to parallel changes
   in the value of the components were developed and these trend factors
   were applied to the original estimates. The basic approach taken to
   calculate the updates presented in this report was to divide the
   original estimates developed by Harwood et al. (1998) into 32
   components. Then, whether the value of each component could be
   re-estimated through straightforward tabulation of published data was
   assessed. When this was the case, the necessary data was gathered and
   the component was re-estimated. Values for 22 of the 32 components were
   re-estimated. For the remaining 10 components, more intensive effort
   would be necessary to re-estimate the component. Therefore, trend
   factors based on published statistics whose values are expected to
   parallel changes in the value of the components were estimated and
   applied to the original estimates to calculate the updated estimates.
   This study subdivides the estimates of drug abuse costs into health
   care, productivity losses, other effects, and crime costs. There are
   other ways of disaggregating the cost estimates that may be of interest
   to policy makers that were not attempted in this study. These include
   the following: · The societal cost of particular illegal drugs (e.g.,
   heroin, cocaine, or marijuana); · The effect of different modes of drug
   consumption (e.g., injection, smoking or oral); and · The implications
   of different potencies or levels of use of the drugs under
   consideration. Similarly, the results of this study were not designed
   to address specific policies to control drug abuse or the alternatives
   of drug prohibition versus legalization. The purpose of this study has
   been to identify and quantify particular negative consequences from the
   abuse of illicit drugs. These data are likely to inform the evaluation
   of particular policies. However, this study has not undertaken specific
   policy evaluations. 12 Section II. Introduction C. Overview of This
   Report Following the guidance for cost-of-illness studies adopted by
   the Public Health Service (Hodgson and Meiners 1979, 1982), this report
   is organized to differentiate health costs from non-health costs and
   the value of goods and services from the value of lost productive
   potential. The remaining chapters are organized as follows: · Chapter 3
   reviews the previous literature and provides an overview of the
   analytic methods that are used in this study. · Chapter 4 describes in
   detail the data and estimation methods used to derive each cost-of-
   illness component estimate. This chapter is divided into three major
   sections, one for each major cost category. The major cost categories
   are: health care costs, productivity losses, and the cost of other
   effects. · Chapter 5 presents the final estimates for 1992 through 1998
   overall, for each of the major cost categories, and for crime related
   costs. The crime related costs are a subset of the costs included in
   the each of the three major cost categories. · Chapter 6 presents
   projected costs for 1999 and 2000. Observed data were generally not
   available upon which to base the 1999 and 2000 projections. Therefore,
   these estimates must be used with greater caution than the 1992 through
   1998 estimates. Again, these costs are presented overall, for each of
   the major cost categories, and for crime related costs. · Finally,
   Chapter 7 provides a discussion of the estimates. 13 Section II.
   Introduction THIS PAGE BLANK 14 Section III. Methodology III.
   METHODOLOGY A. Prior Literature The updated cost estimates developed
   for this study are based on the estimates included in "The Economic
   Costs of Alcohol and Drug Abuse in the United States 1992" (Harwood et
   al., 1998). The estimates employ the same general "cost-of-illness"
   methodology that has been employed in studies of drug abuse over the
   past 20 years. The general framework of this approach was presented in
   the U.S. Public Health Service guidelines developed under Dorothy Rice
   (Hodgson and Meiners, 1982). The guidelines differentiate between
   health system expenditures, the costs of morbidity and premature
   mortality (these are losses of potential productivity), and other costs
   (e.g., criminal justice system costs and losses from accidents or
   fires). For most illnesses (for example cancer, stroke, heart disease,
   and diabetes) costs are concentrated in the health system (e.g.,
   hospitals, doctors' offices, public health clinics) or result from lost
   work due to morbidity or premature mortality (which is the loss of the
   remainder of life expectancy based on actuarial analysis). The economic
   principle of "opportunity cost" is used to attach values to
   measurements of hospital days, visits to doctors and clinics, and lost
   days of work (or household productivity). The cost-of-illness
   methodology applies directly to drug abuse, although with several
   important extensions that are generally not relevant for other health
   problems and diseases. Drug abuse (like smoking and alcohol abuse)
   causes further health problems, and the costs of these illnesses need
   to be estimated and attributed to drug abuse. Some of these include
   HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and injury/trauma. Another major
   characteristic of drug abuse with important economic implications is
   crime. This has impacts including health costs and lost work/mortality
   of crime victims, costs for the criminal justice system, and costs from
   drug abusers dropping out of the legal labor market/economy (working in
   the "drug economy" or living off of income generating/predatory crime)
   and often being incarcerated (again, they are out of the legal
   economy). The major previous cost-of-illness studies for drug abuse
   have included all of these costs. This study does not completely
   re-estimate the costs associated with each component included in the
   previous studies, but rather develops updated estimates for some
   components by applying trend factors based on published data series
   that are expected to be correlated with the actual change in the
   component. Three previous studies of the societal cost of substance
   abuse have developed similar updated estimates of the cost of drug
   abuse without completely re-estimating the component costs. The first
   of these three studies is Rice et al. (1991) which updated the 1985
   baseline estimate of the cost of alcohol, drug, and mental disorders to
   1988. The second study is Harwood et al. (1998) which developed updated
   estimates of 1995 costs for alcohol and drug abuse based on 1992
   baseline estimates. Finally, the third study is Harwood (2000) which
   calculated updated estimates of the cost of alcohol abuse in 1998 using
   1992 baseline data. All three of these studies used the same basic
   approach. That approach entails dividing the estimates into component
   costs that are likely to have been affected similarly by both real and
   price changes. Then, measures of the real and price changes that are
   specific to each cost component are identified. Finally, trend factors
   based on these measures are applied to the relevant component. 15
   Section III. Methodology As discussed in more detail in the next
   section, this study takes the same basic approach as these previous
   authors to update the value of some components. For other components,
   this study takes a more involved approach, essentially re-estimating
   the value of the component. B. Methods As noted above, the original
   1992 estimate was initially divided into 32 components. Health care
   costs are divided into eighteen components. These components are listed
   in Figure III-1. Figure III-1 Components of the Health Care Cost

   each of the components listed above one of two approaches was taken to
   update the estimate. If the component could be re-estimated through
   simple tabulations of published data then the value of the component
   was re-estimated for each year from 1992 through the most recent
   available year of published data. For subsequent years, the component
   value was trended forward based on the historical trend of the
   component value. This approach was used for 22 of the 32 components.
   For the remaining components, simple tabulations of published data
   would not be sufficient to re-estimate the component's value.
   Therefore, for these components, trend factors were developed based on
   published statistics that are expected to parallel changes in the value
   of the component and these trend factors were applied to the original
   estimate. The reliability of the resulting estimates depends on which
   of these methodologies was used to calculate the updates as well as the
   reliability of the underlying data for the calculations. The components
   whose values were re-estimates can be viewed as more reliable than
   those whose values were simply trended. A detailed discussion of the
   reliability of the estimates is provided in Section IV.D.2. In the next
   section, an overview of the re-estimation and trending methods is
   provided. In Section IV, each component is presented along with the
   specific data sources and methods used to update that component. 17
   Section III. Methodology 1. Re-estimation In many cases simple
   tabulations of published data are used to completely re-estimate the
   value of the cost component for this update. There are four groups of
   components for which the updates are essentially re-estimated. These
   are: 1. Components measuring federal government spending by function
   (e.g., specialty treatment, prevention, research, and supply
   reduction); 2. Components measuring crime related costs (e.g., costs to
   victims, crime related productivity losses, and criminal justice system
   costs); 3. Costs for premature death; and 4. Components for which other
   authors have published re-estimates (e.g., HIV/AIDS spending and
   specialty treatment costs). The first group of components are
   re-estimated based on estimates of federal government spending that are
   published annually by ONDCP in the National Drug Control Strategy:
   Budget Summary that presents estimates of spending by federal agencies
   by function (e.g., treatment, supply reduction). These estimates are
   used to re-estimate several cost components with minor adjustments to
   account for issues such as overlap with costs included in other
   component estimates. The second group of components is re-estimated
   based on data published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the
   Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics which includes statistics on
   arrests, victimizations, persons under incarceration, and criminal
   justice system costs. Using these data the cost components that are
   related to crime are divided into numerous subcategories and data for
   each of these categories are refreshed. Then, the same methods that
   were employed by Harwood et al. (1998) to calculate the 1992 estimate
   are replicated to re- estimate the value for 1993 through the most
   recent year of data available. The third category, costs related to
   premature death, is re-estimated based on counts of deaths published
   annually by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Again, the same
   methods employed by Harwood et al. (1998) to calculate the 1992
   estimate were employ to re-estimate the value for 1993 through 1998.
   Finally, the fourth category of updates whose values were re-estimated
   consists of components whose values have been re-estimated by other
   authors. The cost of specialty treatment for drug abuse was estimated
   by Mark et al. (1999) for 1992 through 1997. These values were adopted
   with minor adjustments for overlap with the costs included in other
   components. Similarly, Hellinger and Fleishman (2000) estimated the
   cost of HIV/AIDS care for 1996. This value was disaggregated into the
   non-drug abuse and drug abuse related costs and the drug abuse related
   costs were adopted for this study. Section IV provides detail on the
   data sources and methods used to re-estimate each of these components.
   18 Section III. Methodology 2. Application of Trend Factors As noted
   above, the second approach to calculating the updates is to use the
   detailed estimate of the economic cost of drug abuse developed for 1992
   as the baseline estimate and then apply trend factors for changes in
   the economic costs between 1992 and the year desired for the update.
   This section provides an overview of this method and then demonstrates
   the method in a sample calculation. a) Overview Changes in the actual
   cost of drug abuse and dependence between the year for which detailed
   estimates were developed and more recent years for which estimates are
   desired may be decomposed into two categories: changes in the frequency
   and intensity of the underlying behavioral outcomes and changes in the
   monetary valuation of these outcomes. For this project, changes in
   these components are measured using indicators of the following types:
   · Population; · Incidence/prevalence of selected drug-specific
   consequences; · Prices for health care services; · Worker compensation
   (wage rates); and · General prices. The first two factors might be
   thought of as "real" changes in the impacts related to drug abuse and
   dependence. The latter three indicators can be thought of as measures
   of price change. The simplest approach to updating or adjusting cost
   estimates would be to adjust the original total cost estimate for
   population change (about 1 percent annually) and the general change in
   prices (consumer prices increased by an average of about 2.5 percent
   annually between 1992 and 1998 based on the consumer price index). This
   approach is readily applied, the data are readily available and easily
   explained and understood. However, there are disadvantages to such a
   limited approach. There may be factors that lead various cost
   components to change at different rates across time, relating to both
   real changes in behavioral outcomes and changes in sub- component
   prices. Therefore, for this project, the original cost estimates are
   disaggregated into 32 components and numerous subcomponents--each of
   which comprises multiple components that are similar to each other in
   the nature of the economic impact that has been measured. The
   components within a group are hypothesized to be affected similarly by
   changes in both the real factors (population and/or
   incidence/prevalence) and by price/wage trends. Thus, a distinct trend
   factor is developed and applied to each of these components to
   calculate the updated cost estimate. b) Sample Algorithm To illustrate
   how this methodology is applied, a detailed example is provided. In
   1992 $14.2 billion in lost productivity was attributed to drug abuse
   related illness. The real change in the estimated cost of lost
   productivity related to drug related illness is measured as the change
   in the number of persons reporting more than 100 days of marijuana or
   cocaine use in their lifetime as 19 Section III. Methodology reported
   from the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA). Table III-1
   shows that between 1992 and 1993, the number of persons reporting more
   than 100 days of marijuana or cocaine use in their lifetime declined
   5.4 percent. The price change in the estimated cost of lost
   productivity related to drug related illness is measured based on the
   Bureau of Labor Statistics hourly compensation index. Table III-1 also
   shows that between 1992 and 1993 the hourly compensation index rose
   from 100.0 to 102.4 or 2.4 percent. Table III-1 Components of the Cost

   1994 value based on the 1993 update and so on until updated values
   through 2000 were calculated. 20 Section IV. Data and Estimation of
   Base Cost Components IV. DATA AND ESTIMATION OF BASE COST COMPONENTS
   The societal costs related to drug abuse are divided into three broad
   categories: health care costs, the cost of lost productivity, and the
   cost of other effects. Within each cost category, the cost components
   that had been developed by Harwood et al. (1998) were reviewed to
   calculate the 1992 base estimates. For each of these cost components,
   the available data for updating the estimate were reviewed and the data
   that were believed to provide the most accurate update were selected.
   This section discusses the available data for each cost component and
   describes how the available data were used to update the cost estimate.
   The tables included in each section below display the data used to
   update the respective component value. The number of years of data
   included in each table varies based on the amount of information that
   was available from the source. Thus, data on the number of chronic
   hardcore drug users in Table IV-20 is reported for 1992 through 1998,
   because ONDCP has published these data through 1998. However, the data
   on the cost of police protection in Table IV-22 is only report through
   1996, because the Bureau of Justice Statistics has only published these
   data through 1996. Similarly, when the source for the data provided a
   projection, this projection was adopted, presented in the table, and
   labeled as such. For example, Table IV-4 presents data on the U.S.
   resident population from 1992 through 2000. The estimates for 1992
   through 1999 are actuals. That for 2000 is a projection derived by the
   Bureau of the Census. When the source for the base data did not provide
   actual or projected values through 2000, The Lewin Group developed
   their own projections through 2000 for the component. The methodology
   The Lewin Group used to derive these projections is described in detail
   within the respective section. Below each table in this section that
   presents the data used to update the cost estimates, a brief
   description of the source of the data is provided. Additional detail
   about the sources of the data is provided in Appendix A. A. Health Care
   Costs Table IV-1 displays the health care cost components and their
   estimated cost for 1998. 21 Section IV. Data and Estimation of Base

   Total $12,862 Source: Analysis by The Lewin Group, 2001. The Lewin
   Group assessed the available data and determined the most appropriate
   method for updating each of these numerous components. The methods for
   updating each component are described in the following sections. 1.
   Community-Based Specialty Treatment Community-based specialty treatment
   includes all specialty drug abuse treatment that is not funded through
   a federal agency. A recent report Mark et al. (1999) provides estimates
   of specialty drug treatment costs from 1992 through 1997. These costs
   are reported in Table IV-2. 22 Section IV. Data and Estimation of Base
   Cost Components Table IV-2 Specialty Treatment Costs, 1992-1997 (in
   millions of dollars) Data Series 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997
   Specialty Treatment Costs $3,940 $4,374 $4,629 $4,792 $5,139 $5,282
   Source: Mark et al. (1999) National Spending Estimates for Mental
   health Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Treatment, 1987-1997. The Mark et
   al. (1999) estimates include costs for community-based specialty
   treatment as well as for the Department of Defense, Bureau of Indian
   Affairs, Bureau of Prisons, and Veterans Affairs. To update the
   estimate of community-based specialty treatment costs, The Lewin Group
   obtained estimates of the federal cost for the Department of Defense,
   Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Prisons, and Veterans Affairs
   treatment costs from the ONDCP National Drug Control Strategy: Budget
   Summary and subtracted these costs from the overall Mark et al (1999)
   estimates. The federal specialty treatment costs are discussed in the
   next section.8 Since the Mark et al. (1999) estimates are only
   available through 1997, spending for 1998 through 2000 was projected.
   Between 1995 and 1997 community-based specialty care costs increased
   5.1 percent annually. Between 1997 and 2000, these costs were projected
   to continue increasing at 5.1 percent annually. 2. Federal Specialty
   Treatment Costs Federal specialty treatment costs consist of costs for
   specialty treatment funded through a federal agency. Specifically, cost
   estimates for the Department of Defense, Bureau of Indian Affairs,
   Bureau of Prisons, and Veterans Affairs were obtained from ONDCP
   National Drug Control Strategy: Budget Summary. The ONDCP National Drug
   Control Strategy: Budget Summary is published annually. Thus, estimates
   of these costs were obtained for each year between 1993 and 1999 from
   these reports. The estimate for 2000 is based on the budget request for
   that year as reported in the Budget Summary for 2000. 3. Support
   Support for drug abuse related health care services includes
   prevention, training, research, and health administration. The
   methodology for updating each of the six components of support is
   discussed, respectively, below. a) Prevention Spending on prevention is
   decomposed into federal spending and state and local spending. The
   actual level of federal spending on prevention is published annually by
   ONDCP. This estimate 8 Once these amounts were subtracted, the Mark et
   al. (1999) estimate for the cost of community-based specialty treatment
   in 1992 is $374 million higher than the Harwood et al (1998) estimate
   of community-based specialty treatment costs. The Mark et al. (1999)
   estimate is higher because it is more comprehensive. 23 Section IV.
   Data and Estimation of Base Cost Components includes funding for
   prevention of alcohol abuse, however, as well as drug abuse. The
   spending estimate was apportioned between alcohol and drug abuse based
   on data from analyses of the primary reason for treatment among clients
   in the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS). Analysis of these data
   indicated that 48 percent of current clients were treated for alcohol
   abuse only, 28 percent for drug abuse only, and 24 percent for both
   alcohol and drugs. Splitting the comorbid group in half, the cost of
   alcohol and drug abuse treatment was apportioned 60-percent to alcohol
   and 40-percent drugs (Harwood et al., 1998). The actual value of
   spending for 2000 is not yet available. Therefore, the 2000 budget
   request was used as the estimate for 2000 spending. State and local
   government spending for drug abuse prevention can be estimated based on
   data included in an annual report called State Resources and Services
   Related to Alcohol and Other Drug Problems published by the National
   Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD).
   Ideally, an estimate of spending on prevention that is limited to drug
   abuse and that includes only spending funded by state and local
   government would be used. The prevention spending estimates listed in
   the NASADAD report however include funding for prevention of alcohol
   abuse and include federal funding and funding from other non-
   governmental sources. To apportion the spending between alcohol and
   drug abuse, the same ratios that were applied for federal spending on
   prevention were used. To apportion the prevention spending between
   state and local government spending and spending from the federal
   government and other sources, estimates of the proportion of total
   spending included in the NASADAD (i.e., spending for treatment,
   prevention, and all other activities) for alcohol and drug abuse that
   is from state and local government funds were used. This proportion
   ranges from 41.1 to 44.9 percent depending on the year. Table IV-3
   displays the components used to derive the estimate of state and local
   prevention spending and the final spending estimates for 1992 through
   1997. Table IV-3 Derivation of State and Local Drug Abuse Prevention

   Directors. (1999) State Resources and Services Related to Alcohol and
   Other Drug Problems, Fiscal Years 1996 and 1997: An Analysis of State
   Alcohol and Drug Abuse Profile (SADAP) Data. Based on these estimates,
   state and local spending for prevention declined 19.1 percent between
   1995 and 1996 and then increased 4.7 percent between 1996 and 1997.
   Since a consistent trend in funding in the prior years was not
   observed, it was assumed that state and local prevention funding would
   remain constant at the 1997 level in 1998 through 2000. 24 Section IV.
   Data and Estimation of Base Cost Components b) Training The cost of
   training includes initial and continuing education for specialists in
   drug and alcohol treatment as well as for other health professionals,
   law enforcement officials, criminal justice professionals, and clergy.
   No published data specific to these costs were available. Therefore,
   this estimate was updated based on two components. The first component
   measures real change based on the change in the U.S. population age 18
   years of age or older. The second component measures the price change
   based on the change in the Consumer Price Index. Table IV-4 displays
   these two components of the update for 1992 through 2000. Consumer
   Price Index estimates are not yet available for 2000. Between 1996 and
   1999, the consumer price index increased at two percent annually. This
   two-percent increase is assumed to continue between 1999 and 2000.

   3. Population estimate for 2000 is projected by the Bureau of the
   Census as of September 2000. c) Research Research spending can be
   decomposed into prevention and treatment related research. ONDCP
   publishes annual estimates for these two types of research costs in the
   National Drug Control Strategy: Budget Summary. Actual spending
   estimates are available for these two components through 1999. For
   2000, the budget request is used as the estimate of spending for these
   components. d) Health Administration The Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) estimates the percentage of health care spending
   that is for administration as part of the national health accounts.
   These percentages were adopted for 1992 through 1998 to estimate the
   administrative costs related to specialty drug treatment. These
   percentages are applied to the estimates of the cost of specialty
   treatment in each respective year to determine the cost of
   administration related to the specialty treatment. The components of
   this calculation and the resulting estimates are displayed in Table
   IV-5. 25 Section IV. Data and Estimation of Base Cost Components Table

   and Other Drug Abuse Treatment, 1987-1997. The projected percentage of
   health care costs that are related to administration for 1999 and 2000
   were estimated by HCFA based on observed data for 1997. The 5.4 percent
   estimate of administrative spending for 1992 is higher than the 4.8
   percent estimate used by Harwood et al. (1998). Since the 5.4 percent
   estimate is based on more current data, this percentage was adopted to
   calculate the 1992 estimate. 4. Medical Consequences The specialty
   treatment costs discussed in Section IV.A.1 include costs for specialty
   providers who provide rehabilitation, counseling, case management, and
   other types of services to persons or their families who have problems
   with drug abuse. In addition to the treatment offered by these
   providers drug abuse increases health care costs in the following ways:
   · Drug abuse may contribute to other illnesses or injuries that require
   treatment; · Drug abuse may complicate the treatment of other illnesses
   or injuries, perhaps resulting in longer lengths of hospital stays; or
   · Drug abuse may precipitate violent crimes that result in injuries
   that require medical care. The methodology for updating these costs is
   described in the next four sections. In the first section, hospital and
   ambulatory care costs, the methodology for updating the costs for the
   following types of hospital and outpatient medical care is described: ·
   Care for conditions specifically caused by drug abuse (e.g.,
   polyneuropathy due to drugs, narcotics affecting fetus or newborn via
   placenta or breasts); and · Additional hospital days resulting from
   comorbid drug abuse (secondary to other disorders). In the second
   section, the methodology for updating the estimated cost of four
   specific illnesses that are partially attributable to drug abuse is
   described. These illnesses are: drug-exposed 26 Section IV. Data and
   Estimation of Base Cost Components infants, TB, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis
   B and C. In the third section, the methodology for updating the health
   care costs related to violent crime is described. Finally, in the last
   section, the methodology for updating the health administration costs
   related to these costs for medical consequences is described. a)
   Hospital and Ambulatory Care Costs There were no published data
   available which could be used to re-estimate the hospital and
   ambulatory care costs related to the medical consequences of drug abuse
   through simple tabulations. Therefore, the baseline 1992 estimate of
   these costs is updated based on two factors. The real change is
   measured based on changes in the number of adults reporting more than
   100 days of using marijuana or cocaine during their lifetime as
   displayed in Table IV-6. The derivation of the estimates presented in
   Table IV-6 is based on data from the NHSDA as presented in Appendix
   Table B-1. This number fluctuated between 1995 and 1998. Since there is
   no consistent historical trend in this measure, it was assumed that it
   would be constant from 1998 through 2000. While trends in drug abuse
   related illness are expected to parallel trends in the number of heavy
   drug users, the measure of heavy drug users from the NHSDA is limited,
   because of sampling error and because it is self-reported. Table IV-6

   Services Administration (2001) National Household Survey of Drug Abuse.
   The price change is measured as the change in the Consumer Price Index
   for Medical Services (CPI-M). The actual and projected values for these
   measures are reported in Table IV-7. Table IV-7 The Consumer Price
   Index for Medical Services, 1992-2000 Actual Projected Data Series 1992

   U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2001). The value
   for 2000 reported in this table was projected based on the CPI-M for
   the months of January through September 2000. 27 Section IV. Data and
   Estimation of Base Cost Components b) Specific Disease Costs Certain
   types of medical consequences of drug abuse are underrepresented in the
   hospital and ambulatory care costs updated in Section IV.4.A. These
   include the full cost of drug-exposed infants, TB, HIV/AIDS, and
   hepatitis B and C. The methods for updating these disease specific
   costs are described in this section. (1) Drug-Exposed Infants Ideally,
   the real change in this estimate would be measured based on the change
   in the number of drug-exposed infants born each year, but this
   information was not available. As an alternative an estimate of the
   number of pregnant women reporting current illicit drug use was
   considered. The NHSDA includes pregnant respondents who are asked about
   current drug use. The sample of pregnant women in the NHSDA is small
   however. To calculate statistically valid estimates, two years worth of
   data on pregnant women are combined. The estimates of the percent of
   pregnant women who use illicit drugs are small. They vary from 2.3 to
   3.2 percent depending on the years and the estimates fluctuate from
   year to year. Because the sample size is small and the estimates
   fluctuate from year to year, data from the NHSDA was not used to update
   the cost of drug- exposed infants. Instead, the real change in this
   estimate was measured as the change in the number of births. Doing this
   assumes that the percentage of births that are drug-exposed has
   remained constant. The number of births in each year between 1992 and
   2000 is displayed in Table IV-8 below. The actual count of births is
   displayed for 1992-1998. The number of births is assumed to remain
   constant at the 1998 level in 1999 and 2000. Table IV-8 Number of
   Births, 1992-1998 Data Series 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Number

   Center for Health Statistics. (2001) Births: Final Data for 1998. The
   price change in this component is measured based on the change in the
   CPI-M. The values of this index for 1992-2000 are displayed in Table
   IV-7. (2) Tuberculosis The real change in health care costs
   attributable to tuberculosis (TB) was measured as the change in the
   number of cases of TB that were attributable to injecting or
   non-injecting drug use according to the Center for Disease Control
   (CDC). The number of TB cases was available from the CDC for each year
   between 1992 and 1999. However, the percentage of cases attributable to
   injecting or non-injecting drug use was only available for 1996 through
   1999. Between 1992 and 1996, the percentage of cases attributable to
   injecting or non-injecting drug use was assumed to be fixed at the 1996
   level. Also, since 2000 values were not yet available from the CDC, the
   change in the number of cases observed between 1999 and 2000 was
   assumed to be the same as that observed between 1998 and 1999. The
   percentage of cases attributable to drug abuse in 2000 28 Section IV.
   Data and Estimation of Base Cost Components was assumed to be the same
   as the number observed for 1999. Table IV-9 shows the number of TB
   cases overall and related to drug use between 1992 and 1999. Table IV-9

   Group, 2001. The price change in the TB costs related to drug abuse was
   measured based on the change in the CPI-M. The values of this index for
   1992 through 2000 are displayed in Table IV-7. These updates assume
   that there has not been a major change in the treatment cost per case
   for TB between 1992 and 2000. Since TB was targeted for elimination by
   the CDC after an increase in cases was observed in the late 1980s and
   early 1990s, there have been improvements in treatment practice
   observed between 1993 and 1999 and a decrease in multidrug resistant
   TB. The improvements in treatment practice and the decline in multidrug
   resistant cases may have led to a change in the cost of care per case.
   No adjustment was made to the estimates to reflect suc
