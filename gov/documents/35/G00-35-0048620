   _______________________________________________________________________

   Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the numbers
   presented below; however, as our Internet site is not yet an "official"
   method (meaning an audited method) of presenting winning numbers,
   Lottery rules state that official winning numbers may be obtained from
   any on-line retailer in Washington State or the Washington State
   Lottery.

   This page is updated after the prize verification process (8 - 9 p.m.).
   However, click here if you would like to receive an e-mail of the
   results on Saturday and Wednesday nights.
