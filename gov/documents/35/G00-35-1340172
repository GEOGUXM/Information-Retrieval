   [SGendler.jpg] Town Marshal, Steven C. Gendler, a Fountain Hills
   resident since 1985, assumed his duties in August of 1992 after
   completing a 20 year career with the Arizona Department of Public
   Safety. As a member of the DPS, he served in a wide variety of
   operational and administrative assignments including: manager of the
   planning division, grants administrator, Highway Patrol division
   commander, commander of the state Law Enforcement Training Academy, and
   as Chief of Staff for Administration. Steve retired from DPS holding
   the rank of major.

   As our Town Marshal, he serves as the community's Public Safety
   Director. The Marshal has organized a law enforcement program that has
   twice been nominated for national awards for innovation, and has
   successfully brought to our Town nearly a million dollars in state and
   federal grants. Steve Gendler holds a masters degree from the
   University of Arizona and is a graduate of the FBI National Academy in
   Quantico, VA.
