   Our Privacy Policy

   Notice

       1. This site, www.sec.gov, is provided as a public service by the
          Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is an official
          United States Government System. We do not enable "cookies." (A
          "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a website that
          allows the website to monitor your use of that site, usually
          without your knowledge.)
       2. By using this site, you are agreeing to security monitoring and
          auditing. For security purposes, and to ensure that the public
          service remains available to users, this government computer system
          employs programs to monitor network traffic to identify
          unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or to
          otherwise cause damage, including attempts to deny service to
          users.
       3. Information presented on www.sec.gov is considered public
          information and may be distributed or copied. Please do not use the
          SEC seal or any of the other logos or artwork from this site. In
          addition, please be advised that the EDGAR logo and the EDGAR and
          EDGARLink names are the SEC's registered trademarks. You may not
          use them in connection with an EDGAR-related business without a
          license from the SEC.
       4. For site management, we may collect and store information for
          statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software
          programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such
          purposes as assessing what information is of most and least
          interest, and identifying system performance or problems areas.
       5. You may send us an electronic mail with your personal information,
          comment, question, or complaint. We may store the name and address
          of the requester in order to respond. With the exception of
          comments made specifically in response to a Request for Comments
          issued by the SEC for rulemaking purposes (see the Current SEC
          Rulemaking page), we do not share your electronic mail with any
          other outside organizations except for authorized law enforcement
          investigations or in assisting investors with complaints and
          inquiries. Comments made in response to a formal SEC request are
          public information and are posted on the site in the Rulemaking
          section.
       6. This website has links to other agencies and organizations. When
          you go to another sites through the links, you are no longer on our
          site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new sites.
       7. Unauthorized attempts to upload information and/or change
          information on any portion of this site are strictly prohibited and
          are subject to prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
          of 1986 and the National Information and Infrastructure Protection
          Act of 1996 (see Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 and 1030).
