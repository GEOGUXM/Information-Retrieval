>> Projects

   The Maryland-Delaware-D.C. (MD-DE-DC) District conducts hydrologic
   projects that address a wide variety of water-resources issues,
   including water supply, ground-water contamination, nutrient loading in
   streams, effects of land use on water quality, and basic hydrologic
   data collection. The purpose of this page is to provide brief
   descriptions of the major projects currently underway in the District.

   Some projects have dedicated Internet sites due to the amount of
   information that is available online. These sites are the Chesapeake
   Bay Ecosystem Project, the Chesapeake Bay River Input Program, and the
   Baltimore Ecosystem Study.

   All projects have a small summary online including project problem,
   objectives, approach, and a project chief, and term of the project. You
   can view these projects by selecting the project from the project list
   or by searching the project summaries with a keyword search engine.
