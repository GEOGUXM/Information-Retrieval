   How QWIP Works
   QWIPs operate by photoexcitation of electrons between ground and first
   excited state subbands of multi-quantum wells (MQWs) which are
   artificially fabricated by placing thin layers of two different,
   high-bandgap semiconductor materials alternately. The bandgap
   discontinuity of two materials creates quantized subbands in the
   potential wells associated with conduction bands or valence bands. The
   structure parameters are designed so that the photo-excited carriers
   can escape from the potential wells and be collected as photocurrent.

   photoexcite electrons from the ground state of the quantum well into
   the continuum, causing a photocurrent.
