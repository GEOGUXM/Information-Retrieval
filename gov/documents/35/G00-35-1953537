    This page has been created in order to educate the general public on
    the exciting new developments made in space exploration (in other
    words, it's for those of us who don't have a Ph.D. in astronomy).
    Within these pages you will find out what ARISE is, what it will do,
    and what may happen as a result of this mission. And to help you with
    those big words, they will be linked to an online ARISE dictionary,
    which will pop up so you don't lose your place in the site. For
    example, not many of you know what interferometry is, so click on the
    word and find out!

    And also to help guide you along our webpages, here's a few icons you
   might want to know about:

     [mridea1.gif]  This is Mr. ARISE! This icon means he'll give you a
   little lesson.This is Mr. ARISE! This icon means he'll give you a
   little lesson.

     [thinking.gif]  This icon means Mr. ARISE will give you something to
                    think about.

      [define.gif]  This one means that Mr. ARISE will explain a word not
                   in the dictionary.

    If after checking out this site, questions about ARISE still "arise",
                                 then email:
