     __________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)
   website and reviewing our privacy policy.  Our privacy policy is clear:
   We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our
   website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

  Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically
   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically.  This information does not
   identify you personally.  We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
       private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
       from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
       number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
       are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
    3. The date and time you access our site; and
    4. The pages you visit.

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use.  We do not track or record
   information about individuals and their visits.
   If You Send Us Personal Information
   If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in
   registering a data set or URL, sending the GCMD staff an E-mail, or
   filling out and submitting a form on the GCMD web site with your
   personal information -- we use that information to either respond to
   your message or associate your name with a data set description.  In
   the case of E-mail or questions/comments directed toward the GCMD
   staff, your personal information will be used only to respond to your
   message and to track how the GCMD handled the response.  In the case of
   providing your personal information with respect to a data set
   description (as author, investigator, provider, etc...), your personal
   information will only be used to identify you as a person associated
   with that data set description and serve no other purpose.
   Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you
   provide nor do we give it to any private organizations. The GCMD does
   not collect information for commercial marketing.
   Links to Other Sites
   Our website has Web links to the sites of many other organizations and
   federal agencies.  Once you link to another site outside the GCMD, you
   are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.  We will not pass
   any of your personal information through any of these links.
   Young Visitors
   We at the GCMD are especially concerned about protecting children's
   privacy.  We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's
   Internet explorations.  It is particularly important for parents to
   guide their children when children are asked to provide personal
   information on line.  The GCMD Learning Center encourages children to
   E-mail their questions to scientists and the GCMD staff.  We do not ask
   children for any personal information in their E-mail, though we
   recommend they at least type their name and E-mail address as part of
   their message so that we can respond personally to them.  Providing
   this information is entirely optional.  We specifically ask children to
   get their parents' permission before providing any information on line
   -- at our site or any other site-- and hope parents will always be
   involved in those decisions.  Most importantly, when children do
   provide information through the GCMD website, it is only used to enable
   us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.
