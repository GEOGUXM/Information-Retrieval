                Our Responsibilities

        The Council's responsibilities are set forth in both federal and
        state law. Under the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance
        and Bill of Rights Act, the Council and all the programs, activities
        and projects it funds, including the Program Development Fund Grants
        and local Area Boards on Developmental Disabilities, must adhere to
        the following principles (as amended in the Developmental
        Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000):
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities, including those with
          the most severe developmental disabilities, are capable of
          self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and
          inclusion in all facets of community life, but often require the
          provision of community services, individualized supports and other
          assistance;
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families have
          competencies, capabilities and personal goals that should be
          recognized, supported and encouraged, and any assistance to such
          individuals should be provided in an individualized manner,
          consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities,
          concerns, abilities, and capabilities of such individuals;
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are
          the primary decisionmakers regarding the services and supports such
          individuals and their families receive, including regarding
          choosing where the individuals live from available options, and
          play decisionmaking roles in the policies and programs that affect
          the lives of such individuals and their families;
        * Services, supports and other assistance should be provided in a
          manner that demonstrates respect for individual dignity, personal
          preferences, and cultural differences;
        * Specific efforts must be made to ensure that individuals from
          racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and their families enjoy
          increased and meaningful opportunities to access and use community
          services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance
          available to other individuals with developmental disabilities and
          their families;
        * Recruitment efforts in disciplines related to developmental
          disabilities relating to pre-service training, community training,
          practice, administration, and policymaking must focus on bringing
          larger numbers of racial and ethnic minorities into the disciplines
          in order to provide appropriate skills, knowledge, role models, and
          sufficient personnel to address the growing needs of an
          increasingly diverse population;
        * With education and support, communities can be accessible to and
          responsive to the needs of individuals with developmental
          disabilities and their families and are enriched by full and active
          participation in community activities, and contributions, by
          individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities have access to
          opportunities and the necessary support to be included in community
          life, have interdependent relationships, live in homes and
          communities, and make contributions to their families, communities,
          State, and the Nation.
        * Efforts undertaken to maintain or expand community-based living
          options for individuals with developmental disabilities should be
          monitored in order to determine and report to appropriate
          individuals and entities the extent of access by individuals with
          developmental disabilities to those options and the extent of
          compliance by entities providing those options with quality
          assurance standards;
        * Families of children with developmental disabilities need to have
          access to and use of safe and appropriate child care and
          before-school and after-school programs, in the most integrated
          settings, in order to enrich the participation of the children in
          community life;
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities need to have access to
          and use of public transportation, in order to be independent and
          directly contribute to and participate in all facets of community
          life; and
        * Individuals with developmental disabilities need to have access to
          and use of recreational, leisure, and social opportunities in the
          most integrated settings, in order to enrich their participation in
          community life.

        The federal law also allows additional requirements to be placed on
        Council funding to accomplish the mandates of the federal Act. These
        are accomplished through program instructions, information, or
        memoranda issued by the Administration on Developmental
        Disabilities. Councils must also follow specific procedures to
        receive federal funding, and must attest to certain assurances
        regarding how the money is spent.

        The Council's state-mandated functions are defined in California
        Welfare & Institutions Code (WIC) Sections 4540-4542. The majority
        of the state statutes that govern services for individuals with
        developmental disabilities are found in WIC Sections known
        collectively as the Lanterman Act. For a complete list of governing
        statutes and regulations concerning services to individuals with
        developmental disabilities, visit the Department of Developmental
        Services web page entitled Lanterman Act and Other Statutes.
