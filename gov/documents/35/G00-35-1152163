     * Teacher at Sea Program - Are you a teacher who is interested in
       oceanographic research? Does the idea of living aboard an
       ocean-going research vessel intrigue you? Would you like to work as
       a crew member on a one to three week scientific cruise? The
       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is looking
       for motivated teachers (K-16) with a desire to do scientific
       research at sea and share that experience with students and
       colleagues.
