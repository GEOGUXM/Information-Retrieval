   Forms and Records Management Services (FRMS) provides department forms and
   quality service to DSHS program staff and the public. Welcome to our home
   page.

      DSHS programs produce both forms and publications. A DSHS form is any
      printed or electronic document developed by DSHS to collect and
      distribute information. A DSHS publication is informational material
      such as brochures, booklets, posters, flyers, and pamphlets.
