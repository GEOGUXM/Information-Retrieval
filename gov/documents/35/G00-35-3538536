   Q3: What is the Office of Applied Studies?

     The Office of Applied Studies (OAS) is an Office within the
     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
     an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. OAS is
     the primary source of national data on the prevalence, treatment,
     and consequences of substance abuse in the United States. OAS
     regularly collects data on drug-related emergency room visits and
     drug-related deaths.  OAS  is also the national source of
     information on the location, organization, and capacity of providers
     which offer services to prevent and treat substance abuse and the
     cost, quality, and effectiveness of the services of these
     providers. We have three major data collection systems to provide
     this information on a regular basis:  the National Household Survey
     on Drug Abuse, the Drug and Alcohol Services Information System, and
     the Drug Abuse Warning Network.   For further information on OAS and
     our services, click on the following:   Office of Applied Studies
