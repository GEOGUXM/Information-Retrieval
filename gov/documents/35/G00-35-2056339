   Chairman Greta Joy Dicus

   US Nuclear Regulatory Commission

   Washington, DC 20555


   Honorable Greta Joy Dicus:

   We are encouraged by the numerous statements from the Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission that all safety systems at Nuclear Power Plants
   are Y2K ready. The Committee continues to believe that the electrical
   grid will be stable and that disruptions from Y2K will be minimal. We
   are concerned, however, about the lack of public confidence in the
   nuclear industrys efforts and specific post December 31, 1999 operating
   regimes.

   Recent testimony by GAO indicates that they share our concerns
   regarding the use of existing contingency plans in the Y2K risk
   environment. Moreover, although we believe that the on-site inspections
   by NRC confirmed that NPPs are complying with "acceptable industry Y2K-
   readiness standards", there are some lingering questions about whether
   sufficient independent validation has occurred.

   Please provide the following information by November 15, 1999:

    1. A list of nuclear power plants and how their mission-critical
       systems were validated as Y2K-ready, categorized according to the
       following: internal quality assurance, external review, and
       independent validation and verification. As possible, describe the
       equivalence and differences in such approaches;
    2. Detailed information about voluntary pledges by industry
       representatives to maintain a 30-45 day supply of emergency diesel
       generator fuel, and other voluntary measures to reduce the risk of
       plant failure;
    3. A description of the process by which NRC will make a final
       determination as to which NPP, if any, will be shut-down for safety
       concerns during the rollover period; and,
    4. The minimal safety standards that will be acceptable under the
       proposed suspension of technical regulations.

   Please contact John Stephenson or James Dailey at (202) 224-5224 if you
   have questions about the above requests. I look forward to your
   response and thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.


   Sincerely,
   Senator Bennett Senator Dodd
   Chairman        Vice-Chairman
