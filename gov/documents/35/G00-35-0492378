   USDA ANNOUNCES TWO NEW EMPOWERMENT ZONE COMMUNITIES

   Educational and Economic Improvements Top List of Goals Set By Northern
   Maine and South Texas Communities

        WASHINGTON, January 11, 2002--Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman
   today announced the selection of Northern Maine Development Commission,
   Inc. (Aroostook County) in Maine and Middle Rio Grande FUTURO
   Communities in Texas to receive the designation as the latest rural
   Empowerment Zones (EZs). The selection of these two communities brings
   to 10 the total number of rural Empowerment Zones designated since
   Congress initiated the program in the early 1990s.

        Investments made in Empowerment Zones serve as a beacon of hope
   for the residents who are working hard to create a brighter future for
   their families and their community, said Veneman. The investments will
   help build a solid foundation upon which social and economic prosperity
   will flourish.

        In Aroostook County, Maine, the largest county in the state, the
   sparsely populated area has relied heavily on timber and agriculture as
   its main economic base. Since 1960, the area has recorded a 14.5
   percent out-migration of residents, due largely to the closure of
   Loring Air Force Base and changes in the countys potato industry. The
   out-migration, along with high unemployment has contributed to the
   current economic problems facing this northern region of Maine.

        The Middle Rio Grande FUTURO (Families United to Utilize Regional
   Opportunities) Communities is a five-county region in a remote area of
   rural Texas along the Mexican border. Four of the five counties are
   among the 20 poorest counties in the U.S. Portions of Maverick, Zavala,
   Uvalde, Dimmit and LaSalle Counties suffer from a 20% unemployment rate
   along with a 46.5 percent poverty rate.

        Communities designated as an Empowerment Zone receive a variety of
   federal tax benefits along with technical assistance provided through
   USDA Rural Development. An initial $100,000 grant is provided to each
   designated community for start-up costs.

        The selection process is a very competitive process. In order to
   be eligible for the empowerment program, communities must have high
   levels of poverty or significant population loss. Eligible communities
   must also prepare a long-term, community driven strategic plan for
   community development.

        "The program allows communities, not the federal government, to
   decide what methods and resources will be used to create and sustain
   long-term private investment and job creation," Veneman said.

        Since the inception of the EZ program, and its companion
   Enterprise Community program, USDA Rural Development has invested over
   $560 million in grants and loans in the 59 communities to stimulate
   housing and business sector growth, as well as assisted with the
   development of utility infrastructure and community facilities. To
   date, designated communities have garnered over $3 billion in Federal,
   tribal, state, and local government, private sector and non-profit
   financial support.
