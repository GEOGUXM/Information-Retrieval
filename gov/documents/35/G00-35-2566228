   AIRPORT SAFETY RESEARCH

   The Airport Safety Technology Section (AAR-411) of the Federal Aviation
   Administration's Airport Technology Research & Development Branch, is
   tasked with the development of new technologies in four primary areas.
   In each of these areas, researchers will help to identify, develop, and
   conduct research to improve methods, procedures, and technologies to
   reduce fatal accident rates due to operational hazards at our Nations
   airports. By "clicking" on any of the areas listed below,  more
   information is available on the innovative research projects that will
   contribute to the FAA goal of reducing the fatal accident rate 80%.
