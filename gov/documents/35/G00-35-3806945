   VA Puget Sound Clinicians' are a talented group of individuals.  In
   addition to their many duties, our physicians are expected to produce
   professional papers for presentation to students and other groups.  In
   an effort to showcase their work while making work products freely
   available, we have begun to publish VA physician articles and reports
   on this site.  VA Physicians who are interested in having their work
   published on this site should contact the Webmaster.
