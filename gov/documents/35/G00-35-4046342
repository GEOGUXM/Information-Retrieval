     I
   f you have defaulted on any of your federal education loans, the first
   step is to contact the agency that is billing you.   Explain your
   situation fully, and ask them what options are available to resolve
   your problem.   Let them know that you are willing to repay your loan
   and ask them to work with you.   Always stay in touch with your lender
   or collection agency.
