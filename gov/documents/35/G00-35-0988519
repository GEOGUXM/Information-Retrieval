   USGS Water Resources of Wyoming

      The USGS provides maps, reports, and information to help others meet
      their needs to manage, develop, and protect America's water, energy,
      mineral, and land resources. We help find natural resources needed for
      tomorrow, and supply scientific understanding needed to help minimize
      or mitigate the effects of natural hazards and environmental damage
      caused by human activities. The results of our efforts touch the daily
      lives of almost every American.
