   General Information

   The purpose of these pages is to provide members of the general public
   with basic information on how to obtain access to records maintained in
   the files of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

   The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 USC 552, serves as the vehicle
   to obtain federal agency records, unless the records (or any portion
   thereof) are protected from disclosure by one of the FOIA's nine
   exemptions or by one of its three special law enforcement record
   exclusions. The OCC's disclosure regulation is located at 12 CFR 4. As
   a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, the OCC also
   complies with Treasury regulations. For further information about the
   Department of the Treasury's disclosure requirements, visit the
   Department of the Treasury FOIA site.
