   National Emergency Medical Services for Children – Mission Statement

   The Emergency Medical Services for Children program is designed to
   reduce the child and youth mortality and morbidity sustained due to
   severe illness or trauma. It aims to ensure state of the art emergency
   medical care for the ill or injured child and adolescent: to ensure
   that pediatric services are well integrated into an emergency medical
   services (EMS) system backed by optimal resources; and to ensure that
   the entire spectrum of emergency services, including primary prevention
   of illness and injury, acute care, and rehabilitation, is provided to
   children and adolescents as well as adults.

   What is the Alaska EMSC program?

   The Alaska EMSC program is designed to enhance the pediatric
   capabilities of the current system originally designed for adults.
   Alaska first became a grantee with the EMSC program in the early
   1990’s. We have had several grants since that time and EMSC has
   maintained a strong presence in Alaska.

   The program resides in the Section of Community Health and EMS,
   Division of Public Health, Department of Health and Social Services.

   The Section of Community Health and EMS currently receives funding from
   the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program of the Maternal and
   Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Health Resources and Services
   Administration (HRSA), to enhance the capabilities of the state EMS
   system to deal with sick and injured children. The program is broad in
   scope and ensures the entire spectrum of emergency services, including
   primary prevention of illness and injury acute care, and
   rehabilitation, is provided. For more in depth information, see our
   Frequently Asked Questions information sheet.

    FAQ in .pdf

   The Alaska EMSC program has two active federal grants: Improving EMS
   for Children in Alaska and Improve EMS Capabilities for Alaska Native
   Children. Many of the activities of the EMSC program are accomplished
   through contracts with other agencies and individuals.  To download a
   .pdf copy of these, click on the name or use the downloads page.

   The EMSC program is frequently soliciting proposals from individuals
   and agencies to assist with activities of the program. See the list of
   the current Letters of Solicitation if interested.

   Emergency Trauma Technician Course Final Report from Howard Luke
   Academy.  The final report from the course at the Howard Luke Academy
   is filled with great information on how to handle some of the
   challenges of coordinating and delivering an ETT course in high
   schools.  The report ends with the benefits of such a course and that
   they benefits do outweigh the challenges.

   Pediatric Self-Study Modules.  The EMSC program, through a contract
   with Deborah Whitethorn, RN, EMT-III, BSN, has developed two pediatric
   self-study modules based on the Alaska Pediatric Emergency Course.  The
   modules are Pediatric Trauma and Pediatric Airway Management and
   Respiratory Distress.  Click on the titles to download the programs.

            Subscribing to the ak-emsc Internet Mail List Server

   Because of the scope and complexity of statewide EMS for Children
   (EMSC) projects, the Section of Community Health and EMS is sponsoring
   an internet mail list server dedicated to EMSC activities in Alaska.

   To join this free list, send an e-mail message to:

   list.manager@list.state.ak.us

   The body of the message should be:

   subscribe ak-emsc

   We will be using this service to distribute informational updates and
   hope that people who have subscribed to the list also will use it as a
   forum for sharing information on best practices, local EMSC activities,
   and other issues likely to be interesting to others on the list.

   Although we hope to use electronic forms of communication to great
   advantage with this project, we will continue to send EMSC project
   related correspondence and other materials via the U.S. Postal Service
   when appropriate or necessary.
