        FAQs about GSFC's NASA-ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program

   This FAQ is an attempt to answer some frequently asked questions about
   the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program at Goddard Space Flight Center.
   For general information about the NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship
   Program or the program at other NASA centers, you should follow the
   links to the NASA/ASEE program.

   Nothing in this FAQ is binding on NASA, ASEE, Howard University or the
   University of Maryland. We try to keep this FAQ as current and
   informative as possible. If you have further questions, please send
   Email to Prof. Joshua Halpern at jbh@scs.howard.edu (1999) or Prof.
   Mirela Gavrilas at mirela@eng.umd.edu (2000).
   __________________________________________________________________

   What are the odds of winning a Fellowship?
   We get between 70 and 100 applications per year. Our NASA contract
   provides about 13 first year Fellowships each year, and about the same
   number of second year Fellows are invited back. In addition, several
   Goddard Directorates directly fund additional Summer Faculty
   Fellowships. Summer Faculty Fellowships are collaborations between
   faculty and their Goddard hosts. We are looking for situations where
   the Fellow can contribute to GSFC, and where doing research at GSFC
   will benefit the Fellows.
   __________________________________________________________________

   When would I hear about a first year award?
   On or about March 1. As much else these days, the offers are subject to
   our receiving the grant contract from NASA. It has been our experience
   in the past few years at Howard or the University of Maryland that this
   only comes after April 1. The formal offer can only be made when the
   grant contract is received. We will keep tentative awardees advised of
   all developments. On the other hand, this has been the situation for
   over thirty years, and we have not had to renege on any offer.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Is the fellowship for one, or two summers?
   Fellowships are awarded for one summer, but it is usual for fellows to
   be invited back for a second summer.
   __________________________________________________________________

   Why don't you just say that the fellowship is for two summers?
   Because there are a few reasons why a fellow might not be invited back.
   These include but are not limited to:

   Reduced program funding. Fellows who do not meet the conditions of the
   award, particularly that of doing their research at Goddard Conflicts
   between Fellows and their GSFC hosts Fellows resigning their
   University/College position Disregard of NASA/GSFC safety and security
   regulations
   __________________________________________________________________

   How about a third summer?
   Rarely, if ever, and the third summer MUST be funded by a Goddard
   Directorate. This policy varies among NASA centers.
   __________________________________________________________________

   And the fourth?
   Forget it.
   __________________________________________________________________

   When would I receive notification of being invited back?
   We send out letters of intention in late December to those first year
   Fellows who we hope to invite back. The offer, as mentioned above would
   be subject to the receipt of a grant contract from NASA
   __________________________________________________________________

   If I have been a Fellow, can I reapply?
   Our policy is that we will not consider applicants who reapply less
   than two years after holding their most recent Summer Faculty
   Fellowship. Although we will not reject outright applications from
   those who reapply after two years have passed, this will be a negative
   factor in evaluating them, and more so if their previous fellowship was
   for research at Goddard. Acquainting University/College faculty with
   NASA and Goddard Space Flight Center is a major Summer Faculty
   Fellowship Program goal. Those who have previously held such
   fellowships are already acquainted with NASA.
   __________________________________________________________________

   How are Fellows selected?
   For the Goddard program, your applications are collected by the
   University of Maryland (even years), or Howard (odd years)
   co-directors. Data from the application form, your resumes and your
   letters of recommendation are collated. In the week after the close of
   the competition, we meet with the Goddard University Affairs Office and
   review the applications. At that point we ascertain whether an
   application meets all of the program requirements (US citizen, faculty
   member at an accredited university, college or community college, etc).
   Ineligible applications are not further evaluated.

   We then try to find the best matches between applicants and Goddard
   laboratories. You are asked for your preferences in the application.
   This is VERY important information for us. It is a GREAT help if you
   can first make contact with the Goddard lab you are interested in, and
   discuss what they are doing, and how your interests and skills would
   fit in. You can have no better advocate than a lab head, who wants to
   collaborate with you.

   Packets are prepared containing copies of the application form, the
   applicants resumes, and the letters of recommendation. These are sent
   to the laboratories through the Directorates, and each Directorate
   receives a summary copy of all the applications. Your application is
   evaluated by the laboratories, who make recommendations to the
   Directorates. The Directorates provide the Goddard University Affairs
   Office with a prioritized list of preferences. The final choice is made
   by the University Affairs Office with the advice of the University of
   Maryland, or Howard University co-Director.

   The final selection also considers such factors as whether the
   applicant has previously worked at Goddard, or previously held a Summer
   Faculty Fellowship, distribution of awardees across Goddard
   Directorates, distribution between University, College and Community
   College faculty, geographic distribution, etc.
   __________________________________________________________________

   How are fellows paid?
   Fellows are not paid for work, they receive an award which enables them
   to do research at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. The award is given
   in three roughly equal checks, one at the beginning of the summer, when
   the awardee arrives, one at the end of the summer, when the Fellow
   leaves, and one in the middle. You receive a fellowship award, with no
   deductions.
   __________________________________________________________________

   OK, who would pay the fellowship award?
   Howard University (odd years) or the University of Maryland, College
   Park (even years).
   __________________________________________________________________

   How about taxes?
   The fellowships ARE taxable. YOU are responsible for paying the taxes.
   We recommend that you consult your tax advisor for advice on these
   matters. We are NOT tax advisors, however, we do note that you are not
   receiving pay for work, but a fellowship.
   __________________________________________________________________

   So will I get a W-2?
   No, you will get a 1099 form in February of the next year
   __________________________________________________________________

   Who provides my health insurance?
   You must provide your own health insurance. Most fellows are covered by
   their University/College health insurance. If you do not have such
   coverage, or your plan does not cover you when you are away from home,
   we would recommend your purchasing additional health insurance AT YOUR
   OWN EXPENSE
   __________________________________________________________________

   You mean there are no fringe benefits?
   Fellows are not employees of NASA, ASEE, Goddard Space Flight Center,
   Howard University or the University of Maryland. There are NO fringe
   benefits associated with a Summer Faculty Fellowship Award other than
   the opportunity to do research with some of the best equipment on earth
   (and off) and to collaborate with NASA scientists and engineers.
   __________________________________________________________________

   I don't live in the Washington, DC area. Will I be paid for travel?
   Fellows who do not reside in the Washington, DC area will receive
   $1,000 as a relocation allowance and payment for ONE round trip to and
   from home. If you commute on a daily basis no travel and relocation
   payments will be made.
   __________________________________________________________________

   How about housing?
   We provide awardees who need housing with books and lists of properties
   in the Greenbelt/College Park/Washington, DC area. There are many
   furnished apartments in the area which serve University of Maryland
   students and which are available for rental. There are also some
   dormitory accommodations which are available. This has not proved to be
   a great problem in the past. You should plan on spending between $500
   and $1000 per month for housing, depending on whether your family comes
   with you. Fellows have often shared housing to reduce expenses. Finally
   we would recommend your consulting your tax advisor about the
   deductibility of such expenses.
   __________________________________________________________________

   When does the program start?
   Generally the first week of June, sometimes the last week of May
   __________________________________________________________________

   Could I start earlier/later?
   One or two weeks in either direction is fine, more can be a problem
   because you would not be able to take part in the Summer Faculty
   Fellowship seminars. We believe that scientific and technical
   interactions among Summer Faculty Fellows is an important component of
   the problem. You MUST spend a minimum of ten weeks at Goddard.
   __________________________________________________________________

   I have to go to a conference during the summer. Can I do so without
   affecting the fellowship?
   If the conference is for a day or so fine. If the conference is four or
   five days, we will ask you to prolong your stay at Goddard by that
   amount. In this, as everything else, we seek to be flexible, but not
   foolish.
   __________________________________________________________________

   What does ASEE have to do with this program?
   They print and mail several thousand applications and brochures in the
   Fall and take care of publicity and advertising for the program. They
   advise NASA and the university co-directors how to improve the program
   using site visits, and analysis of of the applications and the Fellows
   exit survey.
   __________________________________________________________________

   What do Howard, and the University of Maryland do?
   Each year NASA provides a grant to Howard or the University of Maryland
   to operate the NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program at Goddard
   Space Flight Center. The universities are responsible for making all
   fellowship, relocation and travel payments. We also are responsible for
   accepting the applications and organizing them for review by the
   University Affairs Office and the various Directorates at Goddard.

   During the summer, the University co-directors organize a Friday SFFP
   seminar for the fellows and their Goddard hosts, as well as some
   special seminars with invited outside speakers. Finally, we function as
   ombudsmen for the Fellows, trying to resolve any problems they may
   have.
