California Inmates Sew the Stars and Stripes with Pride (Chowchilla Prison
Responds to Increased Demand)

   (Chowchilla, CA) Inmates at the Prison Industry Authoritys (PIA) flag
   making enterprise at the Central California Womens Facility (CCWF) in
   Chowchilla are working to meet the increased demand for flags statewide
   in the wake of the September 11 tragedy.

   PIA produced the California flags that were provided to the families of
   the victims of the attack on America at the Governors Day of
   Remembrance at the Capitol last month. Additionally, United States
   flags displayed in the archways of the Capitol during this ceremony
   were also made at CCWF.

   Overall, PIA has received orders for nearly 9,000 flags in the last
   year, many of those since September 11. Inmates have produced
   approximately 5,500 United States and 3,300 California Bear flags in
   addition to 100 official California Highway Patrol banners during that
   time. PIA products and services are produced only for governmental
   entities, including federal, state, and local governmental agencies.

   "With the increased demand for flags, our factory in Chowchilla has
   been operating at full capacity. I am proud of the Prison Industry
   Authoritys flag enterprise and the ability of our staff and inmates to
   respond to this challenge," said General Manager Paul Miller. "PIA
   inmates have been silk screening, cutting, sewing, and inspecting flags
   with a unique sense of pride. Even though the inmates are incarcerated,
   they are motivated to respond like other Americans to the events of
   September 11. For many, this is their way of providing a service to
   their country. Their work was well represented at the recent ceremony
   at the State Capitol to honor the victims of this tragedy."

   PIA is the State organization that provides productive job assignments
   for inmates in Californias correctional institutions. Inmate work
   assignments help reduce idleness, decrease violence, and improve inmate
   work habits and job skills. Court-ordered restitution/fines are
   deducted, from the wages earned by PIA inmates, and transferred to the
   Crime Victims Restitution Fund.

Prison Industry Authority Receives Awards For Internet "User Friendliness"

   State Information Officers Council Honors PIA With Six Communication
   Awards

   (Folsom, CA)--The California Prison Industry Authority (PIA) received
   the grand and gold awards for internet "User Friendliness" at the State
   Information Officers Council (SIOC) annual awards luncheon held last
   week in Sacramento. The awards recognize excellence in State government
   communications.

   The judge's comments in the competition stated, "PIA's design was easy
   to follow and the complexity of the project, having to create a catalog
   for customers to get information and place orders, made the project a
   real winner."

   According to PIA's General Manager David King, "We are thrilled to
   receive these awards which reflect the diligent work of our staff to
   create a website that is truly user friendly. PIA customers can obtain
   easy access to our products and services. I am delighted with the
   response that our customers have demonstrated."

   PIA's lnternet homepage is an "electronic catalog" of over 1,800 items
   that are produced by prison inmates. The electronic catalog showcases
   products ranging from hand-crafted furniture and clothing to steel
   bunks and -- yes -- license plates. Customers can view products and
   place orders over the Internet by accessing PIA's home page address:
   www.pia.ca.gov. PIA products and services are available only to
   federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Since its grand
   opening last summer, over 350,000 contacts have been made to the site.

   This electronic catalog is a database driven system that was designed
   to be updated by downloading information from PIA's Manufacturing
   Accounting Planning System (MAPS). For example, when a product is no
   longer available and is taken out of MAPS, it will also be deleted from
   the electronic catalog. This gives customers a more current list of
   products and services. Other benefits include lower distribution costs
   (as compared to the hard copy catalog) and more visibility to potential
   customers and Internet users. The paper catalog contains more than
   1,000 pages of products currently available.

   PIA also received the following SIOC awards: gold award for best
   slogan, silver award for direct mail, and honorable mentions for PIA's
   calendar and media kit.

   SIOC is a non-profit organization of State Public Information Officers
   that meets on a monthly basis to discuss trends and developments in the
   field of public information. Award recipients represent the State's
   finest achievements in government communication.

   PIA is the State organization that provides productive job assignments
   for inmates in California correctional institutions. PIA's work
   assignments help reduce idleness and violence and improve inmate work
   habits and job skills. Court-ordered restitution/fines are deducted
   from the wages earned by PIA inmates and transferred to the Crime
   Victims' Restitution Fund. Inmates receive wages of $.30 to $.95 per
   hour.

Prison Industries' Andy Parks Receives Correctional Industries Marketing
Award -- December 1, 1998

   A. C. (Andy) Parks, the Assistant General Manager of the Marketing
   Division for the California Prison Industry Authority (PIA), was
   selected in November by the Correctional Industries Association as
   their 1998 National Marketing and Sales Person of the Year. The honor
   is awarded to recognize excellence in building and establishing
   customers in the field of correctional industry marketing and sales.

   Parks administers a marketing team of 45 employees which produces over
   $150 million in revenues annually. Parks has worked for PIA for six
   years and has made significant progress in its marketing efforts. He
   has redesigned PIA's philosophy to make marketing more than just
   selling products to customers. His significant accomplishments include:

   Prompt Delivery Program: Traditionally, prison industry programs
   produce goods in response to specific orders. To improve service, Parks
   organized and implemented a "make to stock" program that provides
   eight-day service in the Sacramento area and 20 days statewide. The
   Prompt Delivery Program produced many satisfied customers and sales of
   more than $10.8 million in its second year of operation.

   Redesigned Catalog: Parks directed the redesign of the PIA catalog to
   motivate customers to purchase products. Additionally, he initiated a
   change in PIA's promotional materials which now include a full range of
   marketing tools to promote products as well as providing information.

   Electronic Catalog: In addition to PIA's paper catalog, Parks directed
   the development of its online electronic catalog which makes over 1,800
   products with 24,000 variations available to customers via the
   internet.

   Merchandise Display Centers: To address the need for customers to view
   PIA products, Parks opened the Merchandise Display Center in
   Sacramento. This first center was such a success, that a second center
   will soon be opened in the Southern California area to increase
   convenience for customers.

   Additional Markets: To increase sales to local governmental agencies,
   Parks implemented special efforts by using aggressive pricing policies,
   increasing contact from the sales representatives, focusing sales
   events, and improving service.

   Customer Satisfaction Surveys/Focus Groups: Parks initiated the use of
   surveys and focus groups to determine the needs of PIA's customers.
   Parks has begun building the necessary information for identifying
   strategies for meeting these customer needs.

   PIA is the State organization that provides productive job assignments
   for inmates in California correctional institutions. PIA's work
   assignments help reduce idleness and violence and improve inmate work
   habits and job skills. Court-ordered restitution/fines are deducted
   from the wages earned by PIA inmates and transferred to the Crime

   hour. PIA operates 68 factories that produce over 1,800 goods and
   services including: flags, coffee, shoes, printing services, signs,

CSU, Chico Unveils Online Ordering Catalog for State Prisons -- July 20, 1998

   California State University, Chico unveiled today, July 20, a new World
   Wide Web page that provides California prisons the ability to market
   products online.

   Working with the California Prison Industry Authority (PIA), CSU, Chico
   created an "electronic catalog" that showcases prison-made products
   ranging from hand-made furniture to steel bunks. The electronic catalog
   allows customers to view products and place orders over the Internet.
   PIA's Internet address is http://www.pia.ca.gov/.

   CSU, Chico received a contract earlier this year to build and maintain
   the electronic catalog, which contains more than 1,000 pages of
   products currently available. Approximately 30 CSU, Chico faculty,
   staff and students contributed to the design, development and
   activation of the Web site.

   "It is very progressive of PIA to go to electronic marketing ahead of
   many other state agencies," said Robert Main, project director and
   chair of CSU, Chico's Communication Design Department. "We enjoyed
   working with PIA, and it has been a wonderful learning experience for
   us."

   David King, general manager of PIA, stated, "The expertise of the
   faculty and staff at California State University, Chico in electronic
   data processing has provided PIA with the latest technology in Internet
   service. The catalog brings over 24,000 products and services to PIA's
   customers online. This effort streamlines our operations and enhances
   service to our customers."

   PIA, the state organization that provides productive job assignments
   for inmates in California correctional institutions, operates more than
   70 factories that produce a variety of goods and services, including
   flags, coffee, shoes, printing services, signs, binders, eye wear,

California prison factories generate $150 million in sales each year, new UC
Berkeley report finds -- June 23, 1998

   Berkeley -- If you think prison inmates only make license places, your
   behind the times. A report released this month by an economist at the
   University of California, Berkeley found California prison factories
   and farms are responsible for over $ 150 million in direct sales
   annually in the state. Prison products today range from silk-screened
   clothing in Tehachapi to fine-ground optics in Vacaville.

   The report is the first comprehensive study of the economic impact of
   the California Prison Industry Authority, the largest prison work
   program in any state. The organization employs about 7,000 inmates in
   23 prisons from Del Norte to San Diego County, said report author
   George Goldman, a cooperative extension economist in the Department of
   Agriculture and Resource Economics at the UC Berkeley College of
   Natural Resources.

   Prison work programs in California voluntary, and inmates line up for a
   chance to work, even though they are paid on average only 57 cents per
   hour. The pay scale ranges from 30 cents to 95 cents per hour.

   Goldman's study shows a positive economic impact on the state from
   prison work programs and also indicates what would happen if they did
   not exist. "If you wipe out the California Prison Industry Authority,
   you'd lose $62 million in personal income in the slate," said Goldman.
   Additionally, 560 jobs would disappear, not counting those held by
   convicts and state civil service staff.

   Goldman found prison labor is also healthy for the private sector.
   Prison programs produce goods that in many cases would otherwise come
   from outside the state while employing the private sector to supply raw
   materials. Biggest prison products are food, with $33 million in sales
   annually; fabrics, $32 million; paper and wood products, $30 million;
   and metal products, $22 million.

   A main goal of prison work programs is to provide "a positive outlet to
   help inmates productively use their time and energies." said Frank
   Losco, spokesperson for the Prison Industry Authority. Another goal is
   to instill good work habits, including appropriate job behavior and
   time management.

   Although the prison programs are self-supporting, "it's not trivial to
   set up one of these factories," said Goldman. "And the factories cannot
   be as efficient as the commercial sector, what with the extra costs of
   security, prison shutdowns and so forth."

   In California only government agencies are allowed to purchase prison
   products, unlike other states such as Nevada, where convicts make cars
   for retail sale, and Oregon, where jeans are produced. In fact,
   Oregon's jeans -- labeled "Prison Blues" -- proved so popular last year
   that prison factories couldn't keep up with demand.

   In California, however, the prisons themselves are their own best
   customers. The California Department of Corrections purchases about
   half of what the prisons make, choosing from a Prison Industry
   Authority catalog.

   Goldman has done economic surveys for many industries, hut this is the
   first time he has studied prison work programs in depth, and even he
   was surprised at the breadth of items produced.

   Prison goods and services include farm and dairy products, such as
   eggs, prunes and almonds; meat cutting; coffee roasting; manufacturing
   of furniture, shoes and clothing; dental and optical services; and much
   more, including a knitting mill run by the California Men's Colony in
   San Luis Obispo.

   "I thought like everyone else, vaguely, that prisoners make license
   plates," said Goldman. "I didn't even know if they still did that.... I
   had no idea they made mattresses al San Quentin or still ran prison
   farms. They do make more than $10 million worth of license places each
   year."

   Compared to Other California industries, prison production weighs in
   with about the same economic impact as book binding ($138 million),
   pulp mills ($133 million), chewing gum manufacturing ($142 million), or
   a single moderately successful Steven Spielberg film, said Goldman.
   That's small change compared to California's blockbuster industries
   such as agriculture, said Goldman, but "it's still a good thing and has
   a positive impact on the state."
