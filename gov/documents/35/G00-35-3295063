                     ___________________________________

   The U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
   (NCLIS) is a permanent, independent agency of the federal government
   charged with advising the executive and legislative branches on
   national library and information policies and plans.

   It was established in 1970 with the enactment of Public Law 91-345.
   Technical amendments in 1991 (Public Law 102-95) clarified terms of
   membership and the Commission's international authority and
   responsibility. The Museum and Library Services Act of 1996 (Public Law
   104-208) established that the Commission shall have the responsibility
   to advise the Director of the Institute for Museum and Library Services
   (IMLS) on general policies with respect to the duties, powers and
   authority of the IMLS relating to library services.

   The Commission
     * reports directly to the White House and the Congress on the
       implementation of national policy,
     * conducts studies, surveys and analyses of the nation's library and
       information needs,
     * promotes research and development activities,
     * conducts hearings and issues publications as appropriate and
     * develops overall plans for meeting national library and
       informational needs and for the coordination of activities at the
       federal, state and local levels.
     * provides policy advice to IMLS Director regarding financial
       assistance for library services.
