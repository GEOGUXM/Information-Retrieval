 STORY LEAD:
 Grass Hedges to Curb Soil Runoff

 Switchgrass, a sturdy rangeland grass being considered for livestock feed
 and for fuel alcohol production, may also prove useful in stiff-grass hedge
 plantings that help curb soil erosion.

 Agricultural Research Service scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of
 switchgrass, Panicum virgatum, and eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides,
 for controlling water-driven soil erosion.

 Hydraulic engineer Darrel M. Temple at ARS' Hydraulic Engineering Research
 Laboratory in Stillwater, Okla., working with agronomist Seth M. Dabney at
 ARS' National Sedimentation Laboratory in Oxford, Miss., have determined the
 depth of water that different widths of hedges can retain before being bent
 over and overtopped.

 The scientists tested narrow, parallel strips of switchgrass and gamagrass
 in an outdoor laboratory. In field applications, these hedges are planted
 close to the contour of slopes and form a porous barrier to flowing water,
 causing it to pond above them, and diffusing the flow over a large area as
 the water passes through them.

 Temple and Dabney tested the hedges by discharging more and more water
 through them until the grasses bent and broke under the flow. Switchgrass
 proved to be better able to withstand the pressure than gamagrass, standing
 erect and holding back sediment and water. The one- and two-row hedges were
 found to be nearly as effective as the wider three- and four-row hedges
 tested.

 For the next two years, the scientists will focus on the ability of
 switchgrass hedges to protect the soil from concentrated waterflow on very
 steep slopes that are already eroded.

 More about this study was published in the October issue of Agricultural
 Research magazine, on the World Wide Web at:
