   What is AmeriCorps*NCCC?
   AmeriCorps*National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) teams meet
   community needs in cooperation with non-profit programs, state and
   local agencies, and other community groups.
   AmeriCorps*NCCC is a 10-month residential national service program for
   young women and men between the ages of 18 - 24. Members serve on
   environmental projects, education, public safety, disaster relief, and
   other community needs across the country. Check out the different types
   of projects.
   Members live at one of five regional campuses located in Denver, CO,
   Charleston, SC, San Diego, CA, Perry Point, MD, and Washington, DC,
   though their projects often take them to other communities throughout
   their region. Contact the campus and check out what different types of
   regional projects they've worked on.
   Find out how your community could benefit from an AmeriCorps*NCCC team
