   Safe Effective Treatment to Stop Seizures Can Be Delivered Outside of the
                                    Hospital

Overview

   A new study shows that paramedics can safely and effectively treat
   patients who are suffering from acute and prolonged seizures with
   injections of benzodiazepines, a mild form of tranquilizers. In 59
   percent of patients who received lorazepam, and in 43 percent of
   patients treated with diazepam, the seizures stopped before they
   arrived at the emergency department. Conversely, only 21 percent of
   patients in the placebo group arrived at the hospital seizure free.

   A new study shows that paramedics can safely and effectively treat
   patients who are suffering from acute and prolonged seizures with
   injections of benzodiazepines, a mild form of tranquilizers. In 59
   percent of patients who received lorazepam, and in 43 percent of
   patients treated with diazepam, the seizures stopped before they
   arrived at the emergency department. Conversely, only 21 percent of
   patients in the placebo group arrived at the hospital seizure free.

   The study is reported in the August 30, 2001 issue of The New England
   Journal of Medicine* by Daniel H. Lowenstein, M.D., now at Harvard
   Medical School in Boston, and formerly with the University of
   California at San Francisco, where the study took place. The lead
   author is Brian Alldredge, PharmD, UCSF professor of clinical pharmacy
   and clinical professor of neurology. The National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) funded the research.

   The study included 205 patients diagnosed with "status epilepticus,"
   continuous or repeated seizures lasting 5 minutes or more without
   recovery of consciousness. Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for
   initial control of the prolonged type of seizures once the patients are
   in the hospital, but until now there has been no research evaluating
   the drugs' safety when they are delivered outside of the hospital.

   The NEJM study reports that the odds that the patient's seizure would
   terminate by the time of admission to an emergency department were 4.8
   times higher in the lorazepam group compared to the placebo group; 2.3
   times higher in the diazepam group versus the placebo group; and 1.9
   times higher in the lorazepam group compared to the diazepam group.
   Patients who received lorazepam also experienced shorter seizures than
   did the patients receiving diazepam or placebo.

   The researchers also closely monitored respiratory and cardiovascular
   complications, which are common side effects of benzodiazepines. They
   reported complications in 11 percent of the lorazepam group, 10 percent
   of the diazepam group, but even higher, 23 percent, of the placebo
   group. The authors suggest that respiratory complications associated
   with prolonged seizures may be more pronounced than those caused by
   injection of the study drugs.

   Although the differences between the two drugs were not statistically
   significant, the authors recommend lorazepam as the best prehospital
   treatment for patients in status epilepticus. However, they caution
   that lorazepam must be refrigerated, unlike diazepam.

   "A patient who is in status epilepticus needs to be treated as quickly
   as possible in order to prevent serious neurological damage," said
   Audrey S. Penn, M.D., acting director of NINDS. "This study
   demonstrates that there is a safe and early treatment for a serious
   condition."

   Despite the positive outcome of the study, the authors note that
   between 41 and 57 percent of patients were still in status epilepticus
   at the time of arrival at the emergency department and were twice as
   likely to require intensive care as those patients whose seizures ended
   earlier. Because of this, they recommend conducting future research
   with higher doses of lorazepam and diazepam to find the optimal therapy
   for these patients.

   The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health in
   Bethesda., Maryland and is the nation's primary supporter of biomedical
   research institute on the brain and nervous system. The Institute is
   celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.
