   sha1pure is a Tcl extension that computes an sha1 message digest or
   hmac. sha1pure uses only core Tcl commands and therefore requires no
   compilation.

  How To Use

   sha1pure can be loaded using package require sha1pure. Alternatively,
   it can be sourced or even inserted directly into another source file.

   sha1 message digests are computed using the sha1pure::sha1 command. It
   takes a single argument and returns the message digest. For example:
      % sha1pure::sha1 "hello world"
      2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed

   sha1 hmacs are computed using the sha1pure::hmac command. Its takes key
   and text arguments and returns the hmac. For example:
      % sha1pure::hmac "our little secret" "hello world"
      a7ed9d62819b9788e22171d9108a00c370104526

  Performance

   sha1pure was not written for efficiency and is inappropriate for large
   arguments. Applications requiring high-performance should use Andreas
   Kupries' trf extension. trf implements several other message digests
   and contains many other conversion functions.

   sha1pure is appropriate for small arguments. Here are some timings. The
   numbers along the top of this chart indicate the message size (in
   bytes). So for example, to produce a digest of a 50-byte string on a
   Sparc 20 required 46ms (about 1/20 of a second). Question marks are
   placeholders timings Iexpect to get in the near future.

   The careful reader will note that the times for 10 and 50 are very
   close. In fact, the sha1 algorithm pads all messages out to (roughly
   speaking) 64-byte boundaries so any difference in times is just system
   noise. The precise steps in the algorithm occur at 56 + 64n characters.

   If you want to do your own timings, run: sha1pure::time

   I have optimized the code but only modestly because the performance is
   already acceptable for my own purposes. If you want to send me
   additional speedups, fine. However, I would prefer not to destroy the
   readability of the code or otherwise perturb it too much. The current
   implementation parallels the pseudocode in FIPS 180-1 very closely - in
   fact, most of the comments are direct quotes from the FIPS. I'd
   hesitate to give that up.

  Credits

   The hmac-sha1 implementation was taken from hmac-md5 which was written
   by D. J. Hagberg.

  Other Caveats

   sha1 is defined over strings with length less than 2^64. This
   implementation limits string lengths to 2^32. This restriction could be
   removed, however there seems no point to it given the speed with which
   such strings could be handled in the first place.

   sha1pure has not been tested on machines with 64-bit integers. It is
   possible that it may not work on all 64-bit machines, due to integer
   layout although I haven't checked any. (I would be interested to hear
   feedback about this.)

  Testing

   sha1pure includes a test suite. For simplicity, it is included in the
   sha1pure package itself. To run the tests, load the package and run:
   sha1pure::test

  Source

sha1pure.tcl The source to sha1pure. Note: if you've got the Tcl plugin
             loaded in your browser, you'll have to shift-click when fetching to
             avoid it being executed!
pkgIndex.tcl Only necessary if you want to load sha1pure as a package.

  Installation

   There is no installation script since it is expected that most people
   will simply insert or include the sha1pure.tcl file into their
   applications directly. However, a pkgIndex.tcl file is available so
   that sha1pure can be installed as a package.

  Generic Disclaimer

   Although I can't promise anything in the way of support, I'd be
   interested to hear about your experiences using it (good or bad). I'm
   also interested in hearing bug reports and suggestions for improvement
   even though I can't promise to implement them.

   If you send me a bug, fix, or question, include the version of
   sha1pure, version of Tcl, and name and version of the OS that you are
   using. Before sending mail, it may be helpful to verify that your
   problem still exists in the latest version. You can check on the
   current release and whether it addresses your problems by retrieving
   the latest HISTORY.
