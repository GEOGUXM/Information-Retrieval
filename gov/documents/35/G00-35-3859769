                    Code-Sharing in the Airline Industry


 Travelers should be aware that a flight may be operated either by the
U.S. carrier whose code appears on listings and tickets for the flight,
  or by another airline, which may be foreign, that has a code-share
            relationship with the U.S. airline in question.

The FAA has safety guidelines for U.S. airlines that code-share or are
 considering a code-share arrangement with a foreign airline. However,
        the FAA does not assess the safety of foreign airlines.

   The Department of Transportation approves and maintains a list of
    active U.S. airline code-share relationships. U.S. air carriers
     interested in code-sharing should apply to the Department of
                     Transportation for approval.

      U.S. air carriers and operators should note that FAA flight
  prohibitions apply to any segment carrying the U.S. carrier's code.

                    Who Benefits from Code-sharing?

· For air carriers, code-sharing provides a cost-efficient way to enter
 new markets and expand their systems by using the existing facilities
              and scheduled operations of other airlines.

· For consumers, code-sharing encourages competition between carriers,
   particularly for traffic moving to or from cities "behind" major
            gateways, and it can increase service options.

 · For cities and communities, code-sharing provides direct links to
 larger domestic and international air service networks, which in turn
           encourage foreign investment, tourism and trade.
