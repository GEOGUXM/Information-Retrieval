    Note to Editors: There will be opportunities to obtain video including
      close ups of fish species (e.g., sturgeon, largemouth bass, channel
         catfish, trout), unusual scientific equipment, and scientists
     conducting research (e.g., sea lamprey control research). The center
                     director is available for interviews.

           Merger combines talents of two Wisconsin science centers

      The U.S. Geological Survey has merged two of its Wisconsin science
     centers to form the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center. The
    move combines the talents of the Upper Mississippi Science Center in La
     Crosse and the Environmental Management Technical Center in Onalaska.
    The combined center supports nearly 200 federal, state, and university
                                  personnel.

     "The decision to merge makes sense," said Center Director Dr. Leslie
     Holland-Bartels. "Combining the two centers will enable us to better
     leverage the talents of our scientific and technical staff. Together,
        we can accomplish much more than we could working separately."

     Center research focuses on aquatic ecology, migratory birds, fishery
     drug research and development, declining and endangered species, and
    environmental contaminants. Findings are used by resource managers and
       decision makers in the Department of the Interior, other federal
                   agencies, states, and the private sector.

         The Center's location on the Mississippi River provides USGS
      researchers the opportunity to work daily on issues impacting this
      important national resource. "The Mississippi River is home to many
     species of fish and waterfowl and it also serves as a major economic
    resource. Center researchers play a critical role in understanding the
        changes occurring in the upper portion of the river," said Dr.
    Holland-Bartels. "We work closely with river managers to determine how
        fish and wildlife are affected by factors such as lock and dam
      operations, increased commercial navigation, recreational boating,
              floodplain development, and industrial pollution."

      The Center's long-term monitoring program on the Upper Mississippi
      River System provides valuable information about the health of the
    river. This information, made available through the Center's World Wide
      Web site, is used to help ensure that ecological conditions of the
      river remain acceptable and to help identify the causes of resource
                                   problems.

      Other Center programs also help support a healthy environment. The
     Center is the headquarters for a national fisheries drug research and
     development program needed to ensure that fish raised in public fish
      hatcheries remain healthy. Without medicinal drugs, hatchery-raised
                     fish are prone to numerous diseases.

        Researchers also are developing methods of controlling invasive
      species. Because they multiply so quickly, invasive species such as
    zebra mussels, purple loosestrife, and sea lamprey pose a major threat
    to both the ecosystem and the economy. In the case of the sea lamprey,
      Center researchers developed a chemical that kills lamprey without
     affecting other fish. This new formulation is expected to reduce the
    population of the parasitic sea lamprey in Lakes Huron and Michigan by
                               about 85 percent.

    Dr. Holland-Bartels will oversee the science program, the La Crosse and
       Onalaska physical plants, and six state-operated field stations.
       Facilities include research laboratories, a fish and invertebrate
      husbandry facility, a Geographic Information Systems laboratory, a
       technical library, and staff offices. The Center also operates an
    extensive network of outdoor research ponds and a fleet of water craft
     suited for year-round research on inland waters. The ponds and indoor
      environmental chambers enable researchers to create simulated field
                       conditions for research efforts.
        As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and
     civilian mapping agency the USGS works in cooperation with more than
     2000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial,
       scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other
        customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS
       scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural
      disasters, contribute to sound conservation, economic and physical
    development of the nation's natural resources, and enhance the quality
    of life by monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral resources.
