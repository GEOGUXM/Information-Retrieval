   Hawaiian Earthquakes

                             HVO Seismic Network

   The network
   Seismic monitoring of the active Hawaiian volcanoes began in 1912.
   Since then, the seismographic network operated and maintained by the
   U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) has
   expanded to over 60 stations on the Big Island. Data from remote
   stations are continuously telemetered in real-time to HVO.

   HVO's network coverage is most dense on Kilauea. A sparser network of
   stations covers Mauna Loa and the other active volcanoes, Lo`ihi and
   Hualalai. The seismic network is set up to monitor volcanic and
   tectonic features on the island of Hawai`i.

   Instumentation and recording
   The network consists principally of instruments that are most sensitive
   to local earthquakes. We are engaged in a continuing effort to upgrade
   the network to include seismometers that are capable of recording a
   much wider range of seismic signals, including some of very long
   wavelength, and to incorporate microwave technology for transmitting
   greater amounts of data to HVO.

   Each telemetered station has a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) for
   FM multiplex transmission to HVO by radio. After discrimination at the
   receiver, the analog signals are converted to digital form as part of
   the routine computer location processing and archiving.

   At HVO, the telemetered seismic signals are automatically detected and
   processed in near-real-time by the CUSP (California Institute of
   Technology-USGS Seismic Processing) routine. Hands-on, interactive data
   analysis follows to confirm and refine the automatic estimates. Data
   are then archived onto magneto-optical disks. Continuous data are also
   written onto digital audio tape.

   History
   Optical drum seismographs were maintained at Uwekahuna (HVO) and Hilo.
   These less sensitive optical records were used primarily to measure
   amplitudes for magnitude calucations to supplement reading from the
   high-gain stations. A helicorder drum seismograph is still maintained
   on Oahu (Honolulu station operated by the Pacific Tsunami Warning
   Center).

   Analog signals from selected stations were recorded on Develocorder A
   and B, using 16-mm microfilm. FM signals from the telemetering network
   were recorded directly on one-inch magnetic tape. September 1992 marked
   the discontinuation of the one-inch magnetic tape recorder,
   Develocorder B, and the optical drum seismographs at Uwekahuna Vault.
   Hilo seismographs were discontinued in October 1993. The magnetic tape
   recorder was replaced by three 4-mm digital-audio tape (DAT) recording
   units. The DAT recorders run continuously, in automatic rotation, as
   each 30-hr tape is filled. Develocorder A was discontinued in September
   1997. A substitute for the develocorder is now in development.
