   Background
   Since the 1930s, West Nile virus (WNV) has been commonly reported to
   cause asymptomatic infection and fevers in humans in Africa, West Asia,
   and the Middle East. But, human and animals infection had never been
   documented in the Western Hemisphere until 1999. In 1999 and 2000,
   outbreaks of WNV encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and other
   febrile illnesses were reported in persons living in the New York City
   metropolitan area. In these two years, 83 human cases of West Nile
   illness were reported; 9 died. In 2001, the first cases of WNV
   encephalitis outside of the New York City metro area occurred when 2
   cases were reported from a rural Florida county in July and August.

   WNV is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes become
   infected when they feed on infected birds that have high levels of WNV
   in their blood. Infected mosquitoes can then transmit WNV when they
   feed on humans or other animals.
   WNV is not transmitted from person to person and there is no evidence
   that a person can get infected by handling live or dead infected birds.
   But, to add a further level of safety, if birds or other potentially
   infected animals must be handled, a protective barrier (e.g., gloves,
   inverted plastic bags) should be used.
   Most WNV infected humans have no symptoms. A small proportion develops
   mild symptoms that include fever, headache, body aches, skin rash and
   swollen lymph glands. Less than 1% of infected people develop more
   severe illness that includes meningitis (inflammation of the spinal
   cord) or encephalitis. The symptoms of these illnesses can include
   headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma,
   tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. Of the few people
   that develop encephalitis, a small proportion die but, overall, this is
   estimated to occur in less than 1 out of 1000 infections.

   There is no specific treatment for WNV infection or vaccine to prevent
   it. Treatment of severe illnesses includes hospitalization, use of
   intravenous fluids and nutrition, respiratory support, prevention of
   secondary infections, and good nursing care. Medical care should be
   sought as soon as possible for persons who have symptoms suggesting
   severe illness.

   Individuals can reduce their contacts with mosquitoes by taking these
   actions:

   When outdoors, wear clothing that covers the skin such as long sleeve
   shirts and pants, apply effective insect repellent to clothing and
   exposed skin, and curb outside activity during the hours that
   mosquitoes are feeding which often includes dawn and dusk. In addition,
   screens should be applied to doors and windows and regularly maintained
   to keep mosquitoes from entering the home.

   2001 Surveillance Activity
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with the U.S.
   Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant
   Health Inspection Service, state wildlife agencies, and state and local
   health and vector control agencies to track the occurrence of West Nile
   virus (WNV). Organizations in the lower 48 States and localities are
   actively participating in this program.

   The West Nile Virus Surveillance System is intended to monitor the
   geographic and temporal spread of WNV over the contiguous United
   States, to further develop national public health strategies for WNV
   surveillance, prevention, and control, to develop a more complete
   regional picture of the geographic distribution and incidence of
   similar viruses, and to provide national and regional information to
   public health officials, elected government officials, and the public.
   There are five surveillance activities:
     * Human Surveillance: Physicians will observe patients for clinical
       signs of WNV and conduct laboratory testing as appropriate.
     * Veterinary Surveillance: Veterinarians will monitor horses, dogs,
       and cats for clinical signs of neurological disease and conduct
       laboratory testing when appropriate. In 2000, the number of
       reported WNV illnesses in horses peaked and persisted after human
       illnesses. This could indicate that horses are not a sensitive
       sentinel for the prediction of human illness but more study of this
       is necessary.
     * Wild Bird Surveillance: Surveillance participants will monitor
       virus activity in wild birds. Surveillance for dead crows, in
       particular, is a sensitive means to detect the presence of WNV in
       an area. In 2000, there was a geographic expansion of WNV-infected
       wild birds. In 1999 the affected area consisted of parts of
       Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and one county in Maryland. In
       2000 the affected area stretched from Vermont to North Carolina.
     * Sentinel Flock Surveillance: Surveillance participants will monitor
       virus activity in sentinel chicken flocks.
     * Mosquito Surveillance: Surveillance participants will monitor virus
       activity in collected mosquitoes. Surveillance of mosquito
       populations will be used to detect WNV, to help identify potential
       mosquito vectors in a particular area, and to monitor population
       densities of those vectors.
