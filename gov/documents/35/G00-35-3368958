   THE CHIEF ) ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, ) U.S. House of Representatives )
   Appellee. ) ____________________________________) Before the Board of
   Directors: Glen D. Nager, Chair; James N. Adler; Jerry M. Hunter;
   Lawrence Z. Lorber; Virginia A. Seitz, Members DECISION OF THE BOARD OF
   DIRECTORS Appellant, Jarvis Gray, a former employee of the House of
   Representatives Postal Operations (the "HPO"), lost his employment when
   HPO internal mail functions were taken over by a private contractor,
   Pitney Bowes Management Services ("PBMS"). Appellant claims that the
   Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (the "CAO") of the House
   failed to provide him with adequate advance notice of his prospective
   termination, as required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
   Notification Act (the "WARN Act"), as applied by section 205 of the
   Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (the "CAA"), 2 U.S.C. ยง 1315,
   and the Board's implementing regulations. In particular, appellant
   argues on appeal that the distribution of a December 13, 1995
   memorandum advising of the prospective take-over at a meeting of
   employees on December 13, 1995 did not constitute a reasonable method
   of delivery, within the meaning of the Board's implementing
   regulations, and that the memorandum itself did not satisfy the
   requirements of the WARN Act, as applied by the CAA and the Board's
   regulations. For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the
   Hearing Officer's decision granting summary judgment against appellant.
   In this case, the Hearing Officer concluded that, although the notice
   provided by the CAO omitted the expected date of the office closing and
   the expected date of the employees' separation from employment, as
   required by section 639.7(d)(2) of the Board's implementing
   regulations, the December 13, 1995 memorandum "substantially complied
   with the notice requirements of the WARN Act as incorporated in CAA ยง
   205; any omissions of information normally required in such a notice
   were, under the circumstances here, minor, inadvertent errors which do
   not give rise to a violation." Conclusion of Law No. 4 at 2. In Gerard
   J. Schmelzer v. Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (Case No.
   96-HS-14 (WN), consolidated on appeal with Case Nos. 96- HS-05, 06, 09,
   16, 18, 20, 26 (WN)) (hereinafter "Schmelzer"), the Board affirmed the
   Hearing Officer's legal conclusion, reasoning that the December 13,
   1995 memorandum substantially complied with the statute and regulations
   because "all appellants either knew the dates on which their employment
   with the House would terminate and PBMS would take over the functions
   of the HPO or attended a meeting that took place at least 60 days
   before the closing of the HPO, at which these dates were discussed.
   Thus, the notification purpose of the statute was satisfied despite the
   technical deficiencies in the December 13, 1995 memorandum." Schmelzer
   at 14. That holding in Schmelzer also governs the resolution of this
   case. It is undisputed that, in addition to the December 13, 1995
   employee meeting, appellant attended a December 14, 1995 PBMS
   orientation session and that, at that time, he learned the date on
   which PBMS expected to take over HPO operations. Finding of Fact No. 12
   at 4; Decision at 55. Accordingly, under Schmelzer, appellant received
   sufficient notice for purposes of section 205 and its implementing
   regulations. The only facts that appellant points to that are different
   from those found in Schmelzer do not change that result. Appellant
   claims that he did not receive timely notice of his actual termination
   date because, as explained at the December 14, 1995 orientation
   session, PBMS's contract had a contingency clause which allowed it to
   cancel within two weeks of the take-over date. For that reason,
   appellant contends, he reasonably believed that the February 14, 1996
   take- over date was only tentative. Appellant further argues that,
   although he read the December 13, 1995 memorandum posted on an employee
   bulletin board shortly after it was distributed, the CAO should be held
   liable because appellant did not receive a copy of the memorandum at
   the December 13, 1995 employee meeting. The Board finds these
   contentions to be without merit. Section 639.7(b) of the Board's
   regulations defines "date" as the specific date or 14-day period at
   which "separations are expected to occur." Section 639.7(a)(4) also
   states that "[t]he information provided in the notice shall be based on
   the best information available to the employing office at the time the
   notice is served." Even taking the facts and the reasonable inferences
   to be derived from these facts in the light most favorable to
   appellant, it is nonetheless clear that appellant knew the "expected"
   date of the take-over, as legally required by the Board's regulations.
   As the Hearing Officer stated: "While complainant says that at this
   meeting there was mention that, under the contract, PBMS had a two-week
   period in which they could 'change their mind about taking over,' his
   declaration refers to February 14, 1996 as the 'expected' takeover
   date, which conforms precisely to the regulation's requirement that
   employees be informed of the 'expected' date of the office closing."
   Decision at 55. Similarly, it does not matter whether the December 13,
   1995 memorandum was distributed at the December 13, 1995 employee
   meeting by CAO staff or by HPO employees, as appellant contends. As the
   Board stated in Schmelzer at 14-15: Section 639.8 of the Board's
   regulations allows the use of "[a]ny reasonable 2 method of delivery"
   and terms signed receipts "optional." Under the circumstances here, we
   agree with the Hearing Officer's conclusion that distributing a
   memorandum at the meetings of the employees was a reasonable method of
   effecting delivery to these employees. That appellant did not receive a
   copy of the memorandum at that meeting does not alter this conclusion.
   As the Hearing Officer concluded, appellant "was aware of all the
   information in the December 13, 1995 memorandum on or shortly after the
   date of its distribution, and thus his failure to receive a copy of
   that which was distributed generally in a reasonable manner is
   immaterial." Decision at 45. See also Saxion v. Titan-C-Manufacturing,
   Inc., 86 F.3d 553, 555 (6th Cir. 1996); cf. Wholesale and Retail Food
   Distribution Local 63 v. Sante Fe Terminal Services, Inc., 826 F. Supp.
   326, 333 (C.D. Cal. 1993) (properly addressed letter placed in the care
   of the postal service is presumed to have arrived and employer is not
   liable under WARN when union leader fails to receive letter properly
   mailed). The Board therefore affirms the decision of the Hearing
   Officer. It is so ordered. Issued, Washington, D.C., December 1, 1997.
