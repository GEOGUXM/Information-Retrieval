   Custom Order PM-ESIP Data
   AMSU Image

   Welcome to the PM-ESIP Custom Order Processing System. This working
   prototype provides on-line access to current data products from the
   AMSU, SSM/I and TMI instruments. On-line data is available for at least
   the past year for each of the data sets.

   Custom order options include the following:
     * subsetting based on geotemporal bounds, instrument channel, or
       geophysical parameter
     * remapping, gridding, or averaging the data
     * translating the data to a specified output format

   The prototype allows a user to download standard data products, or to
   specify the various custom processing requirements and retrieve the
   resulting products. Additional custom order functionality is planned to
   be added in the future.

   Enter the data system at any of the following points:
     * DATA SEARCH - to narrow down the list of available data by
       parameter, instrument, or platform
     * SUBSET DATA - to specify geotemporal bounds
     * DATA ACCESS - to browse data holdings and information, download
       data files, or specify custom order processing

   The Global Hydrology Resource Center provides data management,
   customization and distribution services for the Global Hydrology
   Climate Center. The Global Hydrology and Climate Center is located
   within the newly created National Space Science and Technology Center
   in Huntsville, Alabama. In addition to the passive microwave data sets,
   the GHRC has other atmospheric and meteorological data sets and
   products available for download or ordering at
   http://wwwghrc.msfc.nasa.gov/ghrc/search.html .
