   Models and Applications

      The Toxics Program develops computer simulation and statistical models
      as an integral part of the Program's field investigations. The
      increased knowledge gained from the development and application of
      models greatly enhances the transfer value of research conducted at the
      sites and can have a significant effect on decisions related to human
      and environmental exposure and remedial alternatives. Information on
      the types of simulation and statistical models used by the program is
      available.
