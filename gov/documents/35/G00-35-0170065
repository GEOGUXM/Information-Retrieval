   The EDC DAAC was established as part of NASA's Earth Observing System
   (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS) initiative to process,
   archive, and distribute land-related data collected by EOS sensors,
   thereby promoting the inter-disciplinary study and understanding of the
   integrated Earth system. The EDC DAAC role subsequently was expanded to
   include processing and distribution responsibilities related to Landsat
   7 data. We archive and distribute ASTER and MODIS data from Terra, the
   first EOS satellite, and will receive MODIS data from Aqua. We also
   produce ASTER higher-level products. The archives at EDC hold the
   world's largest collection of civilian remotely sensed data covering
   the Earth's land masses. Skip past What's new
