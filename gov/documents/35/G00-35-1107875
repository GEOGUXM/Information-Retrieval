Obtaining Allocations and Accounts

   At NERSC allocations are made for projects that are funded by DOE's
   Office of Science. Starting in FY 2000 the allocations process has
   instituted a broader scientific peer review and allows a certain number
   of allocations to be made for projects that aren't directly funded by
   DOE's Office of Science but that fulfill its mission requirements. See
   New NERSC Allocation Process Starting in FY 2000.

   Project accounts are called repositories (repos). Every year in the
   June to July timeframe Principal Investigators apply for funding for
   both existing and new repositories. For information on the allocations
   process, see the Allocations page.

   Allocations are made for the Cray PVP Cluster, the MPP systems (Cray
   T3E and IBM SP) and the HPSS mass storage system. As of 1999 all Cray
   and SP usernames have corresponding usernames in HPSS. A user with an
   active NERSC user account may apply for an account on the NERSC Math
   and Visualization Servers, and may request an AFS shared file system
   account by contacting the Account Support group.

   As part of the allocations process, each PI specifies which existing
   users should be continued for the next fiscal year, and what people to
   add as new users. For new repos, the PI can specify which users to add.
   In order to communicate effectively with users and in order to abide by
   DOE computer use regulations we must have the following information for
   each user: name, citizenship, email address, work phone number, and
   work institution (organization). Users are given login names, also
   called usernames, that are associated with repositories. On the T3E and
   SP only one username per user is allowed. On the PVP cluster users must
   use one of their existing usernames when they get added to a new repo.
   PVP users are encouraged to combine their existing usernames into one
   if they wish to. Please contact the Account Support group if you wish
   to do this.

   The PI may designate repo managers who help to administer the repo. At
   any time during the fiscal year (which runs from October 1 through
   September 30) PIs and repo managers can request user additions to and
   deletions from their repository using the NIM web interface: use the
   "Add/Delete User" link in NIM's main menu (located in the leftmost
   frame).

Allocation Units

   On the PVP Cluster the allocation unit is the "Cray Resource Unit"
   (CRU) hour. See Account Charging on the PVP Cluster.

   On the MPP systems the allocation unit is the "MPP Hour": 1 MPP hour
   equals 1 T3E processor hour. See Accounting on the T3E or Accounting on
   the SP. .

   On HPSS the allocation unit is the Storage Resource Unit (SRU) based on
   storage used in HPSS and file transfers. See NERSC Storage Resource
   Units.

Allocation Management

   Repositories that haven't used significant amounts of time by mid-year
   will be adjusted by transferring a part of the unused balance to the
   corresponding DOE Office reserve:

     * On April 1:
          + if usage is less than 20% transfer 25% of the unused balance
          + if usage is less than 10% transfer 50% of the unused balance
     * On July 1:
          + if usage is less than 30% transfer 25% of the unused balance
          + if usage is less than 20% transfer 50% of the unused balance
          + if usage is less than 10% transfer 80% of the unused balance
     * On August 1:
          + if no usage close the repo and transfer balance to the reserve

Usage Reporting

   Usage reporting is accomplished using the NERSC Information Management
   system NIM..

  What happens if a repo or user balance is negative

   Accounting information is sent from computers to the accounting system
   once daily (in the early morning, Pacific Time). At this time actions
   are taken if a repo or user balance is negative.

   If a repo runs out of time all usernames which are not associated with
   another repository of the same allocation type (either MPP or PVP) are
   restricted. Restricted users are able to log in, but cannot submit
   batch jobs, run parallel jobs, or run lengthly interactive programs.

   Usernames that are associated with another repo (of the same allocation
   type) that has a positive account balance are able to run jobs as
   usual, but are not able to charge to the overdrawn repo.

   The PI and repo managers receive an email notifying them that the repo
   is negative. They should send an email to their NERSC Monitor stating
   how much time the repo needs for the rest of the fiscal year.

   If and when the repo receives additional time, any users that have been
   restricted will be unrestricted the following morning (when the
   accounting updates occur).

   Likewise, when a user goes over her/his individual "allowed percent" in
   a given repo, that user is restricted if s/he has no other repo to
   charge to. The user receives an email to this effect. The user should
   contact the repository's PI or a repo manager: for contact information
   click the More Repo Info link in NIM's Repository Summary Frame. See
   the NIM Users Manual for more information on using NIM. A PI or repo
   manager can change the user's allowed percent using the "Update User
   List" link in NIM's Repository Summary Frame.

User Policies

     * Computer Use Policies
     * Password Policy and Procedures
     * Account Ownership Policies
     * Acknowledgement Policy

Username Management

   On most NERSC platforms, each user has a single username, which can
   charge to one or more repos.

   Your username can be in one of the following states:

   Active
          The usual state for active users in repos with a positive
          balance.

   Restricted
          This happens if either the user or the repo runs out of time.

          On the SP, T3E, and PVP cluster a username is restricted if a
          (username, repo) pair runs out of time:

          + If the the user can still charge to some repo, the depleted
            repo is removed from the list the user can charge to.
          + If the user has no repo to charge to the user's interactive
            computing is limited and no batch computing is allowed.

          When funds are restored, the user is unrestricted.

   Disabled
          The user can no longer login to a system, but the user's account
          and files remain intact. A disabled user should contact the
          Account Support group to be re-enabled. Disabling happens:

          + after 5 failed login attempts.
          + if a username is used by anyone other than the person to whom
            it is assigned.
          + if needed for security reasons.
          + if a username hasn't been used in the past 120 days. This is
            checked at the beginning of every month. Affected users are
            notified by email.

          Users who exhaust their storage allocations will receive an
          email to that effect. After two such email warnings a user's
          access to HPSS may be turned off.

   Deleted
          The username has been deleted from a system. Note: the below has
          not been implemented as of April, 2001. This happens when a PI
          or account manager requests that the username be removed,
          usually as part of the account renewal process for the next
          fiscal year (although a PI or account manager may request this
          at any time). There are two cases:

         1. The username is removed from one system but remains active on
            other(s):
               o Files in the user's home directory are archived to HPSS.
         2. The username is removed from all systems:
               o Files in the user's home directories are moved to HPSS.
               o The user's HPSS files are then moved to an archival area.
               o Files in the HPSS archival area are kept for 18 months,
                 after which time they may be deleted.
               o To retrieve archived files or to obtain a listing of such
                 files contact the Account Support group.

          The user is notified by email that her/his username is to be
          removed and is given 30 days to clean up (move files to a
          location owned by an active NERSC username or to the user's
          desktop, for example). After that month, all files in the home
          directory are archived to HPSS.

          The PI and account managers are notified and warned that if they
          want any data to remain active they must move the data to an
          active username before the end of the 30 days. After the 30 days
          the data will still be retrievable from HPSS for 18 months.
