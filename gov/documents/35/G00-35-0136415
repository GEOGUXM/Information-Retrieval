   The Folks Who Made It All Happen

        * Mathematician Dr. Vincenzo Casulli of the University of Trento in
          Italy teamed up with Ralph Cheng to develope the TRIM model which
          is an instrumental part of the SF PORTS page.
        * The jubilant Dr. Ralph T. Cheng of the U.S. Geological Survey
          (USGS) worked with Vincenzo Casulli to develop the TRIM model which
          synthesizes the current maps from the PORTS data.
        * While at the USGS, Jonathan Feinstein was the architect of the San
          Francisco Bay Area Wind Page as well as the original Current
          Pattern Analysis (CPA) page. The CPA page supplied real-time PORTS
          data and a plan-view map of the SF Bay currents as generated by the
          TRIM model. These functions have now been digested into the SF
          PORTS page.
        * The un-erring Richard Smith of the USGS performed the daunting task
          of registering the TRIM model output to NOAA navigational charts
          and has managed the development of the SF PORTS web-site. Richard
          also designed and built the 'Current Maps' section of the SF PORTS
          site.
        * Chad English of the USGS developed the software to manage the
          incoming real-time data and developed the SF PORTS site..

   The Tools They Used

        * PGPLOT - A library of plotting subroutines for Fortran-77 developed
          by T.J. Pearson of Caltech. This package is responsible for most of
          the 'on-the-fly' graphics on the SF PORTS page.
        * ArcInfo - used to register the NOAA charts
        * TRIM - the model which generates predictions of the physical
          characterstics of the SF Bay.
