                            An Invitation to PAC2001

   Dear Colleagues,

   On behalf of the 2001 Particle Accelerator Conference (PAC2001)
   Organizing Committee, Program Committee and Local Organizing Committee,
   I would like to invite everyone who has an interest in the recent
   development in accelerator science and technology to attend and to
   participate in the PAC2001. The conference is to be held on June 18-22,
   2001, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, and is open to
   anyone who registers.

   This is the 19th biennial conference of this series and is organized
   under the auspices of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
   Engineers (IEEE) through its Nuclear and Plasma Science Society (NPSS)
   and the American Physical Society (APS) through its Division of Physics
   of Beams (DPB). The conference also serves as the annual meeting of the
   DPB. The hosting institutions of the conference are Argonne National
   Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory. This booklet, together with the conference web
   site noted herein, describes the conference timelines and processes.

   The PAC2001 Program Committee has already structured the conference
   program as described in this booklet. To complete the program, I would
   also like to invite you to submit an abstract of your contributed paper
   describing recent original and unpublished work on accelerator science,
   technology, and applications. The deadline for abstract submission is
   January 15, 2001.

   The organization of the conference will be similar to previous ones in
   this series with plenary sessions on Monday morning and Friday
   afternoon offering a total of eight invited speakers. During the
   five-day period there are 20 oral sessions, including talks by 77
   invited speakers and presentations of selected contributed papers, and
   eight poster sessions to accommodate 1000 posters. An industrial
   exhibition of about 40 booths will be present for three days adjacent
   to the poster area. After the conference is officially over, there will
   be an optional one-day tour of the accelerator facilities of Argonne
   National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory on
   Saturday, June 23, 2001.

   The last few meetings have had approximately 1200 participants each,
   and we anticipate similar numbers for PAC2001 in Chicago. In view of
   the special rate the Hyatt Regency Chicago is offering and the limited
   number of rooms specially allocated for the conference attendees, you
   are encouraged to register and reserve your hotel room as soon as
   possible. The weather in Chicago in June is usually warm with average
   daytime temperatures around 80° F and nighttime temperatures around 60°
   F. Chicago offers many cultural, historical, and ethnic attractions. A
   program of tours is being offered for companions, and tourism
   representatives will be available to help attendees make other
   recreational arrangements.

   The registration fee of U.S.$370.00 ($450.00 after May 18, 2001)
   supports the conference almost entirely. This fee covers your
   participation in the conference sessions, welcome reception, awards
   ceremony, coffee breaks, and conference proceedings. The registration
   fee does not cover the banquet, companion tours, and ANL/FNAL tour.
   When you sign up for any of these, you must include the additional fee
   charged for each activity.

   To register, please complete the registration form. You can either
   complete the online version (available from the PAC2001 web page at
   http://pac2001.aps.anl.gov) or fill in the paper registration form
   included at the back of this booklet. Whichever method you use, a paper
   copy must be mailed or faxed to us with your payment.

   For those non-U.S. citizens planning to attend the ANL/FNAL tour,
   please read the tour instructions carefully. In order to go on this
   tour, you will have to provide us with citizenship information.

   I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.

   Sincerely,

   Yanglai Cho
   PAC2001 Conference Chair

                                Call for Papers

   Original papers (not previously published or presented) from the whole
   field of accelerator physics and technology are solicited, including
   low- and high-energy machines, accelerators for medical and industrial
   purposes, and accelerator subsystems.

   The scientific program of PAC2001 will consist of invited oral,
   contributed oral, and poster presentations. All contributed papers are
   to be submitted presuming poster presentation. From these the Program
   Committee will decide, based on the abstracts, which papers are chosen
   for oral presentation.

   Note: The proceedings will only include papers that are presented at
   the conference, either orally or as posters.

   In order to maintain the high standards of the PAC proceedings, and to
   keep them to a reasonable size, potential authors are reminded that
   only novel, original work should be submitted. Authors submitting
   several related papers should keep to a minimum repetition of
   introductory material.
