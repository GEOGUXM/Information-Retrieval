   Oral Presentations
     __________________________________________________________________

   Time and Other Information:
    1. The Presenter(s) should arrive 10 minutes prior to his/her
       scheduled time and should speak with the staff member(s) just
       inside the MCC lobby.
    2. The maximum time allowed for your presentation is five (5) minutes.
       It is to your advantage to keep it as short as possible to allow
       the Review Panel time for discussion with you. After five minutes,
       a bell will ring signaling the end of your formal presentation.
       There will then be three minutes for discussion with the panel.
    3. The PI should present the material; co-investigators may be present
       and may participate.
    4. The Review Panel Members are all Scientists and Engineers. However,
       they will not all be specialists in your area.
    5. There will be facilities available for showing view graphs, but no
       other audio-visual equipment is allowed.
    6. Handouts and demos are not recommended as they take too much time
       in this setting.
       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or e-mail
       Mary Dant at 6-7301 or Mary.Dant@gsfc.nasa.gov.

   Location:
   The presentations will take place in the Management Conference Center
       (MCC) located on the third floor of building 8. Presenters should
       wait in the MCC lobby which is just through the double glass doors
       to the right if you take the elevator and to the left if you take
       the stairs. For your information a graphic depicting the layout of
       the MCC is shown below.

        The panel members will be sitting around the table as well as
                along the back and side walls. The code 160
                representative, that will be keeping the meeting on time,
                will be sitting at the head of the table.
