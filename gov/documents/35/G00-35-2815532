                         OSHA ENCOURAGES DEFIBRILLATOR USE
                       TO REVIVE WORKERS WITH CARDIAC ARREST

      Because the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) can save
      the lives of workers who experience cardiac arrest while on the job,
      OSHA today encouraged employers to consider making this equipment
      available in their workplaces.

      "AEDs are easy to use and can make the critical difference in reviving
      individuals who suffer a cardiac crisis," said OSHA Administrator John
      L. Henshaw. "Administered within three minutes, the electric shock
      (defibrillation) restores the normal rhythm to the victim's heart and
      can increase survival rates from less than 5 percent to nearly 75
      percent. Immediate defibrillation can revive more than 90 percent of
      victims."

      OSHA has issued a fact card and a technical information bulletin on the
      use of AEDs, encouraging employers to take advantage of this
      technology. AEDs are lightweight and run on rechargeable batteries.
      They are designed to analyze the heart rhythm and automatically
      indicate when to administer the shock. Each unit costs from $3,000 to
      $4,500.

      Each year 300,000 to 400,000 individuals die from cardiac arrest. Most
      of these deaths occur outside hospitals. Cardiac arrest is often due to
      chaotic beating of the heart, which can be restored to normal rhythm if
      treated promptly with defibrillation. With each minute of delay in
      defibrillation, 10 percent fewer victims survive.

      Placing AEDs in workplaces could significantly increase survival rates.
      In 1999 and 2000, 815 of 6,339 workplace fatalities reported to OSHA
      resulted from cardiac arrest. The agency estimates if AEDs helped
      restore 40 percent of those who suffer a cardiac crisis, as many as 120
      lives would be saved each year. Workers involved in shift work, holding
      high stress jobs, or exposed to certain chemicals or electrical hazards
      face a higher risk of heart disease and cardiac arrest.

      AED's have proven their value at the U.S. Department of Labor
      headquarters where they are strategically placed throughout the
      building. Last Friday, a Labor Department employee collapsed.
      Co-workers called the DOL Health Unit, and a nurse came and used a
      nearby AED to treat the victim. The individual was resuscitated, sent
      to the hospital and is now recuperating following heart surgery.

      The new OSHA fact card and technical information bulletin are available
      on OSHA's website at www.osha-slc.gov/OshDoc/Additional.html#AED" {AED
      Card} and www.osha-slc.gov/dts/tib/tib_data/tib20011217.pdf {Technical
      Information Bulletin}, and through the agency's publications office at
      1-800-321-OSHA. (Note: The purpose of these materials is for
      information only and does not impose and is not intended to result in
