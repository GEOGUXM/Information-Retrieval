Introduction

   The brain is the most complex part of the human body. This three-pound
   organ is the seat of intelligence, interpreter of the senses, initiator
   of body movement, and controller of behavior. Lying in its bony shell
   and washed by protective fluid, the brain is the source of all the
   qualities that define our humanity. The brain is the crown jewel of the
   human body.

   For centuries, scientists and philosophers have been fascinated by the
   brain, but until recently they viewed the brain as nearly
   incomprehensible. Now, however, the brain is beginning to relinquish
   its secrets. Scientists have learned more about the brain in the last
   10 years than in all previous centuries because of the accelerating
   pace of research in neurological and behavioral science and the
   development of new research techniques. As a result, Congress named the
   1990s the Decade of the Brain. At the forefront of research on the
   brain and other elements of the nervous system is the National
   Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), which conducts
   and supports scientific studies in the United States and around the
   world.

   This fact sheet is a basic introduction to the human brain. It may help
   you understand how the healthy brain works, how to keep it healthy, and
   what happens when the brain is diseased or dysfunctional.

The Architecture of the Brain

   The brain is like a committee of experts. All the parts of the brain
   work together, but each part has its own special properties. The brain
   can be divided into three basic units: the forebrain, the midbrain, and
   the hindbrain.

   The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain
   stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue called the cerebellum (1). The
   hindbrain controls the bodys vital functions such as respiration and
   heart rate. The cerebellum is responsible for learned rote movements.
   When you play the piano or hit a tennis ball you are activating the
   cerebellum. Above the hindbrain lies the midbrain, which controls some
   reflex actions and is part of the circuit responsible for voluntary
   movements. The forebrain is the largest and most highly developed part
   of the human brain: it consists primarily of the cerebrum (2) and the
   structures hidden beneath it (see "The Inner Brain").

   When people see pictures of the brain it is usually the cerebrum that
   they notice. The cerebrum sits at the topmost part of the brain and is
   the source of intellectual activities. It holds your memories, allows
   you to plan, enables you to imagine and think. It allows you to
   recognize friends, read books, and play games.

   The cerebrum is split into two halves (hemispheres) by a deep fissure.
   Despite the split, the two cerebral hemispheres communicate with each
   other through a thick tract of nerve fibers that lies at the base of
   this fissure. Although the two hemispheres seem to be mirror images of
   each other, they are different. For instance, the ability to form words
   seems to lie primarily in the left hemisphere, while the right
   hemisphere seems to control many abstract reasoning skills.

   For some as-yet-unknown reason, nearly all of the signals from the
   brain to the body and vice-versa cross over on their way to and from
   the brain. This means that the right cerebral hemisphere primarily
   controls the left side of the body and the left hemisphere primarily
   controls the right side. When one side of the brain is damaged, the
   opposite side of the body is affected. For example, a stroke in the
   right hemisphere of the brain can leave the left arm and leg paralyzed.

The Geography of Thought

   Each cerebral hemisphere can be divided into sections, or lobes, each
   of which specializes in different functions. To understand each lobe
   and its specialty we will take a tour of the cerebral hemispheres,
   starting with the two frontal lobes (3), which lie directly behind the
   forehead. When you plan a schedule, imagine the future, or use reasoned
   arguments, these two lobes do much of the work. One of the ways the
   frontal lobes seem to do these things is by acting as short-term
   storage sites, allowing one idea to be kept in mind while other ideas
   are considered. In the rearmost portion of each frontal lobe is a motor
   area (4), which helps control voluntary movement. A nearby place on the
   left frontal lobe called Brocas area (5) allows thoughts to be
   transformed into words.

   When you enjoy a good mealthe taste, aroma, and texture of the foodtwo
   sections behind the frontal lobes called the parietal lobes (6) are at
   work. The forward parts of these lobes, just behind the motor areas,
   are the primary sensory areas (7). These areas receive information
   about temperature, taste, touch, and movement from the rest of the
   body. Reading and arithmetic are also functions in the repertoire of
   each parietal lobe.

   As you look at the words and pictures on this page, two areas at the
   back of the brain are at work. These lobes, called the occipital lobes
   (8), process images from the eyes and link that information with images
   stored in memory. Damage to the occipital lobes can cause blindness.

   The last lobes on our tour of the cerebral hemispheres are the temporal
   lobes (9), which lie in front of the visual areas and nest under the
   parietal and frontal lobes. Whether you appreciate symphonies or rock
   music, your brain responds through the activity of these lobes. At the
   top of each temporal lobe is an area responsible for receiving
   information from the ears. The underside of each temporal lobe plays a
   crucial role in forming and retrieving memories, including those
   associated with music. Other parts of this lobe seem to integrate
   memories and sensations of taste, sound, sight, and touch.

The Cerebral Cortex

   Coating the surface of the cerebrum and the cerebellum is a vital layer
   of tissue the thickness of a stack of two or three dimes. It is called
   the cortex, from the Latin word for bark. Most of the actual
   information processing in the brain takes place in the cerebral cortex.
   When people talk about "gray matter" in the brain they are talking
   about this thin rind. The cortex is gray because nerves in this area
   lack the insulation that makes most other parts of the brain appear to
   be white. The folds in the brain add to its surface area and therefore
   increase the amount of gray matter and the quantity of information that
   can be processed.

The Inner Brain

   Deep within the brain, hidden from view, lie structures that are the
   gatekeepers between the spinal cord and the cerebral hemispheres. These
   structures not only determine our emotional state, they also modify our
   perceptions and responses depending on that state, and allow us to
   initiate movements that you make without thinking about them. Like the
   lobes in the cerebral hemispheres, the structures described below come
   in pairs: each is duplicated in the opposite half of the brain.

   The hypothalamus (10), about the size of a pearl, directs a multitude
   of important functions. It wakes you up in the morning, and gets the
   adrenaline flowing during a test or job interview. The hypothalamus is
   also an important emotional center, controlling the molecules that make
   you feel exhilarated, angry, or unhappy. Near the hypothalamus lies the
   thalamus (11), a major clearinghouse for information going to and from
   the spinal cord and the cerebrum.

   An arching tract of nerve cells leads from the hypothalamus and the
   thalamus to the hippocampus (12). This tiny nub acts as a memory
   indexersending memories out to the appropriate part of the cerebral
   hemisphere for long-term storage and retrieving them when necessary.
   The basal ganglia (not shown) are clusters of nerve cells surrounding
   the thalamus. They are responsible for initiating and integrating
   movements. Parkinsons disease, which results in tremors, rigidity, and
   a stiff, shuffling walk, is a disease of nerve cells that lead into the
   basal ganglia.

Making Connections

   The brain and the rest of the nervous system are composed of many
   different types of cells, but the primary functional unit is a cell
   called the neuron. All sensations, movements, thoughts, memories, and
   feelings are the result of signals that pass through neurons. Neurons
   consist of three parts. The cell body (13) contains the nucleus, where
   most of the molecules that the neuron needs to survive and function are
   manufactured. Dendrites (14) extend out from the cell body like the
   branches of a tree and receive messages from other nerve cells. Signals
   then pass from the dendrites through the cell body and may travel away
   from the cell body down an axon (15) to another neuron, a muscle cell,
   or cells in some other organ. The neuron is usually surrounded by many
   support cells. Some types of cells wrap around the axon to form an
   insulating sheath (16). This sheath can include a fatty molecule called
   myelin, which provides insulation for the axon and helps nerve signals
   travel faster and farther. Axons may be very short, such as those that
   carry signals from one cell in the cortex to another cell less than a
   hairs width away. Or axons may be very long, such as those that carry
   messages from the brain all the way down the spinal cord.

                                   Image 6
                                 [Kyb6.gif]

   Scientists have learned a great deal about neurons by studying the
   synapsethe place where a signal passes from the neuron to another cell.
   When the signal reaches the end of the axon it stimulates tiny sacs
   (17). These sacs release chemicals known as neurotransmitters (18) into
   the synapse (19). The neurotransmitters cross the synapse and attach to
   receptors (20) on the neighboring cell. These receptors can change the
   properties of the receiving cell. If the receiving cell is also a
   neuron, the signal can continue the transmission to the next cell.

Some Key Neurotransmitters at Work

   Acetylcholine is called an excitatory neurotransmitter because it
   generally makes cells more excitable. It governs muscle contractions
   and causes glands to secrete hormones. Alzheimers disease, which
   initially affects memory formation, is associated with a shortage of
   acetylcholine.

   GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter
   because it tends to make cells less excitable. It helps control muscle
   activity and is an important part of the visual system. Drugs that
   increase GABA levels in the brain are used to treat epileptic seizures
   and tremors in patients with Huntingtons disease.

   Serotonin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that constricts blood
   vessels and brings on sleep. It is also involved in temperature
   regulation. Dopamine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in mood
   and the control of complex movements. The loss of dopamine activity in
   some portions of the brain leads to the muscular rigidity of Parkinsons
   disease. Many medications used to treat behavioral disorders work by
   modifying the action of dopamine in the brain.

Neurological Disorders

   When the brain is healthy it functions quickly and automatically. But
   when problems occur, the results can be devastating. Some 50 million
   people in this countryone in fivesuffer from damage to the nervous
   system. The NINDS supports research on more than 600 neurological
   diseases. Some of the major types of disorders include: neurogenetic
   diseases (such as Huntingtons disease and muscular dystrophy),
   developmental disorders (such as cerebral palsy), degenerative diseases
   of adult life (such as Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease),
   metabolic diseases (such as Gauchers disease), cerebrovascular diseases
   (such as stroke and vascular dementia), trauma (such as spinal cord and
   head injury), convulsive disorders (such as epilepsy), infectious
   diseases (such as AIDS dementia), and brain tumors.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

   Since its creation by Congress in 1950, the NINDS has grown to become
   the leading supporter of neurological research in the United States.
   Most research funded by the NINDS is conducted by scientists in public
   and private institutions such as universities, medical schools, and
   hospitals. Government scientists also conduct a wide array of
   neurological research in the more than 20 laboratories and branches of
   the NINDS itself. This research ranges from studies on the structure
   and function of single brain cells to tests of new diagnostic tools and
   treatments for those with neurological disorders. For more information,
