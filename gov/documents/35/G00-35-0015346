          COMLARA Park
   WHITE TAIL DEER MANAGEMENT
         Hunting Program

                                [deerhrd.jpg]

   To meet the primary mission of the McLean County Department of Parks
   and Recreation, management of natural resources within the Parks is
   necessary. Today, due to the lack of natural predators, natural
   resource management of white tail deer herds is necessary to insure and
   improve natural habitat overall. The use of public hunting at COMLARA
   Park - Evergreen Lake is recognized as an appropriate population
   control method. In addition, public hunting provides recreational and
   leisure opportunities for those that wish to participate.

   Deer Populations
   Research has documented populations at COMLARA County Park in excess of
   60 deer per square mile. The ecological carrying capacity of various
   natural environments is 15 to 20 deer per square mile. Without active
   management, the number of deer will continue to increase, possibly
   dramatically. The deer population levels threaten natural re-generation
   and environmental reclamation projects, due to browse levels.

   Hunting Season 20001
   HUNTING AT COMLARA PARK IS THROUGH A LOTTERY SYSTEM ONLY, PLEASE READ
   ON. Archery hunting for antlerless white-tailed deer is tentatively
   scheduled for October 28 - November 10. The first shotgun weekend is
   tentatively scheduled for November 16, 17, and 18. The second shotgun
   weekend of deer hunting is tentatively scheduled for November 29,30
   December 1, and 2.

   Hunters are required to complete an antlerless deer permit application
   for Comlara County Park. Hunters must possess an IDNR SHOTGUN permit
   for either McLean or Woodford County, prior to applying for a COMLARA
   Special Shotgun permit. Applications can be obtained at the Visitors
   Center in Comlara Park during the months of July and August. ALL
   APPLICATIONS MUST BE IN THE PARK OFFICE BY AUGUST 31, APPLICATIONS
   RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE WILL BE DISQUALIFIED. The lottery drawing for
   both archery and shotgun hunting will take place during the first week
   of September.

   DISABLED HUNTERS

   Disabled hunters are encouraged to apply for both the Archery and
   Shotguns hunts. Currently, there are two disabled hunting blinds being
   utilized. As with able-bodied hunters, disabled hunters must possess an
   IDNR shotgun permit for McLean or Woodford County prior to application
   for the COMLARA Park special hunt.

   Specific Regulations
    1. No person shall hunt or enter designated management areas without a
       permit issued by the Department.
    2. Hunters must possess a valid Illinois Hunting License, habitat
       stamp, and IDNR deer permit (McLean or Woodford Co.)

       hunter's responsibility to recognize and respect those boundaries.
   12. Hunters must check out at Visitor Center, whether they are
       successful or not. Deer must also be taken to an Illinois
       Department of Natural Resource Check Station for tagging.
   13. No vehicles, including ATV's are allowed within the hunting areas.
