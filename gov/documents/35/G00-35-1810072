  Does I.M.A.G.E. have an FTP site?

   Yes. Just ftp to image.llnl.gov and change to the image directory to
   get to the I.M.A.G.E. ftp site. Or, if your browser supports it, just
   click on the following link: ftp://image.llnl.gov/image

   This is an anonymous ftp server so use "anonymous" to login and your
   email address as password.

   Some files of interest include:
   "Master" files -- listed by IMAGEne build, these give the "best"
   representative clone for each IMAGEne cluster. A new file is generated
   with each new IMAGEne build.
   "Candidate_gold" files -- also listed by IMAGEne build, these give only
   the full-coding "best" representative clones. A new file is generated
   with each new IMAGEne build.
   "Cumulative_plates" files -- in the outgoing directory and listed by
   date, these files contain the following information for every
   I.M.A.G.E. clone in the collection: cloneID, clone collection, plate,
   row, column, I.M.A.G.E. library ID, species, and any Genbank accession
   numbers for sequences generated from that clone. A new file is
   generated monthly.
   "libr_desc" files -- in the outgoing directory and listed by date,
   these files contain general information about each library, including
   I.M.A.G.E. library ID (note this is NOT the same as the Genbank library
   ID), library name, species, I.M.A.G.E. vector ID, and host strain.
   "vector_id_to_name" files -- in the outgoing directory and listed by
   date, these files contain general vector information, including
   I.M.A.G.E. vector ID, vector name, and antibiotic-resistance.

   If you have additional data requests, please send an email to
   help@image.llnl.gov.
     __________________________________________________________________

  How can I get an I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone sent to me?

   Simply contact one of our authorized distributors and order the
   clone(s) from them, using the I.M.A.G.E. CloneID to specify which
   clone(s) you are interested in. Note that distributors are also
   offering clone-associated products (for example, high-density colony
   filters for hybridization screening and rearrayed clone sets) in
   addition to other services.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Which number in a database entry is the I.M.A.G.E. CloneID?

   This depends a bit on which database you are retrieving sequence data
   from...

   In dbEST entries, the I.M.A.G.E. CloneID is the number given in the
   "CloneID" field.

   In GenBank entries, the I.M.A.G.E. CloneID is the number on the
   "/clone=" field found in the Features listing. The same number appears
   in the Source field, following "human clone=", and on the Definition
   line following the word "clone".
     __________________________________________________________________

  Why are there so many accession numbers and IDs associated with each clone?
  What do they all mean?

   The I.M.A.G.E. cloneID is a unique identifier assigned by I.M.A.G.E. to
   each clone. All sequences derived from a given clone will reference the
   same I.M.A.G.E. cloneID, and there may be more than one Genbank entry
   for a given I.M.A.G.E. cloneID (ie one for the 5' EST, one for the 3'
   EST, one for the full-insert sequence, etc). Each sequence entry gets a
   unique Genbank accession number and a unique GI number (both assigned
   by the NCBI). All full-length MGC sequence entries are also assigned a
   unique MGC ID by the Mammalian Gene Collection project. All mouse
   clones are assigned an MGI ID from the Jackson Laboratory. The
   I.M.A.G.E. distributors may also assign internal tracking IDs to the
   clones. When in doubt, you can ALWAYS use the I.M.A.G.E. cloneID to
   order the clone you want and as this is the simplest and most
   straightforward option, this is what we encourage everyone to do.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Now that I have a clone, where can I find information about the vector, cDNA
  library, antibiotics, etc.?

   The I.M.A.G.E. homepage, under the "resources" link, contains a vector
   webpage which includes - to the extent we know them - vector sequences,
   polylinker sites, appropriate sequencing primers, and the like. There
   are also links to library pages, which are organized by species, or you
   can use the Library Navigator to select libraries by tissue or library
   name. Your clone distributor may also be contacted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Am I restricted in what I can do with an I.M.A.G.E. clone?

   Only by your imagination - almost ... the key is that we are providing
   clones to advance the public interest. A Good Faith Agreement governs
   the usage of I.M.A.G.E. clones. Basically you may use an I.M.A.G.E.
   clone for any purpose so long as you submit sequence, map, and
   expression data derived from the use of this clone to an appropriate
   public database, and you associate this information with the
   pre-existing unique identifier (I.M.A.G.E. CloneID). To prevent the
   selling of data, you may not disclose or transfer sequence or map data
   to any external commercial enterprise before depositing it into the
   public database. You may not sell the clone either, but you may pass it
   on for free on to anyone else as long as the person receiving it agrees
   with these same stipulations. In general, we discourage secondhand
   distribution since clone quality suffers (deleted clones, contaminated
   stocks, etc.) unless quite a bit of care is taken. We also encourage
   you to sequence (at least the ends of) any clone you receive, and to
   immediately inform the distributor of any discrepancies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Are there restrictions on inventions (ie patents) using these clones?

   No. Any invention based on the use of these clones belongs solely to
   the inventing party. You may take any reasonable steps necessary to
   protect your proprietary interests before submitting information to
   public databases.
     __________________________________________________________________

  How can I get aliquots of the library from which a given I.M.A.G.E. clone is
  derived?

   This depends on the source of the original (unarrayed) library. Send an
   e-mail to help@image.llnl.gov indicating which library you are
   interested in. We will forward the name of the appropriate contact
   person. Please be aware that some libraries are not available.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Is there a bibliographic reference for the I.M.A.G.E. effort?

   Yes: Lennon, G.G., Auffray, C., Polymeropoulos, M., Soares, M.B. The
   I.M.A.G.E. Consortium: An Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and
   their Expression. Genomics 33:151-152 [1996].
     __________________________________________________________________

  How can I check for reported problems on a clone?

   A problem database is queriable from an interface off the main
   I.M.A.G.E. web page. Up to 500 clone ids can be entered at a time as
   criteria of the search. This database integrates all problems reported
   to or by the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. As always, any problems you
   encounter with a clone should be reported to the distributor from which
   it was obtained. You may also enter the problem yourself although we
   encourage you to report it to the distributor first.
     __________________________________________________________________

  What if I have further questions?

   Our goal of being able to help integrate genome studies - using
   publicly available data, from royalty-free cDNA clones - is being
   reached thanks to your support and enthusiasm, and we always welcome
   questions, comments, and suggestions to:
