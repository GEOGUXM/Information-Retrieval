   2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast iv Executive Summary This report was compiled
   by the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC) for
   the Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space
   Transportation (AST) of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The
   2001 Commercial Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) Launch Demand Model is the
   ninth annual forecast of the worldwide demand for commercial
   geosynchronous orbit (GSO) launches as seen by the U.S. commercial
   space industry. It is intended to assist the AST in its efforts to
   foster a healthy commercial space launch capability in the United
   States. The commercial mission model is updated annually, and is
   prepared from the inputs of commercial companies across the satellite
   and launch industries. In this report COMSTAC produces a satellite and
   launch demand forecast. The satellite demand is derived by forecasting
   the number of satellites to be placed in GSO that are open to
   internationally competed launch service procurements. To determine the
   number of possible launches in a year, the satellite demand is
   decreased by the number of satellites forecasted to be launched in a
   dual launch configuration. This report is the result of the COMSTAC
   2001 Commercial Mission Model update. It shows the forecast of the
   demand for commercial GSO satellites and the resulting launch demand.
   The assumptions and methodology used for this forecast are explained in
   the body of this report. The near-term forecast, which is based on
   existing satellite programs for 2001 through 2003, shows 24 satellites
   to be launched in 2001, 28 in 2002, and 32 in 2003. The average annual
   COMSTAC demand forecasts of 1998 and 1999 reports were 32.8 and 33
   satellites per year, respectively. This year's mission model predicts
   an average demand of 30.5 satellites to be launched per year over the
   period from 2001 through 2010 which is very similar to the average
   demand of 30.6 satellites per year forecast in the 2000 report. Figure
   1 shows the graphical representation of the COMSTAC Demand Forecast in
   terms of number of satellites and launch demand. The near-term launch
   demand forecast equates to 20 launches for 2001, 23 launches for 2002,
   and 27 launches for 2003. This year's forecast continues the trend of
   last year's in that the near- term demand has lessened. Table 1 shows
   the projected number of dual payloads to be launched. 2001 COMSTAC GSO

   Introduction The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Office of the
   Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (AST) of
   the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) endeavors to foster a
   healthy commercial space launch capability in the United States. The
   DOT feels that it is important to obtain the commercial space
   industry's view of future space launch requirements and has therefore
   requested that its industry advisory group, the Commercial Space
   Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), prepare a commercial
   satellite launch demand mission model and update it annually. This
   report presents the 2001 update of the worldwide commercial
   geosynchronous orbit (GSO) satellite mission model for the period 2001
   through 2010. It is based on market forecasts obtained in early 2001
   from major satellite manufacturers, satellite operators and launch
   service providers. It should be emphasized that this is not a forecast
   of actual launches for any given year. It is a forecast of the demand
   for launches, i.e., the number of launches needed to fulfill the
   projected delivery of satellite orders in a given year. The number of
   actual launches for that year will then depend on other factors such as
   satellite delivery, launch failures, etc. Appendix A gives a full
   explanation of this difference and the factors that potentially affect
   the actual launches for a given year. Background COMSTAC prepared the
   first commercial mission model in April 1993 as part of a report on
   commercial space launch systems requirements. Each year since 1993,
   COMSTAC has issued an updated model. The process has been continuously
   refined and industry participation has broadened each year to provide
   the most realistic portrayal of space launch demand possible. Over the
   years, the COMSTAC mission model has been well received by industry,
   government agencies and international organizations. The first report
   in 1993 was developed by the major launch service providers in the US
   and covered the period 1992-2010. In the next few years, the major U.S.
   satellite manufacturers and the satellite operators began to contribute
   to the market demand database. In 1995, the Technology and Innovation
   Working Group (the Working Group) was formally chartered to prepare the
   annual Commercial Payload Mission Model Update. Since then, the
   participation in the preparation of this report has grown. This year
   the committee received 27 inputs from U.S. and non-U.S. satellite
   manufacturers, operators and launch vehicle providers. COMSTAC would
   like to thank all the participants in the 2001 mission model update.
   2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 3 Methodology With minor adjustments, the
   Working Group's launch demand forecast methodology has remained
   consistent. As in previous years, they solicited input from industry
   via a letter from the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space
   Transportation. This letter is shown in Appendix C. The letter
   requested that each company provide a forecast of the number of
   addressable commercial GSO payloads per year for the period 2001 -
   2010. Launch vehicle payloads in this context are satellites that are
   open for internationally competitive launch service procurement. These
   satellites are considered the "addressable" market. Not included in
   this forecast are those satellites that are captive to national flag
   launch service providers (i.e., USAF or NASA satellites, or similar
   European, Russian, Japanese, or Chinese government satellites that are
   captive to their own launch providers). Note that the number of
   projected vehicle launches per year is a subset of this satellite
   launch demand forecast due to the potential for multiple manifesting of
   satellites on launch vehicles. The remainder of the commercial market
   (non-GSO) is addressed in a separate forecast developed by the FAA/AST
   Commercial Space Transportation for Non-Geosynchronous Orbits (NGSO)
   market. These projections are included as a separate report in this
   document. Respondents were asked to segregate their forecast into
   satellite mass classes based on separated mass inserted into a nominal
   geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), assuming launch to 28°
   inclination. The satellite mass classes are representative of a
   clustering of similar capability launch vehicles as shown in Table 2.

   Comprehensive mission model forecasts were received from those

   of the total addressable market of customers seeking commercial launch
   services for GSO spacecraft from the years 2001 to 2010. Other
   responses provided partial market or company specific satellite launch
   demand information. The near-term COMSTAC mission model (2001-2003) is
   a compilation of the currently manifested launches and an assessment of
   satellites to be assigned to launch vehicles. This forecast reflects a
   consensus developed by the Working Group based on the current manifests
   of the launch vehicle providers and the satellite operators. Since
   these missions are identified by name, the near-term demand does not
   account for delays resulting from unanticipated launch failures, nor
   delays in the launch vehicle or satellite supply chain. Minor delays at
   the end of a year due to launch vehicle problems or satellite
   manufacturing issues can push launches into the following year. These
   factors will cause differences between the demand for launches and the
   actual launches for that year. This pattern of firm schedule
   commitments, followed by modest delays, has been consistent over the
   history of the industry. An attrition rate factor of 10% of annual
   launch demand was also assumed. This factor includes on-orbit satellite
   and launch vehicle failures. The Working Group used the comprehensive
   inputs from the U.S. respondents to derive the average launch rate for
   years 2004 through 2010. The comprehensive inputs for each mass
   category in a given year are averaged. The total forecast for that year
   is then calculated by adding the averages for each of the four mass
   categories. The highest and lowest inputs (shown in Figure 2 and Table
   3) represent the single highest or lowest estimated number of
   satellites to be launched in that year from these comprehensive inputs.
   2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 5 Some of the factors that were considered by
   respondents in creating this forecast include: * Firm contracted
   missions * Current satellite operator planned and replenishment
   missions * Projected operator growth * An estimate of "unidentified
   growth." * Attrition * Competition from Non-GSO systems * Regulatory
   restrictions "Unidentified growth" is used to include information that
   may be proprietary or competition sensitive such as company-specific
   plans on future systems and trends, and assumptions on possible new
   markets. Other factors may have influenced each individual company's
   specific inputs. There is a certain amount of difficulty and
   uncertainty involved in forecasting the commercial launch market. The
   satellite production cycle of an existing design is on the order of two
   years. Orders within a two-year window are generally known. Satellites
   in the third year and beyond become more difficult to identify by name
   as many of these satellites may be in various stages of the procurement
   cycle. Beyond a five-year horizon, new markets or new uses of satellite
   technology may emerge. As seen in the past, entirely new systems can
   spring up in less than three years, from both new and existing
   companies. The long-term growth shown in this forecast, therefore, is
   based on both the replenishment of existing satellites and assessments
   of potential new markets and satellite concepts. 2001 COMSTAC GSO
   Forecast 6 2001 Mission Model The 2001 COMSTAC mission model consists
   of three elements. The first element is a forecast of demand for
   competed launches of commercial satellites to geosynchronous orbit
   (GSO) from 2001 to 2010. The second element is an estimate of the mass
   distribution of these satellites. The third element is a launch vehicle
   demand projection derived from the satellite launch demand forecast.
   Satellite Launch Demand Model Figure 2 shows the COMSTAC Technology and
   Innovation Working Group's demand forecast for commercial satellite
   launches to GSO. The figure plots the historical COMSTAC forecasted
   launch demand from 1993 through 2000 and the COMSTAC 2001 forecast for
   the years 2001 through 2010. The historical demand is a series of
   one-year projections from every COMSTAC mission model report. For
   example, the historical demand value shown for 1997 is the forecasted
   demand for 1997 taken from the 1997 COMSTAC mission model. Also plotted
   in Figure 2 is the actual number of satellites launched for each year
   from 1993 to 2000 for reference. The factors causing the difference
   between these lines are addressed in Appendix A. The range of
   individual estimates from the various comprehensive inputs is plotted
   as high-low marks above and below the average. A list of the average,
   high, and low inputs is shown in Table 3A. This information is
   presented to give a sense of the variations in the forecasts for any
   given year. COMSTAC does not present "high" or "low" cases for the
   demand forecast. The high and low inputs are simply the highest and
   lowest of all individual estimates provided for any one year. Figure 2.

   forecast shows 24 satellites to be launched in 2001, 28 in 2002, and 32
   in 2003. This year's mission model predicts an average demand of 30.5
   satellites to be launched per year over the period from 2001 through
   2010. The COMSTAC average annual demand forecasts of 1998 and 1999
   reports were 32.8 and 33 satellites per year, respectively. This year's
   average forecast of 30.5 satellites per year is approximately the same
   as the 2000 report average forecast of 30.6 satellites per year. Note
   that the average annual demand for the 1999, 2000, and 2001 reports
   cover different spans of time. The 1999 report average annual demand is
   the average demand from 1999 to 2010, the 2000 report from 2000 to
   2010, and the 2001 report from 2001 to 2010. International

   the user with the best knowledge possible of the number of satellites
   that could be launched. This is further explained in Appendix A of this
   report. Table 4 shows the consensus near term mission model for 2001
   through 2003 which is a compilation of the currently manifested
   launches and an assessment of satellites to be assigned to launch
   vehicles. This forecast reflects a consensus developed by the Working
   Group based on the current manifests of the launch vehicle providers
   and the satellite operators. 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 8 Table 4.

   9 Satellite Launch Mass Classes Figure 3 shows the forecasted
   distribution of the satellite demand by mass. The satellites are
   forecasted in four mass classes; below 1,815 kilograms (<4,000 pounds);
   1,815 to 4,082 kilograms (4,000 to 9,000 pounds); 4,082 to 5,445
   kilograms (9,000 to 12,000 pounds); and above 5,445 kilograms (>12,000
   pounds). As described earlier, these mass classes are representative of
   the capabilities of various launch vehicles. More specifically, the
   definition refers to launch vehicle performance (vs. launch mass) to a
   nominal geosynchronous transfer orbit of 185 km (100 nm) x 35,786 km
   (19,323 nm) at an inclination of 28°. In the near-term forecast, the
   Working Group tried to place each satellite in the appropriate class
   based on what was known of its mass. The remainder of the forecast
   derives from the estimates by each of the respondents of the potential
   breakdown between the classes for that year, where each mass class is
   an average of the domestic comprehensive inputs for each mass class for
   each year beyond the near-term forecast. The prediction of future
   satellite sizes was calibrated by inputs received from satellite
   operators. Figure 3. Forecast Trends in Annual GSO Satellite Mass

   Forecast 10 Commercial GSO Satellite Trends In the early years of
   publication of this mission model report, commercial satellites were
   not projected to grow much beyond the 1,815  4,082kg (4,000 to 9,000
   lbm) mass class. Over the past five years, however, the mass range of
   commercial satellites has exhibited a profound shift from this original
   projection. As shown in Table 5 in the previous section, the projected
   number of satellites in the Above 5,445kg (>12,000 lbm) mass class
   continues to grow, while the number in the 1,815  4,082kg (4,000 to
   9,000 lbm) mass class begins to decline. Very heavy commercial
   satellites, over 5,445kg (>12,000 lbm), have been developed and ordered
   over the last few years to address some specific market segments.
   Satellites designed to provide broadband data communication services
   (such as Spaceway and Astrolink) and mobile communication services
   (such as Thuraya and Garuda) require high levels of power and
   sophisticated on-board processing circuitry. These requirements have
   driven designs of these satellites to approach and exceed 5,445kg
   (12,000 lbm). Other heavy-class commercial satellites have been
   developed to serve traditional broadcast applications with broader
   scope and greater efficiency. The previous generations of satellites
   for operators such as Loral Skynet, Telesat Canada, and PanAmSat were
   generally designed into the 1,815  4,082kg (4,000 to 9,000 lbm) mass
   class. Many of the next generation of satellites for operators such as
   these (launching recently and in the future) have exceeded 4,082kg
   (9,000 lbm), such as PanAmSat's PAS 1R, and even 5,445kg (12,000 lbm)
   such as Telesat's Anik F2. This growth has occurred for a few key
   reasons. Many global and regional satellite operators are attempting to
   maximize their capacity and geographic coverage at prime orbital
   locations. Many operators that were originally authorized to provide
   service to specific areas have been granted permission to expand their
   coverage areas to entire regions. For these missions, they have ordered
   heavy-class satellites with large hybrid C/Ku-band transponder payloads
   and multiple coverage beams. Also introducing upward pressure on the
   mass of traditional satellites is the demand for greater on-orbit
   lifetime, which generally requires greater amounts of station-keeping
   fuel, which in turn drives up the satellite mass. These types of large
   satellites typically offer a lower cost per transponder, making them
   more attractive to the operators' bottom line. Allowing such designs to
   be launched is the next generation of commercial launch vehicles. The
   Atlas V and Delta IV vehicle families feature GTO lift capability
   exceeding 8,165kg (>18,000 lbm). The improvements in launch vehicle
   capability have aided the introduction of these large satellites into
   the market. This general trend toward larger satellites is complemented
   by what appears to be a stable niche for smaller satellites in the
   Below 1,815kg (<4,000 lbm) class, with some designs reaching the lower
   region of the 1,815 - 4,082kg (4,000 to 9,000 lbm) mass class. Some of
   the same operators that have recently ordered very heavy satellites
   have also ordered smaller satellites as well. These smaller satellites
   are used to fill in specific frequency allocations where about 20 to 24
   transponders are needed. In addition, emerging operators may use
   smaller satellites to build up capacity gradually while generating
   revenue. Smaller satellites are attractive to existing and emerging
   operators because they often require a smaller up-front investment, and
   can be built and launched more quickly than larger satellites. 2001
   COMSTAC GSO Forecast 11 Comparison with Previous COMSTAC Demand
   Forecasts The forecasts of the prior three years are compared to this
   year's forecast in Figure 4. They are all characterized by a near-term
   rise , intermediate-term decline and long-term moderate growth (less so
   in the 2000 forecast). The near-term rise and fall is, perhaps,
   inherent in the near-term forecast methodology, which centers on
   identifiable programs. The consequence of this approach, when
   considering that progressively higher attrition in the second and third
   years (i.e., 2002 and 2003) is yet to be realized, creates the
   near-term rise, or "bow wave". The average satellite demand over the
   forecast period 2001 to 2010 is similar to last year's average,
   although demand is lower in the first two years and higher in the last
   four years. This year's model has an average demand of 30.5 GSO
   satellites per year for the period 2001 to 2010 with a modest increase
   in the last three years. The average demand in the 1998 and 1999
   mission models was approximately 33 satellites per year between 1999
   and 2010 with an upswing in demand in the last six years. Last year's
   model showed a flatter demand with a slight decline in the last six
   years. This flatter predicted demand accounted for the drop from 33
   average GSO satellites per year in the 1998 and 1999 demand models to
   30.6 in the 2000 demand model. Although the average demand predicted in
   the 2000 and 2001 forecasts are almost equal, the 2001 forecast
   projects fewer satellites in the near term and slightly more satellites
   than the 2000 forecast in the later years. This year's forecast
   continues the trend of last year's in that the near- term demand has
   lessened. Further, for the launch year 2001, we note a total drop in
   demand of fifteen (15) satellites relative to the 1999 forecast...down
   eight (8) from 1999 to the 2000 forecast, and down seven (7) from 2000
   to this year's forecast. Contributors were the sharp decline in the
   S.E. Asia market and cumulative postponements of other programs. There
   are several factors that may be affecting the projected demand for
   satellites. Consolidation has occurred in the satellite services
   industry, with mergers, buyouts, and alliances reducing the customer
   base and resulting in more effective use of current in-orbit assets.
   Current satellites are also experiencing longer than expected on-orbit
   life, which causes orders for replacement satellites to shift further
   into the future. The longer design lifetimes may also be playing a role
   in the flattening of the demand curve. Increased on-orbit life of the
   current generation of GSO satellites would reduce the magnitude and
   increase the period of the replacement cycle for existing spacecraft.
   The trend toward larger satellites also affects the total number of
   satellites on order. Larger satellites are typically more cost
   effective allowing more transponders to be placed in space for each
   dollar spent. In conjunction with the demand for larger satellites, the
   cost to launch these heavier satellites is being reduced with the
   introduction of new heavy-lift launch vehicles. Finally, there seems to
   be a more cautious view of proposed space-based programs due to recent
   financial problems of some space-based businesses. New business
   concepts using satellites are getting more financial scrutiny, which
   has caused a slowdown in the launch of new ventures. 2001 COMSTAC GSO

   Launch Vehicle Demand Since inception, the COMSTAC mission model has
   provided commercial launch demand forecasts in terms of the number of
   GSO satellites to be launched. However, the actual number of commercial
   GSO launches recorded from 1988 through 2000 is lower than the number
   of satellites launched due to dual manifesting on certain launch
   vehicles. In the fall of 1997, the Working Group decided to estimate
   the demand for launch vehicles based on the satellite launch forecast
   because of the dual manifesting of a portion of the satellites. Figure
   5 presents the satellite demand forecast described earlier as well as
   actual values for 1993 through 2000. Historically, only Arianespace has
   been capable of dual manifesting commercial GSO satellites, and its
   highest publicly announced launch capability is approximately eight
   flights per year. Historically some portion of Arianespace's commercial
   GSO manifest has been launched on a dedicated or single manifest basis.
   Arianespace will also launch payloads other than commercial GSO
   satellites that must fit within this launch capacity. Other launchers
   capable of dual manifesting will become commercially available in a few
   years. As these new systems mature, it is believed customers will
   become more comfortable with their capabilities and will begin to use
   their dual manifest services. The Working Group feels that this will
   cause the annual number of dual manifested satellites to increase
   gradually. The predicted number of dual launches takes this into
   consideration, as well as the mass of available satellites in a given
   year. Table 6 shows the estimated number of dual launches forecasted.

   24 26 25 241 24.1 Forecast 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 15 Factors That
   May Affect Future Launch Demand Last year, the Working Group noted that
   "several anticipated events and compelling factors have the potential
   to impact satellite and launch demand." These events and factors are
   expected to continue through at least 2002. Inaugural flights of
   several new families of launch vehicles will occur this year and next.
   Complementary and in some cases supplementary to these new launch
   vehicles will be the introduction of newly designed components and
   subsystems on these vehicles. Potential new applications, specifically
   broadband coupled with a focus on utilization of Ka-band spectrum, are
   supporting satellite and launch demand in the years just ahead, but
   this possible growth is threatened by a much more cautious business
   environment. The restrictive U.S. Government regulatory environment is
   a catalyst for a redistribution of the sources of supply of satellites
   and launches. This year, the demonstration flights for the Japanese
   H-IIA launch vehicle are scheduled to occur. Next year, the inaugural
   flights of Boeing family of Delta IV launchers are scheduled, as is the
   case for the Lockheed Martin family of Atlas V rockets. If all of these
   new initiatives are successful, two impacts can be anticipated. The
   first is that the competition among Launch Services providers for the
   heavier classes of satellites can be expected to be fierce. The second
   is that the availability of capable and competitively priced launch
   services will facilitate a previously observed, if modest, trend toward
   heavier satellites. However, since satellites are likely to be
   manifested on the new domestic launch vehicles, any early failure of
   one or more of these systems will cause delays in, or migration of,
   scheduled launches. To the extent that alternatives are limited, the
   expected launch demand in a particular year is likely to be deferred
   into the next year. It is difficult to predict the actual "ripple"
   effect of any one failure on launch demand that is actually served. The
   trend toward heavier satellites is accompanied by the trend toward
   satellites capable of longer lifetimes, as customer preferences for as
   much as 15 years usable lifetime on orbit is becoming routine. This
   obviously slows the pace of replenishment, thereby delaying demand.
   This has been somewhat offset by demand for broadband applications,
   where a satellite's capability to satisfy the "last mile" dilemma,
   among other attributes, has in the last couple of years had a positive
   effect on the demand for satellites and attendant launches. However,
   demand for these Ka-band/broadband satellite applications may become
   impaired by "time to market" concerns versus terrestrial alternatives.
   Additionally, some of these initiatives as well as future initiatives
   are potentially threatened by the poor results of various satellite
   telephony projects specifically, and tighter economic circumstances
   generally. While probably not affecting absolute satellite and launch
   demand, many observers cite the U.S. Government regulatory environment
   as the probable cause of a redistribution of market share from domestic
   to non-U.S. suppliers. U.S. satellite manufacturers and launch vehicle
   providers continue to be hampered in meeting the expectations of their
   international customers due to this environment. The impact is not
   limited to delays in the initiation and execution of programs, but now
   the actual capture of business. Last year, the Working Group reported
   that one satellite contract was cancelled and another satellite was
   (and remained) in storage pending receipt of a license in order to
   deliver. Now, there is reason to believe that new orders were lost due
   to the continuation of this environment. 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 16
   Summary This year's COMSTAC Commercial Mission Model forecast predicts
   a slight absolute decrease in average annual demand for satellites.
   This change, from 30.6 satellites forecast to be launched per year, on
   average, to 30.5 is such a minor change as to be insignificant.
   Nevertheless, the forecast may be providing some further clues of
   potential future trends in the industry that could affect the type of
   launch demand forthcoming. Notably, this year's forecast continues the
   trend of last year's in that the near-term demand has lessened. Before
   considering these observations concerning the longer term, the
   near-term forecast for this year shows 24 satellites to be launched,
   followed by 28 in 2002 and 32 in 2003. After taking into account
   probable dual launches, launch vehicle demand was estimated to be 20
   launches in 2001, 23 launches in 2002, and 27 launches in 2003. Last
   year, various factors were identified that served to constrain the
   demand for satellites in the future. Among these factors was
   consolidation in the industry, which now has been seen (e.g. the SES
   GE Americom combination). This particular trend is likely to continue.
   Extended satellite lifetimes was noted, and this trend continues
   unabated, as satellite lifetime requirements are typically in the range
   of 12 to 15 years, and moving increasingly toward the lengthier end of
   that range. Another trend cited in the 2000 forecast was "conservatism
   in the space industry". The current status of several satellite
   telephony projects has introduced this conservatism, which is expected
   to continue to be an issue until new projects prove financially viable.
   While broadband applications have been, and remain, a source of demand
   for satellites and launches, any growth in this area will likely await
   the results of current initiatives. Thus the Working Group continues to
   foresee market events that have the potential of impacting the launch
   industry. In addition to the above, other key factors are: 1. Two
   inaugural or demonstration flights of the Japanese H-IIA rocket are
   scheduled to occur this year, while inaugural Atlas V and Delta IV
   flights are expected to launch next year. This portends a significant
   increase in the industry's capacity to launch heavy and extra heavy
   payloads at competitive prices. This could and does seem to influence a
   modest trend toward heavier satellites, but any failures could cause
   delays of planned launches. 2. Interestingly, from the 2001 Commercial
   Mission Model, there is also a discernable, if modest, trend toward
   lighter satellites. Possible reasons for this were addressed on page 11
   of this report. 3. The restrictive U.S. Government regulatory
   environment continues to have an impact. While this factor does not
   necessarily diminish the level of demand for satellites and launches,
   there is evidence that this more restrictive environment is impacting
   the distribution of that demand. This does not bode well for the advent
   of new commercial U.S. launch vehicles. Given the prospective nature of
   many of these factors, it is expected that there will be greater
   visibility available to the Working Group in the foreseeable future. We
   will look forward to assessing these factors again next year. 2001
   COMSTAC GSO Forecast 17 Appendix A. Use of the COMSTAC GSO Launch
   Demand Model Demand Model Defined The COMSTAC Demand Model is a count
   of actual programs or of projected programs that are expected to be
   launched in a given year. This would be the peak load on the launch
   service providers if all projected satellite launches were executed. It
   is not a prediction of what will actually be launched in a given year.
   The satellite programs and launches in the demand forecast are affected
   by many factors, which may cause them to slip or be canceled. The
   actual launches conducted in a given year depend on what factors come
   into play during that year. For example, the participants in the 2001
   Mission Model Update named actual satellite programs that were
   currently manifested on each of the launch providers for 2001. Though
   24 satellite programs were named for the year 2001, the industry may
   not execute all corresponding launches in that year. However, the
   demand on the launch industry for 2001 is for the launch of 24
   satellites (20 launches after discounting for dual manifesting).
   COMSTAC Demand Projection vs Actual Launches Factors That Affect Launch
   Execution Several factors can affect the execution of a scheduled
   launch. These can include launch failure, launch vehicle components
   problems, or manifesting issues. Satellite suppliers also have factory
   and/or supplier issues that can delay the delivery of a spacecraft to
   the launch site or halt a launch of a vehicle that is already on the
   pad. Other factors influencing the mission model are regulatory issues,
   which affect the launch and satellite businesses. Export compliance
   problems, FCC licensing issues, and ITU registration can slow down or
   stop progress on a program. The US Government policy regarding
   satellite and launch vehicle export control is hampering US satellite
   suppliers and launch vehicle providers in their efforts to work with
   their international customers. This has caused both delays and
   cancellation of programs. The higher costs and hardships caused by
   these regulations could also cause satellite customers to look to
   terrestrial systems to provide services previously performed by
   satellite systems. The customer may also raise issues including
   financing or reprioritizing their business focus thereby delaying or
   canceling satellite programs and their launches. Satellites can have
   more than one issue involved. It is not uncommon to see, for example, a
   satellite delayed due to both factory and launch manifesting issues.
   2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 18 2000 Space Industry Performance on Launch
   Demand In the 2000 COMSTAC Commercial GSO Demand Model, the working
   group listed 30 satellites that were then manifested in that year. Yet
   of the 30 satellites manifested in 2000, only 23 of these satellites
   were actually launched while one satellite manifested in 2001 actually
   launched in 2000. And while there was a demand for 30 satellites to be
   launched as forecasted by the COMSTAC Working Group, the execution on
   the manifest was impacted primarily by satellite production delays. A
   list of the factors that affected the 7 satellites that did not make
   their launch dates follows. Of the 2000 manifested satellites: * 24
   satellites were launched - 23 satellites were launched that were
   forecast to be launched in 2000 - 1 satellite was launched that was
   forecast to launch in 2001 * 6 satellites were delayed due to satellite
   and/or manifest issues * 1 satellite continued to be delayed due to
   regulatory issues (export control compliance) Projecting Actual
   Launches There exists historical data which gives percentage of
   launches executed vs manifested. These numbers vary greatly from year
   to year and it was felt that suggesting a discount percentage would not
   be in the best interest of the users of this report. To project an
   actual executed launch manifest for a year, the factors mentioned in
   the paragraphs above must be taken into account. The working group
   feels that it is best to let the user look at the potential factors
   affecting actual launches and determine the weight of each factor for a
   particular year. 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 19 Appendix B. Historical
   Launches COMSTAC Report Summaries COMSTAC prepared the first commercial
   mission model in April 1993 as part of a report on commercial space
   launch systems requirements (Reference B1). Each year since 1993,
   COMSTAC has issued an updated model. The process has been continuously
   refined and industry participation has broadened each year to capture
   the most realistic portrayal of space launch demand possible. Over the
   years, the COMSTAC mission model has been well received by industry,
   government agencies and international organizations. 1993: The first
   report was developed by the major launch service providers in the US
   and covered the period 1992-2010. The report projected only modest
   growth in telecommunications markets based mainly on replenishment of
   existing satellites, with only limited new satellite applications.
   Annual forecast demand averaged about 10.5 payloads per year. 1994:
   Beginning in 1994, major US satellite manufacturers (Hughes Space and
   Communications, Martin Marietta AstroSpace, Space Systems/Loral and
   TRW) also began to contribute to the market demand database. The 1994
   mission model (Reference B2) projected an average demand of 17 payloads
   per year over the forecast period of 1994-2010, with some members of
   the satellite manufacturing community believing the mission model to be
   too conservative. 1995: In 1995, the Technology and Innovation Working
   Group was formally chartered to prepare an annual Commercial Satellite
   Mission Model Update Report (Reference B3). The organizations from
   which the market demand forecasts were requested was further expanded
   to include satellite operators, in addition to satellite manufacturers
   and launch service providers. The 1995 data contained sizable
   variations in projected launch demand with a significant degree of
   polarization around two differing viewpoints. Therefore, a two-case
   scenario was adopted for the 1995 mission model. A "Modest Growth"
   scenario projected an average launch demand of approximately 20
   payloads per year over the period 1995-2010. A "Higher Growth" scenario
   forecast the demand to be an average of 32 payloads per year. The
   primary difference between the two was the assumption of a segment
   called "unidentified growth" in the "Higher Growth" scenario based on
   proprietary information from the survey respondents. In the 1995 model
   there was general agreement among the participants regarding the
   distribution of payloads among the different weight classes. In both
   the "Modest Growth" and "Higher Growth" cases, approximately 70% of the
   payloads were forecast to be in the Intermediate class, 1,815-3,629kg
   (4,000-8,000 lbm), with 15% each in the Medium, 907-1,815kg
   (2,000-4,000 lbm), and the Heavy, over 3,629kg (>8,000 lbm) classes.
   1996: The 1996 annual update expanded the request for input data to a
   greater number of companies and satellite operators. The resulting
   forecast (Reference B4) represented a consensus on the size of the
   market, which was close to the 1995 "Higher Growth" case, with average
   annual demand of 31 payloads per year. However, in the case of mass
   distribution, the group agreed to portray two cases: "Stable Mass
   Growth" and "Continued Mass Growth." The "Stable Mass Growth" scenario
   predicted that Intermediate payloads would represent 70% of the market
   over the forecast period, while the "Continued Mass Growth" case
   reflected the emergence of a segment of Heavy payloads, representing
   42% of the total market. 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 20 1997: The annual
   mission model update in 1997 (Reference B5) included a section
   discussing the forecast data from non-U.S. organizations, which are not
   included in our formal COMSTAC mission model. It also included a first
   attempt to derive vehicle launch demand from the payload launch demand
   projections by consideration of dual manifesting of satellite on launch
   vehicles. The market forecast from U.S. inputs predicted an average
   annual satellite demand of 33 payloads per year from 1997  2010. Of
   these, it was projected that an average of 6 co- manifested launches
   per year would occur through 2002, and 10 per year from 2003  2010.
   Consensus was reached on the mass growth, with projected demand for
   Heavy (> 4,082kg to GTO) reaching over 50% of the annual demand by
   2010. 1998: The 1998 annual mission model (Reference B6) predicts an
   average demand of 33 satellites per year over the period from 1998 to
   2010. The near-term forecast from 1998-2000 shows that the demand of 33
   launches in 1998 drops to 29 in 1999 then increases again to 33 in
   2000. Demand remains relatively constant until a cyclic dip occurs
   around the year 2004. The forecast for 1999 showed a sizable drop from
   the prior years forecast; from 40 payloads to 29 payloads, a reduction
   of 11 satellites. This was attributed as a short-term response to the
   Asian economic crisis since the majority of the payloads that dropped
   from the forecast were Asian owned satellites. 1999: The 1999 annual
   mission model (Reference B7) predicts an average demand of 32.8
   satellites per year over the period from 1999 through 2010, very close
   to the 1998 COMSTAC forecast of 33 satellites per year. The near-term
   forecast, which is based on actual satellite for 1999 through 2001,
   shows 33 satellites in 1999, dropping to 31 in 2000, and increasing
   again to 39 in 2001. 2000: The 2000 annual mission model (Reference B8)
   predicts an average demand of 30.6 satellites per year over the period
   from 2000 through 2010, which was approximately 10% lower than the 1998
   and 1999 COMSTAC forecasts of 33 satellites per year. The near-term
   forecast, which is based on actual satellite for 2000 through 2002,
   shows 30 satellites in 2000, dropping to 31 in 2001, and increasing
   again to 35 in 2002. Figure B-1 shows the demand models for the past
   COMSTAC reports. At first glance, there seems to be quite dispersion in
   the models. It is interesting to note that after closer examination,
   there seems to be a consensus forming as the models mature. From 1996
   to this year's demand model, the curves are converging on a launch
   demand of 30 to 35 satellites per year. 2001 COMSTAC GSO Forecast 21
