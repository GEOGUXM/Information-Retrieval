   Clearinghouse State of Hawaii Profile of Drug Indicators October 2001
   ONDCP Drug Policy Information Clearinghouse staff compiled this profile
   by using the most recent data available from open sources. The data
   presented are as accurate as the sources from which they were drawn.
   The information contained in this profile should not be used to rank or
   compare States or jurisdictions, due to differences in data collection
   and reporting methods. Hawaii The following profile contains
   information on demographics, political figures, programs, crime, drug
   use, drug trafficking, and enforcement statistics. Demographics1 ÿ
   Population: 1,211,537 (2000 Census); 1,108,000 (1990 census) ÿ

   $100,000 to the Coalition for a Drug-Free Hawaii/Ewa Beach Coalition,
   Honolulu. ÿ Executive Office for Weed and Seed4 There are two Weed and
   Seed sites located in Honolulu. The first site, established in 1998,
   encompasses the Kalihi-Palama/Chinatown area. The second Weed and Seed
   site is in Waipahu. This site became officially recognized as a Weed
   and Seed site in February 2000. ÿ High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area
   (HIDTA)5 Designated in 1999, the Hawaii HIDTA is responsible for the
   following counties: Hawaii, Honolulu, Kauai, and Maui. This HIDTA's
   location, the area's popularity as a resort destination, and its high
   volume of international and domestic air and sea travel/shipping,
   provide crime organizations with ample opportunity to traffic drugs
   into and through the area. Drugs ÿ Medical Marijuana6 In 2000, Hawaii's
   Governor Cayetano signed into law a bill to approve the possession and
   use of marijuana for medical purposes. This bill, SB862 HD1, states
   that medical use of marijuana by a patient shall only be permitted if:
   * the qualifying patient has been diagnosed by a physician as having a
   debilitating medical condition, * the qualifying patient's physician
   has certified in writing that the potential benefits of medical
   marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient, and
   ONDCP Clearinghouse 2 * the amount of marijuana does not exceed an
   adequate supply. An adequate supply of marijuana is the amount of
   marijuana jointly possessed between the qualifying patient and the
   primary caregiver that is not more than is reasonably necessary to
   assure the uninterrupted availability of marijuana. This adequate
   supply is not to exceed three mature plants, four immature plants, and
   no more than one ounce of usable marijuana. ÿ The 1999 National
   Household Survey on Drug Abuse stated that 7.1% of Hawaii's population
   age 12 and older used an illicit drug during the past month. The survey
   also stated that 6.0% had used marijuana in the month before the
   survey.7 ÿ The major drugs used throughout Hawaii are marijuana,
   crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin.8 ÿ Black tar heroin is
   the most readily available type of heroin found in Hawaii. This heroin
   typically comes from California or Mexico.9 ÿ Hawaii is a major source
   State for marijuana. Hawaiian marijuana, known as "Kona Gold" or "Maui
   Wowee," is noted for its high quality and potency.10 Juveniles ÿ During

   services, as well as vocational/educational assistance. Corrections ÿ
