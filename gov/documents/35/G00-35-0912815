            Welcome to the ROOT Educational Resources at Fermilab

   This site supports Fermilab's three day class on ROOT. It is inteneded
   for the novice to intermediate user, and hopefully it will get you
   started on ROOT quickly. The tutorial corresponds to version 3.01 of
   ROOT.

   A video CD of the three-day class is available in the Fermilab Stock
   Room
   The part number is:1307-058200 and the cost is $7.12 a copy (2 CDs in
   one case)
   Hard copies of the ROOT User's Guide are available in the Fermilab
   Stock Room.
   The part number is: 1307-058000 and the cost is $4.50 a copy.

   Check out the Root 2001 workshop.
   VOTE: You can vote on what subjects should be covered and view the
   results of the vote so far.

                               The ROOT class:

             [btn_tutorial.gif] Day 1: slides, Power Point file

     * GUI basics
     * Command line basics
     * Finding Information

                       Day 2: slides, Power Point file
     * Command Line (CINT)

     * three ways you can use ROOT: the command line, the script
       processor, and the graphical user interface (GUI).
     * how to generate a PostScript file.
     * histograms, and the input/output capabilities.
     * example of an analysis using real physics data.
     * example of a simulations and an event display.
