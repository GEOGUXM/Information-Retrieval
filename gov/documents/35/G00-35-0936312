Additional UPS System Installed

  by Bob Lebherz

   Another Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system has been installed to
   augment the existing Chloride UPS. This system, manufactured by
   American Power Conversion (APC), enhances the ABCCÂ¹s ability to survive
   unscheduled power outages, provide cleaner power, and establish the
   appropriate level of UPS power to fully support its four Power
   Distribution Units. The Chloride UPS capacity was exceeded after the
   Center's recent acquisitions of the Cray SV1 SuperCluster and the IBM
   SP3.
