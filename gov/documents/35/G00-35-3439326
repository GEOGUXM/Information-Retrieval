    WAGILS Status Report: December 2001 Finding Government Information Gets
    Easier and Easier

      News stories:  09/26/01- Find-It! Washington Now Powered by MS Find-It,
      10/05/01- Find-It! Washington Receives APQC Award,

      Find-It! Washington program improvements and new products:

      FIND-IT WASHINGTON now powered by MS Find-It software.

   Improved and upgraded service:   The Find-It! Washington service is
   newly launched on the MS Find-It software platform. The service has
   been upgraded to feature new search options and the ability to select a
   search to focus on just state, city or county information. System
   improvements include robust usage analysis reports, and collection
   analysis. The service produces results for more than 5,000 searches and
   retrievals daily. More than forty percent of users make use of the
   search by topic option of the site.

   Technical enhancements:   In November, the Washington State Library
   moved all operations to a new library building located at 6880 Capitol
   Blvd S, Tumwater WA 98501-5513. This new location is three to four
   miles south from the original library building on the Capitol Campus,
   in Olympia. The technical support team and technical infrastructure
   (yes! all the servers) are still to be moved to the new site. Brief
   service outages may occur as the servers are moved, includng possible
   service disruption of the Find-It! Washington and the Find-It Consumer
   services.

   Collection Status: The data currently being served in Find-It!
   Washington is refreshed weekly. Data gathering continues on the
   following schedule: Individual sites are spidered weekly on a five day
   schedule.

   FIND-IT CONSUMER

   The Find-It Consumer search engine is a successful service that has
   proved to be very popular with its audience. During the first year of
   operation it received an average of 2.5 requests for site as a result
   of searches per visitor. Visitor stay at the site an average of 4.3
   minutes. Both statistics indicate a high degree of usefulness to users
   and interest from users in the information reached thru the site. The
   State Library continues to partner with state agencies on development
   of the Find-It Consumer service.

   GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS CATALOG

   Technical enhancements:   A new SQL database application is under
   development to support the Government Publications collection.The new
   database and web interface will allow greater flexibilty in searches of
   local and state government documents held in Washington libraries. The
   project is coordinated by Tamera Meyer. She is testing a product from
   the Technology Resource Foundation -- the OpenBook Integrated Online
   Library System. The Cataloging and OPAC modules of OpenBook will be
   used to replace the existing database. The database will contain a
   customized selection of bibliographic records converted from US MARC
   format to SQL tables.

   Leadership & Partnering:

   WSL receives content management award: The American Productivity and
   Quality Center (APQC) of Houston Texas has recognized the Washington
   State Library as a national leader in knowledge management. The State
   Library received an award for Content Management and Knowledge Sharing
   best practices. Program coordinator, Gayle Palmer accepted the award on
   August 23, 2001 at a Consortia Learning Forum conducted by APQC. Also
   honored at the forum were four national corporations, the MITRE Corp.,
   General Electric, Dow Chemical, and the Schlumberger Limited, Inc. who
   along with the Washington State Library were profiled as content
   management best practices sites.

   The State Library is working on a project funded by a National
   Leadership Grant, "Metadata Tools for State Collaboration." The goals
   of the project are to "have national impact by developing solutions to
   two issues facing GILS states, national interoperability of government
   data and development of a common subject thesaurus for government
   information.

   Work with other agencies:
   METATAG TRAINING: WAGILS staff, Gayle and Tamera are available to
   provide hands-on metatag training to staff of agencies. They are
   available to come and discuss metatagging and web development with
   agency web content developers.

   Work toward future interoperability:
   GILS Programs in Washington, Utah, and Minnesota along with the Federal
   GILS program are participating in a pilot project that will test cross
   state searching of government information using Z Tokens.
   Tell us how you feel about improvements to our web site. For more
   information please contact Gayle Palmer, WAGILS Program Coordinator,
   360-704-5210, E-mail gpalmer@statelib.wa.gov.

    Note to Webmasters

   Important! The change in software platform will require a change in the
   "direct search" scripting for those sites that use the Find-It!
   Washington search engine as their own site search. The coding and port
   configuration is provided for webmaster convenience. Find-It!
   Washington can be accessed at both find-it.state.wa.us and
   find-it.wa.gov.

   Please update your pages if you have any links to Find-It! Washington.
