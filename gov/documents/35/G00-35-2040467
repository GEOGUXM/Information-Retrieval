   MMCR seatainer. Cloud radars transmit radio-frequency signals with
   wavelengths that are about 10 times shorter than those used by
   conventional storm surveillance radars, such as NEXRAD. The shorter
   wavelength helps these radars detect the tiny water droplets and ice
   crystals which comprise clouds, in addition to the much larger
   raindrops and snowflakes that conventional precipitation radars can
   "see". Fine-scale depictions of cloud layer heights and thicknesses,
   including multiple layer situations, are readily obtained from the
   ground with these ground-based systems. The cloud radar measurements
   can also be used to estimate the microphysical properties of the
   clouds, including particle sizes and mass contents, especially when the
   radar data are combined with simultaneous radiometer measurements. The
   information on cloud structure is particularly valuable for
   understanding and modeling how clouds reflect, absorb, redirect, and
   transform radiant energy passing through the atmosphere. It is vital
   information for improving climate models and climate prediction.

   Spectra contours. NOAA/ETL designed the MMCR, a vertically pointing
   Doppler cloud radar, specifically to monitor clouds overhead at the
   Cloud and Radiation Testbed CART sites of the U.S. Department of
   Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (DOE/ARM) program. These
   radars monitor the clouds continuously at sites in Oklahoma, Alaska,
   and the Tropical Western Pacific Ocean. They are intended to operate at
   these sites with minimal manned assistance for at least a decade. An
   identical unit, the MMCR Package. is operated by ETL for shorter
   periods on a variety of research field projects. The MMCR attains
   extraordinary sensitivity (as good as -50 dBZ at 5km height) for
   detecting extremely weak non-precipitating clouds through the use of a
   relatively large antenna (6-ft or 10-ft diameter), long sampling (~ 1
   second), signal processing and pulse compression techniques, and the
   short wavelength (8.7 mm).
