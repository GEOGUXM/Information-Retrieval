   The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory
   is a national facility for neutron scattering research. IPNS is
   operated by the University of Chicago for the United States Department
   of Energy. It is available to outside users through the submission of
   research proposals. Proposals are reviewed semiannually by a Program
   Advisory Committee. IPNS has been in operation since 1981.  Argonne
   blocks internet ports which permit the use of clear text passwords.
   Instead of telnet, we recommend the use of SSH.  Instructions for
   installation and use of free SSH clients are available at
   http://zuul.pns.anl.gov/security/.  Other possible methods are given at
   http://www.cio.anl.gov/internal/cybersecurity/nocleartext.html, but
   this link may not be available outside the Argonne web.
