                                   Welcome

   The New York Power Authority welcomes you to its St. Lawrence-Franklin
   D. Roosevelt Power Project home page. We have lots of information to
   share with you about our power project and a relicensing effort now
   underway. We'll also tell you about recreational opportunities in the
   North Country of New York State.

   You can find out how to contact us for further information or how you
   can participate in the relicensing of our St. Lawrence-FDR project.
   We'd like to hear from you!
