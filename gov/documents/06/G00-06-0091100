                               Welcome to Ohio


    The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil
      Conservation Service, is the federal government agency that works
   hand-in-hand with the American people to conserve natural resources on
    private lands. Using our scientific and technical expertise, and our
   partnerships with soil and water conservation districts and others, we
        help people conserve all natural resources on private lands.
