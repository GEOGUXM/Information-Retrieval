   The Fisheries Statistics & Economics Division collects data and
   coordinates information and research programs to support the
   science-based stewardship of the nation's living marine resources.

   In addition to integrating and disseminating state and federal
   statistics about marine fisheries, we coordinate the NMFS economics
   and  fishery observer programs. Our efforts help to build sustainable
   fisheries.

   This site describes how and why we conduct all our programs,  provides
   access to key databases (commercial fisheries landings, foreign trade,
   marine recreational fisheries catch and effort), and contains relevant
   links and references.
