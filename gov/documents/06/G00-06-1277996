   [homeside.jpg] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
   (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division (HRD) has been producing real time
   analyses of tropical cyclone surface wind observations on an
   experimental basis since 1993. HRD's analyses are created by compiling
   all available observations relative to the storm center about which the
   analysis is made. Some of these observations are taken from Air Force
   and NOAA aircraft, ships, buoys, satellites (QuikScat, TMI, ERS-2,
   SSMI), Coastal Marine Automated Network (CMAN) platforms and surface
   airways (airports). Before going through a quality control session the
   observations are adjusted to simulate the same observations at a common
   height (10 meters), exposure (marine or land), and averaging period
   (maximum sustained 1 minute wind speed).

   The primary product of an analysis, a streamline and isotach contour
   plot, is designed to aid meteorologists in forecasting a storm's
   behavior by helping them determine the storm's current intensity and
   the extent of its damaging winds. During a storm's landfall, an
   analysis image coupled with the affected geography can help determine
   which areas are suffering from the most violent winds and storm surge.
   These tools should supply emergency managers with enough information to
   help limit confusion and maximize the efficiency of early search,
   rescue and recovery efforts in these hard hit areas.
