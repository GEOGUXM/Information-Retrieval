   The Marion facility, also known as the "Scioto Laboratory" , located in
   Marion County, Ohio, was a standby facility for the Mound Laboratory T
   Building, in Miamisburg, Ohio.  The Marion facility was never operated,
   and radioactive materials were never introduced or used at the
   facility.

   By the mid-1950's all process equipment, instrumentation, and supplies
   were transferred to Mound.  The Marion facility was then turned over to
   the Government Services Administration (GSA) for other possible
   government use or sale.
