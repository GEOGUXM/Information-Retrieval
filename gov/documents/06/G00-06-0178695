                               Laboratory News


   Proton NMR Studies of Spin Density Wave Fluctuations up to 1.9 GHz.
   Preliminary, qualitative report on recent world record measurements in
   the 45 T Hybrid magnet.
   Field Induced Superconductivity in a Magnetic Organic Conductor. Recent
   mapping of the temperature magnetic field phase diagram of the FISC
   state by using AC electrical transport techniques with the Hybrid
   magnet.
   High Capacity Production of >40% Spin Polarized Xenon-129 for NMR and
   MRI Applications at the NHMFL/UF. Development and construction of a
   hyperpolarized noble gas generator is complete and performance is
   better than any other laser diode array (LDA) based system.
