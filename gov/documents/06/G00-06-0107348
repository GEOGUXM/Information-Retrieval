   We provide here a summary of XML resources and tools that are now under
   development or in use at the NASA Goddard Astronomical Data Center
   (ADC).

   The XML activities at the ADC are sponsored and supported by the NASA
   Office of Space Science Applied Information Systems Research Program
   (AISRP).

   [list pointer] What is XML?

   XML is the eXtensible Markup Language. It is an emerging standard for
   digital information markup. It allows information (data, metadata,
   documentation, resources of any kind) to be expressed in a structured,
   flexible, and easily parsible manner. XML allows for contents-based
   tagging of any information resource, and consequently it allows for
   powerful, focused, and efficient contents-based search and retrieval of
   information. For more information and an excellent starting point for
   learning about XML, refer to the on-line articles: "A Technical
   Introduction to XML", and "The Evolution of Web Documents: The Ascent
   of XML".

     XML for general scientific data: The eXtensible Data Format Home Page
   (XDF) .

     XML for Scientific Manuscripts and Articles: A Science Article Markup
   Language.
   An experimental mark up language for scientists to use when authoring
       manuscripts to be sent to journal or book publishing houses or for
       preprints. It incorporates MathML and XDF. A rudimentary converter
       to LaTeX is provided for backwards compatibility.
