   Group leader: Chris Wood

    The Biophysics Group (P-21) was founded in 1988 with the goal of
   applying the scientific and technical resources of Physics Division to
   the biosciences. The mission of P-21 is to apply physics knowledge and
   techniques to increase our understanding of important biological
   phenomena and to use biological systems to elucidate physical
   principles of complex phenomena. The group has strengthened existing
   biological projects within the Division and has initiated new
   bioscience efforts in a number of directions. Group members are engaged
   in biophysical research over a wide range of physical scales, including
   characterization of the structure and dynamics of protein molecules and
   the implications of those qualities for protein function;
   ultrasensitive detection and characterization of individual molecules
   using laser fluorescence; design and implementation of biologically
   inspired robots and adaptive digital hardware; development, validation,
   and application of noninvasive techniques for the measurement of human
   brain function; development of nonbiological applications of low-field
   magnetic sensors; and development of three-dimensional computational
   models of the human brain.

Projects:

          Low-Field Magnetic Sensors
          R. Kraus
          The Los Alamos Biophysics group is developing several sensors
          for weak magnetic fields. These include: 1) a 120 sensor system
          for the human brain; 2) a 12 sensor system for the human heart
          and other organs; 3) a sensor system for Non-Destructive
          Evaluation and Corrosion studies; 4) a small system for
          microstructure examination; 5) a HiTc SQUID system for use with
          HiTc SQUIDs; and 6) a gravity gradiometer scheme. The use of DSP
          chips in the SQUID circuits is also being implemented.
          Single-Molecule Detection
          A. Castro
          This project focuses on the development of laser-based
          techniques for the detection and analysis of biological
          molecules. Applications to molecular biology and medical
          diagnosis are being explored.
          Protein dynamics and kinetic crystallography
          J. Berendzen
          Protein dynamics is the study of the conformational motions
          responsible for biological function and the underlying physics.
          We use UV/Vis/IR spectroscopy in concert with cryogenic
          techniques and X-ray crystallography to study the structural
          foundations of protein reactions. Knowledge of the
          three-dimensional structures of intermediates in protein-ligand
          reactions helps us understand the way proteins work and provides
          the groundwork for manipulating and controlling biomolecules.
          This can potentially impact many fields, including
          mechanism-based drug design and bioremediation.
          Brain Imaging and Modeling
          J. George
          Work is focused in two major areas.
          We are involved in the development and application of
          technologies for functional mapping of the human brain.  The
          present focus is on the development of experimental and
          computational methodologies for integrated neuroimaging
          combining multiple complementary methods: Neural Electromagnetic
          Methods, MEG and EEG; Anatomical MRI (to define computational
          geometries), and functional MRI.  This effort is supported by
          the NIH-lead Human Brain Project.
          The second area of research and development is in the area of
          Advanced Optical Imaging.  The primary target application  is
          imaging of brain physiology and function, although the
          technologies are useful in other contexts.  Projects include:
          "Virtual Pinhole" Confocal Microscopy;  Confocal and Spectral
          Endoscopy;  and Photon Migration Tomography.
          Robotics and adaptive systems
          J. Moses
          P-21 has begun investigations into the design, implementation,
          and application of a variety of adaptive control systems. These
          include development of biologically inspired, legged robotics
          with simple, highly robust control circuits; applications of
          wavelets for feature recognition and data compression; and
          support for advanced multi-channel data-acquisition systems.
          This work promises to contribute both to an improved
          understanding of robotic control and to a variety of
          applications in which robust, inexpensive adaptive capabilities
          are required.
