                      Project Schedule | Presidential Records Act Overview

   The first White House Web Site was developed in 1994, during the
   Clinton Administration. The White House took snap shots of each
   version. These versions are historical materials, frozen in time,
   which means that they are no longer updated and links to other sites
   will not work. Some images were not provided to the National Archives
   and Records Administration and may appear as broken images or links.
