   Welcome to the Communications Engineering Branch of the Lister Hill
   National Center for Biomedical Communications.

   Projects in the CEB focus on research and development in image
   engineering: the capture, storage, processing, online retrieval,
   transmission, and display of both biomedical documents (mainly
   journals) and medical imagery. Areas of active investigation center on
   image compression, image enhancement, image understanding,
   pseudo-grayscale rendition, image transmission and networks, omnifont
   text recognition, and man-machine interface design. This applied
   research and development is directed toward the National Library of
   Medicine's (NLM) mission-critical tasks such as document delivery,
   archiving, and preservation. In addition, research into imaging
   techniques that support medical education packages employing digitized
   radiographic, dermatological, and other imagery is also being pursued.

   Through the National Institutes of Health, CEB offers summer and
   year-round employment opportunities for qualified student applicants.
