                        Headquarters Security Update

                   U.S. Government Information & Resources
                    In Response To September 11th Events
   As the nexus of NASA's major aeronautical and space programs, NASA
   Headquarters is the voice of the Agency. Through sound Agency
   Management, integral Functional Offices, and a vigorous Enterprise
   Management, NASA Headquarters integrates NASA as an aggregate sum of
   its many parts.

   By prioritizing budget directions and providing customer-driven
   aeronautics and space programs, internal NASA planning has helped
   thrust the U.S. aircraft and airline industries into positions of
   leadership in global aviation, and it has created the foundation for
   America as a world leader in space travel and exploration.
