           Here at the Greater Kansas City Federal Executive Board we
   strive on providing a clear and effective communications medium between
   federal agencies as well as all levels of government.  Nothing can be
   more important to federal organizations than "partnering" with other
   government entities and community groups.

           There are numerous opportunities to pool experience, resources,
   and accomplish savings.  We feel that the Federal Executive Board can
   bring diverse parties to the table and facilitate collaboration and
   problem solving.

           We hope that this website proves helpful to you.  We welcome
   your suggestions and comments.  Please feel free to contact us at any
   time.
