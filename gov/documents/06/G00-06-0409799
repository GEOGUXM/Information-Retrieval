   Conference Reviews Digital
   Economy, Examines Agenda
   For Future Research
   [a.gif] public conference was held on May 25 and 26, 1999, at the
   Department of Commerce, to review recent research on implications of
   the digital economy and examine the agenda for future research,
   including the need for and possible sources of new data, indicators,
   and tools.
   The explosive growth of electronic commerce, combined with rapid
   changes in information, computing and communications sectors, is having
   a profound effect on the nation's economy. A year ago, the Department
   of Commerce released its report, The Emerging Digital Economy. Other
   reports have followed from the OECD, the National Science Foundation,
   and the National Research Council.

   The President recently directed the National Economic Council, in
   consultation with executive branch agencies, to analyze the economic
   impact of the Internet and electronic commerce in the United States and
   internationally and to consider new indicators for the information
   economy, new types of data collection, and new research that could be
   undertaken by organizations in the public and private sectors. The
   conference assessed research to date on the scale, direction, and
   significance of the emerging digital economy; engaged the private
   sector in suggesting the research, tools, indicators, and data
   collection that may help to inform investment decisions and policy
   development; and promoted an open research agenda for better
   understanding the growth and socioeconomic implications of information
   technology and electronic commerce.

   Economists and other social scientists prepared papers on the state of
   research and research needs in these areas.
