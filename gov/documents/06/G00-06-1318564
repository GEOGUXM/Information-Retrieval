   The samples for the FormFlow 99 Server Components are divided into two
   categories: Business Forms and Version Management Control. You can
   start any of the samples listed below by simply clicking the
   appropriate form name.
   Each of the Business Forms contain a Features page which outlines the
   the various features used in the form. Use these forms to test your
   FormFlow 99 Web Server install. See the FormFlow 99 Deployment Guide
   for instructions on deploying sample forms supplied with FormFlow 99
   Form Designer. These samples illustrate additional FormFlow 99
   features.
   The Version Management Control section provides samples for deploying
   the Version Management control in a Web environment. For these samples,
   a detailed description of the topic is provided.
   Please note that Netscape Navigator users must install the FormFlow 99
   Plug-in for Netscape Navigator in order to use the Version Management
   Control. For details on the Version Management control, see the
   FormFlow 99 Deployment Guide.

    Version Management

     For Internet Explorer

     For Netscape

     Detect browser An example of an administrative page that users could
   access to update their FormFlow controls or troubleshoot difficulties
   with form object versions. Demonstrates the UpdateControls,
   SendDiagnostics, and AnalyzeAndUpdateVersions methods of the Version
   Management control.
    Update and Redirect

     For Internet Explorer

     For Netscape

     Detect browser Demonstrates how the AnalyzeUpdateAndRedirect method
   of the Version Management control can be used to ensure a client's form
   objects are up-to-date before proceeding to another page. This sample
   uses JavaScript to access a Version Management control.

    Update and Redirect with ASP This sample calls an ASP to ensure a
   client's form objects are up-to-date before proceeding to another page.
   Demonstrates how the AnalyzeUpdateAndRedirect method and ExecuteMethod
   property of the Version Management control can be used in an Active
   Server Page. To use this sample, UpdateControls.asp must be installed
   on a server which supports ASPs.
    controls.txt This is a sample of the controls.txt file which the
   Version Management control uses to gather version information on the
   controls on a client's system. Administrators may alter this file as
   described in the FormFlow 99 Deployment Guide in order to control the
   user interface.
