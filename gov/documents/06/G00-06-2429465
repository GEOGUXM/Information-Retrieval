  [a_right.gif] Background:

   The JPL GPS Systems (Rogue) Group has been developing highly precise
   multipurpose navigation receivers for NASA since 1981. New
   high-accuracy GPS flight receivers for low earth orbit are being
   developed at JPL that will produce sub meter level orbits, attitude
   determination, and provide a large variety of valuable scientific
   information. The data collected by tracking the dual frequency GPS
   signals as the GPS Satellites are Occulted by the Earth's atmosphere
   can provide valuable information about the Ionosphere and Troposphere
   characteristics. The basic receiver design will be used in numerous
   future projects but its hardware and software will be modified to suit
   the special needs of each mission. The past, present and future of GPS
   receiver development at JPL can be seen with the Family Tree Diagram.

   The basic receiver is based on the Power PC 603e ÂµProcessor and will
   run at over 200 MHz. Power consumption will be less than 4 watts in the
   digital section and less than 1 watt for each of the up to four
   antenna's digital sampling down converter in the RF section. It will
   weigh less than 1 pound and will take up only 5 cubic inches. In
   addition to the low power, size, and weight, additional advantages
   include minimal ground support (<1 person), autonomous operation, high
   speed communications ports, and a unique open hardware architecture
   that will allow for a wide variety of hardware configurations for
   minimal additional costs.
