Census 2000 Final Response Rates

   Welcome to the Final Response Rates site for Census 2000. The national
   67% Final Response Rate for Census 2000 exceeds the 65% response rate
   from the 1990 census and far exceeds the 61% response rate expected for
   the census. Thanks to the public's help, Census 2000 is a good census.
   The increase in participation by the American public enabled census
   staff to complete field operations on schedule. The American public
   should be proud of its accomplishment.

   More than 24 percent (9,294) of the local communities responded to the
   Census Bureau's challenge to increase their community's participation
   rates in this census by at least five percentage points over their 1990
   response rate. Of the 50 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,
   5 met or exceeded the '90 Plus Five challenge. This is a truly
   significant achievement.

   These rates update the Initial Response Rates that were last posted in
   April for more than 38,000 state, local and tribal governmental
   entities. They tell how many housing units returned a census
   questionnaire by mail, used a Be Counted form, or provided census
   responses over the telephone or Internet. They are a measure of
   cooperation by the American public. The rates confirm that the American
   public reversed a three-census decline in census participation by
   mailing back their census forms at rates that significantly exceeded
   those measured in 1990.

   The numbers presented on this site represent responses received by
   mail, telephone or over the Internet through September 7. The rates
   were calculated solely as a measure of progress in meeting the '90 Plus
   Five challenge. The Final Response Rates should not be confused with
   mail return rates that will be calculated and released by the Census
   Bureau at a later date. It is at that time that vacant housing
   structures will be excluded from the calculation to give a true measure
   of census "returns."
