   Image of a Diagram showing the merger of two government Y2K web sites
   to make the New Y2K.gov Clearing house website Welcome to the National
   Year 2000 (Y2K) Clearinghouse. This website is a combination of the
   President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, the Chief Information
   Officer's Council Committee on Year 2000, and the U.S. Federal Gateway
   for Year 2000 Information Directories.

   This clearinghouse creates a single repository of Y2K information to
   assist the public, business, academia, Federal, state and local
   governments in obtaining various Y2K information.

   The National Y2K Clearinghouse web site is in the process of being
   finalized. Please send an e-mail message to Mike Johnson at
   mike.johnson@gsa.gov regarding any departmental information (in
   particular Y2K lessons learned) you would like to have included in the
   National Y2K Clearinghouse web site. To those of you that have provided
   content for the National Y2K Clearinghouse web site, thank you.
