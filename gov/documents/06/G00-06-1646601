     Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura is a NASA mission to study the
     Earth's ozone, air quality and climate. This mission is designed
     exclusively to conduct research on the composition, chemistry and
     dynamics of the Earth's upper and lower atmosphere employing multiple
     instruments on a single satellite. EOS Aura is the third in a series of
     major Earth observing satellites to study the environment and climate
     change and is part of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise. The first and
     second missions, Terra and Aqua, are designed to study the land,
     oceans, and the Earth's radiation budget. Aura's chemistry measurements
     will also follow up on measurements which began with NASA'S Upper
     Atmospheric Research Satellite and continue the record of satellite
     ozone data collected from the TOMS missions.

     The EOS Aura satellite, instruments, launch, and science investigations
     are managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
     Maryland. The satellite will be launched in June 2003 and operated for
     five or more years. Scientific investigations will continue throughout
     the years the spacecraft is in operation and several years afterwards.

     This site provides information on the mission's science objectives,
     spacecraft and instrument technology, mission operations, and data
     analysis. Aura project management is described with useful information
     on conducting business with the project. Recent milestones and events
     of interest are also posted. There are many links relating to
     atmospheric chemistry research and related spaceflight projects in the
     United States and the rest of world.
