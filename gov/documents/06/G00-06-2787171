   Your children may be eligible for free or low-cost health insurance!

   You work hard to provide for your children and want to make sure they
   grow up strong, smart and healthy. But like many parents whose children
   don't have health insurance, you worry about taking care of them.

   Now, you may have one less thing to worry about. Your state, and every
   state in the nation, has a health insurance program for infants,
   children and teens.

   For little or no cost, this insurance pays for:
     * doctor visits,
     * prescription medicines,
     * hospitalizations, and
     * much more.

   Kids that do not currently have health insurance are likely to be
   eligible, even if you are working. The states have different
   eligibility rules, but in most states, uninsured children 18 years old
   and younger, whose families earn up to $34,100 a year (for a family of
   four) are eligible.

   To learn more, go to Your State's Program or make a free call to
   1-877-KIDS-NOW for more information.
