                               Welcome to the
                       Collider-Accelerator Department

   The mission of the Collider-Accelerator Department is to develop,
   improve and operate the suite of particle / heavy ion accelerators used
   to carry out the program of accelerator-based experiments at BNL; to
   support the experimental program including design, construction and
   operation of the beam transports to the experiments plus support of
   detector and research needs of the experiments; to design and construct
   new accelerator facilities in support of the BNL and national missions.
   The C-A Department supports an international user community of over
   1500 scientists. The department performs all these functions in an
   environmentally responsible and safe manner under a rigorous conduct of
   operations approach.
