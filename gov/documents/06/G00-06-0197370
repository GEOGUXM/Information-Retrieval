   Welcome to our new home page!

   This Program Support Center service is used primarily by Federal
   awarding officials (grant and contracting officers) in determining
   appropriate amounts of indirect, fringe benefit (and other types of)
   costs to be awarded and claimed by "not-for-profit" type organizations
   receiving Federal awards.

   Information for organizations subject to the Commercial (for-profit)
   Cost Principles are NOT included here.
