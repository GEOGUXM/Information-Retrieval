                                Flight Linux

    FlightLinux is a concept that uses a real-time variation of the open
      source Linux Operating System for onboard spacecraft use. Onboard
     Operating systems have evolved from custom code to applications of
    embedded real-time operating systems. The time has come to go to open
                                   source.

    The open source Linux concept, with a modified real-time, embeddable
       kernel, will address the unique problems of spacecraft onboard
                              computers better.

      FlightLinux is the subject of a NASA Advanced Information System
   Technology (AIST) research effort, NRA-99-OES-08. Linux is a registered
                        trademark of Linus Torvalds.

                            What is FlightLinux?

     FlightLinux is a customized copy of a standard Linux distribution,
     adapted to the unique environment of a spacecraft embedded control
                                  computer.

    The first instance of FlightLinux will be on the 80386EX processor of
   the currently in-orbit UoSat-12 spacecraft, of Surrey Space Technology,
   Ltd (UK). As a basis, we are currently using the ELKS distribution, due
    to its small size. We will migrate to BlueCat Linux from LynuxWorks,
     and add real-time features as required. Custom device drivers will
         address the unique aspects of the spacecraft architecture.

    Future versions will be ported to the architectures described in our
                         Target Architecture Report.

   At the moment, we have not posted any downloadable code, due to issues
            of export restrictions on satellite control software.
