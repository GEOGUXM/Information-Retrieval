   The Mission of the Pollution Liability Insurance Agency is to make
   pollution liability insurance available and affordable to the owners
   and operators of regulated petroleum underground storage tanks and
   heating oil tanks.

                        PLIA is also responsible for:
     * Verifying the validity of declarations of financial responsibility
       for the costs of cleanup of contamination;
     * Providing informal advice and technical assistance to owners of
       heating oil tanks regarding liability, cleanup requirements and
       related matters; and
     * Monitoring UST Community Assistance Program grants to ensure
       compliance with contracts and service requirements.
