   MISSION:
   Our division develops and applies new active optical sensing technology
   to provide information about atmospheric winds, aerosols, clouds,
   turbulence, humidity, and chemical species.
   The TEA CO2 Doppler lidar measures winds at TexAQS to understand
   pollution transport in the Houston area.

  Research Areas:

     * Mesoscale Dynamics & Air Pollution Meteorology
     * Clouds & Aerosols
     * Water Vapor
     * Ozone Pollution

     * Turbulence, Diffusion, & Fluxes
     * Spacebased/Airborne Doppler Lidar
     * Lidar Signal Processing
     * Instrument Development

  What is a Lidar?

  What's New?

     * New Pages:
          + Vertical Transport and Mixing (VTMX) information and data
          + Paper on CASES and MAP
