General information

   These pages reside within your AXIS 200+. For the most recent
   information, visit Axis Communications [remote.gif] . (Note: links
   marked with ' [remote.gif] ' will take you to Axis web site, all other
   links are functional even if you don't have Internet access.)

   Your current software version is 1.41 (Dec 11, 1998).

   Now that you can access the home page of your AXIS 200+, you can
   immediately link it up to your web page. If it is being used on an
   intranet or a modestly trafficed Internet site, this is all you need to
   do!
   However...
   ... if you are operating a popular web site, we recommend that the AXIS
   200+ is accessed over an assisting web server and not directly. To
   avoid occasional loss of images in high traffic applications, we
   suggest that you set up the eyeget script [remote.gif] to grab snapshot
   images from the AXIS 200+, and make them accessible by your web server.
