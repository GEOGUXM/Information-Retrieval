    It Takes a Laboratory                         Main Injector Tunnel

   The Main Injector has been a decade in the making. The initial design
   work started in 1987, when a small group of physicists undertook a
   study of how Fermilab could enhance the performance of the Tevatron
   beyond its original performance goals, by integrating a new accelerator
   or accelerators within the existing complex. Funding for the Main
   Injector Project was approved starting in October 1991. After an
   extended design and R&D period, the construction really got underway in
   the spring of 1993. In the spring of 1999 the Main Injector is ready
   for high energy physics research at Fermilab.

   The addition of Main Injector to the Fermilab accelerator complex marks
   a dramatic increase in the physics capabilities of the Fermilab High
   Energy Physics Programs.
     * There will be a dramatic increase in the number of
       proton-antiproton collisions that can be created and observed in
       the Tevatron, by increasing the beam current in the Main Injector,
       its reliability and the cycling rate over the Main Ring which it
       replaces,   This extends the physics "reach" to higher mass and
       rarer particles that will, if discovered, expand our understanding
       of the nature of matter and the forces that hold it together.

     * The Main injector will operate simultaneously in fixed target and
       antiproton production modes. A very intense 120 GeV beam can be
       extracted. Targeting this beam will create an intense beam of
       neutrinos that will be used to study the basic question: do
       neutrinos have mass? An intense beam of K-mesons can also be
       created and rare decay modes studied.

   Greater understanding of the basic quark structure of matter and the
   nature of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe will emerge
   from these studies.

   The Recycler Ring was added to the Main Injector Project in the spring
   of 1997. The Recycler Ring will increase the collision rate in the
   Tevatron collider by a factor of three to five beyond that with the
   Main Injector alone. Without the Recycler, the precious antiprotons
   left at the end of a collider "store" (8-12 hour period of time when
   the beams are in collision) must be thrown away.  The Recycler will
   allow Fermilab to recover these antiprotons and re-use them in a later
   store. As an added benefit, the Recycler will also allow the existing
   Antiproton Source to perform more efficiently and produce more
   antiprotons per hour.
