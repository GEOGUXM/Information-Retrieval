                        Take a Moment to Remember...

     ...those Americans who gave their lives in service to their country

   Memorial Day... it's not about war...it's about people. They died, most
    of them young, serving their fellow Americans, their country, future
   generationsall of us. This Memorial Day, please pause with Americans
   at home and abroad to honor the men and women who died so that we might
       enjoy the gift of freedom. Let us never forget their sacrifice.

    At 3:00 p.m., simply stop what you are doing and think for one minute
   about those who died for your freedom. If you are driving, turn on your
                            vehicle's headlights.

      As you participate in the National Moment of Remembrance, you are
     helping reclaim Memorial Day for the noble purpose for which it was
   establishedto honor those who died in service to our Nation. Join with
     the White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance in
     honoring those who have died and their families. It is a minute of
                     reflection that everyone can spare.

   7-Eleven and AT&T salute those who answered the call of our country in
               a Memorial Day RemembranceCalling all Heroes

   The National Moment of Remembrance was formally established by an act
   of Congress.
