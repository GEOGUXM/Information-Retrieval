                         Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer
     __________________________________________________________________

   [planfin.gif] NASA GSFC's Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer (ROWS) is an
   airborne remote sensor used to support the development and refinement
   of satellite radars that measure the ocean surface. The short-pulse
   Ku-band radar is specifically configured to measure the directional
   spectrum of ocean swell. In addition, the system is being used to study
   near-nadir ocean backscatter and its relation to wind waves. The sensor
   is typically flown on one of several NASA aircraft and is potentially
   available for outside use in funded ocean research efforts. Currently,
   ROWS research efforts are aimed at improving the interpretation of
   ocean data collected using the satellite SAR (ERS-1), altimeter (TOPEX)
   and scatterometer (NSCAT).
