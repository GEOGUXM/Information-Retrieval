   Laboratory
   [engineer.gif] Welcome to the new Home Page of the Reactor Analysis and
   Engineering Division of Argonne National Laboratory. The division was
   formed on October 1, 2000, and is the result of a merger between the
   former Reactor Analysis and Reactor Engineering Divisions.

   Due to the recent merger, the division will maintain two separate web
   sites until this new single web site is fully developed. Please follow
   the links provided below to learn about the division's activities.
