   MISR Instrument
   No instrument like MISR has flown in space before. Viewing the sunlit
   Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced angles, MISR collects global
   images with high spatial detail in four colors at every angle. These
   images are carefully calibrated to provide accurate measures of the
   brightness, contrast, and color of reflected sunlight.

   The change in reflection at different view angles affords the means to
   distinguish different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud
   forms, and land surface covers. Combined with stereoscopic techniques,
   this enables construction of 3-dimensional models and more accurate
   estimates of the total amount of sunlight reflected by Earth's diverse
   environments.

   MISR provides new types of information for scientists studying Earth's
   climate, such as the partitioning of energy and carbon between the land
   surface and the atmosphere, and the regional and global impacts of
   different types of atmospheric particles and clouds on climate.

   MISR was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is part of
   NASA's Terra spacecraft, launched into a polar orbit around Earth on 18
   December, 1999.

   MISR data products are distributed through the NASA Langley Atmospheric
   Sciences Data Center.

                         Volga Delta and the Caspian Sea

      Russia's Volga River is the largest river system in Europe, draining
      over 1.3 million square kilometers of catchment area into the Caspian
     Sea. The brackish Caspian is Earth's largest landlocked water body, and
      its isolation from the world's oceans has enabled the preservation of
     several unique animal and plant species. The Volga provides most of the
     Caspian's fresh water and nutrients, and also discharges large amounts
      of sediment and industrial waste into the relatively shallow northern
        part of the sea. These images of the region were captured by the
     Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on October 5, 2001, during Terra
         orbit 9567. Each image represents an area of approximately 275
                          kilometers x 376 kilometers.

     The left-hand image is from MISR's nadir (vertical-viewing) camera, and
      shows how light is reflected at red, green, and blue wavelengths. The
      right-hand image is a false color composite of red-band imagery from
         MISR's 60-degree backward, nadir, and 60-degree forward-viewing
      cameras, displayed as red, green, and blue, respectively. Here, color
     variations indicate how light is reflected at different angles of view.
      Water appears blue in the right-hand image, for example, because sun
         glitter makes smooth, wet surfaces look brighter at the forward
      camera's view angle. The rougher-textured vegetated wetlands near the
       coast exhibit preferential backscattering, and consequently appear
     reddish. A small cloud near the center of the delta separates into red,
      green, and blue components due to geometric parallax associated with
                        its elevation above the surface.

         Other notable features within the images include several linear
     features located near the Volga Delta shoreline. These long, thin lines
     are artificially maintained shipping channels, dredged to depths of at
      least 2 meters. The crescent-shaped Kulaly Island, also known as Seal
           Island, is visible near the right-hand edge of the images.

       MISR was built and is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
      Pasadena, CA, for NASA's Office of Earth Science, Washington, DC. The
        Terra satellite is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
         Greenbelt, MD. JPL is a division of the California Institute of
                                   Technology.
