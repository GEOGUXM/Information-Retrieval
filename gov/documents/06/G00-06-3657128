   Welcome to the CMBP Web Site.
   The U.S. Census Monitoring Board, established by Congress in 1997, is a
   bipartisan board charged with monitoring Census 2000 operations and
   with reporting its findings to Congress. The Board is composed of eight
   Members: four appointed by the President, two appointed by the Speaker
   of the House of Representatives, and two appointed by the Majority
   Leader of the United States Senate. The Board began its work in 1998
   and issued reports to Congress in February, April and October of 1999,
   March and April of 2000, and in April 2001. The Final Report was
   submitted on September 26, 2001.

   The Final Report Downloads:
   The following report represents over three years of dedicated service
   to the cause of an accurate Census 2000. It embodies not only our
   legacy, but also our belief that the census, as a foundation of
   democracy, should count every single individual in our great nation. It
   is also our hope that this final report will serve as a useful roadmap
   for Census 2010.
