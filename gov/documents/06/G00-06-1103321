Welcome to the Office of Administrative Hearings!

   The Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) is an independent state
   agency which conducts impartial administrative hearings for other
   government agencies. OAH was created in 1982 as an independent forum
   for citizens challenging government decisions. It provides independent,
   professional, and timely "due process" hearings for a wide variety of
   state and local agencies.

Our mission

   To hold fair and independent hearings for the public and for government
   agencies, and to issue sound and timely decisions.

   Learn more about our agency's history, goals, and objectives for the
   next biennium.

How do I request a hearing?

   Except for DSHS appeals, you must file your appeal (usually in writing)
   with the agency that made the original decision. Each agency has its
   own rules and timelines for accepting appeals of its decisions.

How do I prepare for my hearing?

   OAH cannot give legal advice. We have, however, written a guide to the
   most common types of hearings to help you prepare for your hearing. You
   can also find some links to legal research online.
