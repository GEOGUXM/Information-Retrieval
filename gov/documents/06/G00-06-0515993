   SCOPE of ICIS'01

   ICIS'01 is the 9th in a series of international conferences on ion
   sources. The biennial conference brings together scientists working on
   all aspects of ion sources and their application. ICIS'01 is expected
   to attract about 250 scientists and engineers from ion source
   communities all over the world. The primary goal of the conference is
   to foster the exchange of ideas, results, theories, and techniques in
   different sub-fields and areas of application among workers from
   laboratories and industries around the world.

   At the conference all topics regarding ion sources will be covered,
   including ion production, beam transport, ion source-relevant plasma
   physics, novel techniques in ion sources and related apparatus and
   applications of ion sources and beams.

   equations). Equations and Greek symbols are permitted, but no imbedded
   figures.

   TOPICS
   ICIS'01, the ninth in a series of international conferences on ion
   sources, is expected to bring together over 250 scientists and
   engineers who work on all aspects of ion sources and their
   applications. It fosters the exchange of ideas, results, theories, and
   techniques in different subfields and areas of application among
   researchers from universities, laboratories and industries around the
   world.

   All subjects regarding ion sources will be covered, including ion
   production, beam transport, relevant plasma physics, novel techniques
   in ion sources and related apparatus, and applications of ion sources
   and beams. The conference will be organized along the following three
   major topics.

   1. FUNDAMENTALS AND THEORY
      Ion production    Beam transport
      Diagnostics       Ion optics
      Simulation        Others

   PRESENTATION

   Technical sessions will include Plenary and Invited oral presentations,
   as well as poster sessions. English is used for all presentations and
   publications.

   Oral - All oral sessions will be held in the Jewett Ballroom/Exhibit
   Hall in the Oakland Marriott City Center. There will be no parallel
   sessions.

   An overhead projector and a LCD projector will be available. For
   specialized audio-visual needs please contact the Conference
   Administrator.
