     __________________________________________________________________

   The Pacific Hydrographic Branch is the NOAA, Office of Coast Survey
   contact for West coast hydrographic survey requests and West coast data
   processing. Atlantic Hydrographic Branch is our East coast counterpart.
   Both branches are under the Hydrographic Surveys Division. PHB produces
   final survey data and selects significant features and soundings that
   are to be displayed on navigational charts and related documents used
   by:
     * The Marine Chart Division of NOAA's National Ocean Service.
     * Marine Geology and Geophysics Division of the National Geophysical
       Data Center in Boulder, CO.
     * Commercial interests, especially in Washington, Oregon, California,
       Hawaii, and Alaska.
     * State and local governments, and other federal agencies.
     * Recreational Boaters, e.g. see Mark Rosenstein's (extensive)
       Sailing page
     * Even the midwestern farmer selling his produce overseas relies on
       accurate nautical charts to efficiently serve his customers!

  A number of NOAA offices support hydrographic surveying:

     * Order Nautical Charts from NOS, if you can't get to a local chart
       sales agent;
     * Geodetic Survey monuments and data;
     * Photogrammetric shoreline mapping data;
     * Actual Tides, Datums, and Tidal Predictions; or
     * Hydrographic Survey Ships operated by
     * Office of NOAA Corps Operations, the nation's seventh and smallest
       uniformed service.

               Recent examples of hydrographic sensor imagery:

      Note: These are not available for surveys more than 50 years old
      because leadlines are poor Graphics Input Devices! Unfortunately,
   approximately 60% of the nation's charts are based on survey data prior
                              to World War II.

   Of course, a nautical chart is only as good as the data (hydrographic
   surveys) used to create it. It must be updated periodically in response
   to changes in shoreline, ports, bathymetry, navigational aids, and even
   the draft of transiting vessels.

   The United States Coast Guard operates ancillary services vital to this
   mission and to the mariner, such as:
     * Local Notice to Mariners in Microsoft Word 97 or Adobe PDF formats
       which you can download;
     * Global Positioning System (GPS) information from the USCG
       Navigation Center, and;
     * Recreational Boating Safety advice from the USCG; also check your
       local USCG Auxilliary.
