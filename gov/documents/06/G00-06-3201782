                          Mechanical Systems Center
                     NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center

   The Mechanical Systems Center (MSC) is an innovative center of
   expertise which provides multidisciplinary capabilities and technology
   development to design, analyze, fabricate, integrate, test, and launch
   advanced scientific instruments and support platforms for a variety of
   ground-based, suborbital, and orbital Earth and space science missions.
   The MSC Mission is to provide mechanical systems development and
   cutting edge technology in support of Earth and space science.
   The MSC Vision and Strategic Goals: With a diverse, talented,
   motivated, productive workforce, we will:
   Deliver state-of-the-art products and services with end-to-end
   mechanical systems capabilities.
     * Provide new technologies that enhance and enable cutting edge
       science.
     * Provide world-class facilities delivering value-added, customer
       driven services.
     * Nurture current collaborative efforts and develop new partnerships
       with other NASA centers, other government agencies, academia,
       private industry, and international agencies.
     * Operate with high performance teams that define clear roles and
       responsibilities and that establish open communication with
       employees, customers, and partners.
     * Use streamlined processes that ensure responsiveness to customer
       needs.
