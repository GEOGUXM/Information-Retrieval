   Welcome to the State of California Department of Community Services and
   Development (CSD) web site.   CSD's mission is to develop resources
   that California's low-income communities need to move from poverty to
   self-sufficiency by collaborating with our network of community
   services providers and other public and private organizations.

   We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our
   programs.  Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or
