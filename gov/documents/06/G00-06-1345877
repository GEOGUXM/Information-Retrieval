Program Description

   The Constituency Outreach and Education Program is a nationwide
   communications initiative of the National Institute of Mental Health
   that enlists State and national organizations in a partnership to help
   close the gap between mental health research and practice and reduce
   the stigma of mental illness.

   The program is a key element in a broader effort by NIMH to deliver
   science-based information on mental health to the public and health
   professionals and thus to improve the diagnosis and treatment of mental
   illnesses among all Americans--including underserved populations such
   as minority groups, children, and older people. Through this program,
   NIMH also hopes to build increased public awareness of the importance
   of basic and clinical research in advancing knowledge of the brain and
   behavior--knowledge critical to the development of new and improved
   treatments for mental disorders. [More]
