   Dec 21, 1999 AcrimSat Launched 12/20/99 -- Mission Status

   The ACRIMSAT Mission will measure Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) during
   its five-year mission life. The ACRIMSAT spacecraft, carrying the ACRIM
   III instrument, will be secondary payload on a Taurus vehicle scheduled
   to launch in December 1999. The instrument, third in a series of
   long-term solar-monitoring tools built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory, will continue to extend the database first created by ACRIM
   I, which was launched in 1980 on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM)
   spacecraft. ACRIM II followed on the Upper Atmosphere Research
   Satellite (UARS) in 1991.

   The Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) I instrument
   was the first to clearly demonstrate that the total radiant energy from
   the sun was not a constant. However, the solar variability was so
   slight (0.1% of full scale) that continuous monitoring by
   state-of-the-art instrumentation was necessary. It is theorized that as
   much as 25% of the anticipated global warming of the earth may be solar
   in origin. In addition, seemingly small (0.5%) changes in the TSI
   output of the sun over a century or more may cause significant
   climatological changes on earth.

   The ACRIMSAT mission is funded by NASA through the Earth Science
   Programs Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. The ACRIMSAT Project
   Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA) manages the
   design, fabrication, and test of the ACRIM III instrument and manages
   the subcontract for the ACRIMSAT spacecraft being built by Orbital
   Sciences Corporation. The ACRIM III data products will be available
   through the Langley EOS Data Analysis and Archive Center.

   The Principal Investigator for the ACRIM mission is Dr. Richard Willson
   of Columbia University. Ron Zenone of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
   the ACRIM Project Manager. Roger Helizon of the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory is the ACRIM Instrument Scientist. Tom Itchkawich of Orbital
   Sciences Corporation is the ACRIMSAT Spacecraft Program Manager. (Other
   personnel are listed on the Contact List on the Organization/Feedback
   page.)
