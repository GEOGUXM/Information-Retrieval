   distribution.
        __________________________________________________________________


   [medbutton.png] As the whole Linux-Mandrake distribution, this Apache
   web server is compiled with Processor-Specific Optimizations to take
   advantage of the power of the new processor generation, giving it 5-30%
   more performance than any other Linux Web Server. For documentation and
   information on Mandrake Linux, please visit the web site of
   Linux-Mandrake.
   This version of Apache includes many optimizations, Extended
   Application Programming Interface (EAPI), Shared memory module, hooks
   for SSL modules, and several patches/cosmetic improvements. It is also
   fully modular, and many modules are available in pre-compiled format,
   like PHP4, the Hotwired XSSI module and Apache-ASP. Also included are
   special patches to enable FrontPage 2000 support (see mod_frontpage
   package).
   Documentation for some standard Apache modules and other addon modules
   is included.

                           Secure your web server!

   [stamp.gif] Mandrake now comes with SSL encryption (mod_ssl), we
   suggest you install it for more security. It comes with its own test
   key so you can start using it right now, or, thanks to Mandrake's new
   partnership with Thawte, you can now buy an SSL certificate through
   MandrakeSoft! See this page for more information. Thawte SSL
   certificates will enable the SSL on your web server, giving you the
   ability to communicate securely with your web customers. SSL security
   makes eavesdropping on your web traffic almost impossible. You might
   also want to try mod_sxnet: This product includes software developed by
   Thawte Consulting and implements the Thawte Strong Extranet version 1.1

   About Apache

      The Apache Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed
      at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and
      freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server.
      The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around
      the world, using the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and
      develop the server and its related documentation. These volunteers are
      known as the Apache Group. In addition, hundreds of users have
      contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the project.

      Apache is the most popular web server in the world, with around 60%
      market share, more than twice than Microsoft IIS!

      According to Netcraft, "The widespread deployment of Apache amongst
      hosting companies and ISPs ensures that Apache is in a better position
      to echo the growth of the web than any other server, and this has been
      a longterm theme of the Web Server survey." The last Netcraft survey
      reported almost 17 million Apache servers worldwide.

      If you are seeing this instead of the content you expected, please
      contact the administrator of the site involved. If you send mail about
      this to the authors of the Apache software, NetRevolution, or to the
      distributors of the operating system, who almost certainly have nothing
      to do with this site, your message will be ignored. You are probably
      seeing this page because the server is not yet fully configured.
