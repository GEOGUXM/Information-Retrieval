   The Central Energy Team, in the USGS Energy Resources Program, provides
   the best-available assessments of Energy Resources (coal, oil, natural
   gas). These assessments are critical to the Nation's welfare and are
   based on:
   New Features
     * A comprehensive understanding of the Geologic Framework in which
       energy resources occur and

     * A thorough understanding of the Geologic Processes that produce
       accumulations of energy resources and consider the economic,
       technical, and environmental factors affecting the availability and
       recoverability of those energy resources.
