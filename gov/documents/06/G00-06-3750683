   Welcome to the electronic home of the MatTec. The Subcommittee on
   Materials Technology is hereby established under the Committee of
   Technology by action of the National Science and Technology Council
   (NSTC). The Subcommittee serves as the principal internal consultative,
   advisory, and executing NSTC group on materials technology policy,
   research and development programs, education and training, and budget
   assessment for the Executive Branch. The NSTC Committee on Technology
   will serve as the forum for building consensus and resolving issues
   raised by the Subcommittee. Research and development (R&D) is defined
   to include basic and applied research, technology development,
   technology demonstrations, and materials engineering for the purpose of
   subcommittee activities.

   Our
   purpose is to coordinate federal programs to achieve the
   administration's mission in Materials Technology.

   You are welcome to take a look at our meetings and events .   Although
   most are limited to federal program managers, some are open to the
   public.   Inquiries are encouraged.
