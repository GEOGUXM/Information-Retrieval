                                   NOTICE

   The Merit Systems Protection Board Headquarters' office is experiencing
   a disruption of mail delivery because of the closing of the Brentwood
   mail facility.  To facilitate case processing, parties with matters
   pending before the Board may wish to fax copies of any submissions they
   may have mailed to the MSPB headquarters during the past three weeks.
   Copies of submissions can be faxed to 202 653 7130 or 202 653-6182.  Of
   course, submissions that were postmarked by the required due date will
   be accepted as timely.

   The Board's New York Field Office is now open for business, however,
   admittance to the office, including for hearings, must be approved in
   advance. The office is open to federal employees with photo IDs;
   non-federal employees must show photo IDs and evidence that they have
   an appointment. Such evidence can be a letter on MSPB stationary
   stamped approved by the GSA building manager's office, an MSPB hearing
   or conference order, or subpoena, etc.

   USPS mail service to the New York office has been restored (26 Federal
   Plaza, Room 3137A, New York, NY 10278). NYFO also receives deliveries
   from FedEx, UPS, and other private mail carriers as well as by FAX

   Welcome to the World Wide Web Home Page of the U.S. Merit Systems
   Protection Board (MSPB).

   Established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Board serves
   as guardian of the Federal Government's merit-based system of
   employment, principally by hearing and deciding appeals from Federal
   employees of removals and other major personnel actions. The Board also
   hears and decides other types of civil service cases, reviews
   regulations of the Office of Personnel Management, and conducts studies
   of the merit systems.

   Make your selection and enjoy your stay.
