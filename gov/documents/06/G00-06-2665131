                 Wildland Fire Manager Password Application



   The USGS GeoMAC Team maintains two fire information servers:
     * One server is for the Public
     * The other server is for Wildland Fire Managers only

   By giving Firefighters access to their own server, we are able to
   insure that the fastest download times possible are given to the
   front-line firefighters who need this information the most.

   Wildland Fire Managers - please fill-in the following information to
   obtain your password:

                                New Feature!
                                  Save View

   Explanation - It's similar to saving a video game level. You can save a
   fire-location, then come back at a later time and display the
   fire-location that you saved in your previous log-in with your very own
   customized settings. This feature saves you valuable time when looking
   for the specific fire information you want to display.

   If you have already registered as a Wildland Fire Manager and would
   like the [Save View] feature added to your profile, please fill-in the
   following information:
