   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates a
   wide assortment of hydrographic survey, oceanographic research, and
   fisheries research vessels. These vessels are operated by the Office of
   Marine and Aviation Operations. Ships located in the Pacific are
   managed by the Marine Operations Center, Pacific, (MOP) in Seattle,
   Washington. Ships located in the Atlantic are managed by the Marine
   Operations Center, Atlantic, (MOA) in Norfolk, Virginia. Logistic
   support for the vessels is provided by the appropriate marine
   operations center or, for vessels in Woods Hole, Charleston,
   Pascagoula, San Diego, and Honolulu, by Port Captains located in those
   ports.

   The ships are run by a combination of NOAA Commissioned Officers and
   wage marine civilians. The wage marine personnel include licensed
   masters, mates and engineers, and unlicensed members of the engine,
   steward, and deck departments. In addition, survey and electronic
   technicians operate and/or maintain the ship's mission, communication
   and navigation equipment. The ship's officers and crew provide mission
   support and assistance to embarked scientists from various NOAA
   laboratories as well as the academic community.

   Detailed information about our ships and support facilities can be
