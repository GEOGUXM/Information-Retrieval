                  Welcome to the wEST Working Group Website

   Discussion items will be placed on this webserver. In some cases,
   discussions will require feedback, and a bulletin board has been set up
   for this at: The Curator Bulletin Board

  Trace Files

   Available here are the raw tracefiles that come directly from the
   ABI3700 sequencer. [All of the files have been transferred and
   compressed as *.ab1.gz files; tables will be prepared to point to
   locations and library sources of the sequences; a sequence run viewer
   is being set up to present the quality of the sequencing run].

   As a test set for comparing clustering methods, a select collection of
   sequences will be chosen for developing contig assembly methods. The
   test set will include 35639 sequences currently listed in the wEST
   database. These sequences are derived from several libraries
   constructed with Chinese Spring derived tissue. These sequences are
   derived from 460 independent sequencing runs done on an ABI 3700
   sequencer [81% of the sequences from these runs made it through the
   pipeline]. It is presumed that this early set without sequence data
   from other cultivars or genomes can help prepare for the evaluation of
   these methods in future assemblies when genome complexity is introduced
   into the test set.

   Preliminary methods started with the FASTA formatted files (without
   quality data files). The FASTA files used were previously screened with
   the PHRED program to identify the Quality Read Length (QRL) which
   essentially included stretches of DNA that had PHRED Score values above
   20. The sequence outside of the QRL was trimmed using the SWEEP1 PERL
   script. The resulting sequences were then marked-up using the
   CROSS_MATCH program which identified vector sequence to be removed
   using the SWEEP2 PERL script. The resulting files were composed of the
   QRL minus vector identified regions (there were occasional misses by
   the CROSS_MATCH program).
