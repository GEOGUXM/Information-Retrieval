   StarLight's technologies will enable future spacecraft to detect
   Earth-sized planets around other stars.

   StarLight's two small telescopes can achieve the resolution of a
   telescope mirror 125 meters (137 yards) in diameter--wider than a
   football field is long!

   StarLight's formation flying technologies will control the distance
   between the two spacecraft to within less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch)
   and the angle (bearing) to within 3 arc minutes (873 Âµradians).
