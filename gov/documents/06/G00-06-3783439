                               Mission Statement

   STATUTE LAW COMMITTEE OFFICE OF THE CODE REVISER

   Chapters 1.08, 29.79, 34.05, 34.08, 44.20 RCW

  I. Agency Purposes and Goals

       A.
       The primary responsibilities of the Statute Law Committee and the
       Code Reviser are to periodically codify, index, and publish the
       Revised Code of Washington and to revise, correct, and harmonize
       the statutes by means of administrative or suggested legislative
       action as may be appropriate.
       B. Bill Drafting Services
       The Code Reviser's Office is also the official bill drafting arm of
       the legislature and provides a central bill drafting service for
       legislators, legislators-elect, legislative committees, joint
       committees, the governor, state elected officials, and agencies.
       Others, including lobbyists and private citizens must first obtain
       authorization from a legislator to use his or her name. Written
       authorization is preferred, but oral direction is agreeable.
            1. Nonpartisan
            The drafting attorneys proceed on a strictly nonpartisan basis
            and serve all regardless of party affiliation, seniority, or
            any other factor. Requests will be processed in the order
            received and as rapidly as careful workmanship will permit.
            2. Confidential
            The attorneys and our support staff keep all bill drafting
            work strictly confidential. Your request will not be disclosed
            or your draft given to any person except as you may authorize.
            Requests for any information about a specific bill which has
            been introduced will be referred to your office.
            3. The Drafting Process
            Your requests may be communicated in person, by mail, or by
            telephone. Requests will be received by any drafting attorney
            in the Code Reviser's Office, situated on the ground floor in
            the southwest corner of the legislative building. When
            submitting requests it is helpful to receive as much pertinent
            information as possible. Committee research analysts may be
            able to assist you in obtaining preliminary information. A
            complete, detailed, and specific explanation and purpose of
            your proposal, will expedite a more professional bill draft.
            Our attorneys will put your ideas into proper form and will
            assure you of technical accuracy. We will not comment on a
            proposal's desirability as a matter of public policy. We will
            use our legal knowledge and drafting skills to express your
            proposal in writing as clearly as possible, so as to achieve
            your objective and avoid constitutional conflicts.
            After receiving and recording a request, we will formulate the
            bill draft. You will be contacted by telephone if policy
            questions arise.
            All bills must be adapted to existing statutes. If a statute
            exists on the subject, new legislation must amend or repeal
            existing laws. If no statute exists, the new legislation must
            create a provision which fits into the existing statutes. The
            draft must also be made to conform to overriding provisions of
            the state and federal Constitutions, federal law, regulations
            of federal agencies, if any, and court cases which interpret
            them. When the draft is completed a sponsor sheet will be
            attached and your office notified. You are encouraged to study
            it carefully and bring it back for revisions before placing it
            in the hopper.
            C. Immediately following each session of the Legislature, the
            Committee indexes and publishes the temporary edition of the
            session laws and subsequently publishes the permanent edition.
            The Committee also responds to citizens' requests for copies
            of recently enacted laws, and reviews all initiative proposals
            prior to their being filed with the Secretary of State.
            D. The Committee administers the Administrative Procedure Act
            with respect to notice of hearings and the proposal and final
            adoption of rules. The Committee acts as official repository
            for the rules of the various state agencies and the
            institutions of higher learning, and publishes the Washington
            Administrative Code. The Committee publishes the Legislative
            Digest and History of Bills. The Committee also publishes on a
            twice monthly basis, the Washington State Register which
            contains proposed agency rules, adopted rules, executive
            orders, agency public meeting notices, and Supreme Court
            rules.
            E. The Committee utilizes substantial computer support
            services provided by the Legislative Service Center and
            provides committee data bases for access by the Public
            Printer's photocomposition operation and for automated legal
            research services.
            F. The Statute Law Committee Publications Account consists of
            proceeds from the sale of our major legal publications,
            including the RCW, WAC, Washington State Register, and Session
            Laws. These publications are edited and published by the
            Statute Law Committee, printed by the Public Printer, or
            private printer subject to bid. The RCW is distributed on a
            contract basis by a publishing company and the other
            publications are distributed by our staff. The material is
            sold on the basis of returning to the state the actual cost of
            printing and distribution. Editorial cost is considered a
            governmental expense.
            G. The Committee consists of twelve attorneys. Five are
            appointed by the Washington State Bar Association, two each by
            the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, and one each by the
            Governor, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the
            Speaker of the House. The Committee employs a Code Reviser who
            serves as its secretary. The Reviser's staff consists of bill
            drafting attorneys, editorial assistants, data entry
            operators, proof readers, and other support personnel.
       II. Objectives
       The objectives of the Committee are to provide high quality
       services in a professional and strictly nonpartisan and cost
       effective manner. The Committee seeks to foster professionalism and
       expertise which will result in highly accurate publication of laws
       and agency rules.
