   Chad T. Olinger, Group Leader
   Richard B. Strittmatter, Acting Deputy Group Leader

   NIS-7 performs applied research and development to solve problems of
   national security interest in domestic/international safeguards,
   nonproliferation, and arms control.

   NIS-7 engages in nonproliferation systems studies and policy analysis,
   develops information analysis algorithms and software, and develops
   information management systems. Core capabilities include knowledge of
   nuclear material process chemistry, policy analysis, facility
   operations, destructive and nondestructive measurement methods, systems
   analysis, simulation, modeling, computer-assisted data analysis
   (including statistics, machine learning, and anomaly detection), and
   software development using object-oriented approaches and client/server
   architectures with a focus on Web-based applications.
