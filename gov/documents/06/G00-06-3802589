                   Seawinds on QuikScat Daily Wind Report

                               [waveline.gif]

    Welcome to the QuikScat Daily Wind Report Homepage. The goal of this
   effort is to process the QuikScat winds in near real-time (within hours
   after data acquisition) and make the wind information available to the
   general public in the form of QuickTime® movies, Gif® and Jpeg images.

   If you have any problem viewing any of the elements of this page,
   please see our prerequisites page.

   Warning! The images, animations and data on this page are provided on a
   best effort basis only and may experience occasional gaps, outages and
   errors.
   Please see our ... DISCLAIMER... for more information.

   We also maintain a status page where we post messages on the current
   status of this page as well as upcoming events that may affect
   processing.

Upcoming Events

   I had to delay the upgrade for a week.

   During the week of Jan 28 2002, I will upgrading the hardware and/or
   software of both the processing machine and the webserver. While the
   processing machine is being upgraded no new products will be made, so
   the webpage will be stagnant for that time. Also the data will be
   unavailable.

   While the web server is being upgraded, the website will be down.

   My hope is to upgrade the processing machine on Jan 28 and the
   webserver on 29th or the 30th. I hope it won't take more than a day
   each, but you never know.

   [const.gif] This site in under construction. We will be adding new
   features in the future.

Automated Tropical Storm Images

   I've developed software which makes closeup overlays of winds on cloud
   imagery for any tropical depression (and up) in the Pacific and
   Atlantic oceans. At the moment, I only do north Atlantic, north-east
   Pacific (goes 8 and 10 respectively). The coverage for the western
   Pacific is better, running to +/- 60 latitude. This product is the
   tropical storms page! Please be patient, this page has many pictures on
   it and can take some time to load.

Other Special Attractions

   Here we will present special attractions, images of current storms and
   other interesting wind phenomena. These images and animations are made
   by hand as occaion permits, and are available on our Special
   Attractions page!

The Data

   For those in the community who wish to use this Near Real Time data,
   please see our FTP site. Please see disclaimer for caveats. Example
   programs (C and IDL) for reading the data are in subdirectories of the
   readers directory. And see the Data portion of the details page for
   some small discussion of the data.

                               [waveline.gif]

Animations

   We have the following animations Each has been made with the prior 14
   hours of data, although at different times. Generally the 'created'
   time will be shortly, usually minutes, after the movie was made, but
   may be up to several hours if there's been some snafu in the
   processing. In this series the background colors represent wind speed,
   blues are low speed, the moving arrows show the wind directions. (You
   will need the QuickTime Player with the Cinepak Codec to view this
   movie. For PCs, both Windows and Macintosh, it's available for free
   from Apple , for others, check the Xanim homepage.)

   For more details, see the animation portion of the details page.

   Here are images of the latest wind data overlaid on Goes IR4 imagery.
   In these pictures the color of the arrows represents the wind speed,
   with blue the lowest windspeed and magenta the highest. We are
   experimenting with a rain flag which are represented in black.

   For more details, see the Overlays portion of the details page.
