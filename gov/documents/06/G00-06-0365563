        The Office of University Programs oversees activities and programs
   at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) designed to maintain and broaden
   the Center's interaction with the university community. Special
   attention is directed to local colleges and universities along the
   northern and eastern seaboard and aerospace-oriented institutions
   nationwide having programs of mutual interest to Goddard.

           The Office manages NASA-wide fellowships and grants programs at
   GSFC, provides programmatic support for other university-related
   programs, within the various laboratories at GSFC, and develops new
   programs to enhance the GSFC research and development missions through
   increased contact with the university community. NASA's programs deal
   with students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, faculty
   members, researchers, and in some cases, the teachers of teachers. In
   addition the Office serves as a point of contact for college and
   university faculty and students interested in exploring and developing
   cooperative relationships with GSFC. Special attention is paid to
   cultural diversity
