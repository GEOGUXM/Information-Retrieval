   DSHS rewrites state rules and closes loophole that let some qualify
   unfairly for Medicaid

   The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) in May amended the

   the spirit of Medicaid, which is a state-federal partnership that
   protects the most vulnerable citizens who can't afford the cost of
   their own care," said Dennis Braddock, Secretary of DSHS.

   "We all have a responsibility, as neighbors and community members, to
   look out for one another and help keep each other safe. Preventing
