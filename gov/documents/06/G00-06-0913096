          The Center...

     NOAA Fisheries emblem The Northeast Fisheries Science Center is the
     research arm of NOAA Fisheries in the region. The Center plans,
     develops, and manages a multidisciplinary program of basic and
     applied research to: (1) better understand living marine resources
     of the Northeast Continental Shelf Ecosystem from the Gulf of Maine
     to Cape Hatteras, and the habitat quality essential for their
     existence and continued productivity; and (2) describe and provide
     to management, industry, and the public, options for the
     conservation and utilization of living marine resources, and for the
     restoration and maintenance of marine environmental quality.

     The functions are carried out through the coordinated efforts of
     research facilities located in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
     Connecticut, New Jersey, and Washington, DC.
