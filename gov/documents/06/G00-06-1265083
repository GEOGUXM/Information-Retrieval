           Welcome to Group T-4 at Los Alamos National Laboratory

   T-4 members develop methods for and do computer calculations of atomic
   structure, scattering cross sections, opacities, exotic atoms, and
   quantum and nonlinear optics, including effects of high energy density
   environments and interaction with strong external electromagnetic
   fields.
