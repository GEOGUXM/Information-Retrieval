   California On-Line Directory

   The California On-Line Directory is a service provided by the
   Telecommunications Division of the Department of General Services. The
   On-Line Directory is designed to improve access to government
   information and services for state employees, local government and the
   general public. The directory services will include 'White Pages,'
   'Yellow Pages,' and State Government Organization Charts, as well as a
   keyword search.

   The 'White Pages' provide a search function for telephone numbers and
   Internet addresses of state agency employees (as determined for
   inclusion by each agency). Information agents are available to assist
   you at (916) 657-9900.

   This Directory is a work in progress. The services implemented so far
   are:
    The 'Yellow Pages,' a locator function for each state agency,
       displaying its organizational structure and pertinent contact
       information.
        State of California Organizational Charts, depicting the structure
       of California State Government, its agencies, boards and
       commissions.
        Keyword Search, a tool to use familiar words to locate related
       state agencies, e.g., Driver License = Department of Motor Vehicles
       etc.
