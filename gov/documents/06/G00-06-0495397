   What is Sage-ST?

   In this fast paced world of technological change organizations must use
   any and all of the tools at their disposal to solve their problems, and
   assure the competitiveness of the organization.  Sage-ST is a set of
   application development tools that supports teams of engineers working
   in a multi-tool/multi-vendor enterprise automation environment.  At its
   core, Sage-ST is an integration technology, called Visual Sequence
   Object Technology (VSOT), that empowers engineers by providing them
   with a development environment capable of utilizing any and all of the
   myriad enabling technologies available in modern computing
   environments.  In addition to its integration core, Sage-ST includes a
   set of reusable feature rich, high quality and time tested standard
   application development objects (SADO), which includes state-of-the-art
   distributed object technology called "N-tier Technology," with which
   engineers can build world-class applications.  Finally, the Sage-ST
   product team, realizing that Sage-ST is not THE "silver bullet" but
   another "silver bullet", specifically designed VSOT to allow the easy
   integration of application components built using, or purchased from,
   other development resources.  Simply stated, Sage-ST is a tool set
   developed, used, maintained and supported by a team of real software
   engineers that will empower your organization to focus the "silver
   bullets" you choose on the targets of your choice.
   Sage-ST's VSOT allows engineers to create, maintain and reuse
   application sequence objects, which represent architectural and design
   decisions, from within a visual graphics-based editing environment.  A
   sequence is a container object that holds both other application
   objects, including other sequences, and the aggregate behavior of those
   objects, called sequencing information.  Using VSOT, engineers are
   forever liberated from the costly and error prone activities of
   documenting, generating and maintaining the "glue code" that defines
   the aggregate behavior of their system's objects.  VSOT empowers
   engineering teams by allowing them to deal with the
   high-level-of-abstraction characteristics of their applications at the
   high level, and in so doing provides them with the opportunity to
   define, communicate, understand and maintain the architecture of their
   applications.  VSOT is a breakthrough object integration technology
   that, when combined with a powerful set of reusable application
   development objects, will allow your software engineering teams operate
   at heretofore unheard of levels of effectiveness.
   Sage-ST's SADO application development objects are a set of
   understandable, useful, usable and reusable components that can be
   incorporated into Sage-ST applications.  Although the SADO is a
   world-class product in its own right, its important to note that VSOT
   does not require the exclusive use of SADO; in fact SADO and VSOT are
   specifically designed to encourage developers to use the best
   components available, from whatever source, to meet their application
   needs.  The SADO includes objects that support open standards-based
   interoperation with other system components including standard
   executables, ODBC data sources, OLE Automation Servers/Controllers and
   ActiveX controls.  Also included is the MultSage object which makes the
   state-of-the-art distributed object capabilities of our "N-tier"
   technology easily accessible to application development engineers.
   Finally, there are many other object classes provided by the SADO, 65
   and growing, including scientific/engineering graphics, relational data
   manager with SQL interface, textual data base with phrase searching,
   GUI components, and a wide variety of lower-level of abstraction
   classes.

   Our Mission

   The mission of the Sage-ST product team is to provide a set of tools
   with which Ada application developers can produce state-of-the-art
   systems while taking advantage of the good software engineering
   practices designed into the Ada language, and, through reuse,
   leveraging off of the efforts and experiences of our team members and
   others in the Sage-ST development community.

   Profile

   The Sage-ST product team is a group of approximately thirty engineers
   and support personnel located in Idaho Falls, Idaho at the facilities
   of the United States Department of Energy's Idaho National Engineering
   and Environmental Laboratory. All members of the team are employed by
   Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC that holds the contract for the operation of
   the laboratory.

   For over a decade now, the Sage-ST product team has provided Sage-ST to
   organizations throughout the world, including the United States
   government, industry, and academic institutions. By forming strong
   relationships with our customers, listening to what they have to say,
   keeping up with the state-of-the-art in computer systems technology,
   and maintaining an open mind about what features should be incorporated
   into Sage-ST, we have managed to provide our customers with a tool set
   that is useful, usable and understandable, while at the same time
   remaining vital and dynamic.

   Hundreds of systems, representing millions of lines of Ada source code,
   have been developed using Sage-ST as their foundation. Several of these
   systems have won government as well as industrial awards. Sage-ST
   relies on and contributes to the solid software engineering base upon
   which the Ada language was designed.
