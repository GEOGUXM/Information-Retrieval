   Treasury Contractor Profile Database
   Treasury has established this automated contractor profile database
   where current and prospective vendors can register once for access to
   all Treasury bureau procurement offices. This database eliminates the
   need for vendors to file a separate Standard Form (SF) 129,
   Solicitation Mailing List Application, with each Treasury bureau
   procurement office and replaces Treasury's previous database that was
   accessed via modem or diskette.
   The registration form should be viewed as a marketing tool, and not as
   a guarantee for receiving solicitations or contract awards. Questions
   may be referred to Mary Ellen Dorsey by email or by phone at (202)
   622-0374.

                                   [1.a26?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif]

   In order to register you must have your DUNS number
   and know the SIC CODES for your company.
