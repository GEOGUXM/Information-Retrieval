Project Description:

     * Display 3-Dimensional (D3D) is part of the WFO-Advanced system
       development aimed at providing an advanced operational workstation
       to operational forecasters. It allows users to view model output
       and real-time meteorological data in a three-dimensional
       interactive display.
     * One of the values of 3D for forecasting is that it is a rapid
       method to assimilate a large amount of model output and analysis
       data, and understand how the features vary with height.
     * The core visualization software of D3D is Vis5d from the University
       of Wisconsin.
     * CSU/ CIRA employee contribution to WFO-Advanced D3D
