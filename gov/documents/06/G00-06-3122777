        We are currently involved in several projects here at the Genomics
   Group. Our main goal is to improve methods for sequencing large scale
   projects. To this end we have developed a number of plasmids which are
   useful for generating nested deletion clones. The advantage of being
   able to generate nested deletions is that these subclones can be
   ordered by size, giving us a framework to align our sequences. The
   sequences generated can be aligned based on the expected order. The
   ability of ordering sequences based on the sizing information allows
   researchers to rapidly sequence and align fairly large blocks of
   sequence. We are using this ability to sequence through difficult,
   highly repetitive regions of the human genome, and for rapidly
   finishing those regions of interest in the bacteria we are sequencing.
