   Overview

   One of the most important ecological issues concerning our planet is
   climate change. It is generally agreed that the Earth's climate will
   modify in response to radiative forcing induced by changes in
   atmospheric trace gases, cloud cover, cloud type, solar radiation, and
   tropospheric aerosols (liquid or solid particles suspended in the air).
   In order to develop conceptual and predictive global climate models, it
   is vital to monitor these properties. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument, launched on 18 December 1999
   onboard the Terra Platform, is uniquely designed (wide spectral range,
   high spatial resolution, and near daily global coverage) to observe and
   monitor these and other Earth changes. (MORE)

     Aerosol pollution over India and Bangladesh    (4 December 2001)
   Click to visit the Visible Earth site The skies over Northern India are
   filled with a thick soup of aerosol particles along the southern edge
   of the Himalayan Mountains, and streaming southward over Bangladesh and
   the Bay of Bengal. Note that the air over the Tibetan Plateau to the
   north of the Himalayas is very clear, whereas the view of the land
   surface south of the mountains is obstructed by the brownish haze. Most
   of this air pollution comes from human activities. The aerosol over
   this region is notoriously heavy in sulfates, nitrates, organic and
   black carbon, and fly ash. These particles not only represent a health
   hazard to people living in the region, but scientists have also found
   they have a significant impact on the region's hydrological cycle and
   climate. Image by Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Land Rapid Response Team,
   NASA GSFC. Write-up from the Visible Earth web site.

   Cloud Effective Radius - Combined Cloud Phase    (18 September 2001)
   Sample L3 MODIS Image -- Click for a full-resolution version
   This image was created by combining Cloud Effective Radius retrievals
   derived for water-phase, ice-phase, and undetermined-phase clouds.
   Synoptic scale storms and fronts are clearly visible, characterized by
   comma-shaped patterns. Image by Eric Moody.

   Cloud Optical Thickness - Combined Cloud Phase    (April 2001)
   Cloud Optical Thickness - click to visit Earth Observatory page
   This false-color image shows a one-month composite of cloud optical
   thickness averaged globally for April 2001. Optical thickness is a
   measure of how much solar radiation is not allowed to travel through a
   column of atmosphere. Areas colored red and yellow indicate very cloudy
   skies, on average, while areas colored green and light blue show
   moderately cloudy skies. Dark blue regions show where there is little
   or no cloud cover. This data product is an important new tool for
   helping scientists understand the roles clouds play in our global
   climate system.
