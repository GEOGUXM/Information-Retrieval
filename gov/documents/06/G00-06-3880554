   The Energy & Environment Directorate (E&E) at Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory is an organization that combines the strengths and
   capabilities of the former Energy Programs and Earth and Environmental
   Sciences Directorates. The organization addresses enduring national
   needs in the areas of energy and the environment and provides
   discipline support in earth and atmospheric sciences to other major
   Laboratory programs.

   E&E work is concentrated into four theme areas:
     Nuclear Materials (developing nuclear materials stewardship
       strategies that span the breadth of the nuclear fuel cycle, with an
       emphasis on geologic repositories).

     Energy, Carbon, and Climate (performing basic and applied research in
       global climate change, and developing carbon management strategies
       and advanced energy technologies).

     Environmental Risk Reduction (analyzing the movement, transformation,
       and impact of hazardous chemicals and radionuclides in the
       environment; remediating and reducing environmental hazards).

     Geoscience Expertise and Capabilities for National Security
       (nonproliferation, stockpile stewardship, radionuclide effects...).

   The directorate draws upon the broad multidisciplinary capabilities and
   unique research facilities available at LLNL and has approximately 400
   employees and an annual budget of about $100 million. The Energy &
   Environment Directorate collaborates with national and regional
   governmental organizations, with industry, and with academia.
