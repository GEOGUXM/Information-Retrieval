    Disclaimer (i.e. the fine print): though many of these textures have
   been stitched together directly from multispectral images taken by NASA
    spacecraft, they should not be used for scientific analysis. Many of
     these images have blank spots where no images have been taken; some
   have also been enhanced and slightly altered for aesthetic appeal. For
     some bodies, no global maps are available at this site yet; some we
     just haven't explored enough to get any reasonably high resolution
   images (like Pluto). Maps of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune,
        and Uranus) and Titan are merely meant to be representative;
        atmospheric dynamics will change the body's appearance daily.
