Bioassay and Internal Dosimetry Users Group (BIDUG)

                            fancy horizontal bar

   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) , Office of Worker Protection
   Programs and Hazards Management (EH-52) sponsors the Bioassay and
   Internal Dosimetry Users Group (BIDUG, pronounced BYE-dug) as a vehicle
   for communication and coordination among DOE facilities and DOE
   contractors. BIDUG is part of the Environment, Safety, and Health
   Systems product line at PNNL  Check out the DOELAP Accreditation User
   Forum at the above link.

Bidug News

   November 5, 2001: Dan Strom and Jay MacLellan published Evaluation of
   Eight Decision Rules for Low-Level Radioactivity Counting. an article
   in Health Physics that documents serious difficulties with Currie's
   formula for decision level as presented in NUREG/CR4001 and in his
   original 1968 paper in Analytical Chemistry.

   July 27, 2001: Workshop on Internal Dosimetry of Radionuclides,
   sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and the European Commission,
   September 912, 2002, New College, Oxford, United Kingdom.

   November 10, 2000: Jay MacLellan's abstract and presentation to the
   BAER conference is posted here.

   September 6, 2000: ABHP Course materials by Tom La Bone are now
   available. The BIDUG web site is pleased to host Tom's 142 pge document
   describing the New ICRP Rispiratory Tract and Systemic Models. Also
   available for downloading are Appendices 1, 2, 3, and 6: lungdep66.pas
   , a Pascal program with three supporting MathCad files: ,
   pu239sDecays.mcd , functions.mcd , and iodine.mcd

   April 21, 2000: The Hanford Internal Dosimetry Program is pleased to
   announce that the two manuals which most of its technical basis
   documentation are now available on the worldwide web and can be viewed
   or downloaded in an Adobe.pdf format. The manuals and their addresses
   are: Methods and Models of the Hanford Internal Dosimetry Program,
   PNNL-MA-860 (January 2000) and Hanford Internal Dosimetry Project
   Manual, PNL-MA-552 (1997) It is the intent of the Hanford Internal
   Dosimetry Program to maintain these websites as the electronic
   controlled copy version of these manuals.

   January 13, 2000: the Inspector General has recommended consolidation
   of DOE in-vitro bioassay analysis under one nation wide contract as a
   cost saving measure. BIDUG members are urged to participate on a
   committee to help formulate technical requirements of such a contract.

   An inconsequential Y2K bug in report headers printed by CINDY has been
   reported. The dose computations are not effected. Canberra is aware of
   the problem and may post information at http://www.canberra.com/ The
   Radiation Information Network at Idaho State University proivides a

   MacLellan, J.A.; Strom, D.J. Traditional Formulas For Decision Level
   Are Wrong For Small Numbers of Counts PNNL-SA-32146. Proceedings of the
   45th Annual Conference on Bioassay, Analytical, and Environmental
   Radiochemistry, October 18-22, Gaithersburg, MD. Bioassay, Analytical,
   and Environmental Radiochemistry Conference 45; 1999. New Work; more
   detail.

   Traditional Formulas For Decision Level Are Wrong For Small Numbers of
   Counts A 10 minute platform paper presented at the Health Physics
   Society (HPS) Annual Meeting on June 30, 1999 in Philadelphia.

   "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics," Professional Enrichment Program
   Th-2 (Revised and Corrected 7/2/99), contains all materials from
   "Traditional Formulas For Decision Level Are Wrong For Small Numbers of
   Counts" [above] with much additional material. Presented as a 2-hour
   PEP Lecture at the Philadephia HPS meeting.

   On October 27-28, 1998, EH-52 sponsored a Bioassay/Internal Dosimetry
   Workshop in Gathersburg, MD.

   On April 3, 1998, the Energy Facility Contractors Group (EFCOG)
   Executive Committee fully endorsed the idea of creating a users group
   for internal dosimetry and radiobioassay and indicated that their
   respective organizations would fully support participation.  BIDUG was
   sanctioned at the May, 1998 meeting of the Radiological Protection
   Working Group (RPWG) chaired by Joe Graf of Los Alamos National
   Laboratory.  Formal organization of BIDUG is underway, including a
   charter and operating procedures.

                            fancy horizontal bar

   The consensus of EFCOG members was that one should:

              Never compare data with minimum detectable amount

                               (MDA = L[D])*;

            Do report less than DL   Do not report less than MDA

               Compare data with decision level (DL = L[C])*.

   * ANSI/HPS N13.30-1996, Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay, equates
   MDA with Currie's (1968) detection level, L[D], and DL with curries
   critical level, L[C].  Some Bayesian statisticians have argued that
   these equations are not true, since, for example, one may have a
   decision level that differs from Currie's L[C].  There was consensus on
   what constituted correct use of DL and MDA, as shown above. Figure
   adapted from Rick Brake of Los Alamos National Laboratory.

     * EFCOG attendees identified more than 20 Issues related to
       radiobioassay and internal dosimetry that need further work.
