   USDA to Reclassify IT Employees
   by June 2002
   OPM has issued a new classification standard, Administrative Work in
   the Information Technology Group, GS-2210. This new standard replaces
   OPM's standard for the GS-334 computer specialist series. It is the
   first major change to the IT job classification standard in 10 years
   and is a significant improvement over the old job standard. USDA is
   scheduled to reclassify all of its IT employees to the new standard by
   June 2002.
   To view the IT job classification standard.
   On October 30, 2001 OHRM and OCIO sponsored training on the new
   standard for the Departments HR and IT employees.
