   The Network for the Detection for Stratospheric Change (NDSC) is a set
   of high-quality remote-sounding research stations for observing and
   understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere.
   Ozone and key ozone-related chemical compounds and parameters are
   targeted for measurement. The NDSC is a major component of the
   international upper atmosphere research effort and has been endorsed by
   national and international scientific agencies, including the
   International Ozone Commission, the United Nations Environment
   Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

   Following five years of planning, instrument design and implementation,
   the NDSC began network operations in January 1991.
