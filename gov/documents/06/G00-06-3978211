   [montana_sm.gif] The need exists for information on the occurrence of
   fires on the land surface, since fire changes the surface cover type
   and releases gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere,
   affecting ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry. Fire is also a hazard
   and satellite derived fire information can be used for improved fire
   and forest management. Identification of active volcanoes is also
   important because of the geophysical consequences they have on the
   Earth's atmosphere, including ozone destruction and the lowering of the
   global temperature.
   The MODIS fire and thermal anomalies product (MOD14, MOD40) contains
   information unique to understanding the timing and distribution of
   fires and characteristics such as the energy emitted from the fire and
   is available for both day and night periods. Temporal composites
   include an eight-day and monthly day and night fire occurrence
   aggregation and a summary of the number of fires in classes related to
   the strength of the fire.
   The MODIS Fire products will provide an important contribution to the
   NASA Land Use and Land Cover Program and the International Global
   Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC) Project.
