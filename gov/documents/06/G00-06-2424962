Mathematical Software Cross Index

   Search for software according to
     * what problem it solves.
     * package name.
     * module name.
     * text in module abstracts.

   Go straight to the problem decision tree.

   Try HotGAMS, a Java interface to GAMS with additional search features.

   If you cannot find what you need in the cross index, you might try some
   of these other sources of information about mathematical software.
