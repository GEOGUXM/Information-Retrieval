  The OCD Intranet's Permanent Home

   The OCD Intranet, a place where USDA Rural Development staff can get
   information to help them conduct community development outreach, has
   moved to its permanent home. That site is http://ocdi.usda.gov. Please
   bookmark your browser for this site, which we hope you will want to use
   often.
