   The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS -- formerly the Soil
   Conservation Service) is an agency of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture. For six decades, we have worked cooperatively with
   landowners, conservation districts, federal, state, and local
   governments, and citizens from urban and rural communities to restore
   and enhance the landscape. NRCS resource conservationists, soil
   scientists, agronomists, biologists, engineers, planners, and other
   specialists promote land stewardship by providing technical assistance
   through teams to address surface and ground water quality; wetlands,
   riparian areas, and biodiversity; and impacts of landuse changes. NRCS
   teams work on all of Connecticut's landscapes; agricultural, wetlands,
   and riparian areas, suburban, rural, urban centers, and forested.
