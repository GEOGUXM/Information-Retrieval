   gamma-ray burst

            "Local" Gamma-Ray Bursts Are Newest Pieces of Puzzle
   Don't look now, but some gamma-ray bursts may be closer than you think.
     Although scientists have believed for some time that most gamma-ray
     bursts originate from the farthest reaches of the Universe, a NASA
      Goddard scientist has discovered about 100 of them that are quite
             "local," within 325 million light years from Earth.

                   Featured Scientist: Dr. Caroline Stahle
      Dr. Caroline Stahle has always enjoyed solving puzzles. Now, as a
    member of NASA's Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, she builds
    very small devices which help us study some of the largest things in
                                the Universe.

                              Special Exhibit:
                        Taking Black Holes for a Spin
   Our Latest Feature Presentation - No one doubts that black holes should
   rotate the same way stars and planets do. But until careful analysis of
    data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, such evidence was elusive.
   The videos in this feature illustrate the properties of rotating black
                holes which were used to find this evidence.

      everything from the basics of light and electromagnetism, to dark
   matter and black holes. Or if you are a more advanced student, you can
