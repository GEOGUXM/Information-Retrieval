   LET Calcs
   Radiation Effects Testing and Calibration
   This facility is available for the study of space radiation effects, in
   particular, Single Event Upset ( SEU ) Testing and Spacecraft
   Instrument Calibration. We can provide ion beams for more than 50 ion
   species at a wide range of energies and intensities. Our capabilities
   range from 29 MeV protons to 385 MeV uranium. See our run calendar for
   times when the facility is available. To get more information about our
   capabilities and services, use the more info fill-in form. Registered
   users with existing accounts can reserve beam time using the time
   request fill-in form.

   Our facility is frequently upgraded and improved in response to
   suggestions from our user community. Checkout the latest SEU Facility
   Improvements. If you have any suggestions about how we can improve our
   services, please let us know how we can assist you to make your
   experience at the TVDG more pleasant and rewarding.

   Listed below are several examples of the type of work that is done at
   the SEU Test Facility.
     * See a graph of LET vs Energy in Silicon for some of the available
       TVDG ions.
     * See a graph of Range vs Surface LET for some of the available TVDG
       ions.
     * See a graph of Cross Section vs LET for a typical SEU run.
     * Perform LET Calculations with user-specified targets, ions and
       energies.

   Have you got questions? We have answers. See our SEU FAQ (Frequently
   Asked Questions) page for information about the SEU hardware and
   software.

   Download the SEU Test Facility Manual. The manual is in Windows Help
   File Format and is compressed for faster downloading. The file is about
   800K in size. Click Here to download. (Requires WinZip to unzip)

   Our facility is also available for other ion-beam related applications.
   You may contact us to discuss the requirements for your project or
   product. We will be happy to provide you with any development
   assistance you may need. You can arrange to discuss your project with a
   member of our staff of engineers and scientists who have an extensive
   background in ion irradiation and implantation. We can help you with
   every stage of development from concept to working system.

   Heavy Ion Research Logo

   RHIC
   Heavy Ion Research
   Nuclear physics started at this facility in 1970. Since 1986 one of the
   accelerators (MP-7) serves as the heavy ion injector for the Brookhaven
   synchrotrons (AGS Booster, AGS , and eventually for RHIC - the
   Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider). The synchrotrons are host to a number
   of nuclear physics and heavy ion experiments at relativistic energies
   such as: E864, E877, E910.

   Experiment E898 is a collaboration of groups from NASA and BNL to study
   the effects of relativistic heavy ions on cells and animals. This
   radiobiology research program is related to the investigation of space
   radiation on humans and is particularly important for the planning of
   future long-term deep space flights.

   About Us
   The BNL Tandem Van de Graaff (TVDG) Facility consists of two model MP
   (MP-6 and MP-7) electrostatic accelerators, their associated beam
   transport lines, experimental areas and test facilities. The TVDG
   complex was originally constructed by High Voltage Engineering
   Corporation (HVEC) in the mid 1960s and has undergone upgrades and
   improvements ever since. HVEC was founded by Robert J. Van de Graaff.

   A major improvement was the addition of a Pelletron charging systems to
   both accelerators. This link is a nice .gif animation of the operation
   of the charging system.

   One accelerator (MP-7) has been upgraded to run at a maximum terminal
   voltage of 15.5 MV and is also capable of high intensity pulsed beam
   operation. The other accelerator, (MP-6) has had a similar upgrade and
   is currently in service providing beam for SEU users while MP-7
   delivers gold ions to RHIC. The facility is now capable of supporting
   the Booster/AGS/RHIC program and the outside user program
   simultaneously. This will allow us to run SEU and other applied
   programs year round. A layout diagram of the upgraded facility is
   available in .pdf format.

   information about our facility.

   A short biography of Robert J. Van de Graaff is now available. This is
   a chronology of his life where you can learn something about the man
   who invented the electrostatic particle accelerator.

   A very nice general reference site about Van de Graaff Generators is
   available. Some of this site is in French and some in English.
