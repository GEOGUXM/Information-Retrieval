    The Theoretical Chemistry & Molecular Physics Group at Los Alamos is
   staffed by theoretical chemists and physicists who work on projects to
     improve our understanding of the behavior of materials. Generally,
    projects in the group seek to describe how basic forces operating at
   the atomic and molecular level manifest themselves in the properties of
                     matter at more macroscopic levels.

      Current activities in T-12 include research both in gas phase and
      condensed phase phenomena. These projects apply state-of-the-art
     computational approaches for fundamental and applied studies of the
     physics and chemistry of molecules and materials. Research projects
    include the development and application of techniques for calculating
    the electronic properties of molecules, the dynamics and kinetics of
      chemical reactions, atomistic simulations of materials, molecular
    modeling of catalysts, the study of solute-solvent interactions, and
                         chemical process modeling.
