   NFIRS 5.0 is a modified and improved National Fire Incident Reporting
   System which has been designed as a tool for fire departments to report
   and maintain computerized records of fires and other fire department
   incidents in a uniformed manner. NFIRS 5.0 was developed by the United
   States Fire Administration (USFA) in partnership with the National Fire
   Information Council (NFIC).

   The New NFIRS 5.0 system, in addition to many code improvements,
   provides additional modules to meet the increasing diversity and
   demands of fire departments today. It has been designed to expand the
   collection of data beyond fires to include a full range of fire
   department activity on a national scale. Included is an expanded
   utility for users of the system at both the state and fire department
   levels. The recent addition of an Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
   module to the system along with the inclusion of Department Apparatus,
   Wildland and Personnel modules ensures greater usefulness of the
   system.

   NFIRS 5.0 will enable the Fire Service to examine trends on a local,
   state and national level. The resulting information is used to help
   reduce the needless loss of life and property by fire throughout the
   United States.
