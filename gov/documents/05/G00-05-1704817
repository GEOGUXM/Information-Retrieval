   Mail Advisory
   The delivery of first-class mail to NEH has been delayed since
   mid-October and delays are expected to continue for the foreseeable
   future. Many NEH offices have been in telephone and email contact with
   those sending mail to the Endowment in recent weeks. Postcards have
   also been sent acknowledging the receipt of grant proposals. If you are
   concerned, however, about the status of any time-sensitive mail, please
   contact the relevant individual or program to ensure your materials
   arrived. Every attempt is being made to accommodate late-arriving mail.
   Until normal mail service resumes, please consider using alternatives,
   such as email, fax, or commercial delivery services. We appreciate your
   patience.
