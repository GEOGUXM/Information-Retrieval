   Our Mission



   Since its formation in 1941, Civil Air Patrol ("CAP") has been
   dedicated to serving its local community, state and nation.  Today, CAP
   supports three primary missions for both its Senior Members (adult
   members) and  Cadets (youth aged 11 to 18 years old):

   bullet

          Cadet Programs - focuses on developing the leadership skill of our
          Cadet members through hands on experience and training.
   bullet

          Aerospace Education - educates both CAP members and the community at
          large about the importance and fun of aerospace education and flight.
   bullet

          Emergency Services - assisting our community in times of emergency,
          supporting  search and rescue efforts, disaster relief operations and
          even assistance in counter drug efforts.

      Michigan Wing is dedicated to these principles and developing the
      personal and professional capabilities of our members.
