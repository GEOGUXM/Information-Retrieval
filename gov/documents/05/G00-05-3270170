         Mission:

         Neutron research is a unique and powerful tool for studying the
         structure and dynamics of materials at the atomic, molecular, and
         macromolecular levels. Six U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories
         (Argonne, Brookhaven, Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and
         Jefferson Lab) are partners in the design and construction of the
         Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), a one-of-a-kind facility in Oak Ridge,
         Tennessee, that will provide the most intense pulsed neutron beams in
         the world for scientific research and industrial development.
         Construction of the $1.4 billion facility began in 1999 and is
         scheduled for completion in 2006. In partnership with Oak Ridge,
         Argonne has resumed responsibility for the design and construction of
         the neutron scattering instruments and installation. The Instrument
         Systems group will also develop the infrastructure for externally
         funded groups to design and construct additional instruments; expand
         the neutron scattering user community; and prepare plans for operation
         of the SNS instrument suite.

   Instruments Under Development:
     * Backscattering Spectrometer
     * Extended Q-Range Small Angle Neutron Diffractometer (EQ-SANS).
     * Magnetism (vertical surface) Reflectometer
     * Liquids (horizontal surface) Reflectometer
     * Powder Diffractometer (POW-GEN3)
     * Engineering Diffractometer (VULCAN)
     * Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer (CNCS)
     * Fermi Chopper Spectrometer (ARCS)
     * Disordered Materials Diffractometer
     * High Pressure Diffractometer (SNAP)
     * Single Crystal Diffractometer (SCD)

         Benefits:

         When completed, the SNS will enable a new generation of experimental
         studies of interest to chemists, condensed matter physicists,
         biologists, materials scientists, and engineers, in an ever-increasing
         range of applications. Argonne is an important partner for the
         development and expansion of the neutron scattering user community that
         will ultimately use the SNS. The SNS is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC,
         under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy.
