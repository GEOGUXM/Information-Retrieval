        Text Retrieval
                The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) supports research
                within the information retrieval community by providing
                the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of
                text retrieval methodologies. TREC-8 tracks were question
                answering, web retrieval, filtering, interactive
                retrieval, spoken document retrieval, query building, and
                cross language retrieval using European languages.

        Topic Detection and Tracking
                Topic Detection and Tracking refers to automatic
                techniques for finding topically related material in
                streams of data such as newswire and broadcast news.
