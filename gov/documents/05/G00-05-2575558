   America's Response to the Terrorist Attacks

   [ribbon%20date.gif] The thoughts and prayers of the Democratic Caucus
   are with all those affected by the September 11, 2001, terrorist
   assault on America. As we recover, rebuild and respond to this cowardly
   and barbaric attack, the Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- is
   working shoulder-to-shoulder with the President.

   On this website, you will find contact information for those searching
   for missing persons, grief and child counseling services, and ways to
   help the victims and recovery efforts. Additionally, you will find news
   on the work Congress is doing to support America's response to the
   terrorist attacks -- and to ensure that it never happens again.
