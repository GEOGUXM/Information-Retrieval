                        Lightning Kills, Play It Safe

   Summer is the peak season for one of the nation's deadliest weather
   phenomenalightning. Safeguarding U.S. residents from dangerous
   lightning is the goal of NOAA's new public awareness campaign"Lightning
   Kills, Play it Safe." The campaign is designed to lower lightning death
   and injury rates and America's vulnerability to one of nature's
   deadliest hazards.

   In the United States, an average of 73 people are killed each year by
   lightning. That's more than the annual number of people killed by
   tornadoes or hurricanes. Many more are struck but survive. However,
   they often report a variety of long-term, debilitating symptoms,
   including memory loss, attention deficits, sleep disorders, numbness,
   dizziness, stiffness in joints, irritability, fatigue, weakness, muscle
   spasms, depression, and an inability to sit for long.

   Lightning is a serious danger. Through this site we hope you'll learn
   more about lightning risks and how to protect yourself, your loved ones
   and your belongings. As a start, check out this link for some QUICK
   FACTS about lightning.
