     The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a proposed
   future mission, which could be launched as a free flyer before the end
     of the decade. EXIST would image the entire sky each 95 min orbit,
   detecting extremely faint high energy X-ray sources in an energy range
   that is relatively poorly explored, yet has great potential to yield a
   wealth of information. EXIST would conduct the first all-sky survey for
    obscured active galactic nuclei, which likely dominate the accretion
     power of the universe. The unparalled sensitivity, resolution, and
    energy bandwidth coverage of EXIST would make it the Next Generation
    Gamma Ray Burst Observatory. EXIST science covers many additional key
     topics, from the origin and evolution of black holes to the helping
             constrain the origin of the diffuse IR background.
     EXIST has been studied for various mission implementations, but the
     increased sensitivity and coverage needed demand a very large area,
   wide-field mission concept. EXIST was recommended by the 2000 Report of
    the Decadal Survey to carry out the high priority science for both a
   Hard X-ray Survey and a Next Generation Gamma Ray Burst mission. EXIST
     could best be implemented as a Free Flyer mission, though a backup
   implementation on the International Space Station is also possible, as
   originally recommended by the 1999 Report of the NASA Gamma-ray Program
                               Working Group.
