   The Greater Cincinnati Combined Federal Campaign reached its goal of
   collecting $1,000,000 for charity. Reaching the $1,000,000 mark is a
   milestone in the history of the Greater Cincinnati CFC it is the first
   time that amount has ever been raised.

   Mr. Thomas Pishioneri, Associate Director of the Department Of Veterans
   Affairs Medical Center has chaired the CFC drive for five years. He
   holds the national record for longest serving CFC Chairperson. Mr.
   Pishioneri expressed his gratitude to the Federal workers, "Despite
   work force reductions and a recession, Federal employees have once
   again demonstrated their generosity and concern for others in the
   community and the world.  They have continued their long history of
   reaching deep into their pockets when the need is great. I am proud to
   be associated with them."

   The Federal Executive Board thanks Tom for providing the dedication and
   leadership necessary to make this happen.
