   Measuring Ocean Winds from Space

   Wind is a key to understanding our environment. The SeaWinds missions
   provide long-term, high-resolution, ocean-surface wind data (both speed
   and direction) used for studies of ocean circulation, climate and
   air-sea interaction. These measurements are crucial to understanding
   and predicting severe weather patterns and climate changes. SeaWinds is
   a radar instrument that sends pulses to the ocean surface and measures
   the echoes called backscatter, that bounce back to the satellite.
