   In 1988, the NEXRAD Agencies established the WSR-88D Radar Operations
   Center (ROC) in Norman, Oklahoma. The ROC employees come from the
   National Weather Service, Air Force, Navy, FAA, and support
   contractors. The ROC provides centralized meteorological, software,
   maintenance, and engineering support for all WSR-88D systems. WSR-88D
   systems will be modified and enhanced during their operational life to
   meet changing requirements, technology advances, and improved
   understanding of the application of these systems to real-time weather
   operations. The ROC also operates WSR-88D test systems for the
   development of hardware and software upgrades to enhance maintenance,
   operation, and provide new functionality.
