   Water Data

USGS Water Resources of Wyoming

   The USGS provides maps, reports, and information to help others meet
   their needs to manage, develop, and protect America's water, energy,
   mineral, and land resources. We help find natural resources needed for
   tomorrow, and supply scientific understanding needed to help minimize
   or mitigate the effects of natural hazards and environmental damage
   caused by human activities. The results of our efforts touch the daily
   lives of almost every American.
