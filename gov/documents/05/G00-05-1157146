        Cesar E Chavez said, "We can choose to use our lives for others to
     bring about a better and more just world for our children. People who
         make that choice will know hardship and sacrifice... In giving of
    yourself you will discover a whole new life full of meaning and love."

     To ensure that the life, work, and values of Cesar E. Chavez continue
   to inspire all Californians, Governor Gray Davis signed into law Senate
    Bill 984 (Statutes of 2000, Chapter 213) creating the Cesar Chavez Day
                                                  of Service and Learning.

      Join Californians across the state on April 1, 2002 and discover how

       "Grant me the courage to serve others; for in service there is true
                                                  life." --Cesar E. Chavez
