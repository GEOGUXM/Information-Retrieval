   The Davis Bacon Wage Determination Database contains wage
   determinations made by the U.S. Department of Labor under the mandate
   of the Davis-Bacon Act and related legislation. The Department
   determines prevailing wage rates for construction-related occupations
   in most counties in the United States. All Federal Government
   construction contracts and most contracts for federally assisted
   construction over $2,000 must contain Davis-Bacon wage determinations.

About the Davis-Bacon Data

   You can quickly and easily locate wage determinations through the NTIS
   FedWorld On-line service and:
     * Get immediate access to the latest weekly data
     * Browse By Determinations Most Recently Changed
     * Search and find just the data you need
     * Locate A Determination by Entering a Determination Number
     * Save the time filing stacks of weekly paper updates

   The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that all Federal Government construction
   contracts and most contracts for federally-assisted construction over
   $2,000 must contain the appropriate Davis-Bacon wage determinations. By
   using the Davis-Bacon database available on FedWorld, you can be sure
   you are always using the current wage determinations and can easily
   find the ones you need by searching on:
     * wage determination number
     * state or county
     * trade
     * type of construction

About the Search and Browse

   The subscription database includes a browse feature that displays the
   most recently changed determinations with the simple click of a button.
   You can also just enter a Determination number.

   The Davis-Bacon wage determination source files are indexed into a Wide
   Area Information Server (WAIS) database. Most casual searchers should
   be able to fill out the form and get off and running pretty quick, but
   here are a few comments:
     * Fields in the form left blank are ignored;
     * In either the text block search forms, you can enter additional
       search queries, but you need to follow WAIS query rules -
       operators, including AND, OR, NOT and ADJ must be capitalized.

   More gory details about WAIS searches are
   available . This WAIS search is a full text search - this database
   doesn't have any fields and when you search, you are searching every
   bit of every record.

   Phrases must be in quotation marks (" "). The operators ADJ (adjacent),
   AND, OR and NOT can be used, but must be capital letters. For example:
   "diver tenders" OR "diver". Word roots can be searched using an
   astersik (*) following the word stem. For example: diver* will retrieve
   both diver and divers.
