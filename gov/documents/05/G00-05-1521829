      Welcome to the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) Project WWW Server
                                   Forest

   BACKGROUND INFORMATION. The Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) Project is
   concerned with modeling and monitoring ecosystem processes and patterns
   in response to natural and anthropogenic effects. The project uses
   coupled ecosystem models and remote sensing models and measurements to
   predict and observe ecosystem change. The overall objective of the FED
   project is to link and use models of forest dynamics, soil processes,
   and canopy energetics to understand how ecosystem response to change
   affects patterns and processes in northern and boreal forests and to
   assess the implications for global change. See Conceptual Diagram for
   model schematic.

   The Forest Ecosystem Dynamics World-Wide-Web server has been online
   since July 1994. The FED server was created for the dissemination of
   project information, to archive numerous spatial and scientific data
   sets, and demonstrate the linking of ecosystem and remote sensing
   models.
