   What is
   CEDR?   [dot_clear.gif] The Department of Energy (DOE) has developed
   the Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource (CEDR) Program to provide
   public access to health and exposure data concerning DOE installations.
   Most of the data are from epidemiologic studies conducted by DOE-funded
   researchers as part of the DOE Worker Health and Mortality Study. A
   current tally of Data File Sets, Data Files, Variables, and Code Sets
   is available.

   Additionally, studies of populations residing near DOE installations,
   and other studies of radiation health effects, such as classic studies
   of atomic bomb survivors and the radium dial painters, are represented
   in CEDR.

   Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project atmospheric dose
   estimates resulting from Hanford site radionuclide emissions for the
   highest release years of 1945-1951. These estimates come from the
   Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction (HEDR) study conducted for
   the U.S. Department of Energy, at the Pacific Northwest National
   Laboratories (PNNL) operated by Battelle. The study was completed in
   1994.
