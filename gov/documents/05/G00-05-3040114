   THE GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH GROUP (EES-7) provides Test
   Coordination Office (TCO) efforts related to the Yucca Mountain Site
   Characterization Project (YMP) High Level Nuclear Waste Repository
   Program. EES-7's mission is to provide a sole-source, comprehensive
   resource for concept refinement, prediction, and planning and
   implementation of underground and surface geotechnical testing. This
   objective is being implemented by EES-7 through the management
   responsibility and direct integration role for test program definition,
   detailed planning, and field implementation for all geotechnical
   testing and data acquisition for both surface-based and underground
   facilities at Yucca Mountain.

   Activities
   EES-7's current Yucca Mountain Project activities and studies consist
   of YMP thermal testing, ESF and ECRB excavation and construction,
   Surface-based drilling, and Busted Butte testing coordination.
