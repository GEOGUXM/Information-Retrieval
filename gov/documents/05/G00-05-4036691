                                MCL Overview

   The interests of the Laboratory cover a wide range of systems and
   techniques relevant to macromolecular crystallography and its
   applications. The Synchrotron Radiation Research Section, based at the
   National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory and
   headed by Dr. Zbigniew Dauter, is involved in developing new methods
   for phasing macromolecular structures by anomalous scattering,
   particularly with signals from comparatively light atoms such as
   bromine. This Section has also been involved in collaborative efforts
   with a number of groups within and outside MCL in extending the
   resolution of crystal structures to atomic levels. The principal
   interest of Dr. Xinhua Ji's Biomolecular Structure Section is the
   structure and function of biomolecular systems with anticancer and
   antimicrobial significance and the feasibility of structure-based drug
   design targeting these biomolecules. Systems under study include
   detoxification enzymes, retinoic acid-binding proteins, mono- and
   pyrophosphoryl transferases, and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Dr.
   Jacek LubkowskiÂ’s Macromolecular Assembly Structure and Cell Signaling
   Section is investigating structural basis of anti-viral and
   anti-bacterial activity of various proteins involved in intercellular
   signaling. Current studies involving a wide range of chemokines,
   defensins, and their analogs will soon be extended to chemokine
   receptors. The Protein Engineering Section, headed by Dr. David Waugh,
   focuses primarily on developing new technology for high-throughput
   protein expression and purification, and on the structural proteomics
   of virulence factors in potential agents of bioterrorism. Under the
   direction of Dr. Alexander Wlodawer, the Protein Structure Section has
   been investigating retroviral protease and integrase; proteins used as
   anticancer drugs, such as asparaginase and Onconase; a variety of other
   proteases and ribonucleases; and a number of cytokines and
   cytokine-receptor complexes.
