 The NIH Biowulf/LoBoS3 cluster is a Beowulf parallel processing system
 designed and built at the National Institutes of Health. Managed by the
        Helix Systems Staff, Biowulf/LoBoS3 consists of a main
   login/administrative node and 340 compute nodes (680 processors)
 running the Redhat Linux operating system. The computational nodes are
       interconnected by a high speed network and have access to
                high-performance NFS RAID fileservers.
