     Emerging scientific applications such as the Large Hadron Collider
     (LHC) at CERN and the Nasa EOS satellites are producing tremendous
     amounts of data. The Data Intensive Distributed Computing Research
     Group at LBNL is doing research on mechanisms and services to
     efficiently move,  select, and manage huge data sets in a
     distributed, or Data Grid environment. We are also working on tools
     for monitoring and analyzing distributed system performance, which
     we call the Distributed Monitoring Framework (DMF). These projects
     are supported by the US Department of Energy MICS office, the SciDAC
     program, and the Network Research program.

                              Current Projects:
                   Distributed Monitoring Framework (DMF)
                     Net100 Project (LBNL Net100 page )
                     Self Configuring Network Monitoring
                  The Matisse Project (DARPA NGI Project )
                               DMF Components:
        -  NetLogger Toolkit: end-to-end instrumentation and analyses
                     -  Enable Network Monitoring Service
         -  py-GMA (GGF Grid Monitoring Architecture implementation)
                 -  Sensor Management System (formerly JAMM)
                -  Network Characterization Service (pipechar)
