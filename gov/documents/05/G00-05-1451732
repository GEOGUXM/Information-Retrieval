   Los Alamos Astrophysics (LAA) is an informal organization at Los Alamos
   National Laboratory that maintains a regular colloquium series, serves
   as a clearing-house for information on astrophysical research at the
   lab, and prepares the annual astrophysics report that is published in
   the Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society each February. LAA
   also occasionally sponsors a joint meeting with the UNM Institute for
   Astronomy, usually held in Santa Fe. Officers of LAA consist of the
   Coordinator, the Deputy Coordinator, and a 15-member board. The Deputy
   Coordinator is responsible for planning the colloquium series, and the
   Coordinator for institutional relations. These officers are chosen at
   an annual meeting in December.

   THE CURRENT OFFICERS ARE:
   Coordinator: Kimberly New
   Deputy Coordinator: Luis Teodoro
   Observatory Report Coordinator: Cy Hoffman
   Committee Members: Richard Epstein, Ed Fenimore, Galen Gisler, Joyce
   Guzik, Todd Haines, Jack Hills, Cy Hoffman, Bryan Laubscher, Hui Li,
   Peregrine McGehee, John Middleditch, Warner Miller, Gus Sinnis, and
   Mike Warren.

   Los Alamos Astrophysics has given birth to the Los Alamos branch of
   INPAC, the Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics and
   Cosmology, and to Fenton Hill Observatory. The Transient Journal Club,
   focusing on the astrophysics of rapidly evolving sources has also grown
   out of LAA.

   There is an electronic mailing list associated with LAA, currently
