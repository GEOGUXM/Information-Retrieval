   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has developed a Tool Kit to help
   laboratory designers, owners, and operators design and operate high
   efficiency facilities and reduce energy costs. The Tool Kit includes
   the Design Guide for Energy-Efficient Research Laboratories - an
   Internet-based guide intended to assist in identifying and applying
   advanced energy efficiency features in laboratory environments.
