                      [ACT_groupshot01a.jpg] Welcome to
     C-ACT, the Applied Chemical Technologies Group within the Chemistry
   Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In our newly redesigned Web
     Site, we will be constantly striving to provide current and topical
    information about all research Teams within the LANL C-ACT Group. Our
   Mission at C-ACT is to develop instrumentation and methods for advanced
    chemical processing and/or manufacturing. Our latest addition to the
     site (coming this spring) will be links to video files on the LANL
                           streaming video server.

         Click the R&D100 Award Link on the Inside Pages to view an
    award-winning technology For now, you can read a brief Description of
   our Teams; meet the People who work on the Teams; find out about Honors
   and Awards bestowed on the Teams (click the R&D100 Award Link when you
    see it to read about an award-winning technology); access interactive
   Maps for finding your way to our facilities; and for those who work at
   the Lab, log in to a special password-protected area to access special
    LANL Forms. When you're ready to explore a Team in more detail, click
     its link at the top of every page. We hope you enjoy your stay, and
                            thanks for visiting!
