   Welcome to the web site for the laboratory of Dr. Mary Helen
   Barcellos-Hoff. Our primary research interest is in the protein
   Transforming Growth Factor Beta. TGF-b is secreted as a latent complex
   that can be activated extracelluarly. TGF-b responses of mammary
   epithelial cells appears to be cessation of growth and production of
   differentiated products, based on studies of cultured cells. However
   several additional roles have been proposed that include induction of
   apoptosis and control of morphogenesis. Currently our understanding of
   TGF-b activity during mammary gland growth and development is limited,
   in part due to the lack of reagents that discriminate between the
   active and latent forms in situ. We have recently identified a set of
   antibodies that differentially localize active and latent TGF-b in
   situ. Fluorescence detection of these antibodies in conjunction with
   digital imaging has revealed notable heterogeneity of TGF-b activation
   among murine mammary epithelial cells.
