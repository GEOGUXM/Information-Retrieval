Extending the Legacy of Global Land Observation
                       __________________________________________________________________

Welcome the the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) website! This
site is intended to be a resource for the global remote sensing
community for information related to the LDCM mission.

The Landsat program has a long history of providing satellite remote
sensing information to the world, over 28 years. The first seven
Landsat spacecraft have collected the longest continuous space-based
remote sensing dataset in the world. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are working
together on the next mission in the Landsat series, called the LDCM.

NASA and the USGS are proceeding with a two-step procurement to
accomplish the delivery of Landsat continuity data to the U.S.
Government. The timeline shown below represents a top level summary of
the mission timeline. The mission is realized through a sequence of
phases, Formulation and Implementation, with the goal of acquiring the
first data in 2006. The Request For Proposals (RFP) for the Formulation
phase was released November 1, 2001.
Mission Time line, Forulation from 2002-2003, impementation 2002- 2006,

We welcome your input. If you have something you would like to send in,
regarding either the LDCM or this web site, please use our feedback
