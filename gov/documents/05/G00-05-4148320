   Below Normal Flood Potential in East USA
   RIVER FLOOD POTENTIAL BELOW NORMAL FOR WINTER AND EARLY SPRING
   THROUGHOUT EASTERN UNITED STATES

   NOAA's National Weather Service forecast for flood potential remains
   below normal through the remainder of this winter and into early spring
   for the eastern United States. In fact, conditions in many areas of the
   East are so dry that drought conditions may be more of a concern than
   flooding.

        WEATHER EVENT SIMULATOR HELPS FORECASTERS TRAIN FOR THE WORST

   NOAA's National Weather Service is using a new, high-tech training tool
   to help its meteorologists better forecast Mother Nature at her
   worstfrom monster tornadoes and blinding snow storms, to floods.

                          IS El NIÑO COMING BACK?

   NOAA's Climate Prediction Center says warming is being observed over
   the Tropical Pacific, which could lead to an El Niño by early Spring.
   The U.S. is not expected to see its potential impacts until late
   summer, through the fall and into next winter.

             THREE-DAY HURRICANE FORECAST BECOMING MORE ACCURATE

   After years of trying to develop better hurricane forecast models,
   scientists at NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center have upgraded the
   "Aviation Model," which now produces improved forecast guidance of
   tropical storms and hurricanes.
