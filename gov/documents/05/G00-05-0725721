   America's Farm
   http://www.americasfarm.org
   A Prototype for Other National Cyber-Educational Sites. Web-delivered
   inquiry- and problem-based curriculum aimed at educating students,
   teachers, and others about agriculture and remote sensing.

   America's Farm is an interactive web site to provide teachers, students
   and resource managers an opportunity to observe and monitor the daily
   activities of a large, working Midwestern farm.

   The project integrates educational materials and data into thematic
   units (Curriculum Building Blocks) based on Earth Science information
   to allow students to study various aspects of a large farm operation
   and provide experience in the applications of various types of remotely
   sensed data and procedures for addressing research problems related to
   the agricultural sector of our society. Two one-semester graduate
   courses have been developed.

   Teacher workshops introduce teachers to the materials, including
   workshops on-site at the farm, other locations, and web-based for
   remote teachers. The next planned implementation is Americas Wetland.
   National standards that the project will address are: earth science,
   life science history and technology topics. There will be multiple
   evaluation methods, including student and teacher feedback, classroom
   studies, and surveys.

   EventScope
   http://www.eventscope.org/
   Carnegie Mellon University A 3-D Networked Robotic Learning
   Environment. Adapts NASA's virtual world data sets so students can
   "virtually" visit the sites of real science missions.

   EventScope is developing an interdisciplinary teaching tool that will
   permit junior high school students to virtually navigate and remotely
   sense online environments that have been created from NASA datasets. To
   accomplish this, the project will:
    1. Generate interactive, viewer-navigable 3-D models based-on real
       world 3D data gathered by remotely operated robots (e.g.
       Pioneer/Chernobyl mapping, Mars Sojourner/Pathfinder)
    2. Develop an interface that permits students and teachers to use NASA
       visualization tools without extensive training.
    3. Develop a cross-platform stand-alone program that works with common
       web browsers that would integrate all of the components of the
       project. The proposal delineates the National Research Council
       Science Content Standards that the project will address. Teachers
       will be involved in the development of the accompanying curriculum
       and the project plans to collect teacher and student feedback for
       evaluation purposes.

   KaAMS Kids as Airborne Mission Scientists
   http://www.pgd.hawaii.edu/kaams/
   Penn State University
   Web-based curriculum materials using NASA content, including remote
   sensing, that promotes science, math, technology and geography.
   Involves students in authentic aeronautics-based remote sensing
   missions conducted by NASA airborne scientists.

   KaAMS (Kids as Airborne Mission Scientists) A teacher website populated
   with problem-based learning lessons that involve students in authentic
   aeronautics-based remote sensing missions conducted by NASA airborne
   scientists. Supplemental materials for middle school science, math,
   technology, and geography curriculum that include bursts of hands-on
   activities guiding students through knowledge development and problem
   solving activities to support scientific inquiry.

   PROJECT GOALS
     * Use airborne remote sensing missions to increase middle school
       students' interest in science
     * Develop web-based curriculum supplements that meet National
       Education Standards
     * Facilitate improvements in middle school science education by
       developing curriculum supplements based on problem-based learning
       and actual NASA aeronautics events

   The KaAMS home page will provide links to contextualized, authentic
   problem scenarios. The teacher will present the problem scenarios
   involving NASA airborne missions to middle school students. Through a
   series of framing and informing activities, students will search for
   additional supporting information on the problem, develop an
   understanding of the science of the problem, and propose a solution for
   conducting a mission that will provide remote sensing data to solve the
   problem scenario. Teachers can select from a myriad "bursts" of
   activities involving their students in conducting a mission, collecting
   and analyzing data. Finally, students will summarize their findings in
   several different ways and go public to share what they have learned
   with classmates and/or others outside their classroom. PBL scenarios
   will use both aeronautics and remote sensing topics to involve students
   in mission participation and mission construction.

   SENSORS
   http://www.ceeo.tufts.edu/sensors/
   Tufts University
   The Science and Engineering NASA Site of Remote Sensing SENSORS is
   developing a web site and several "outposts" for remote sensing using
   LEGO robots. One can remotely operate a robot in various environments.

   SENSORS has developed a web site and several "outposts" for remote
   sensing using LEGO robots. A section for passive learning will provide
   background material on some NASA remote sensing missions, including
   information about Mars and the Earth, as well as information required
   for developing a "mission plan" for submission to Tufts University for
   participation in an actual remote sensing activity.

   Several levels of participation will be offered:
     * Remotely operate a robot in one of (at least four) of the
       environments developed by the project (at Tufts, Langley or Glenn),
     * Build and operate a robot in one's own environment
     * Build a robot, "launch" it to Tufts (via Post), and conduct a
       remote sensing mission in a remote outpost.

   Educational standards are addressed and teachers on the team will be
   developing outposts.

   A resource area for teachers will be included in the web site, where
   teachers can communicate how they have integrated this activity into
   their classrooms.

   Assessment in the form of a user feedback mechanism. The project also
   plans to offer grants to groups to build their own landscapes for their
   own use and remote robot developers.

   Signals of Spring
   http://signalsofspring.com/
   Students analyze migrations and seasonal environmental changes by
   linking real-time NASA earth science data to information about the
   locations of migrating animals and explain their migratory pathways
   scientifically.

   Signals of Spring students use earth imagery to explain the migratory
   movement of birds and marine animals. Animal are trapped, tagged, and
   tracked with radio transmitters.

   Signals of Spring gets students to use NASA data and engage in
   authentic and meaningful scientific research. Teachers (middle and high
   school) are trained to facilitate students inquiry as they track
   animals (birds and marine animal) and explain their migratory pathways
   scientifically.

   Online, completely interactive analysis journals culminate the
   activities as students share their findings. Scientists respond.
   Houston, New York City, and Washington, DC schools are served through
   the In-person Teaching Training and Local Symposiums.

   An Online Teacher Training component enables the educational community
   at large to participate in the project.

   The excitement of this proposal is that it immerses students into the
   world of remote-sensing through exciting themes (local to global/time
   scales) and topics relevant and of interest to this age group (whales,
   bald eagle, etc...).

   Through proposed simulations and access to real time NASA (e.g.,
   LandSat, GOES-8, TOPEX-Poseidon, and SeaWIFS) data students will be
   able to analyze the impact that weather, climate, vegetation,
   phytoplankton and ocean temperatures and circulations have on the
   migration of animals and other things in nature.
