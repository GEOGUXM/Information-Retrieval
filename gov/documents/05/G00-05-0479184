   With the International Space Station (ISS) now in orbit, new frontiers
   in human space exploration, technology, and business have opened. The
   ISS is an unparalleled international scientific and technological
   cooperative venture that has ushered in a new era of human space flight
   with the promise of economic benefits to people on Earth

   The ISS provides more space for research, with greater resources and
   flexibility than any spacecraft ever built. The ISS provides
   unprecedented, long-term access to the microgravity and ultra-vacuum
   environment of space, a flexible vantage point for observational
   research, and a testbed for new technologies
