   [Photo of The Sand Point Naval Station] The Sand Point Community
   Housing Association, under a master lease with Seattle, Washington, has
   overseen the redevelopment of the former Sand Point Naval Station,
   which the U.S. Navy decommissioned in the mid-1990s. The property was
   transferred to the city for the purpose of providing housing,
   supportive services and employment opportunities for the homeless. The
   redevelopment will result in 200 units of transitional housing for the
   homeless. Visit our What Works page.
