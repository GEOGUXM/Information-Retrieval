    The President is determined to make committed, responsible
    fatherhood a national priority...  [T]he presence of two committed,
    involved parents contributes directly to better school performance,
    reduced substance abuse, less crime and delinquency, fewer emotional
    and other behavioral problems, less risk of abuse or neglect, and
    lower risk of teen suicide.  The research is clear:  fathers factor
    significantly in the lives of their children. There is simply no
    substitute for the love, involvement, and commitment of a
    responsible father.

   The Department of Health and Human Services has developed a special
   initiative to support and strengthen the roles of fathers in families.
   This initiative is guided by the following principles:
     * All fathers can be important contributors to the well-being of
       their children.
     * Parents are partners in raising their children, even when they do
       not live in the same household.
     * The roles fathers play in families are diverse and related to
       cultural and community norms.
     * Men should receive the education and support necessary to prepare
       them for the responsibility of parenthood.
     * Government can encourage and promote father involvement through its
       programs and through its own workforce policies.

   The Departments activities account for those circumstances under which
   increased involvement by a father or a mother may not be in the best
   interest of the child.  This is true for a small number of children,
   however.  The Department strongly supports family preservation and
   reunification efforts when they do not risk the safety of the child.
