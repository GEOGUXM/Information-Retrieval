     NERSC is a world leader in accelerating scientific discovery through
     computation. NERSC provides high-performance computing tools and
     expertise that enable computational science of scale, in which
     large, interdisciplinary teams of scientists attack fundamental
     problems in science and engineering that require massive
     calculations and have broad scientific and economic impacts.

     NERSC is funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, and
     is part of the Computing Sciences Directorate at Lawrence Berkeley
     National Laboratory. High-speed remote access to NERSC is provided
     by ESnet.
