   The Passive Microwave Earth Science Information Partner enables science
   researchers to interactively customize and receive hydrologic data sets
     derived from the newest space-based passive microwave instruments.

   Tropical Cyclones
   Track hurricanes & typhoons over the globe. Maximum wind speeds derived
   from satellite.

   Tropical Observations
   Get sea surface temperatures, water vapor, wind speed and rainfall from
   the tropics.

   Temperature Images
   View the most recent atmospheric temperature images from the surface to
   the stratosphere.

   Temperature Trends
   Are the Earth's current atmospheric temperatures above or below
   average?

   Interactive Visualization
   Interactively subset and view swath data from multiple satellite
   sensors.

   Order Data
   Search, subset, order and download custom and predefined data sets.
