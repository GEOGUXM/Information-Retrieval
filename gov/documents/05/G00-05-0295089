        What forces determine the Earth's climate? What destroys the ozone
       layer? What will happen to air quality in pristine regions? How are
     these environmental issues linked? The answers to these questions are
             the research goals of NOAA's Climate Monitoring & Diagnostics
        Laboratory (CMDL). Atmospheric gases and small particles from both
    natural and human sources influence the Earth's climate, the thickness
      of the ozone layer and the quality of the air we breath. CMDL's five
           research groups have been conducting sustained measurements for
   research related to climate, the ozone layer, and air quality at global
    Baseline Observatories and other locations for over 40 years in search
    of the answers which are needed to project the environmental future of
                                                              this planet.
