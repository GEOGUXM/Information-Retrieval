                         OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY

   "Diversity at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a concept that
   encompasses much more than ethnicity, gender, or age.  It includes
   educational background, lifestyle differences, and cultures.
   Essentially, diversity is the sum of all the parts that make us
   individualsseparate and distinct from one another.

   At PNNL, we embrace diversity as key to our future success.  When we
   have a diverse workplace--one in which every staff member can fully
   develop and apply their talents and capabilities--we foster the
   creativity and innovation that is essential to the business of science
   and technology.  A few principal guidelines that all of us can follow
   in the diversity process include mutually respecting one another, being
   open to change, and capitalizing on the strengths of others.  By
   remembering these guidelines, we can put diversity to work for us.  We
   can use the sum of all of our differencesour diversityto achieve our
   vision of becoming the premier environmental science and technology
   laboratory."

   --Dr. Lura Powell, Director of the Pacific Northwest National
   Laboratory
