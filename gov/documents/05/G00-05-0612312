     The Energy Technology Division's Alpha-Gamma Hot Cell Facility has
     capabilities for handling and analyzing irradiated nuclear fuel and
     other radioactive materials. The facility was designed and built to
   conduct postirradiation examination of fuels and structural components
    for reactor development, but that role has expanded over the years to
      include analysis and testing of components for current reactors.
