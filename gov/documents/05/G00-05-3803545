   Welcome to the Falling Through the Net web site. Here you will find
   information about efforts to provide all Americans with access to the
   Internet and other information technologies as well as reports and
   information about what has been called the "digital divide."

   The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
   Administration (NTIA) has established this site to help inform you of
   the federal government's activities regarding Americans' access to the
   Internet and other information technologies. In addition, we have
   provided direct links to other resources that provide information on
   private sector educational and funding initiatives.
