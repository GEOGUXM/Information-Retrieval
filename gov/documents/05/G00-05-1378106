Mission:

   Conduct research into the structure, dynamics, and evolution of the
   solid Earth and planets using space-techniques and remote sensing data.

Major Elements:

   Geomagnetism, Crustal Deformation, Topography and Surface Change,
   Orbital-Rotational-Climate Interaction, Planetary Geology and
   Geophysics.

   The research activities of the Geodynamics Branch comprise a broadly
   based effort, centered on measuring, modeling, and interpreting the
   configuration and motion of the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth.
   Similar efforts are also directed toward understanding the Moon, Mars,
   and Venus. Relevant data types include regional-to-global scale
   patterns of stress, strain, seismicity, gravity, topography, magnetics,
   and temporal variations in Earth rotation. Processes under intensive
   study include orbital evolution, post-glacial rebound, rotational
   dynamics, faulting, tectonism, volcanism, mantle convection, core
   magnetohydrodynamics, erosion and impact crater formation.
