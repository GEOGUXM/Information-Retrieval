   Thousands of years ago, on a small rocky planet orbiting a modest star
   in an ordinary spiral galaxy, our remote ancestors looked up and
   wondered about their place between Earth and sky. Now, in the 21st
   century, we ask the same profound questions:
     * How did the universe begin and evolve?
     * How did we get here?
     * Where are we going?
     * Are we alone?

   Today, after only the blink of an eye in cosmic time, we are beginning
   to answer these questions. In the last 40 years, space probes and space
   observatories have played a central role in this process of discovery.

   Our missions and research are now generating most of the coolest news
   coming out of NASA. We are responsible for all of NASA's programs
   relating to astronomy, the solar system, and the sun and its
   interaction with Earth. Our science covers everything from the middle
   levels of Earth's atmosphere to the edge of the universe billions of
   light years away.

   Our web site is packed with content to serve our science community,
   educators, government decision-makers, and the public. We hope your
   visit is enjoyable and rewarding. Thanks for stopping by!
