   WHAT IS CLASSROOM@SEA?
   Classroom@Sea is a virtual learning community being constructed by the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with the help of the
   University of Washington's College of Education. Its purpose is to
   connect NOAA's research vessels working in the world's oceans with
   classrooms around the globe to bring science to life. Classroom@Sea is
   about bringing together experts aboard NOAA's ships with novices on
   shore to ask questions about the oceans, and to search for answers. Its
   about experiencing life aboard a floating research platform, and
   celebrating what is known and unknown about our water planet. Help us
   construct Classroom@Sea by visiting the site, using the data and
   information, trying out the activities and experiments, and letting us
   know what you think. Your feedback is important to insure the site is a
   usable and meaningful tool for doing ocean science. For more
   information, email Michele Malarney.
