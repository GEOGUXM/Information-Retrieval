   Airborne Survey to Map Water Quality
   Helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) surveys were flown in October 2001 to
   map water quality and the extent of saltwater intrusion in parts of Big
   Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and land southeast
   of Homestead, Florida. The surveys cover about 440 sq. mi. (1140 km^2).
   Preliminary apparent resistivity maps from the five-frequency HEM
   system will be available in early January. - Learn more about this

   New publication: An Investigation of the Interrelation of Everglades
   Hydrology and Florida Bay Dynamics to Ecosystem Processes in South
   Florida
   Welcome to the South Florida Information Access (SOFIA) Website
   (formerly the "South Florida Ecosystem Program"). South Florida is one
   of several study areas within the USGS Place-Based Studies Program.
   This Program was established to enable the USGS to enhance its
   scientific assistance to resource managers who require an improved
   scientific information base to resolve or prevent complex resource
   conflicts or environmental problems in specific ecosystem sites.

   For an overview of the website, you can either search the site for
   specific words or topics, or use the site map. You can access
   information on projects by title, investigator, or by region. The
   Database contains data related to all of the projects. We also have a
   publications page that contains Open File Reports, Fact Sheets, and
   other publications for our projects.

                                 Let us know
                               what you think!
