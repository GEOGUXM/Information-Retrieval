   The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is the element of
   the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) charged with promoting the
   scientific investigation of the "fast" component of the Earth's climate
   system. The International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project
   (ISLSCP) is one of several projects of the GEWEX and has the lead role
   in addressing land-atmosphere interactions; Specifically, process
   modeling, data retrieval algorithmns, field experiment design and
   execution, and the development of global data sets. The previous
   Chairman of ISLSCP was Dr. Piers Sellers, now of the Astronaut Office,
   Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The current Chair, Dr. Pavel
   Kabat is at the DLO Winand Staring Centre in the Netherlands. Since its
   inception in 1983, ISLSCP has conceived and participated in a number of
   workshops, field experiments and the production and publication of a
   five-volume CD-ROM collection of global data sets to support energy,
   water and biogeochemical cycling studies, ISLSCP Initiative I .
   Following the production and publication of the ISLSCP Initiative I
   data collection in 1994, ISLSCP members have continued to meet on a
   regular basis, evaluating the Initiative I data collection and defining
   the requirements for an expanded data collection, ISLSCP Initiative II.
   In 1999 NASA's Hydrology program provided funding to initiate the
   production and publication of the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection.
   Drs. Forrest G. Hall and Blanche Meeson of the NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center are Co-Principal Investigators. The ISLSCP Initiative II
   staff at the Goddard Space Flight Center consists of Dr. Sietse Los,
   who oversees the production of the land cover biophysical
   characteristics data, Dr. Lou Steyaert, who coordinates the publication
   of the ISLSCP land cover type data sets, and Mr. Eric Brown de Colstoun
   who coordinates the incorporation of the various data sets into the
   ISLSCP data collection and is the webmaster for this site. Except for
   the land cover biophysical characteristics data sets, all other data
   sets will be produced by other projects funded at various university
   and government institutions and provided to the ISLSCP staff. An ISLSCP
   working group meets regularly to assist the GSFC staff to coordinate
   the production and publication of the various data sets in the data
   collection.

   The data sets that are being produced for Initiative II are based on
   the need to develop a comprehensive data set that covers the 10-year
   period from 1986 to 1995. The data will be produced at a spatial
   resolution of 1 degree for the meteorological data and at 0.5 and 0.25
   degrees for topography, soils, and vegetation parameters.

Objectives

     * Revisit Global Change Modeling Data Requirements and Algorithm
       Approaches
     * Provide User Services to Target Community
     * Develop Science Driven Land Cover Data Sets for Global Change
       Process Studies
     * Validate ISLSCP II Data Sets
     __________________________________________________________________

Data Sets

   The intent is to produce a consistent collection of high priority
   global data sets using existing data sources and algorithms, designed
   to satisfy the needs of modelers. The global data sets are mapped at
   consistent spatial and temporal resolutions and are compiled in four
   key areas: land cover, hydrometeorology, radiation, and soils. The data
   sets cover those four areas, span the 10-year period, 1986-1995, and
   are mapped to consistent grids (0.5 deg. x 0.5 deg. for topography and
   land cover, 1 deg x 1 deg for meteorological parameters). The temporal
   resolution for most data sets is monthly; however, a few are at a finer
   resolution (e.g., 3-hourly). As data sets from the ISLSCP II data
   collection become available from the providing institutions, they will
   be placed on line at this web site. The primary purpose of doing so is
   to provide the ISLSCP user community access to data sets as quickly as
   possible and to obtain feedback from that community. Some data sets may
   have only partial documentation or may otherwise be incomplete.
   Contents of the data sets may be updated without notice. The staff
   would appreciate any feedback you may have on the data sets or this web
   site. An initial version of the complete Initiative II collection is
   planned for Dec 2001 with a final version by the end of the three-year
   ISLSCP II project in May of 2002.

   The majority of the data sets in the ISLSCP II collection will be
   submitted by December 2001 and will be provided via this web site as
   they become available. The available data may be accessed and
   downloaded from the following links:
     * Vegetation
     * Hydrology and Soils
     * Snow and Sea Ice
     * Oceans
     * Radiation and Clouds
     * Carbon
     * Near-Surface Meteorology
          + Fixed
          + Monthly
          + Monthly 3-hourly
          + 3-hourly
     * Other

   The data are also available directly through anonymous ftp.

Data Processing Status

   The data within each of these areas were acquired from a variety of
   sources including model output, satellites, and ground measurements.
   The individual data sets were provided in a variety of forms. In some
   cases this required the data publication team to regrid and reformat
   data sets and in others to produce monthly averages from finer
   resolution data. A peer review process will be organized to ensure the
   quality of the data and documentation

   Details on the data sets and the status of their processing are listed
   in the

                            ISLSCP-II Data List.

Biophysical Parameter Data

   A major goal of ISLSCP Initiative II is to produce satellite-derived
   biophysical parameters for multiple years. The interannual variation in
   the surface vegetation is crucial to improve understanding of the
   interrelationships among vegetation, water, carbon, and energy balance.
   To help accomplish these goals, the Fourier-Adjusted, Solar zenith
   angle corrected, Interpolation, and Reconstruction (FASIR) algorithm
   was used to reduce spurious variations in global NDVI data. Dr. Sietse
   Los is leading the effort to produce the FASIR-NDVI and a number of
   other biophysical data products.

   These biophysical data sets will be available through ISLSCP II under
   the Vegetation data sets.
