Water Resources of New Jersey

   The U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's largest earth- and
   life-science agency and has the principal responsibility within the
   Federal government for providing hydrologic information and appraising
   the Nation's water resources. The New Jersey District of the USGS
   collects basic hydrologic data and makes interpretive investigations of
   New Jersey's water resources. This web site is intended to provide the
   general public with information on the USGS and with timely access to
   the data we collect and the information we provide. The N.J. District
   information page describes our permanent projects, people to contact
   and outreach activities. Directions to our office are also available.

   * Ground water
          Information on the ground-water resources in New Jersey.
          Includes both water-level and water-quality data.

          Method and computer programs to improve pathline resolution near
          weak sinks representing wells in Modflow and Modpath
          ground-water-flow simulations is now available online(PDF).
          (5/2001)

   * Surface Water
          Information on the surface-water systems (rivers, lakes, tidal
          waters) in New Jersey. Includes both streamflow and
          water-quality data.

          A Hydrologic Primer for New Jersey Watershed Management is now
          available online(PDF). (4/2001)

   * Publications
          Reports produced in this office and information on ordering
          publications. Includes a searchable District Bibliography and
          downloadable PDF files.

   * National Water Quality Assessment Program
          The National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program is
          designed to describe the status and trends in the quality of the
          Nation's ground- and surface-water resources and to provide a
          sound understanding of the natural and human factors that affect
          the quality of these resources.

          Water Quality in the Long Island-New Jersey Coastal Drainages
          (USGS Circular 1201) is now available online. (3/2001)

   * Toxic Substances Hydrology Program - Galloway Township, NJ Research
          Site
          The Toxic Substances Hydrology Program is designed to provide
          information on the behavior of toxic substance in the Nation's
          surface and ground waters that is needed to avoid human
          exposure, to develop effective remedial strategies and to
          prevent further contamination. This website contains information
          on hydrocarbon fate and transport investigations conducted at
          the Galloway Township, NJ research site. This site also contains
          information on unsaturated zone computer models: R-UNSAT, AIR2D
          and AIR3D.
