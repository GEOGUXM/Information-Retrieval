   Welcome to Washington Council for Prevention of Child Abuse and
   Neglects (WCPCAN) Web site.

   WCPCANs mission is to provide leadership and a statewide focus on the
   prevention of child abuse and neglect, and to encourage and support
   effective community prevention efforts.

   The legislature created WCPCAN and the Childrens Trust Fund in 1982.
   WCPCAN is funded by the states general fund (through a $5 surcharge on
   marriage licenses), the federal Community-Based Family Resource and
   Support Program grant, the Childrens Trust Fund and private donations.

   WCPCAN is a 14-member, Governor appointed Council legislated to promote
   prevention of child abuse and neglect.  Seven Council members are
   appointed by the Governor, three are ex officio members designated from
   the Department of Health, the Department of Social and Health Services
   and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and four are
   appointed from the Legislature (two each from the House and Senate).
   WCPCAN employs six staff, an Executive Director, two Office Assistants,
   and three professional staff who manage Program Development and
   Evaluation, Public Education and Outreach, and Resources and Training.

       local programs, and policymakers on research, best practices and

       facilitate continuous quality improvement.
     * Co-sponsor (with Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center)

       statewide public awareness campaign to increase awareness about the

       Washington Childrens Trust Fund.

Childrens Trust Fund

   The Childrens Trust Fund was established by the Legislature as a
   separate fund within the state treasury to receive public and private
   donations to support the work of WCPCAN. In addition, monies generated
   by the sale of the "Heirloom Birth Certificate" are deposited to this
   account.  You can make a tax-deductible donation to the Childrens Trust
   Fund.  The fund provides financial support to programs that strengthen
   families and prevent child abuse and neglect and educates the public
   about Shaken Baby Syndrome.

Community Based Family Resource and Support (CBFRS)

   The Community Based Family Resource and Support (CBFRS) program was
   established by Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act
   (CAPTA) Amendments of 1996. The purpose of the CBFRS program is to
   support state efforts to create and operate statewide networks of
   community-based, family-centered, prevention focused family resource
   and support programs, which strengthen families and reduce the
   incidence of child abuse and neglect.
   This legislation has a rich history, beginning with the Child Abuse
   Prevention Federal Challenge Grants Act in 1984 the first law to direct
   Federal funds specifically to assist state efforts in preventing child
   abuse and neglect. Amendments to the law in 1992 and 1994 broadened the
   earlier legislation to include the provision of community-based child
   abuse prevention activities and family resource services.
