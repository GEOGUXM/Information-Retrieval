                      Our Sadness Will Lead To Resolve

                   What To Do If You Receive Mail That May
                 Contain Anthrax Or Another Hazardous Agent

                      Q & A and Web Links About Anthrax

   Welcome to my Website

   One of the highest responsibilities of elected officials is to help
   provide services and information to constituents. I want you to be
   connected with your government. To that end, I have provided links
   which can help you get information on a variety of topics and issue
   areas. As an example, you can look up any bill through the Library of
   Congress that is pending before either the U.S. House or Senate. I want
   to help you be informed. If you have suggestions for other links that
   would be helpful, or information that would be educational that we can
   add to this website, please let me know.

   I hope you find this information interesting and useful. If you would
   like to let me know what issues are important to you, please send me a
   message at craig@thomas.senate.gov. Thank you for visiting my website.

                                   Best Regards,
