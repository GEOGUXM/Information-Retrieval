                  WELCOME TO THE MATERIALS SCIENCE DIVISION

       Materials Science Division (MSD) is the focal point for research in
   materials science at Argonne National Laboratory. Our mission is to
   develop new materials for society, and we do so with a team of
   materials scientists, physicists and chemists who carry out
   collaborative research on a variety of problems. Typically, we can
   bring to bear fundamental research, involving synthesis,
   characterization and modeling, to improve performance of old materials,
   or design new materials.

                              Recent Highlight

      Dieter Gruen and Mike Pellin's development of "The 308nm Excimer
   Laser System" has been recognized as one of the top 100 scientific
   accomplishments of the Department of Energy . This is a tremendous
   honor for Dieter and Mike, for MSD, and for Argonne National
   Laboratory. Their work, which emerged from materials chemistry programs
   to understand laser-surface interactions, has had a real impact on
   people's lives as it is used in laser cardiovascular surgery.
