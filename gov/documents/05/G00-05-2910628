   The commercial development of the space frontier is one of the greatest
   opportunities facing America. It is the growth of business into space
   that will bring the benefits of space down to Earth and enrich the
   everyday lives of all Americans.

   NASA is encouraging businesses to seize this opportunity through the
   Space Product Development Program and its Commercial Space Centers, to
   help ensure the continued economic growth of the U.S. and to bring the
   opportunities for new advances, technological understanding, products
   and jobs to the public.
