   Professor George Smoot's group conducts research on the early Universe
 (cosmology) using the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and other
astrophysical sources. These investigations are directed towards realizing a
     variety of science goals regarding CMB. Post doctoral, Graduate and
  undergraduate student, and other job opportunities, pending funding, are
                 available in the various research projects.

                         [cobe_satellite.gif] Projects:

   [prj_cobe.gif]
          COBE: satellite data analysis on the anisotropy and spectrum of
          the cosmic microwave background and on infrared emission from
          Galactic and extragalactic sources.

   [prj_max.gif]
          MAX, MAXIMA and BOOMERANG: balloon-borne CMB anisotropy mapping
          experiments and the new MAXIPOL instrument for CMB polarization
          observations
          [new.gif] New Results

   [prj_cosa.gif]
          Planck Surveyor : formerly called COBRAS/SAMBA is a satellite
          proposed to extend the COBE DMR work.
          It completed Phase A feasibility study in May 1996, and has been
          selected for a mission by ESA (European Space Agency) in July
          1996.

   [mincer.gif]
          CMB Data Processing, Analysis and Computing : is a major effort
          in collaboration with COMBAT and work work utilizing the NERSC
          Supercomputer Center.

          CMB Foreground Estimation and Realistic Modeling including the
          WOMBAT collaboration

   [prj_gem.gif]
          GEM: the Galactic Emission Mapping project. A radio survey of
          Galactic emission.

   [prj_neut.gif]
          Neutrino Astrophysics Projects designed to detect high energy
          neutrinos.

   [snapsat2.jpg]
          designed to measure cosmological parameters and do related
          astrophysics. SNAPsat

   [prj_spec.gif]
          Former Projects such as the U2 jet aircraft borne experiment
          that detected the CMB dipole anisotropy and this one to measure
          the long wavelength spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.
          This was done at a number of sites including the South Pole
          pictured there.
