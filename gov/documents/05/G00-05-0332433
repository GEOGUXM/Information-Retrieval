   The Marshall Space Flight Center Vector Magnetograph Facility was
   assembled in 1973 to support the Skylab mission. The instrument was
   designed by Dr. Guenther Brueckner of the Naval Research Laboratory and
   housed in an enclosure at the top of a 40-foot tower. Major
   improvements to the vector magnetograph occurred in 1982, when Solar
   Physics group member Ed West, upgraded the SEC Vidicon camera to a CCD.
   In 1985, other changes were made to increase the field-of-view from 5 x
   5 arc min (2.4 arc sec per pixel) to 6 x 6 arc min with a resolution of
   2.81 arc sec. The result was a world-class instrument that has
   illustrated the usefulness of reliable vector magnetic field
   measurements for understanding solar magnetism and its role in
   processes such as solar flares.

   In 1989, the facility made use of an H-alpha telescope (bandpass of 1
   Ã…) which had been built as a backup for the one which flew on Skylab's
   Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM).   Images from this co-aligned telescope
   provide a view of chromospheric structures, flare activity, and furnish
   additional information on the orientation of the magnetic field in
   active regions. This photograph of the facility shows the gold plated
   H-alpha telescope mounted on the side of the magnetograph's telescope.
       James Smith, the chief observer, is shown attending to the
   instrument.

   Recently (in year 2000), the magnetograph was again upgraded to take
   advantage of current technology. Changes consisted of the installation
   of a new CCD camera and data acquisition system. With the new CCD, the
   spatial resolution over the 7 x 5.2 arcmin field- of-view is now 0.64
   arcsec per pixel (binning 1 x 1), an improvement by a factor of 5 over
   the former detector. The new system is also faster (3 minutes for a
   full vector magnetogram) and much more versatile with its new computer
   system and much larger memory. We began observations with this system
   on September 14, 2000.

   The magnetograph works by measuring the polarization of light at
   various wavelength positions within a solar spectral line.  Circular
   polarization in the opposite sense on either side of a magnetically
   sensitive spectral line gives a measure of the longitudinal magnetic
   field (the strength of the field directed toward and away from the
   instrument). Linear polarization provides information on the strength
   and direction of the magnetic field transverse to the line of sight.

   can be found here.
