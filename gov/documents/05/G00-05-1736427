   their representatives know their opinions.
   In my Georgia and Washington, D.C. offices, we use the internet to
   listen to your concerns as well as to keep you abreast of what I am
   doing to serve Georgia citizens.
   I am delighted that you have taken this opportunity to learn about my

   In the months since the horrific attacks against America on September
   11th, we as a nation have unified behind our President, committed to
   bringing the terrorists to justice and ending the epidemic of fear
   around the globe. We continue to stand united as we pray for the safety
   of our men and women in uniform, work to make our own country as secure
   as possible and mourn those who fell.
