   MEL Highlights
   Engineering Metrology Toolbox

   Engineering Metrology Toolbox
   A site for computational tools that solve real problems in dimensional
   measurement.

   Currently the web site has two computational tools. The first tool is
   for calculating the index of refraction of air. The second tool is for
   calculating the elastic compression of spheres and cylinders at point
   and line contact.
