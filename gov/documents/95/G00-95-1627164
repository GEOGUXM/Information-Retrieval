   About the images...

   DNA strand DNA Strand - The easiest signs of life to detect on a
   distant planet will be departures from chemical balance in the planet's
   atmosphere. Exploring the details of how the planet's life processes
   work will be much harder.
   Nulling Nulling Animation - Planets will be lost in the glare of the
   bright star that is their sun. An optical technique which makes the
   star's light waves interfere with themselves, "nulling" will be used to
   dim the star so that the planets can be seen.
   [about-spectrum.gif] Spectrum - Some of the signs of life:
     * The spectral shape shows the temperature of the planet and it is
       right for water to be liquid
     * The strong carbon dioxide band shows we have a planet with an
       atmosphere
     * The ozone band shows plentiful oxygen, probably produced by life
     * The spectral features of water show abundant water, indicating a
       planet with ocean, since water is a necessity for life

   [about-trapezium.gif] Orion's Trapezium - Located nearby, only fifteen
   hundred light years away, the Trapezium region is the closest star
   formation site containing both Sun-like stars and stars much more
   massive than the Sun. While ground-based observations have hinted at
   extended structures surrounding the Sun-like stars, HST has produced
   images with incredible detail revealing that these stars are embedded
   in circumstellar disks and surrounded by diffuse hot ionized gas.

   Theoretical models, coupled with NASA Hubble Space Telescope
   observations of the Trapezium cluster in the Orion nebula, suggest that
   disks around young cluster stars may not survive long enough for
   planets to form within them. This implies that there are certain
   hostile environments in star-forming regions that may inhibit planet
   formation.
