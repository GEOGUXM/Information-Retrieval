   Welcome to the
   Coe Park
   Visitor Center   [visitctr.gif]
   The Visitor Center at Coe Park is open every weekend throughout the
   year, and it's often open on Fridays and Mondays, especially during the
   busy months of spring.  The building is staffed by park rangers and
   volunteers who can give you information about the park and help you
   plan backcountry outings.
   Outside the Visitor Center you'll find:

   In 1953, Sada Coe Robinson bequeathed her beloved Pine Ridge Ranch as a
   parkland dedicated to the memory of her father.  In 1971, Sada funded
   the design and construction of the Visitor Center, which has served the
   public well for over 25 years.  During those years, however, the park
   has grown immensely in size (from 12,221 to almost 81,000 acres) and in
   popularity.  For that reason, plans are underway to expand the Visitor
   Center.  The enlarged building will more comfortably accommodate the
   growing number of people who come to the park and will provide the
   space required for natural history and American Indian
   displays.  To get a peek at what's planned, take a look at our Visitor
   Center Expansion page.
