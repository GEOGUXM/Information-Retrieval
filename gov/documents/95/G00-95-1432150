   Strategic Direction - Mailing Industry Task Force

    "Seizing Opportunity" - The Report of the 2001 Mailing Industry Task
    Force


    For six months, the Mailing Industry Task Force - co-chaired by Pitney
    Bowes CEO Michael Critelli and Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan -
    worked to develop recommendations for future enhancement and growth of
    mail and the mail channel. The eight recommendations support three
    strategic imperatives: to respond to customer needs, to make mail more
    competitive and to unify the industry. The Report, the contents of the
    press kit announcing its release, a sampling of its supporting
    research, task force members, and meeting minutes can be found below

   ** - Please note that there is a typographical error in tables 8 and 9
   on pages 12 and 13 of "Seizing Opportunity". Instead of "1999-2000",
   the year range in these tables should be "1999-2010".
