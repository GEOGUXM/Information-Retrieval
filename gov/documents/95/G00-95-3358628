   References to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are
   references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The EAR are issued by
   the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export
   Administration (BXA) under laws relating to the control of certain
   exports, reexports, and activities. In addition, the EAR implement
   antiboycott law provisions requiring regulations to prohibit specified
   conduct by United States persons that has the effect of furthering or
   supporting boycotts fostered or imposed by a country against a country
   friendly to United States.

   The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve the
   national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supply
   interests of the United States and, in some cases, to carry out its
   international obligations. Some controls are designed to restrict
   access to dual use items by countries or persons that might apply such
   items to uses inimical to U.S. interests. These include controls
   designed to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
   controls designed to limit the military and terrorism support
   capability of certain countries. The effectiveness of many of the
   controls under the EAR is enhanced by their being maintained as part of
   multilateral control arrangements. Multilateral export control
   cooperation is sought through arrangements such as the the Wassenaar
   Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the
   Missile Technology Control Regime. The EAR also include some export
   controls to protect the United States from the adverse impact of the
   unrestricted export of commodities in short supply. See also: History
   of Export Controls.

   Some people will find the great length of the EAR and their extensive
   use of technical terms intimidating. BXA believes, however, that such
   detail and precision can and does serve the interests of the public.
   The detailed listing of technical parameters in the CCL establishes
   precise, objective, criteria. This should, in most cases, enable you to
   ascertain the appropriate control status. Broader, more subjective
   criteria would leave exporters and reexporters more dependent upon
   interpretations and rulings by BXA officials. Moreover, much of the
   detail in the CCL is derived from multilaterally adopted lists, and the
   specificity serves to enhance the uniformity and effectiveness of
   international control practices and to promote a "level playing field".
   The detailed presentation of such elements as licensing and export
   clearance procedures enables you to find in one place what you need to
   know to comply with pertinent requirements. Of special importance is
   the detailed listing of License Exception criteria, as these will
   enable you to determine quickly, and with confidence, that you may
   proceed with a transaction without delay. Finally, some of the detail
   results from the need to draft the EAR with care in order to avoid
   loop-holes and to permit effective enforcement.
