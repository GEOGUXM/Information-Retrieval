   AIRPORT PAVEMENT RESEARCH PROGRAM. The National Airport Pavement Test
   Facility (NAPTF) has recently completed the construction of two
   concrete test strips inside building 296. The tests strips are two
   separate lanes of 11 inch thick concrete, each consisting of two 20' x
   20' and four 15' x 15' slabs for a total of 6 slabs in each lane. A
   different concrete mix was used in each lane. The purpose of the test
   strips is to evaluate various concrete mixes for shrinkage and curling.
   To accomplish this, a total of 160 sensors were installed in and on the
   concrete to measure various parameters. Displacement transducers
   measure vertical movement of the slabs from the base material. Concrete
   strain gages measure internal strains as a result of shrinkage
   stresses. Thermistor trees measure the vertical temperature gradient of
   the interior between top and bottom of the slabs. Externally mounted
   slide gages measure horizontal movement of the slabs with respect to
   the base material and externally mounted crack gages measure movement
   at the control joints. A data collection program was specifically
   designed to monitor the instruments in real time, making use of the
   NAPTF's existing data collection system. The experiment will continue
   for several months while planning and preliminary work is done to
   prepare for full-scale replacement of the NAPTF test sections. The
   results will be used to choose the best combination of materials for
   replacement of concrete test pavements.

   VISUAL GUIDANCE PROGRAM. Runway End Identifier Light (REIL) Baffling
   Project, Windham Airport, Willimantic, CT. Jim Patterson (AAR-411, the
   Airport Technology R&D Branch, Safety Section) traveled to the Windham
   Airport to assist the New England Region Airports Office in solving a
   problem with a REIL system. Pilots at the airport complained that the
   lights were blinding them on a perpendicular taxiway. At the conclusion
   of the visit, it was determined that baffling the light units would
   significantly reduce the usability of the lights to airborne aircraft
   approaching the airport. It was recommended that the light fixtures be
   moved to an alternate location on the opposite side of the taxiway.
   While this was considered a last resort, it was determined to be the
   only viable solution.

   Wildlife-Mitigation research program Bird Detection Radar Research
   funded by the Dual Use Science and Technology (DUS&T) program.
   Dedicated efforts of Michel Hovan and Peter Sparacino of the Airport
   Technology R&D Branch, AAR-410, were paid off when the USAFs DUS&T
   Program Office informed them that a technical proposal valued at
   $1,011,564 was awarded for the development of dedicated bird detection
   radar for airports and airfields.  Both Michel and Peter have been
   involved in the DUS&T program by co-authoring, evaluating, co-funding
   the research topic, and facilitating this partnership between the Air
   Force, industry, and the FAA; AAR- 410 will be contributing $125,000
   toward this project.
   The goal of this partnership is to develop, test, and evaluate an
   affordable and portable radar unit capable of detecting, in real time,
   individual and flocking birds in and around the airport airspace.  This
   will greatly increase safety for both arriving and departing flights at
   airports of all sizes.
   The Air Force DUS&T program jointly funds research projects with
   industry for the development of dual use technologies to solve specific
   technical problem.  A dual use technology is defined as a technology
   that has both military utility and sufficient commercial potential to
   support a viable industrial base.

   Obstruction Lighting for Wind Generators.  Personnel from AAR-411, the
   Airport Technology R&D Branch, Safety Section, conducted an airborne
   evaluation of two major wind turbine developments in Somerset, PA.  The
   goal of the project is to develop a lighting configuration that will
   effectively illuminate complex arrays of towers without requiring
   lights on each and every one.  It is not uncommon to have turbine farms
   with over 100 units spread out over 20 plus miles, making it very
   difficult to illuminate without polluting the landscape with lights.
   This work is being accomplished under an Interagency Agreement with the
   Department of Energy. Three additional evaluations are to be
   accomplished within the next few months.
