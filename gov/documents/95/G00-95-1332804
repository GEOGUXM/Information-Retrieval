   NASA Selects Instruments for STEREO Mission:

   NASAs Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission will
   use two identically equipped spacecraft to provide revolutionary 3-D
   imaging of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The STEREO mission will be a
   multilateral international collaboration involving participants from
   France, Germany, the United States, and United Kingdom.

   Investigations for STEREO will include:

   Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)
   for the remote sensing package. SECCHI will have four instruments: an
   Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, two white-light coronagraphs and a
   Heliospheric Imager. These instruments will study the 3-D evolution of
   CMEs from birth at the Suns surface through the corona and
   interplanetary medium to its eventual impact at Earth. Dr. Russell
   Howard, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., will lead the
   investigation.

   STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) is an interplanetary radio burst tracker that
   will trace the generation and evolution of traveling radio disturbances
   from the Sun to the orbit of Earth. Dr. Jean Louis H. Bougeret, Centre
   National de la Recherche Scientifique, Observatory of Paris, and lead
   co-investigator Dr. Michael Kaiser of Goddard, will lead the
   investigation.

   In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT)
   investigation will sample the 3-D distribution and provide plasma
   characteristics of solar energetic particles and the local vector
   magnetic field. Dr. Janet G. Luhmann, University of California,
   Berkeley, will lead this investigation.

   PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment will
   provide plasma characteristics of protons, alpha particles and heavy
   ions. This experiment will provide key diagnostic measurements of the
   form of mass and charge state composition of heavy ions and
   characterize the CME plasma from ambient coronal plasma. Dr. Antoinette
   Galvin, University of New Hampshire, will lead this investigation.

   Spacecraft development is scheduled to begin in 2001, with launch
   scheduled for 2004.
