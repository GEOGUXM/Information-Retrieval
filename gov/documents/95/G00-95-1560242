   Volunteer program

                          Volunteer Program of the
                   USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO)

   Volunteer sets up a GPS receiver at summit of Mauna Loa Volcano Dozens
   of volunteers contribute thousands of hours each year to help HVO's
   staff monitor the active volcanoes of Hawai`i and conduct research on
   various aspects of Hawaiian volcanism. The volunteers in turn gain
   experience working on active volcanoes and participating in scientific
   research--collecting and analyzing data, building and installing
   instruments for experiments and volcano and earthquake monitoring,
   taking photographs and conducting surveys, and working on team or
   individual research projects.

   Volunteers help install a tiltmeter into a hole about 3 m deep
   Volunteers range from undergraduate students to retired educators,
   computer programmers to chemists, and writers to electricians. People
   come from around the world to volunteer at HVO. Hawai`i's active
   volcanoes and natural beauty make the vounteer positions very popular
   and highly competitive.

   HVO provides free lodging for as many as 7 volunteers at a time in a
   fully-furnished house about 4 km from the Observatory. Volunteers
   staying in our guest house must be willing to work for at least three
   months on a full-time basis. Transportation is provided between the
   house and HVO, but volunteers are responsible for all non-work-related
   travel expenses (travel to and from Hilo, Hawai`i, and travel on the
   Big Island and neighboring islands). Volunteers are also responsible
   for all food and health-care costs.

   Volunteer conducts a VLF (very-low frequency) survey over a lava tube
   Many of the volunteer positions require work in the field, sometimes in
   remote areas of Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park and other parts of the
   Big Island. For these positions, volunteers often must hike several
   kilometers over rough and irregular ground in hot, humid conditions, or
   sometimes in raw, bone-chilling cold and wet weather high on the
   volcanoes. Also, some of the field sites are near active fumaroles, and
   many sites are intermittently swept by the plume of sulfur dioxide gas
   from the Pu`u `O`o vent--the noxious plume poses a health hazard by
   aggravating preexisting respiratory ailments (for more information
   about the plume, see Volcanic air pollution--a hazard in Hawai`i).

   HVO supports a variety of volunteer opportunities. Although each

   an HVO staff member, volunteers are provided with opportunities to
   learn about the other research activities at HVO. Check the categories
   of work listed below for detailed descriptions of volunteer
   opportunities available at HVO and to submit an application form to
   supervisors. You may also submit an application to all supervisors (see
   last entry in table below).

   Volunteer opportunities with the Federal Government are available to
   both citizens and non-citizens.

   Some universities and other educational institutions will grant
   academic credit for participation in volunteer projects. Student
   volunteers are personally responsible for making all arrangements with
   their instructors or department heads. The Federal Government will
   cooperate in this process by providing a record of specific service
   upon request. skip past other USGS opportunities
