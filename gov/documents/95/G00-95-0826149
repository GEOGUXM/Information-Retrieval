     We are exploring the security requirements of distributed computing
     and colloboration environments. One of our goals is to provide
     prototypes of distributed access control solutions that will reflect
     the distributed nature of the stakeholders of shared distributed
     resources. For details on our approach see Overview.

Projects


   Akenti Certificate-based Authorization mechanism
   Network Bandwidth Quality of Service (STARS) Exploring and building a
   prototype for access controlled reservations for guaranteed-bandwidth
   network connections.
   Anchor Toolkit A system for Secure Mobile Agents
   Secure and Reliable Group Communication Investigating protocols for
   secure group memberships and developing a prototype using Akenti access
   control to determine who may be allowed to join a group.
   DOE Diesel Collaboratory pilot A DOE2000 Collaboratory pilot which is
   deploying Akenti security tools.

Publications
          + Publications, Reports and Presentations
          + Overview of Identity Certificate Use

                      This is a good, brief html slide show of what
                      public/private keys and Identity Certificates are,
                      and what they are used for. Put together by the
                      Project Mercury folks at Berkeley Lab to explain the
                      use of Public Key Infrastructure at the Lab.

          + "Research & Development Priorities for Communications and
            Information Infrastructure Assurance"

                      (Acrobat PDF format)
                      This report outlines the research and development
                      priorities required over the next five years in
                      order to assure that the communications
                      infrastructure (the public switched network and the
                      global Internet) and information infrastructure (the
                      millions of computer systems that store, organize,
                      and analyze the information on which our society
                      increasingly relies) are as secure as possible from
                      potential attacks and/or natural disasters.
