   CONSERVATION PLANNING


   The Conservation Planning Program is responsible for statewide
   oversight of various approaches used to balance the needs of
   threatened, endangered, and sensitive species and habitats with the
   needs of land users. Our primary focus is to provide policy guidance to
   large-scale, multi-species planning approaches that are partnerships
   between state, federal and local governments and private interest
   groups. We also coordinate habitat acquisition associated with plans,
   local assistance grants for conservation planning and implementation,
   conservation and mitigation banking, and voluntary integrated resource
   management plans.    Planning Map
