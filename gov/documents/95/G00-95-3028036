                   Distributed Perl Documentation (5.005_02)

   Every perl distribution comes with the following documentation,
   typically viewable through the standard man(1) program, the slower and
   less flexible perldoc(1) program, or as HTML. However, many programmers
   seem to have trouble finding that documentation, so here it all is; you
   may also fetch it manually as one gigantic GNU-zipped tarfile (1593k)
   for viewing on your local system.

Normal Documentation

     * The main perl manpage.
     * Supporting manpages.
     * The Perl Frequently Asked Questions lists.
     * Manpages for libraries, extensions, and pragmas.
     * Manpages for utilities and the x2p tools.

   The documentation listed above is available as one huge postscript file
   (1816k) suitable for printing, or as a textfile (941k) for searching.
   Other Perl documentation may also be available.

Installer Documentation

     * 5.005 release announcement.
     * READMEs and installation notes.
     * Notes on porting Perl, including directions for non-Unix ports.
     * How to handle hints files.
     * Miscellaneous porting tools.

Platform Documentation

     * Installation directions for non-Unix ports.
     * Running under Plan9.
     * Modules peculiar to OS/2.
     * Documentation peculiar to VMS.
     * Tools peculiar to Microsoft.

   Some pre-built binaries for compiler-challenged platforms can be found
   in the CPAN ports directory.
