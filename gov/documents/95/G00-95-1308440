                          Starting a Food Business

     FDA's primary focus as a regulatory agency is food safety. FDA does
     not offer financing or business tips for starting up and maintaining
     a business. FDA offers information on food safety guidelines and
     regulations it has established that are required for informative
     labeling and the safe preparation, manufacture, and distribution of
     food products.

  The Government Network

   Many federal, state, and local agencies work together to regulate and
   monitor the production, packaging, distribution and selling of food
   products.
