                                        Office of General Counsel
     __________________________________________________________________

          Chief Counsel of the Economic Development Administration
     __________________________________________________________________

     The Economic Development Administration (EDA) assists America's
     distressed communities to build healthy economies through effective
     partnerships and the strategic use of resources. Visit EDA's Web
     site: http://www.doc.gov/eda/

   The Office of Chief Counsel (OCC) of EDA is organizationally part of
   EDA, while under the legal direction of the Department's General
   Counsel. OCC is staffed with four lawyers in the Washington
   headquarters of EDA (the Chief Counsel and three attorney-advisors),
   regional counsels in each of EDA's six regional offices, and an
   additional regional attorney in three of the regional offices.

   Most, but not all, of EDA's legal needs are served by OCC, notably all
   program-related matters including pre- and post-approval project
   reviews and grant property management issues. As most of EDA's program
   responsibility has been delegated to its regional offices, most legal
   reviews take place there as well. Regional lawyers provide advice to
   regional EDA staff, referring matters to OCC headquarters or to OGC
   offices as appropriate. The regional office lawyers also handle
   regional Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, legal aspects of
   audit matters before they are referred to headquarters, and grant
   project legal issues such as adequacy of title, form and content of
   security instruments and covenants, and interpretations of specific
   project conditions.

   Headquarters lawyers manage EDA legal policy and the legal aspects of
   legislative and regulatory drafting and interpretation, and of audit
   appeals and resolutions; handle all denials of FOIA documents; respond
   to Departmental and EDA headquarters FOIA and Privacy Act requests and
   Congressional inquiries; assist in debt collection and loan and grant
   property management matters; review project awards, correspondence, and
   other activities that take place in headquarters; and generally advise
   EDA senior management on all aspects of EDA's responsibilities.

   In Washington, D.C., OCC lawyers are located in room 7005, Main
   Commerce Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, Northwest,
   Washington DC, 20230, telephone (202) 482-4687, fax (202) 482-5671.
