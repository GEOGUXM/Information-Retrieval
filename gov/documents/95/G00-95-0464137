   HOU Student Research

      Student research and investigations is a key component of the HOU
      project. Many students have used HOU to explore astronomical phenomena
      and have written web-based reports. Some examples of their work is
      provided here.

      HOU teachers and Teacher Resource Agents are working with the HOU staff
      to develop more substantial ongoing projects where teachers, students
      and scientists work together on original research, such as the HOU
      Asteroid Search. More projects are being developed this year.
