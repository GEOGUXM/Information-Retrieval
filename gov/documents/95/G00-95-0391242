                         Hints on Query Formulation


     * All terms are equally weighted in the query.

                It is not necessary that the first word in your query be
                the most important or the broadest in scope. Because the
                terms are equally weighted, searching one topic at a time
                will filter the most valuable documents for that
                particular search.

     * Lots of common words get removed from the query. You can use them,
       but they will be stripped out of the query.

                Examples are: "and", "not", "the", "am", "about", etc. Try
                to confine your searches to adjectives and nouns.

     * Quoted strings (text surrounded by quotation marks) will perform an
       exact match.

                For example the search string "space shuttle" will only
                find documents where space and shuttle occur next to one
                another. If however, you search for space shuttle (without
                quotations), you will retrieve any document that contains
                the words space and/or shuttle.

     * In the U.S. Code database, if you are trying to locate a particular
       passage, do not separate a cited passage with a colon.

                In this database, you must separate the passage with USC.
                For example, if you are trying to locate 5 USC 552,
                formulate the query as "5 USC 552" not "5:552".

     * In the Code of Federal Regulations database, if you are trying to
       locate a particular passage, separate the Title and Part by a
       colon.

                Do not include the abbreviation CFR if you are searching a
                particular passage within the document. Cited passages in
                the database are arranged with a colon, not with CFR. For
                example, if you are trying to locate "40 CFR 265" your
                search string should be "40:265".

     * Search for the appropriate document within the appropriate
       database.

                In other words, do not attempt to locate a particular
                numbered CFR passage under the U.S. Code. Keep in mind
                that these documents are codified differently in each
                resource.
