                                          Federal Funding Sources for Habitat Restoration
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Funding for Habitat Restoration Projects: A Citizen's Guide" is a
   resource developed by Restore America's Estuaries to help individuals,
   organizations and agencies access federal assistance in support of
   community based habitat restoration. Numerous federal programs can
   support habitat restoration activities.

   This on-line database is intended to provide access to information on
   available federal funding sources for habitat restoration projects.
   Users can query the information for one, several, or all of the funding
   programs based on program, agency, funding support type and funding
   amount. Results are returned in formats that can be viewed or
   downloaded in different ways (HTML, Excel, ASCII).

   Select one of the four query options below to return information about
   Federal restoration funding sources:
     * Funding Program - query programs in three different ways: view all
       programs by fiscal year, view selected programs by fiscal year, or
       view chart of funding amounts for a selected program.
     * Funding Agency - query by agency in four different ways: view all
       programs for a specific agency(s), view selected programs for a
       specific agency, view chart of funding amounts for all programs
       within a specific agency by fiscal year, or view chart of total
       funding for all agencies by fiscal year.
     * Funding Support Type - query by selected funding support type (e.g.
       grants, loans, etc.).
     * Funding Amount - query by program or agency for funding amounts in
       two different ways: view all programs sorted by funding amount, or
       view all programs for a selected agency(s) sorted by funding
       amount.
