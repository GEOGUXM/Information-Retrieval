   Links to Laboratory Partners
     * Argonne National Laboratory's (ANL) Transportation Technology R&D
       Center
       ANL focuses its research on developing cleaner and more efficient
       automobiles and heavy vehicles as well as improving transportation
       systems such as traffic flow, safety, and security.
     * Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory's (INEEL)
       Transportation Infrastructure
       INEEL currently supports national priorities for transportation in
       the areas of advanced automotive technologies and alternative
       fuels, including key programs in energy storage, materials, and
       sensors.
     * Lawrence Berkley Laboratory's (LBL) Transportation Energy Policy
       Analysis
       LBL analyzes how the combination of vehicle technology, land-use
       patterns and driving behavior affect the energy use, and greenhouse
       gas emissions in the transportation sector.
     * National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Biotechnology
       Division
       NREL performs biofuels conversion technology development for the
       Office of Fuels Development's Biofuels Program. The scientists and
       engineers in NREL's Biotechnology Division for Fuels and Chemicals
       work with industry to develop ethanol-from-biomass and related
       technologies.
     * National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Center for Transportation
       Technologies and Systems
       NREL works on advanced transportation systems such as fuels
       assessment, hybrid electric vehicle development, light/medium/heavy
       vehicle demonstrations, systems design, fuel cell development,
       global impacts, and emissions testing.
     * Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) Transportation Technologies
       Program
       ORNL conducts innovative, cost-effective research and development
       on transportation energy and environmental issues, national
       transportation planning and policy, transportation systems
       engineering, and military transportation and logistics.
     * Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
       PNNL works on various advanced transportation technologies such as
       fuel cells, heat pumps and exhaust control, automotive air
       conditioner concepts, fuel processors for automotive fuel cells and
       more.
     * Sandia National Laboratories, Combustion Research Facility (CRF)
       The CRF is the DOE's principal user facility for combustion
       research, providing laboratories, up-to-date optical and
       mass-spectroscopic diagnostics, and staff support for fundamental
       and applied combustion research. In the transportation area, the
       CRF has active research programs in alternative fuels, heavy-duty
       diesel and homogeneous-charge compression-ignition engines, soot
       generation and detection, and exhaust gas recirculation.
