    Not just building a bridge, a road, an airport, a port, or a transit
                     station, but building a community.

   Welcome to the Department of Transportation's Livability Initiative
   home page.  Take a look at What's New in our web.

   Transportation plays a critical role in community livability.  As the
   transportation planning process guides states and localities in
   developing transportation plans and programs to serve their people,
   transportation links safety concerns, land use development,
   environmental quality, attention to the needs of disadvantaged
   populations, and economic development into an integrated approach to
   community livability.

   This website provides information on how communities across the nation
   have used their transportation funds and programs to make their homes
   better places in which to live, work and play.
