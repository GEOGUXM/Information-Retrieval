                         Descriptions of Query Operators

     The InQuery search engine supports two different types of queries:
       * Natural language
       * Structured

     The natural language queries enables the user to type the information
     request as an English (or other language) sentence. The InQuery
     query-processor transforms these queries into a structured form which
     can then be processed by the query engine.

     The structured queries require the user to input the query in a
     structured format. By directly inputting a structured query, the user
     is able to provide more exact information about the relationship of
     terms in the query. This can improve performance, but requires a
     knowledgeable user to properly formulate the query using the special
     operators provided.

     The INQUERY search engine developed by the Center for Intelligent
     Information Retrieval.

     Note: In the following examples, the query operators may be shown as
     upper or lower case. The operator input is not case sensitive.

     The available operators (in the general order of common usage) are as
     follows:
       * Sum Operator: #sum (T1 ...Tn )

     The terms or nodes contained in the sum operator are treated as having
     equal influence on the final result. The belief values provided by the
     arguments of the sum are averaged to produce the belief value of the
     #sum node.

     This is the default operator used by InQuery. When you type a sentence
     like "vacationing in Florida" the system converts this to:


  Example:

          #sum(vacation Florida)

          Notice the "in" is gone; it's a stop word.
       * Weighted Sum Operator: #wsum (Ws W1 T1 ... Wn Tn)

     The terms or nodes contained in the WSUM operator contribute unequally
     to the final result according to the weight associated with each (Wx).
     The final belief value is scaled by Ws, the weight associated with the
     #wsum itself.


  Example:

          #wsum(1.0 10.0 vacation 50 Florida)

          This example will weight Florida 5 times as heavily as vacation.
       * Ordered Distance Operator: #N (T1 ... Tn) or #odN (T1 ... Tn)

     The terms within an ordered distance operator must be found within N
     words of each other in the text in order to contribute to the
     document's belief value. The #N version is an abbreviation of #odN,
     thus #3(health care) is equivalent to #od3(health care).
       * And Operator: #and(T1 ... Tn)

     The more terms contained in the AND operator which are found in a
     document, the higher the belief value of that document. This operator
     is very similar to the #sum operator, it is not a Boolean operator. Not
     all of the terms listed in the #and must be found for the group to
     contribute to the overall relevance score.
       * Boolean And Operator: #band(T1 ... Tn)

     All of the terms within a BAND operator must be found in a document in
     order for this operator to contribute to the belief value of that
     document.


  Example:

          #band(vacationing Florida)

          Both terms must exist for the group to contribute to the belief score.
       * Boolean And Not: #bandnot (T N)

     Search for document matching the first argument but not the second.
       * Or Operator: #or(T1 ... Tn)

     One of terms within the OR operator must be found in a document for
     that document to get credit for this operator.
       * Negation Operator: #not(T1 ... Tn)

     The terms or nodes contained in this operator are negated so that
     documents which do not contain them are rewarded.
       * Unordered Window Operator: #uwN(T1 ... Tn)

     The terms contained in a UWN operator must be found in any order within
     a window of N words in order for this operator to contribute to the
     belief value of the document.
       * Phrase Operator: #phrase(T1 ... Tn)

     Terms within this operator are evaluated to determine if they occur
     together frequently in the collection. If they do, the operator is
     treated as an ordered distance operator of 3 (#od3). If the arguments
     are not found to co-occur in the database, the phrase operator is
     turned into a SUM operator. In ambiguous cases the phrase becomes the
     MAX of the SUM and the OD3 operators.

     Basically, this function will maximize the belief score of the items
     contained in the operator.
       * Passage Operator: #passageN(T1 ... Tn)

     The passage operator looks for the terms or nodes within the operator
     to be found in a passage window of N words. The document is rated based
     upon the score of its best passage.


  Example:

          If you have a database of news articles, some section of each document
          will be the best or most relevant passage in the document.

          #passage50(vacation Florida) will only use the belief score from the
          best passage of each document in scoring the documents.
       * Synonym Operator: #syn(T1 ... Tn)

     The terms of the operator are treated as instances of the same term.


  Example:

          #syn(computer pc) will treat the words computer and pc as the same
          thing. If computer exists 3 times in a document and pc exists 4 times,
          the #syn operator will result in a belief score based on the term
          existing 7 times.
       * Maximum Operator: #max(T1 ... Tn)

     The maximum belief value of all the terms or nodes contained in the MAX
     operator is taken to be the belief value of this operator.
       * Weight Plus Operator: #+ T1

     The effect of the term or node T1 is increased relative to the rest of
     the query.


  Example:

          vacation (#+ Florida) will weight the term Florida more heavily than
          the term vacation in all searched documents.
       * Weight Minus Operator: #- T1

     The effect of the term or node T1 is decreased relative to the rest of
     the query.


  Example:

          vacation (#- Florida) will weight the term Florida less heavily than
          the term vacation in all searched documents.
       * Literal Operator: #lit(T1 ... Tn)

     This operator preserves the original forms of the terms contained
     within it. No stemming or stopping is performed and capitalization is
     preserved.

     This is the operator you'd use to search for exact strings: #lit(Four
     score and seven years ago) will only contribute to the score of an
     evaluated document if that exact phrase is encountered.

     The #lit operator is especially useful when searching on a DOCID field.


  Example:

          #field(DOCID #lit(weird-xid_string))
       * Filter Require: #filreq(arg1 arg2)

     Use the documents returned (belief list) for the first argument if and
     only if the second argument would return documents. The value of the
     second argument does not effect the belief values of the first
     argument, only whether they will be returned or not.
       * Filter Reject: #filrej(arg1 arg2)

     Use the documents returned by the first argument if and only if there
     were no documents returned by the second argument. The value of the
     second argument does not effect the belief values of the first
     argument, only whether they will be returned or not.
       * Field Operator: #field( FIELD-NAME #REL-OP T1 ... Tn)

     The terms contained in a FIELD operator are searched only within the
     FIELD-NAME specified. The relational operator (REL-OP) allows fields to
     be searched for ranges of values. If the REL-OP is missing, equality is
     used by default.

     Range Operators Used with #field


  Equivalent Forms

                  Meaning

  #gt #>

                  greater than

  #gte #>=

                  greater than or equal to

  #lt #<

                  less than

  #lte #<=

                  less than or equal to

  #ne #neq #!=

                  not equal to

  #eq #==

                  equal to (default and may be omitted)

     These operators can be combined and nested to produce the desired
     result. For example a simple structured query might be a sum of a term
     and an ordered distance operator:

     #sum( reform #2(health care) )

     This query would find documents which contained the term reform and the
     two terms health and care occurring at most 2 words apart.

     A primary rule in formulating structured queries is that "belief
     operators" may not occur inside of "proximity operators". This is
     because proximity lists (the basic unit of InQuery knowledge) can be
     converted to a belief list (a score or weight), but belief lists may
     not be converted to proximity lists.

     Unranked Boolean Operators

     The following operators are "pure" Boolean operators, that is, they do
     not cause a belief value to be calculated for a document. Instead,
     their belief values are either 0 or 1; they either satisfy the query
     conditions or they dont. These operators do not include the concept of
     how well the query is satisfied.

     When using unranked Boolean operators, the result set is not ranked
     since there are no varying belief scores to sort by. Since belief
     scores are not calculated and results are not sorted, unranked Boolean
     operators are faster than ranked operators.

     In those situations where only the top N documents are needed, unranked
     Boolean operators are much faster. In these situations, once N
     documents are found during query evaluation, the documents can be
     returned. It is not necessary to look for all the possible document
     "hits" and rank them before selecting the top N documents to return.

     Since the same queries can be done using ranked Boolean operators (with
     the added advantage of probabilistic evaluation), the unranked Boolean
     Operators should only be used when their added speed is important and
     the query can be phrased in such a way that the results will, as much
     as possible, only include those documents which are meaningful. Or,
     they can be used in cases where the user is performing a more general
     search and any set of documents with the indicated terms will be
     considered by the user.

     Note: Unranked Boolean operators should not be mixed with ranked
     operators except for the #filreq (filter require) and the #filrej
     (filter reject) operators.

     Wrong mix of operators, ranked and unranked:

     #sum(#uband(California vacationing) #uband(Florida vacationing))

     Right mix of operators, all unranked:

     #ubor(#uband(California vacationing) #uband(Florida vacationing))

     Right mix of operators, unranked are part of a filter reject operator:

     #filrej( #sum(rafting kayaking #phrase (water sports))

     #ubor (Florida California)))
       * Unranked Boolean And Operator: #uband(T1Tn)

     All of the terms within a UBAND operator must be found in a document
     for it to be selected. This operator is similar to the BAND operator,
     but, unlike BAND, belief values are not calculated and therefore the
     returned documents are not ranked. Instead, all of the documents
     returned will have a belief score of 1.0.


  Example:

          #uband(vacationing Florida)
          Both vacationing and Florida must exist for the document to be
          selected.
       * Unranked Boolean And Not Operator: #ubandnot(T1 T2)

     The operator searches for documents whose terms match the first
     argument (T1) but not the second (T2). It is similar to the BANDNOT
     operator but, unlike BANDNOT, belief values are not calculated and
     therefore the returned documents are not ranked. Instead, all of the
     documents returned will have a belief score of 1.0.


  Example:

          #ubandnot(vacationing Florida)
          To be selected, the document must include vacationing but it cannot
          include the term Florida.
       * Unranked Boolean Or Operator: #ubor(T1Tn)

     The operator searches for documents whose terms match any of the
     arguments (T1 through Tn). It is similar to the OR operator but, unlike
     OR, belief values are not calculated and therefore the returned
     documents are not ranked. Instead, all of the documents returned will
     have a belief score of 1.0.


  Example:

          #ubor(rafting kayaking canoeing)
          To be selected, the document only needs to include one of the three
          terms: rafting, kayaking, or canoeing. It can include more than one
          term.

     Examples of Nested Unranked Boolean Operators

     The following query will get documents about either rafting or
     kayaking, but not about Florida or California:

     #ubandnot (#ubor(rafting kayaking) #ubor (Florida California))

     The following query will get documents about both rafting and kayaking
     in either Florida or California:

     #uband (#uband(rafting kayaking) #ubor (Florida California))

     Filter Require Example Using Ranked and Unranked Operators

     As stated before unranked Boolean operators should not be mixed with
     ranked operators except when used with the #filreq (filter require)and
     the #filrej (filter reject) operators . In the case of the filter
     operators, the second argument is not used for ranking; it is only used
     to determine if the documents should be returned at all.

     In the following example, the user wants articles about rafting or
     kayaking or anything that mentions water sports, but the user does not
     want articles that deal with these topics in Florida or California
     since the user has already vacationed there.

     #filrej( #sum(rafting kayaking #phrase (water sports))

     #ubor (Florida California)))

     List of Query Operators by Type

     Below is a list of InQuery structured language operators by their type.


  Belief List Operators

                                   Proximity List Operators

  #sum

                                   term

  #or

                                   #syn

  #and

                                   #n (same as #od)

  #not

                                   #uw (same as #uwn)

  #max

                                   #phrase

  #wsum

  #passageN

  #band

  #field

  #bandnot

  #filreq (same as #filter-require)

  #filrej (same as #filter-reject)

  #lit

  Unranked Boolean Operators

  #uband

  #ubandnot

  #ubor

                               Examples Using the
                             Ranked Query Operators

  Simple Queries

       * Find information about Bart Simpson (general OR type logic)

     #sum(Bart Simpson) = #sum(bart simpson)

     Note: The InQuery engine is case insensitive.

     This will find documents about bart simpson, or documents about anyone
     or anything named bart or anyone/anything named simpson.
       * Find information about only Bart Simpson (AND type logic)

     #1(Bart Simpson))

     This will find documents where the word bart and simpson occur within
     one word of each other. Again this is case insensitive.
       * Find information about anything but bart simpson (NOT type logic)

     #sum(#not(Bart Simpson) lisa)

     This will find documents that talk about lisa but don't mention bart
     simpson.

     Note: This will cause documents about lisa simpson to be given a low
     score because they include the word simpson.

  Complex Queries

       * Information about the last British Open won by Jack Nicklaus

     #sum(last british open won by #1(Jack Nicklaus))

     This will rank documents talking about the last british open won by
     Jack Nicklaus highest, but will also find documents mentioning Jack
     Nicklaus or the British open.

     Note: Remember InQuery is a probabilistic engine, it will do the best
     it can with your query. In this method of operating, a document about
     Britain is better than no document at all.
       * Find a document mentioning all three terms: elvis presley
         graceland, and the document must also include something about
         country or rock.

     #sum(#filter_require(#band(elvis presley graceland)) #syn(country
     rock))

     This query will require that all three terms elvis presley and
     graceland appear in the document. It will also score documents with the
     word country or rock higher than documents without those terms.
