   Freedom of Information Act

         Welcome to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Home Page of the
          Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The Commission has
      developed this Home Page to assist you in obtaining public information
      from the public reading room (referred to as the Public Reference Room)
       and in obtaining nonpublic or privileged information by submitting a
       FOIA request to the Office of External Affairs. We hope the Home Page
        will also help answer questions you may have about the statutes and
                            regulations regarding FOIA.
