   RIPPLE is a model for transient, two-dimensional flows of
   incompressible fluids with surface tension on free surfaces of general
   shape. Such flows include ink-jet printers, application of industrial
   surfactants, casting and mold-filling applications, and dynamics of
   drops and bubbles. Surface tension is modeled as a volume force derived
   from the continuum-surface-force model, which gives RIPPLE both
   robustness and accuracy in modeling surface tension effects at the free
   surface as well as wall-adhesion effects.

                               RIPPLE Features

     * Finite difference discretization on an Eulerian, rectilinear mesh
       in Cartesian or cylindrical geometry.
     * Free surfaces are modeled as volume-of-fluid (VOF) data on the
       mesh.
     * A two-step projection method is used to solve for the
       incompressible flow.
     * Pressure Poisson equation is solved via a robust incomplete
       Cholesky conjugate gradient technique.
     * Flow obstacles and curved interior boundaries are representable
       with a partial-cell treatment.
