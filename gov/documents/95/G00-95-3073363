Researchers Identify Potential Treatment for Learning Disability in
Neurofibromatosis

   For release: Wednesday, January 16, 2002

   Researchers studying learning disabilities associated with
   neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, have traced the problem to excessive
   activity of a crucial signaling molecule and have successfully reversed
   the disabilities in mice by giving them an experimental drug. The
   findings provide hope that these learning problems may one day be
   treatable in humans.

Immunotherapy Treatment Shows Dramatic Results for Rare Neurological Disorder

   For release: Wednesday, December 26, 2001

   An immunologic therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), administered
   to patients suffering from stiff person syndrome (SPS), provides
   dramatic relief from disabling symptoms, according to a study appearing
   in the December 27, 2001, issue of The New England Journal of
   Medicine.* The study's principal author, Marinos C. Dalakas, M.D.,
   chief of the Neuromuscular Diseases Section of the National Institute
   of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says that the success of the
   treatment supports the theory that SPS is the result of an autoimmune
   response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.

Delayed Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury May Improve Recovery

   For release: Saturday, December 01, 2001

   Rats given an experimental therapy several weeks after their spinal
   cords were severed showed dramatically greater regrowth of nerve fibers
   and recovery of function than rats treated immediately after injury, a
   new study shows. The report suggests that the window of opportunity for
   treating spinal cord injury may be wider than previously anticipated.

   double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 2,206 patients at 48
   participating centersthe largest trial to date comparing aspirin to
   warfarin for recurrent stroke prevention. The study was sponsored by
   the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

Estrogen Doesn't Prevent Second Strokes: Protective Effects of Hormone
Replacement Therapy Challenged

   For release: Thursday, October 25, 2001

   Estrogen hormone replacement therapy does not reduce the risk of stroke

   prevention of cerebrovascular disease.

Safe Effective Treatment to Stop Seizures Can Be Delivered Outside of the
Hospital

   For release: Wednesday, August 29, 2001

   A new study shows that paramedics can safely and effectively treat
   patients who are suffering from acute and prolonged seizures with
   injections of benzodiazepines, a mild form of tranquilizers. In 59
   percent of patients who received lorazepam, and in 43 percent of
   patients treated with diazepam, the seizures stopped before they
   arrived at the emergency department. Conversely, only 21 percent of
   patients in the placebo group arrived at the hospital seizure free.
