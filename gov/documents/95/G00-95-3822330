      the U.S.?

      In 1999, there were 5.7 million occupational injuries and illnesses
      among U.S. workers. Approximately 6.3 of every 100 workers experienced

      the job. For more information, to to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
      Webs Site, Safety and Health Statistics page.

      What are OSHA's inspection priorities?

      Top priority are reports of imminent dangers-accidents about to happen;
      second are fatalities or accidents serious enough to send three or more
      workers to the hospital. Third are employee complaints. Referrals from
      other government agencies are fourth. Fifth are targeted
      inspections-such as the Site Specific Targeting Program, which focuses
      on employers that report high injury and illness rates, and special
      emphasis programs that zero in on hazardous work such as trenching or
      equipment such as mechanical power presses. Follow-up inspections are
      the final priority.

      What's the penalty for violating an OSHA standard?

      OSHA penalties range from $0 to $70,000, depending upon how likely the
      violation is to result in serious harm to workers. Other-than-serious
      violations often carry no penalties but may result in penalties of up
      to $7,000. Serious violations and may have penalties up to $7,000.
      Repeat and willful violations may have penalties as high as $70,000.
      Penalties may be discounted if an employer has a small number of
      employees, has demonstrated good faith, or has few or no previous
      violations. For more information on OSHA penalties, see Section 17 of
      the OSH Act or information on penalties in the OSHA Publication All

      following issuance of citations.

      The OSHA Strategic Partnership Program is for employers with varied
