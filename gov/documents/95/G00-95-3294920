   Global Ionospheric Maps

   Data from over 100+ continuously operating GPS receivers in a global
   network are being used to produce global maps of the ionosphere's total
   electron content (TEC). These Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM) provide
   instantaneous "snapshots" of the global TEC distribution, by
   interpolating, in both space and time, the 6-8 simultaneous TEC
   measurements obtained from each GPS receiver every 30 seconds. The maps
   can be produced unattended in a real-time mode, with an update rate of
   5-15 minutes.

   Monitoring Global Ionospheric Weather

   GIM
   GIMs represent a new tool for monitoring global patterns of ionospheric
   weather, a key component of the space weather, which is driven by
   changes in solar ultra-violet radiation, the interplanetary particle
   stream known as the solar wind, and the underlying composition, wind
   patterns and electrodynamics of the thermosphere (the upper atmosphere
   at altitudes between 100 and 1000 km). GIMs are being used for global
   ionospheric delay calibrations, for scientific investigations of the
   upper atmosphere, and will be an important data source for the National
   Space Weather Program.
