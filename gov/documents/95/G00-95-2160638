     * A HYDRAULIC AND GEOMORPHIC ANALYSIS OF STEP-POOL STRUCTURES

     This study was conducted to identify the geomorphic and hydraulic
     characteristics of natural step-pool structures in steep mountain
     channels. Design procedures for the installation of boulder-step
     structures were developed, providing guidance for integrating
     step-pool structures as functioning, low-maintenance channel
     restoration/rehabilitation components.
