                         California Wing - Join Us!

   Civil Air Patrol membership offers a lot of great benefits.  Not the
   least is getting to meet some really fine people.  And that's really
   the first step to joining the CAP in California.
   We recommend that you find a unit in your area, and drop in for a
   visit.   Use the California Units link to find the group that serves
   your community, then look up a nearby squadron.  You might want to
   visit more than one local unit, as individual squadrons tend to have
   their own personalities.   For example, one cadet squadron might
   emphasize drill while another might focus on aerospace education.  Each
   unit will tailor its program to meet the needs of the members as well
   as best utilize the resources available in terms of facilities and
   members.
   One thing to keep in mind is that there are three types of squadrons in
   CAP:
     * Senior Squadrons - Mission oriented with a program for adults only

     * Cadet Squadrons - Tailored mainly for the youth program, with
       adults helping to run the youth program

     * Composite Squadrons - These units feature separate programs for
       youth and adults

   If you can't find a unit in your area, contact the webmaster stating
   what you are looking for, and he'll do his best to make a good
   suggestion for you, and even arrange an appointment to visit if you
   like!
