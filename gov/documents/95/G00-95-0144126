   Highway Maintenance Cost Comparisons with National Average
   The comparison of physical maintenance expenditures shows that
   Washington's costs are $7,487 per system mile, while the nationwide
   average of 50 states' costs is $9,597 per system mile. WSDOT is 22%
   below the average expenditure per system mile nationwide. This trend
   indicating Washington to be lower than average cost holds for almost
   all functional classes. Read more...

An Overwhelmed Transportation System, And, What to Do About It

   Providing adequate funding for Washingtons Transportation system has
   been a lively topic in the news across the state. There are almost as
   many opinions about the subject as there are people who live here.

   The Washington State Department of Transportation has been sorting
   through a variety of research and data to help explain how we got into
   this transportation mess, and to provide some ideas on what to do about
   it.

   The document, An Overwhelmed Transportation System and What to Do
   About It (pdf, 1mb), is the result of this effort. It provides a 20
   year look at Washingtons growth, gas tax, and comparisons with other
   states. It shows how growth has affected the transportation system and
   discusses the economic, safety and quality-of-life impacts as a result.
   And, it also talks about how to make things better - by maximizing use
   of all transportation options, clearing incidents quicker, and funding
   projects that improve congestion, freight movement, safety and the
   environment. Take a look and let us know what you think.

WSDOT Mission Statement
