   Welcome to the City of Lodi's 2001 State of City presentation.  The
   City of Lodi, in cooperation with InReach Internet, is proud to make
   available the following pictures and information collected over the
   past year celebrating Lodi's economic and cultural growth.

   You may access the presentation in two ways:


   Web Browser

   This works best with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher.  Slower
   computers may need to run their browser in a small window to help
   performance.  Also, a high-speed connection will help since there are
   many high-resolution photographs throughout this exciting show.
   PowerPoint

   If you are having technical difficulties viewing the presentation live,
   we have made available an option to download it to your computer.  You
   must have Microsoft PowerPoint 2000 or greater installed to view it.
   Note that the file is roughly 35 megs.  On a T1 or DSL line this will
   only take a few minutes to download.  We do not recommend you download
   this with a standard modem connection.

   To save the file to your computer for off-line viewing, right-click on
   the link above and chose Save As.
