    Product Data Standards for Capital Facilities Improving Equipment and System
    Design, Fabrication and Installation

    Principal Investigator: Mark E. Palmer   Revised: 1/25/2002

      __________________________________________________________________

    Objective:

    To assist U.S. industries in developing and implementing data exchange
    standards, XML specifications and work process improvements which
    reduce the life cycle costs and risks for the design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of capital facilities.

    Problem:

    U.S industries seek to improve the design, delivery and operation of
    capital facilities through advanced uses of information technologies,
    e.g., CADD, CAE, CAM, ERP, SCM and eCommerce (computer-aided design and
    drafting, computer-aided engineering, computer-aided manufacturing,
    enterprise resource planning, supply chain management and internet
    enabled transactions), and the integration of the information systems,
    e.g., automation of the exchange and sharing of information among
    systems. Although many of the leading engineering organizations have
    adopted 3D modeling, project web sites, and information integration
    technologies in the design and initial documentation phases of
    projects, the capabilities and benefits of these technologies are not
    being exploited in the procurement, fabrication, inspection and
    construction phases. Additionally, the use of engineering and
    construction information for facility maintenance, repair and
    operations is restricted by the lack of effective information sharing
    and re-use capabilities.
    There are numerous developments of overlapping and incompatible
    eCommerce systems related to engineering and construction, repeating
    electronically the chaos of the paper-based work processes. Engineering
    and construction businesses face the challenge that everyone configures
    their eCommerce systems differently. There is minimal convergence on
    nomenclature, XML specifications and API (Application Program
    Interface) functionality to support the design, delivery and operation
    of constructed facilities.
    The many computerized systems in use for the design, procurement and
    construction of facilities can be integrated only at great cost because
    of their incompatible proprietary representations of information.
    Standard, neutral information representations, exchange methods and
    transaction capabilities are needed that allow system vendors to be
    innovative and yet allow system users to exchange and share information
    about capital facilities automatically.

    Approach:

    This project works with the process, semiconductor,
    shipbuilding, engineering, construction, pipe fabrication and
    information
    technologies industries to resolve the described problems and to
    advance the
    industries to a new level of capabilities. The international standard
    ISO 10303
    -Product Data Representation and Exchange, commonly known as STEP
    (Standard for
    the Exchange of Product model data) and the evolving XML infrastructure
    are
    providing base technologies for developing exchange and transaction
    protocols
    for technical information on constructed facilities.

    During FY2002, and in collaboration with FIATECH, Construction Industry
    Institute, PlantSTEP, Inc., the U.S Navy and the U.S. MARITECH Program,
    this
    project will:

      Investigate the state of the construction industries eBusiness
      capabilities, problems and priorities

      Investigate the state of construction supply chain performance and
      problems

      Develop Guidelines on Improving Construction Supply Chain
      Performance

      Resolve ISO ballot comments on the Committee Draft of ISO 10303-227
      (STEP
      AP 227) Edition 2 for support of:

      piping engineering, shop fabrication, inspection, installation and
      system turn-over

      equipment design and installation

      HVAC system design and installation

      cable tray spatial layout and installation

      improved catalog referencing capabilities

      change management

      Develop the ISO Technical Report for the Test Suite for AP 227
      Edition 2

      Develop the Draft International Standard for ISO 10303-227 Edition 2

      Participate in PlantSTEP and FIATECH (Fully-Integrated and Automated
      Project Processes Technologies) and monitor the ISO TC184/SC4
      projects
      relevant to BFRL and FIATECH.

      Lead the CII Project Team 172 "Improving Construction Supply Chain
      Performance" to develop baseline analyses of current construction
      supply
      chains and produce recommendations for improved work processes and
      IT
      infrastructure.

      Lead the FIATECH eBusiness for Capital Facilities program
