   VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network January 30, 2002
   VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network

   The VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network is a fully integrated,
   comprehensive healthcare system dedicated to providing quality
   healthcare services to AmericaÂ’s veterans with dignity and compassion.
   More than 1.8 million in eleven Southern California counties and four
   Southern Nevada counties can access primary and specialized care as
   well as related medical and social support services covering the full
   healthcare continuum. Most services are provided through an alliance of
   VA Medical Centers located in West Los Angeles, Loma Linda, Long Beach,
   San Diego, Las Vegas, and Community Outpatient Clinics strategically
   located in Southern California and Southern Nevada. Fee-for-service
   arrangements with private sector partners provide additional services,
   including organ transplantation.

   Network Director Kenneth J. Clark assumed leadership of the network in
   September 2000.

   We envision a healthcare system that realizes continued user growth, is
   responsive to veteran needs, and serves as a benchmark for health care
   value in the United States. We employ innovative approaches to better
   meet the challenging task of providing extensive services and quality
   care to an aging veteran population residing in a geographic area
   spanning more than 110,000 square miles.

   In addition to providing quality healthcare, the VA Desert Pacific
   Healthcare Network is a leader in medical education and research. Brief
   descriptions of VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network facilities and
   programs illustrate the value and purpose of this healthcare
   organization.
