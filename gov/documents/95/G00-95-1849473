   The national MPA Initiative must involve people within and outside of
   government. Executive Order 13158 mandates that a marine protected area
   advisory committee be established to provide expert advice and
   recommendations to the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior on the
   development of a national system of marine protected areas. This page
   includes information on the committee's charter, organization, and
   business activities.

   Establishing the Committee

   Executive Order 13158 directs federal agencies to strengthen the
   management, protection and conservation of existing MPAs, and to
   establish new MPAs, as necessary, to attain a scientifically based,
   comprehensive national system of MPAs. Section 4(c) of the Executive
   Order states: "In carrying out the requirements of this section, the
   Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior shall seek
   the expert advice and recommendations of non-Federal scientists,
   resource managers, and other interested persons and organizations
   through a Marine Protected Area Federal Advisory Committee. The
   Committee shall be established by the Department of Commerce."

   Nominations

   On June 4, 2001, Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans released a
   statement announcing the Administrations retention of Executive Order
   13158 on marine protected areas. The Secretary also announced his
   intention to appoint a Marine Protected Area Advisory Committee as
   required by the Executive Order. To complete this task, on August 10,
   2001, a notice was posted in the Federal Register announcing the 30 day
   reopening of the MPA Advisory Committee nomination process.
   All nominations received during the prior nomination period (August -
   October 2000) will be considered, along with any new nominations
   received during the second nomination period, unless a nominee
   withdraws his or her application. No additional submission is required
   for those nominees from the prior nomination period. Prior nominees may
   submit new information or update their files. All nominations will be
   treated equally.
   Committee Charter

   The Committee will operate in accordance with the Federal Advisory
   Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 (5 U.S.C. App. 2). FACA requires the
   creation of a charter that details the committees objectives and
   duties, membership qualifications and terms, and administrative
   provisions. The charter was approved on December 18, 2000, and filed
   with relevant congressional committees and the Library of Congress.
