   Division Statement

   The Resource Economics and Social Sciences Division (RESSD) is located
   in the National Science and Technology Consortium of the Science and
   Technology deputy area of the Natural Resources Conservation Service
   (NRCS). The RESSD provides policy direction, coordination, and
   leadership for the social science disciplines, including
     * Agricultural and Resource Economics
     * Alternative Agricultural Enterprises and Agritourism
     * History
     * Environmental Psychology

   The Division assures that these activities are integrated with the
   planning and implementation of the nation-wide comprehensive resource
   conservation program of the NRCS. The Social Sciences Institute is also
   a part of this deputy area and works in conjunction with the RESSD.

   In our role of policy leadership for economics and social sciences we
   are concerned with providing the following:
    1. historical perspective on conservation programs for policy
       decisions;
    2. analyses for the Chief, USDA officials, the Congress on economic
       and social consequences of conservation policies in order to help
       assess legislative proposals and existing policies;
    3. national guidance to NRCS related to the Principles and Guidelines
       in order to satisfy legal responsibilities for project evaluation;
    4. national leadership for resource economics and social sciences,
       including the development of policies, procedures, and guidelines
       to help ensure efficient and equitable program implementation; and
    5. leadership for identifying and transmitting research needs to
       appropriate organizations and helping transfer research findings.

   Primary functions of the Division include:
    1. Ensures national technical policy coordination with other agencies,
       groups, and organizations in the areas of resource economics and
       social sciences.
    2. Addresses the social science and economic aspects of legislation
       and programs.
    3. Assures that the quality of all NRCS economic and social sciences
       activities conforms to NRCS and professional standards.

   In addition to our policy staff, numerous staff economists are
   affiliated with other programs, divisions, and staffs throughout NRCS
   and provide economic assistance.
