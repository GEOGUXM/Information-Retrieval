   The Consolidated Contract web pages are designed for use by DOH and 34
   Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) that contractually receive state and
   federal funds from various programs within the state Department of
   Health for local public health services. Using the Con Con web pages is
   a new mechanism for communicating and conducting contract-related
   business between LHJs and DOH.  We will rely on your feedback for
   improving the process.  You will be notified via email when changes are
   made to any of the web pages.

   This web site gives LHJs and DOH the most current information about the
   Consolidated Contract, such as contract amendments, policy changes, and
   issues for discussion.  It also gives LHJs and DOH electronic access to
   preliminary 2002 contract materials and enables electronic submission
   of completed contract materials to a single DOH mailbox for review and
   final contract preparation.
     * What's New for Con Con-related updates and changes.
     * LHJ Menu links to a listing of all 34 LHJs.  Click on your LHJ
       (e.g., Adams) to link to your LHJ's 2002 Preliminary Allocation
       Sheet, which lists by DOH program the projected funding levels for
       your preliminary 2002 Consolidated Contract.  Clicking on each
       individual program links you to the program web page so you can
       access that program's "application" materials.
