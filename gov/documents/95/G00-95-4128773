   Doing More in Less  April 1998
   Microgravity - Doing More In Less - features two NASA researchers as
   the guests and Dr. Shelley Canright as the NASA host. "Microgravity" is
   a term commonly applied to a condition of free-fall within a
   gravitational field in which the weight of an object is significantly
   reduced compared to its weight at rest on Earth. The NASA researchers
   will demonstrate to teachers and students the principles of
   microgravity, and will participate in classroom activities designed to
   demonstrate the effects of microgravity on objects in space. The
   program will also highlight a classroom experiment where students
   working in teams will collect and analyze data from the launch of
   "Fizzy-Tablet Rockets." U.S. Senator John Glenn (D. OH) makes an
   appearance to present viewers with a special message. Number sense and
   numeration, computation and estimation, measurement, probability and

   Planetary Landers  December 1997
   NASA seeks to answer fundamental questions about the universe just as
   earlier astronomers did. However, NASA scientists have space-based
   telescopes, space probes, orbiters and landers to explore the planets
   and to study the solar system. Engineers have the challenge to design a
   vehicle that meets the scientific requirements and that can place the
   lander safely onto a planet's surface.In this program, students will
   explore the design considerations that go into constructing a planetary
   lander and examine the mathematics behind the landing process. They
   will observe students conducting an experiment to investigate mass and
   velocity, in which different objects are dropped onto a "martian"
   surface. By working in pairs or small groups (during the program's
   Challenge Point), program viewers will better understand how research
   teams of NASA scientists, technicians and engineers must work together
   to complete large projects involving planetary landers.

   Flight Direction  October 1997
   NASA engineers and pilots constantly experiment with test designs and
   materials to make the best airplanes. Their experiments are done over
   long periods of time. They change their experiments by varying the
   conditions. In this program, students will be introduced to and will
   learn from former NASA test pilot Lee Person. They will observe
   students from McIntosh Elementary School (Newport News, VA) as these
   students conduct a paper airplane experiment in which different flight
   conditions are tested and changed. By working in pairs or small groups
   during the program's Challenge Point, program viewers will better
   understand how research teams of NASA engineers, technicians and pilots
   must work together to complete large projects involving airplanes.
