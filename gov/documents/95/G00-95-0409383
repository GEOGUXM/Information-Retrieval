                       Supported CAD Systems at Fermilab

   The Computing Division is the custodian of all supported CAD software
   in the laboratory. A supported system is one which receives software
   installations and upgrades, license contracts and negotiations with
   software vendors, and consulting services from the UNIX Application
   Support Group (CD/OSS/CSI) , a department within the Computing
   Division. All questions and concerns on CAD software can be directed to
   the Computing Division Help Desk, at extension 2345.

   Within the laboratory is a committee that was appointed by the
   directorate to monitor, and manage the affairs of CAD in the lab. The
   name of this committee is the CAD Tools Committee , chaired by Richard
   Andrews, BD.

   The CAD Tools Committee is composed of representatives from all the
   mechanical engineering groups in the lab.

   The CAD Tools Committee has developed a guideline for selecting a CAD
   Software product. The guideline, titled Guidelines to Selecting a CAD
   Software Package , document #DR0006 , can be found in the Computing
   Division User Library, WH8NE.

   The currently support CAD systems in the laboratory are:

   Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC)
          The SDRC products supported in the lab include the Drafting,
          Solid Modeling, and FEM software products. In 1987, the lab
          purchased limited and varied quantities of these products from
          SDRC. Access to these products is made available via a network
          license manager on UNIX platforms. The SDRC products are the
          primary CAD tools utilized in the lab. The version being used
          currently is ms6a.

   Manufacturing Consulting Services (MCS) / Anvil
   MCS/Anvil software is utilized primarily by the Technical Support
   Department machine shops for controlling numerical control equipment.
   Recently, in 1994, the lab acquired a small set of perpetual licenses
   of Anvil 5000, Design Drafting and Advanced Intelligent Modeler (AIM)
   products from MCS. These products expanded the usability of the MCS
   software for other mechanical engineering groups to utilize. The MCS
   products are supplemental products that pick-up and augment the
   capabilities of the SDRC products. Together, the SDRC products and the
   MCS products provide a rich, robust mechanical CAD environment. The MCS
   products are also made available via a network license manager on UNIX
   platforms.

   Automated Analysis Corporation / Ansys
   Ansys is a high-end, highly respected finite element modeling software
   that is utilized by a small portion of the mechanical CAD community.
   This software is available on UNIX platforms. Ansys extends the
   capabilities of the SDRC FEM product and the MCS AIM product.

   The scope of support for these systems in the laboratory is as follows:

  Statement of CAD Support Hours

   The Computing Division, UNIX Application Support Group provides
   technical support for CAD systems during regular business hours, 8-5
   M-F. The proper method, in order of priority, for obtaining support
   during these hours is as follows:
    1. Email to helpdesk@fnal.gov Include a description of the problem,
       the name of the machine that is experiencing the problem. Also
       include any/all error messages that are available relative to the
       problem.
    2. Contact the help desk at extension 2345.

   For support during weekends and after hours, the following procedure
   should be followed:
    1. Contact the help desk after hours number at extension 2345, leave a
       voicemail or enter "0" to get someone on the line. The scope of
       support for CAD systems during off hours is based on good will
       efforts. The help desk personal are not prepared to resolve a CAD
       issue. They will contact the staff in the Operating Systems Support
       via the helpdesk@fnal.gov address. A log of the problem will be
       sent to helpdesk@fnal and the problem will be addressed during the
       normal business hours.
