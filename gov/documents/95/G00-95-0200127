        The Ground Systems Department

        The Ground Systems Department (GSD) is in the business of implementing
        ground systems which support spaceflight operations. This includes the
        development and operation of voice systems, video systems, and
        virtually any data system (command, telemetry, planning, etc.) which
        our customers need to plan, train and fly our programs' missions.
