   12 Meter Antenna

   The 12 meter antenna was decommissioned in 1999.  The antenna still
   remains on the pad but all the control equipment inside the operations
   building have been removed.

   13 Meter Antennas

   13M X-Band Remote Sensing Satellite (RSS) Antenna System is a heavy
   duty,  all environment system offering precision pointing and autotrack
   accuracy.

     * The three-axis positioner provides uninterrupted operation in winds
       up to 30  m/sec.
     * Tracks both Low Earth Orbit satellites (LEO) and high velocity
       sources.
     * The positioner's unique 7 degree, 3rd axis wedge design allows
       overhead  tracking of very low altitude satellites.

   26 Meter Antenna

   The 26 meter antenna is a hydraulic powered antenna installed in the
   1960s and still operating today.


   Gilmore Creek Geophysical Observatory

   The 26 Meter radio telescope is used for Very Long
   Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for geodesy and astrometry
   observations.  VLBI web  site

   COSPAS-SARSAT

   COSPAS-SARSAT is an international satellite system for Search and
   Rescue (SAR).  It consists of a constellation of satellites in polar
   orbit and a network of earth stations which provide distress alert and
   location information to appropriate authorities anywhere in the world,
   for maritime, aviation and land users in distress.
