Mission-related Photo Galleries

   The galleries below are the same as those that are arrived at via the
   Recent Missions link on the Home Page. The intent of these galleries is
   to convey a sense of the environment at a mission deployment. Although
   scientists often get to travel to interesting and sometimes exotic
   locations, field work is extremely difficult involving long hours with
   little time off to explore the surroundings. Most of the photos in
   these galleries were taken on a few days off on a month long
   deployment. Hopefully, they will bring back fond memories of these
   deployments for those who were on them, and help instill interest in
   atmospheric research for those who were not.
