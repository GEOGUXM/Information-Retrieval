   Dear           :

         I am writing this letter to request an opportunity to meet with
   you to discuss an issue that the Social Security Advisory Board regards
   as of great importance to the American public. The Board is deeply
   concerned about the Social Security Administrations lack of capacity to
   provide the high quality of service that we think the public needs and
   deserves.

         Our concern is based on extensive study of operations at all
   levels of the agency. Over the last several years we have met with
   thousands of SSA and State disability agency employees throughout the
   country, examined agency reports and statistics, and held hearings to
   hear the views of the public. Our work has been conducted on a
   nonpartisan basis, and all of our reports have been issued by consensus
   and without dissent.

         Our most recent reports describing the service delivery problems
   of the agency include Agenda for Social Security: Challenges for the
   New Congress and the New Administration, issued in February 2001; and
   Charting the Future of Social Securitys Disability Programs: The Need
   for Fundamental Change, and Disability Decision Making: Data and
   Materials, both issued in January 2001. An earlier report regarding the
   agencys service delivery problems, How the Social Security
   Administration Can Improve Its Service to the Public, was issued in
   September 1999. Copies of these reports are enclosed.

        In our reports we have emphasized the fact that SSA urgently needs
   to make major changes in the way the Social Security and Supplemental
   Security programs are being administered and we have provided
   recommendations for what we believe needs to be done.

        But we also firmly believe that the agencys service delivery
   problems stem in large part from inadequate resources over a prolonged
   period of time. Over the last two decades, constraints on SSAs funding
   levels have required large-scale downsizing throughout the agency,
   resulting in staffing shortages in key parts of the organization.

        Since 1982, there has been a 29 percent reduction in the number of
   employees in field offices, teleservice centers, program service
   centers, and regional offices, most of whom provide front-line service
   to the public. Over this same period the number of Social Security and
   SSI beneficiaries has grown by 31 percent. Improvements in technology
   have made up for a portion but not all of the resource gap. Visitors to
   field offices, particularly those in large urban areas, experience
   overcrowded waiting rooms and lengthy waits for service. Telephone
   service is inadequate, both on the agencys 800 number and in field
   offices. Claimants who apply for disability often must wait for long
   periods of time to receive a decision as to whether they are disabled
   on average well over a year if they appeal their case to an
   administrative law judge or nearly three years if they continue their
   appeal to SSAs Appeals Council.

        There are numerous other serious service delivery shortfalls that
   are less visible. Field office employees lack sufficient time to
   provide the kind of assistance many applicants need to file a properly
   documented disability claim or to explain program rules and procedures
   so that applicants can understand whether they may meet the
   requirements of the Social Security disability definition and what
   items of information they need to document their case. Inadequate
   staffing levels and lack of time for appropriate training mean that
   work that is needed to maintain program integrity too often remains
   undone.

        The Board supports a funding level that would enable the agency to
   begin to address some of it most critical needs, including improving
   telephone service, shortening field office waiting times, speeding up
   and strengthening the quality of the disability claims process,
   increasing program integrity, addressing backlogs in postentitlement
   actions, and developing and implementing needed systems improvements in
   a timely way.

        The Board strongly recommends excluding the agencys administrative
   budget from the statutory cap that imposes an arbitrary limit on the
   amount of discretionary government spending. Both workers and employers
   contribute to the self-financed Social Security system. It is entirely
   appropriate that spending for administration of Social Security
   programs be set at a level that fits the needs of contributors and
   beneficiaries, rather than an arbitrary level that fits within the
   current government cap on discretionary spending.

        This action would improve substantially the likelihood that the
   agency will be able to meet the serious administrative challenges that
   it is facing. Excluding SSAs administrative budget from the
   discretionary cap need not lead to unrestrained spending by the agency.
   The Congress and the Administration can and should continue to review
   the administrative needs of the agency, while also recognizing its
   uniquely important role in serving the public.

        Again, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of the
   agencys funding with you. If you would like to arrange an appointment
   with me and other members of the Board, please have your staff contact
   Margaret Malone, the Boards Staff Director.


                                                      Sincerely,


                                                      Stanford G. Ross

                                                      Chairman
