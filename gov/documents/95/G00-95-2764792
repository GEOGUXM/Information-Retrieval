   Strategic Enterprise Management
        __________________________________________________________________

      NASA has established the five Strategic Enterprises to function as
      primary business areas for implementing NASA's mission and serving its
      customers. Each Enterprise has a unique set of strategic goals,
      objectives, and implementation strategies that address the requirements
      of the Agency's primary customers.

      Enterprise Management is responsible for establishing overall customer
      requirements and ensuring overall customer satisfaction throughout the
      Strategic Enterprises. They work with the Enterprise Associate
      Administrators to determine what each Enterprise does and why. In
      addition, they provide program definition (requirements, cross-program
      efficiency, and synergy). They are responsible for Enterprise-focused,
      long-term institutional investment strategy, integrated budget
      development, program resource allocation and performance assessment,
      Enterprise-specific policy and standards, and the implementation of
      NASA policy.

      Through the Enterprises and Agency Management, NASA's highly skilled
      workforce, including scientists, engineers, technicians, and
      administrative and support professionals, and our world-class
      facilities represent the backbone of the Nation's civil research and
      development capabilities in aeronautics and space.

      Enterprises, or see the NASA Strategic Plan online.
