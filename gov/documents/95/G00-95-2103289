   A N A L Y S T The 2002-03 Governor's Budget lays out the
   administration's spending priorities and offers a plan for addressing
   the state's $12-plus bil- lion budgetary shortfall. While "on paper"
   the plan appears to work, many of its assumptions are overly
   optimistic, it relies largely on one- time solutions, and it results in
   substantial long- term out-year costs. Moreover, the plan does not
   resolve the state's budgetary imbalance in subsequent years, thereby
   continuing the risk of future shortfalls. I A N L A O R E P O R T
