   Satsop Combustion Turbine Project
   2001 Requests for Amendment
     __________________________________________________________________

   Technical Amendment No. 297:
   In February 2001, the Council authorized technical amendment No. 297 to
   the Site Certification Agreement, allowing the addition of Duke Energy
   Grays Harbor, LLC, as a Site Certification Agreement co-permittee.

   Technical Amendment No. 298:
   In April 2001, the Council authorized technical amendment No. 298 to
   the Site Certification, allowing:
     * the replacement of the originally permitted Westinghouse turbines
       with General Electric turbines;
     * a modification of  the facility configuration  from a dual
       "one-on-one" configuration (two separate but identical combustion
       turbine generator - steam turbine generator trains), to a single
       "two on one" configuration (two combustion turbine generators - one
       steam turbine generator facility);
     * an increase of  the nominal output of the facility from 490 MW to
       530 MW;
     * an increase of the a maximum output of approximately 650 MW by
       utilizing duct firing;
     * and removal of the capability to use diesel oil as a backup fuel.

   Request for Amendment and Expedited Permitting:
   Duke Energy notified EFSEC on October 23, 2001 that the current
   licensed project, consisting of two combustion turbine generators on a
   "two on one" configuration with a  single steam turbine generator,  and
   a 48 mile natural gas pipeline to supply fuel to the site, is to be
   considered "Phase I" pending the submittal of a request to amend the
   SCA to allow for the construction of another 650 MW project, consisting
   of two combustion turbine generators on a "two on one" configuration
   with a  single steam turbine generator, called "Phase II".  On November
   19, 2001, a request for an amendment to allow for the construction of
   Phase II, and for expedited processing pursuant RCW 80.50.075 was
   received by the Council.
