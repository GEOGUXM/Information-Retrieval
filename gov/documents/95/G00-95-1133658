   Mission
     * The mission of NIDA's science meeting program is to be the
       frontline of information dissemination and technology transfer to
       the professional community.
          + Scientific meetings provide an opportunity for scientists,
            clinicians, community leaders, and others to enter into a
            two-way dialogue, an activity that is vital to NIDA's goal of
            closing the great gap between the known science and the
            prevention and treatment of drug addiction.
          + These meetings facilitate the further creation of materials
            such as peer-reviewed journal articles, research reviews,
            monographs, and multi-media technology-transfer packages
            including video tapes and coordinated, pilot-tested printed
            matter.
