   [dot8.gif] Fishery Management Plan Summaries By Regional Fishery
   Management Council

   These documents are concise summaries of the Fishery Management Plans
   (FMPs) that were prepared by the Gulf of Mexico , South Atlantic, and
   Caribbean Fishery Management Councils, or the Gulf of Mexico and South
   Atlantic Councils, and NMFS . Many FMPs have been amended several
   times. To obtain a copy of the entire document, contact the Council by
   mail or by phone. The summary will tell you the name of the Council,
   NMFS plan coordinator to call for more information, species in the
   management unit, and principle management measures. You can determine
   if this FMP applies to you by knowing where you are fishing or planning
   to fish and the common or scientific name of the fish you caught or
   plan to catch. Just review the management unit to determine if the FMP
   applies to you. When in doubt call the Southeast Regional Office at
   727/570-5305.
