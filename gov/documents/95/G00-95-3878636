        HOMEPAGE

   Welcome to the NHTSA Event Data Recorder (EDR) Website. EDRs are
   devices which record information related to an "event." In the context
   of this site the event is defined as a highway vehicle crash.

   EDRs can be simple or complex in design, scope, and reach. They have
   the ability and potential to have a major impact on highway safety,
   ranging from assisting in real-world data collection to better define
   the auto safety problem to aiding in law enforcement and understanding
   the specific aspects of a crash.

   In 1997, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued
   recommendations to "pursue crash information gathering using EDRs." The
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory (JPL), in April of the same year recommended that NHTSA
   "study the feasibility of installing and obtaining crash data for
   safety analyses from crash recorders on vehicles."

   In early 1998, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
   (NHTSA) Office of Research and Development (R&D) launched a new effort
   to form a working group comprised of industry, academia, and other
   government organizations. The group's objective were: To facilitate the
   collection and utilization of collision avoidance and crashworthiness
   data from on-board EDRs. The Working Group published a report with 29
   findings that presented an overview from users to manufacturers.

   In 2000, NHTSA sponsored a second Working Group looking into EDRs
   specifically associated with trucks, school buses, and motor coaches
   based on 1999 safety recommendations by the NTSB. NHTSA has been using
   EDRs to support its crash investigation program for several years. EDR
   data are routinely incorporated into NHTSA's crash databases.

   This Internet Web site is another EDR-related effort to promote the
   understanding and widespread use of these devices. It is designed to be
   a useful resource tool for anyone seeking knowledge of the emerging
   highway-based EDR technologies. By sponsoring this effort, NHTSA
   encourages dialogue, research and development in emerging EDR
   technologies towards the goal of fewer crashes, injuries, and deaths.
