Supporting Multicast with RealPlayer 8

   RealPlayer 8 Build: 6.0.9.450 does not properly support multicast. NIH
   VideoCast recommends that NIH staff upgrade if their version of Real
   Player 8 is earlier than Build: 6.0.9.584.

     * Launch RealPlayer
     * Select Help
     * Select About Real Player

     * Upgrade to RealPlayer or RealOne if your version of Real Player 8
       is earlier than Build: 6.0.9.584

More Information About Multicast

   Multicasting is a unidirectional communication deployed during live web
   casts only. Clients simply listen to a data stream to join the
   multicast. Multicasting conserves bandwidth (one 128kb stream viewed by
   100 clients uses only 128kb of bandwidth), however, clients cannot
   determine when the data stream starts, pause the stream without losing
   data, or move forward or backward in the data stream. A client that
   connects in the middle of a multicast misses half of the data stream.
   Unicasts are data streams decoded on a one-to-one basis. Unicasting is
   a bidirectional communication. Clients send requests to the server, and
   each connection from client to server uses bandwidth. A 128kb data
   stream unicast to 100 clients uses 12,800kb (12.8Mb) of bandwidth. When
   unicasting is deployed for a past event (not a live web cast), clients
   can determine when the data starts, move forward or backward in the
   data stream, or pause the stream without missing any data.
   Most of the NIH network is multicast enabled. Live events streamed to
   computers on the NIHnet are mostly multicast, thus saving considerable
   bandwidth. However, the same live event streamed to computers on the
   Internet or to non-multicast enabled segments of the NIH network are
   unicast. On-demand viewing of past events, whether on the NIH network
   or the Internet are always unicast.

How Do I Know If Multicast is Working?

     * Multicast status can be verified during a Live Event

     * Select View

     * Select the Streams tab

     * Transport Protocol : Multicast

Who Should I Contact If Multicast is Not Working?

   [stats3.gif]
     * If Transport Protocol : UDP
     * Make sure you are viewing Live Event
     * Past Events are always unicast
     * Make sure your computer is physically attached to the NIH network
     * Computers with Internet connections outside of the NIH network
       always receive unicast streams
     * If your government-furnished computer on the NIH network is not
       receiving multicast during a live webcast, contact CIT at
       301-594-6248.
