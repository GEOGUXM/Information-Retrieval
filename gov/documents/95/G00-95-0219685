   What's New !

   Please check back in the future for any new information.

   Help Your School Win $5,000 !

   Here's how to get involved:

   Begin preparing now - the competition begins October 1, 2001 and ends
   April 1, 2002. Completed applications must be postmarked by Friday,
   April 19, 2002 to the Office of the Secretary for Education (OSE). No
   faxed, late, electronic, or incomplete applications will be accepted.
   K-8 students can participate and read from any recreational reading
   book approved by their parent and teacher. Up to 800 elementary and
   middle schools whose students read the greatest number of pages will
   win $5,000!

   Encourage ALL of your students to participate - Each school sets its
   own reading goals for the competition, but the more pages that students
   read, the greater your school's chance of winning! TIP: A good goal for
   K-3 pupils is 3,000 pages per pupil over the 6-month period (500
   pages/month). For grades 4-8, each student should read 2,000 pages over
   the 6-month period (333 pages/month).

   Keep track of the number of pages read - Students in grades K-2 can
   read on their own or with a parent/guardian/teacher (they can also read
   the same book more than once). Your K-3 students will count the number
   of books read, and you will either convert those books into pages (1
   book = 25 pages) or count the number of pages if the books exceed 25
   pages. Grades 4-8 count the actual number of pages read. Please review
   the rules and regulations of the program located on the OSE website at
   www.ose.ca.gov. The OSE website provides sample student log forms and
   teacher tally sheets. If you decide to use your own log forms, the same
   information contained on OSE's log forms should be contained on your
   forms. You can also download a thermometer gauge from the site to help
   students keep track of the pages read!

   Encourage a good reading environment at home - Talk to the students and
   their parents about the importance of reading 15-20 minutes every day
   in a quiet area with no distractions. For additional tips, visit the
   READ California website at http://www.readcalifornia.org/

   Send us your success stories! We want to know how your school is doing
   and how your school promotes reading. E-mail us at read@ose.ca.gov.

   Mailing List - To subscribe to the Governor's Reading Award email list,
   send an email to:
   readingaward-on@ose.ca.gov. This is provided as a forum for educators
   to exchange ideas, concerns and suggestions regarding the Governor's
   Reading Award Program.

   Title I Schools - The 2001 Budget Act includes $750,000 to support
   California Reads. California Reads provides training for schools to
   implement a recreational reading program. For more information please
   visit the California Reads Official Website at:
   http://www.californiareads.com/

   Charter Schools - According to the State Department of Education, the
   Governor's Reading Award program is included in the charter school
   block grant funding model pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with
   Section 47630) of Part 26.8 of the Education Code. Therefore, charter
   schools that are participating in the model will receive their funding
   for this program as part of the categorical component of the charter
   school block grant, which was allocated as part of the principal
   apportionment. Charter schools that are not participating in the
   charter school block grant funding model will receive their funding for
   this program through their chartering agency.
