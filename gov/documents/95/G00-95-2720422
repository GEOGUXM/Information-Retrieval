   Bioengineering

   Micropatterned Schwann Cell-Seeded Guidance Conduits for Nerve
   Regeneration
   Improvements in the techniques of nerve repair could provide better
   return of protective sensibility and tactile discrimination, reduce
   denervation atrophy of muscles, and minimize pain syndromes. Achieving
   full organ function after peripheral nerve injury is the ultimate goal.

   New Cleanup Approaches

   Expedited Site Characterization

          Remediation of DOE sites should be quicker and less costly once
          a streamlined, cost-effective characterization approach is in
          place.

   Analyzing Environmental Contaminants

   Improvements in Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry
          Augmenting an already effective analytical technique, sampling
          improvements for ICP-MS promise reduced hazards, costs and
          complexity for assessing DOE's radioactive sites.

          Electrospray Mass Spectrometry
          Adapting for environmental use an analytical technology already
          common in medical applications, researchers are developing a
          single instrument comprehensive enough for a wide range of
          environmental analyses. Reducing the need for multiple
          analytical tools, this system should cut the costs and
          complexity of DOE's environmental assessments.

          LA-ICP-AES using a high resolution fiber optic interferometer
          With a remarkable combination of small size, affordability and
          high sensitivity, Ames Lab's new interferometric ICP-AES
          spectrometer should make detailed field-testing possible in
          areas where traditional methods lack the required selectivity
          and portability.

          FTIR-Photoacoustic spectroscopy of solids
          This technique reduces worker exposure to radiation because of
          the small sample size and the dramatic reduction in sample
          preparation needed, also making the technique faster and more
          cost-effective.

   Monitoring Environmental Contaminants

   Zero Tension Lysimeters

          Offering expanded monitoring capabilities at a reduced cost,
          this new zero-tension lysimeter produces a more complete and
          accurate picture of soil and water flow to help guard against
          the spread of contaminants in upper regions of the soil.

          Ultrasonic characterization of wastes
          Safe, quick and cost-effective physical description of stored
          waste will help speed the decommissioning of storage tanks for
          newer, more effective waste treatment, storage and disposal.

          Measurements by Transient Infrared Spectroscopies (TIRS)
          Helping DOE improve waste solidification with continuous
          monitoring, Ames Lab's new infrared spectrometry technique will
          allow process operators to maximize and document the quality of
          polymer-encapsulated waste for safer, more efficient storage and
          disposal.

   Decontaminating Environmental Wastes

   Laser decontamination of metals

          This new technique that uses lasers for safe and effective metal
          decontamination produces little secondary waste and can reduce
          selected waste volumes (or at least lower waste classifications)
          and therefore reduce the hazards and costs of waste storage and
          disposal.

          X-ray detector system helps evaluate facility contamination

          Rapidly providing critical contaminant information on site, Ames
          Lab's portable K-edge heavy metal detector should make the
          dismantling of DOE's contaminated facilities easier, safer and
          more efficient.

   Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing

   Lead-free Solder Paste

          The strength, heat resistance, workability and
          cost-effectiveness of Ames Lab's new lead-free solder make it an
          attractive alternative for getting environmentally hazardous
          lead out of commonly used solders.

   Ames Laboratory assists DOE

   Characterization, Monitoring, and Sensor Technologies - Teaming with
          DOE to Develop, Transfer, and Deploy Technologies

          Focusing on user needs and emphasizing collaboration between
          technology developers, providers, and users, Ames Laboratory
          scientists are assisting DOE Headquarters to speed development,
          transfer, and application of new technologies for faster, safer,
          better and cheaper characterization, monitoring, and sensing
          work.
