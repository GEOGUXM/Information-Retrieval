     The Technical Support Branch (TSB) provides support for TPC's
     assorted information systems, maintains an array of computer
     forecasting models, produces a small number of operational and
     nonoperational products, and develops new tropical cyclone and
     tropical weather prediction techniques. TSB also assists the
     operations of NHC and TAFB by providing personnel, meteorological
     and data support.

     TSB is composed of a Branch Chief, a Science and Operations Officer
     (SOO), the Techniques Development and Applications (TDAU) and Storm
     Surge Units, a Computer Support Group (CSG) and Computer
     Specialists, Electronics Technicians, several contractors and a
     liason for FIU and NWS projects. TPC's System Administrator,
     Webmaster, and Y2K Program Manager are drawn from this staff.

     Information systems supported by TSB include communications hardware
     and a network of PC's, UNIX servers and x-terminals used for the
     ingest, processing, and display of satellite imagery and other data,
     as well as for the production and distribution of various NHC and
     TAFB products. GOES satellite imagery is ingested directly from the
     GOES 8 (.JPG) and GOES 10 (.JPG) satellites, while METEOSAT (.JPG)
     data and polar orbiting imagery are obtained via land lines. The
     Man-computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS) satellite data
     processing system is used to view and manipulate this imagery. NCEP
     Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (N-AWIPS)
     workstations running GEMPAK scripts process and display model
     output, aircraft observations from Air Force Reserve and NOAA
     reconnaissance missions, and conventional meteorological station,
     ship and buoy data. Radar data from the WSR-88D system is treated
     independantly using four Principal User Processors (PUPs). Finally,
     TSB was instrumental in the creation and continued development of
     the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) system, used to
     incorporate various data and model outputs and to generate
     forecasts.

     TSB maintains a number of statistical and dynamic models used in
     predicting both hurricane behavior and associated weather
     conditions. An assortment of track and intensity forecast models
     provide information about the direction and strength of each
     individual storm. These include the statistical NHC90/NHC91 track
     forecast models, the dynamical Beta and Advection (BAM) and
     barotropic hurricane track forecast models (VICBAR, LBAR), and the
     Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS). Given the
     strength of a storm approaching from seaward, the Maximum Envelope
     Of Winds (MEOW) model assists inland wind forecasts, and the Sea,
     Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model details the
     penetration of floodwaters inland. TSB also evaluates the computer
     intensive dynamical models run at NCEP, and provides feedback for
     improvement of prediction in tropical regions.

     TSB operational products include large-scale analyses of tropical
     upper- and lower-level winds and storm surge predictions for
     landfalling tropical cyclones. Storm surge atlases, prepared in
     advance by TSB's Storm Surge Unit, are used by county emergency
     managers to develop evacuation plans. The latest versions of
     publically available TSB operational products may be found on the
     Forecast Products page. This NHC/TPC Website and its text-only
     counterpart, officially nonoperational products, are produced and
     maintained by TSB staff as a service to the public.

     TSB is responsible for developing new techniques for tropical
     cyclone and tropical weather prediction. TSB's Science and
     Operations Officer is directly involved in the development of new
     forecasting techniques. Members of TSB's Techniques Development and
     Applications Unit are charged with developing WSR-88D radar
     applications for tropical cyclones and new techniques for NOAA
     reconnaissance aircraft (268K GIF)and other platforms.

     Several TSB members serve as reserve NHC Hurricane Specialists when
     additional manpower is required. TSB Computer Specialists and the
     Computer Support Group maintain the TPC 24 hour operational data
     flow. TSB also provides technical training for NHC and TAFB
     operational personnel.
