           EEOC COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN WAFFLE HOUSE CASE

   WASHINGTON - By a 6-3 vote, the United States Supreme Court today ruled
   in EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc. (No. 99-1823) that a private arbitration
   agreement between an individual and that individual's employer does not
   prevent the EEOC from filing a court action in its own name and
   recovering monetary damages for the individual. The Supreme Court
   reversed a lower court decision that had prevented the EEOC from
   recovering monetary damages on behalf of an individual who had
   previously agreed with his employer to arbitrate the individual's
   private claim of discrimination.

   "The Supreme Court's decision reaffirms the significance of the EEOC's
   public enforcement role," said EEOC Chair Cari M. Dominguez. "The
   ruling embraces the view that, as the agency entrusted to enforce the
   federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, the EEOC
   is not constrained in any way by a private arbitration agreement to
   which the EEOC is not a party. The decision also acknowledges, as does
   the EEOC, the goals of efficiency and economy that may be furthered in
   particular cases by the private arbitration system."

   The Supreme Court recognized that the EEOC is authorized to bring suit
   in its own name and that the EEOC has the prerogative, as a federal
   enforcement agency, to decide what relief is appropriately sought in a
   particular action brought by the EEOC. The Supreme Court rejected the
   argument that the EEOC is a mere proxy for the individuals for whom it
   seeks relief in its actions, ruling that the EEOC is the "master of its
   own case" and can decide to bring a claim for monetary damages in
   court, even though the individual for whom the EEOC seeks relief would
   be required to pursue his or her own claim in arbitration.

   EEOC enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,
   which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color,
   religion, sex, or national origin; the Age Discrimination in Employment
   Act, which protects workers 40 years of age and older; the Equal Pay
   Act; prohibitions against discrimination affecting individuals with
   disabilities in the federal sector; sections of the Civil Rights Act of
   1991; and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which
   prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in the
   private sector and state and local governments. Further information
