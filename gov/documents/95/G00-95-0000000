                          Hawaii State Legislature

                            Felix Consent Decree

   The Felix consent decree is the outcome of a 1993 lawsuit in U.S.
   District Court that alleged that "qualified handicapped children" were
   not receiving mental health services necessary to enable them to
   benefit from their education. The State waived all rights to appeal and
   agreed to fully implement a system of care by June 30, 2000. The State
   agreed to the consent decree to preserve its autonomy and maintain
   control in the design and implementation of a system of care.
