   TOP OF PAGE


        Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&SU)

   AOE 4404 - Applied Numerical Methods - Interpolation and approximation,
   numerical integration, solution of equation, matrices and digenvalues,
   systems of equations, approximate solution of ordinary and partial
   differential equations. Applications to physical problems.

   AOE 5305 - Marine Engineering - In depth analysis and design or major
   ship propulsion system and machinery components. 5305: Propellers,
   Shafting, and Gearing. Introduction to boilers, steam, and gas
   turbines, nuclear power plants and diesels.

   AOE 5454 - Advanced Aerospace and Ocean Engineering Instrumentation -
   An advanced treatment of the principles of measurement systems;
   standards, accuracy, uncertainty and statistical concepts, and signal
   processing. Detectors, transducers, and instruments for aerospace and
   ocean engineering. Hot-wire and laser anemometry. Signal conditioning
   systems and readout devices, digital data acquisition principles.
   Electronics and electrical test intruments. Case studies of practical
   instrumentation systems.

   ESM 5014 - Introduction to Continuum Mechanics - Analysis of stress and
   deformation at a point. Development of the basic equations of a
   continuous medium by applying the basic laws of conservation of mass,
   linear momentum, moment of momentum and those of thermodynamics. Study
   of constitutive axioms and constitutive relations for fluids and
   solids. Specialization of the field equations to simple boundary-value
   problems of solid mechanics and fluid mechanics with simple solutions.

   MSE 4304 - Metals and Alloys - This course covers the production,
   properties and uses of commercially important metals and alloys. The
   influence of structure, chemisstry, and processing upon the properties
   of metals is emphasized. Alloy selection is discussed. Mechanical,
   electrical, thermal and chemical characteristics of ferrous and
   nonferrous alloys are studied.

   MSE 5984 - Structures of Materials - This course provides an
   introduction to the crystallography of materials and focuses on x-ray
   diffraction as the tool for investigation the structure of matter. The
   student will be introduced to the concepts of Bravais lattices, Miller
   indices, reciprocal space, sterographic projections, symmetry and
   crystall defects. Along the way, the class will develop a mathematical
   method to handle calculations of directions, lengths and angles in any
   crystal systems. The students will be given a theoretical basis from
   which to understand x-ray diffraction and material structure-property
   relationships.

   MSE 5984 - Quantitative Analytical Techniques - A core premise in
   materials science (and many others) is that properties and performance
   re the consequence of structure, and that structure is the consequence
   of the processes that brought it about, all broadly understood.
   Characterization has the task of revealing structure in all detail
   needed to make the link between processing and performance. Unlike
   analytical chemistry however, materials characterization is just now
   taking shape as a coherent (if changing) body of knowledge that can be
   learned and applied in a systematic way. Often it is seen chiefly as
   the area within boundary drwn around all the "alphabet soup"
   techniques. The original applications concentrated strongly in high
   vacuum processing, but now high pressure/temperature (catalysis) and
   ambient/wet (biological, environmental) settings are more important.
   This course presents materials characterization, emphasizing surface
   and microanalysis, using the underlying science as a unifying
   framework, carrying through to illustrative applications. Its objective
   is to provide students with a bachelor's level background in physical
   science the knowledge level needed for them to: Define a
   characterization strategy appropriate to the issue at hand, Select the
   most promising techniques, Communicate with a technique expert
   adequately to convey the need and interpret the results, Use
   computer-based mathematical models to simulate the results of
   experiments, Enter the specialist literature for a given technique so
   as to develop state of the art expertise, and Understand at this same
   level new techniques as they emerge.

   ME 5734 - Advanced Engineering Acoustics - The fundamental principles
   underlying the generation, transmission, and reception of acoustic
   waves will be presented. Methods for analytically investigating various
   acoustical situations encountered in practice will be developed. The
   applications of these methods to typical engineering acoustical
   problems with physical interpretation of the results will be studied.
