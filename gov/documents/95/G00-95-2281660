      The LISA mission will consist of three spacecraft forming an
      equilateral triangle with a distance of five million kilometers between
      any two spacecraft. Gravitational waves passing through the solar
      system will generate small changes in the distance between the
      spacecraft. The distance changes can be made very accurately using
      laser interferometry, so that distance changes of a small fraction of
      the wavelength (1 micron or 25 thousandths of an inch).

      Sunlight variations (and other effects) would, if not corrected, force
      the spacecraft to move distances much larger than gravitational waves
      would. To reduce this effect, each spacecraft contains within it a
      "proof" mass which is shielded from direct sunlight. The laser
      interferometry then measures the distance between the shielded proof
      masses in different spacecraft. The position of each spacecraft will be
      measured with respect to the shielded proof mass within it. As sunlight
      causes the spacecraft to be pushed towards the proof mass, the induced
      distance change will be measured, and small thrusters will fire to move
      the spacecraft back to the original position around the undisturbed
      proof mass.

      This spacecraft position control operation is similar to that used for
      low Earth orbiting satellites which need to correct for the force due
      to the friction, or drag, of the Earth's atmosphere, and hence is
      referred to as "drag-free" operation.

      The laser interferometry measurements are more difficult to make if the
      distances between pairs of spacecraft are not nearly equal. Thus the
      preferred orbits are chosen to minimize changes in the distance between
      spacecraft. The nominal orbits are indicated in the two figures above.
      Each spacecraft is in an Earth-like orbit with a period of one year
      going around the Sun. The planes of the spacecraft orbits are slightly
      elliptical and slightly tilted with respect to each other and with
      respect to the plane of the Earth's orbit (the ecliptic). By carefully
      choosing the tilts of the orbits, the thre spacecraft maintain a
      triangular configuration even though each is separately orbiting about
      the Sun. The right-hand figure above highlights the motion of one of
      the spacecraft and indicates how the distance between spacecraft
      remains the same and how the triangular formation changes orientation
      over one year. The change in orientation of the triangle formation is
      helpful in determining the direction of the sources of observed
      gravitational waves.

      Changes in the spacecraft separation will be caused mainly by the
      gravitational pull of the Earth. The location of the center of the
      formation 20 degrees behind the Earth represents a compromise between
      the desire to reduce the gravitational pull by the Earth and the desire
      to be closer to the Earth to reduce the amount of propellant needed to
      reach the operational configuration and to ease the requirements on the
      telecommunications system. With these orbits, the angle between the two
      distant spacecraft, as seen from any one spacecraft, will change slowly
      through the year, by Â±1 degree in the worst case. This will require the
      angle between the two telescopes on each spacecraft to be articulated.

      The distance between the spacecraft is chosen to be five million
      kilometers and the expected distance measurement accuracy is about 10
      picometers each second (about 10 times smaller than the size of an
      atom). Gravitational waves are characterized by a strain amplitude,
      causing a distance change proportional to the nominal distance. Thus
      the sensitivity to gravitational waves is the measurement accuracy
      divided by the spacecraft separation. In this case, that is 10
      picometers divided by 5 million kilometers, or a strain amplitude of
      2X10^(-18) for each one-second measurements.
