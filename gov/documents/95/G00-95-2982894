Sea Level and Climate

  Introduction

   Global sea level and the Earth's climate are closely linked. The
   Earth's climate has warmed about 1°C (1.8°F) during the last 100 years.
   As the climate has warmed following the end of a recent cold period
   known as the "Little Ice Age" in the 19th century, sea level has been
   rising about 1 to 2 millimeters per year due to the reduction in volume
   of ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers in addition to the
   thermal expansion of ocean water. If present trends continue, including
   an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas
   emissions, many of the world's mountain glaciers will disappear. For
   example, at the current rate of melting, all glaciers will be gone from
   Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century (fig.
   1). In Iceland, about 11 percent of the island is covered by glaciers
   (mostly ice caps). If warming continues, Iceland's glaciers will
   decrease by 40 percent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200.

   Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic
   and Greenland ice sheets (table 1). Complete melting of these ice
   sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 80 meters, whereas
   melting of all other glaciers could lead to a sea-level rise of only
   one-half meter.

   <== Figure 1. Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park, Montana;
   photograph by Carl H. Key, USGS, in 1981. The glacier has been
   retreating rapidly since the early 1900's. The arrows point to the
   former extent of the glacier in 1850, 1937, and 1968. Mountain glaciers
   are excellent monitors of climate change; the worldwide shrinkage of
   mountain glaciers is thought to be caused by a combination of a
   temperature increase from the Little Ice Age, which ended in the latter
   half of the 19th century, and increased greenhouse-gas emissions.

  Glacial-Interglacial Cycles

   Climate-related sea-level changes of the last century are very minor
   compared with the large changes in sea level that occur as climate
   oscillates between the cold and warm intervals that are part of the
   Earth's natural cycle of long-term climate change.

   During cold-climate intervals, known as glacial epochs or ice ages, sea
   level falls because of a shift in the global hydrologic cycle: water is
   evaporated from the oceans and stored on the continents as large ice
   sheets and expanded ice caps, ice fields, and mountain glaciers. Global
   sea level was about 125 meters below today's sea level at the last
   glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago (Fairbanks, 1989). As the
   climate warmed, sea level rose because the melting North American,
   Eurasian, South American, Greenland, and Antarctic ice sheets returned
   their stored water to the world's oceans. During the warmest intervals,
   called interglacial epochs, sea level is at its highest. Today we are
   living in the most recent interglacial, an interval that started about
   10,000 years ago and is called the Holocene Epoch by geologists.

   Sea levels during several previous interglacials were about 3 to as
   much as 20 meters higher than current sea level. The evidence comes
   from two different but complementary types of studies. One line of
   evidence is provided by old shoreline features (fig. 2). Wave-cut
   terraces and beach deposits from regions as separate as the Caribbean
   and the North Slope of Alaska suggest higher sea levels during past
   interglacial times. A second line of evidence comes from sediments
   cored from below the existing Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets.
   The fossils and chemical signals in the sediment cores indicate that
   both major ice sheets were greatly reduced from their current size or
   even completely melted one or more times in the recent geologic past.
   The precise timing and details of past sea-level history are still
   being debated, but there is clear evidence for past sea levels
   significantly higher than current sea level.

Figure 2 Figure 2. Wave-cut terraces on San Clemente Island,
         California. Nearly horizontal surfaces, separated by step-like cliffs,
         were created during former intervals of high sea level; the highest
         terrace represents the oldest sea-level high stand. Because San
         Clemente Island is slowly rising, terraces cut during an interglacial
         continue to rise with the island during the following glacial interval.
         When sea level rises during the next interglacial, a new wave-cut
         terrace is eroded below the previous interglacial terrace. Geologists
         can calculate the height of the former high sea levels by knowing the
         tectonic uplift rate of the island. Photograph by Dan Muhs, USGS.

  Potential Sea-Level Changes

   If Earth's climate continues to warm, then the volume of present-day
   ice sheets will decrease. Melting of the current Greenland ice sheet
   would result in a sea-level rise of about 6.5 meters; melting of the
   West Antarctic ice sheet would result in a sea-level rise of about 8
   meters (table 1). The West Antarctic ice sheet is especially
   vulnerable, because much of it is grounded below sea level. Small
   changes in global sea level or a rise in ocean temperatures could cause
   a breakup of the two buttressing ice shelves (Ronne/Filchner and Ross).
   The resulting surge of the West Antarctic ice sheet would lead to a
   rapid rise in global sea level.

   Reduction of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets similar to
   past reductions would cause sea level to rise 10 or more meters. A
   sea-level rise of 10 meters would flood about 25 percent of the U.S.
   population, with the major impact being mostly on the people and
   infrastructures in the Gulf and East Coast States (fig. 3).

   Figure 3. Red shows areas along the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the
   United States that would be flooded by a 10-meter rise in sea level.
   Population figures for 1996 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, unpublished
   data, 1998) indicate that a 10-meter rise in sea level would flood
   approximately 25 percent of the Nation's population.                Figure 3

   Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey and elsewhere are
   investigating the magnitude and timing of sea-level changes during
   previous interglacial intervals. Better documentation and understanding
   of these past changes will improve our ability to estimate the
   potential for future large-scale changes in sea level.
