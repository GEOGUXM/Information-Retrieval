   Background

      The Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development provides a
      range of technical assistance and financing services to assist
      businesses in obtaining capital for start-up and expansion projects
      that create or retain jobs, stimulate private investment, increase
      local tax base, and strengthen community economic vitality.  Our
      finance programs are only available to businesses operating in
      Washington State.

   Community Development Finance

      The Community Development Finance (CDF) Program is available to help
      business and industry secure long-term expansion loans. By combining
      private financial resources with federal and state lending assistance
      and local leadership, this program focuses on business expansion
      through community development activities.
      [j0315542.jpg] Through the loan packaging services offered by the
      program, businesses can secure loans that provide long-term financing,
      reasonable interest rates, and low down payments; lenders have a lower
      credit and collateral risk and more dollars to lend; and communities
      can look forward to the creation of jobs and expanded tax base.

      [14111.jpg] The CDF Program uses the resources of economic development
      organizations such as the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and
      the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). CDF finance
      specialists work closely with businesses (new and existing), banks,
      local economic development councils, governments, port districts, and
      community colleges. The CDF Program purpose is to identify and assess
      the feasibility of projects, to structure financing alternatives, and
      to prepare loan packages for the business and for the bank. The program
      goal is to facilitate planned economic development, job creation, and
      job retention.

   CDF assistance and services may be requested by:

        * Any local government in need of community development assistance
        * Any successful business wanting to expand and in need of long-term
          capital, including
        * manufacturing
        * service
        * wholesale companies
        * Companies providing on-site childcare
        * Childcare business owners

      Loan programs are available for real estate, new construction,
      renovation, major leasehold improvements, machinery, equipment, and
      working capital. Government financing for a start-up business is
      possible but more difficult and requires a larger down payment by the
      business.

      Decisions are based on criteria such as experience in the type of
      business to be financed, evidence of ability to repay the loan, owners'
      equity in the business, sufficient collateral, and job impact.
