   Clearinghouse Northern Mariana Islands Profile of Drug Indicators
   September 2001 ONDCP Drug Policy Information Clearinghouse staff
   compiled this profile by using the most recent data available from open
   sources. The data presented are as accurate as the sources from which
   they were drawn. The information contained in this profile should not
   be used to rank or compare States or jurisdictions, due to differences
   in data collection and reporting methods. Northern Mariana Islands The
   following profile contains information on demographics, political
   figures, programs, crime, drug use, drug trafficking, and enforcement
   statistics. Demographics1 ÿ Population: 71,912 (July 2000 est.) ÿ
   Age/Gender: 0-14 years: 24% (male 8,652; female 8,377); 15-64 years:
   75% (male 25,441; female 28,233); 65 years and over: 1% (male 591;
   female 618) (2000 est.) ÿ Ethnic groups: Chamorro, Carolinians and
   other Micronesians, Caucasian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean ÿ Unemployment
   Rate: 14% (residents) ÿ Economy: The economy benefits substantially
   from financial assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined
   as locally generated government revenues have grown. A rapidly growing
   chief source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about
   50% of the work force (Japanese tourists predominate). The agricultural
   sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
   small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
   Garment production is the fastest growing industry, with employment of
   12,000 (predominantly Chinese workers) and shipments of $1 billion to
   the US in 1998 under duty and quota exemptions. ÿ Geography: The
   Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is located in an
   area called Oceania, with islands in the North Pacific Ocean, about
   three- quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines. Northern
   Mariana Islands has a total land area of 477 sq km. ÿ This land is
   composed of 14 islands including; Saipan (Capital), Farallon de
   Parjaros, Maug, Asuncion, Agrigan/Agrihan, Pagan, Alamagan, Guguan,
   Sariguan, Anatahan, Farallon de Medeirilla, Tinian, Aguijuan, and
   Rota.2 Politics3 ÿ Northern Mariana Island is a commonwealth associated
   with the United States. ÿ CNMI Senate President: Senator Paul A.
   Manglona (Republican/Rota 12th CNMI Senate) ÿ CNMI House
   Representatives: Representative Maria "Malua" T. Peter and
   Representative Rosiky F. Camacho (CNMI 12th Legislature) 4 ÿ Governor:
   Governor Pedro P. Tenorio (since NA January 1998), and Lieutenant
   Governor Jesus R. Sablan (since NA January 1998) Programs/Initiatives ÿ
   United States District Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern
   Mariana Islands, was established by an Act of Congress in 1977 and
   became operational in January, 1978. The court sits on the island of
   Saipan, but may sit other places within the Commonwealth. The District
   Court has the same jurisdiction as all other United States District
   Courts, including diversity jurisdiction and bankruptcy jurisdiction.
   Appeals are taken to the Ninth Circuit.5 ONDCP Clearinghouse 2 ÿ CNMI
   Criminal Justice Planning Agency (CJPA) is the State Administering
   Agency (SAA) for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law
   Enforcement Assistance formula grant program administered by the Bureau
   of Justice Assistance (BJA). The program has been the source of
   criminal justice systems improvement since 1987. In 1988, the program
   funded five (10) action programs; Law Enforcement, Court Diversion
   Program, Court Case Management Program, Information Systems and
   Technology Improvements, Availability of Program Information, Family
   Court Mediation Program, Community Crime Prevention Program, Drug Abuse
   Resistance Education (DARE) Parent Program, Batterer's Program.6 ÿ
   Support from BJA is used primarily to fund the Northern Marianas Drug
   Task Force, which is a collaborative effort of CNMI Customs, Department
   of Public Safety and Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the
   CJPA divides remaining grant funds among smaller programs and the
   development of a Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS).7 Crime and
   Drug-Related Crime8 ÿ In 1997, there were 719 assault crimes in the
   Northern Mariana Islands, a decrease since 1996 (758 assault crimes).

   TOTAL 84 67 Drug Use 9 ÿ Methamphetamine Methamphetamine abuse poses
   the greatest illegal drug threat to the Commonwealth of the Northern
   Mariana Islands (CNMI). Nearly all drug investigation in CNMI involve
   the distribution of crystal methamphetamine. More than 5 % of students
   (7  12th grade) have tried methamphetamine at least one. Of those
   sentenced for drug crimes and received sentences within the CNMI, 100%
   of defendants were specifically methamphetamine violations.
   Methamphetamine is not produced within the CNMI, but is smuggled in
   from Southeast Asia and the Philippines. The crystal form called "ice"
   is the most common and preferred form of the drug in this area. ÿ
   Marijuana While marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug in the
   commonwealth, its cultivation and use do not pose the same problems to
   authorities as methamphetamine. Cannabis cultivation, which is usually
   small quantities for personal use, has reduced significantly in the
   past two years. Smuggling of marijuana from the Philippines or Belau is
   the primary source of cannabis within the CNMI. ÿ Heroin Heroin use is
   limited within the CNMI. There is no recorded addiction among the
   resident population, however many tourists use the drug. Because of the
   location of ONDCP Clearinghouse 4 CNMI, many drug smugglers use the
   islands for transshipments of SEA heroin through the CNMI, often with
   destination of Canada. ÿ Cocaine Cocaine use is very low, but the
   amount smuggler ships that enter into the country has increased,
   suggesting more widespread use. ÿ Other Dangerous Drugs Although other
   dangerous drugs are a relatively small threat in the CNMI, in 1999,
   authorities recently became aware of MDMA and LSD use. Until then,
   inhalants posed a greater threat to the CNMI youth. Drug Trafficking10
   ÿ The CNMI is a transit point for drugs, especially methamphetamine and
   heroin, smuggled from Asia to the U.S. West Coast. Officials
   acknowledge that almost all illicit drugs, including methamphetamine,
   cocaine, and heroin, are smuggled into the commonwealth. Cannabis
   continues to be grown locally in small quantities, but most marijuana
   is imported from neighboring countries. The CNMI is both a
   transshipment point and a final destination for marijuana. Drugs
   smuggled into the CNMI often arrive via commercial air passengers and
   air cargo. Individuals also use maritime vessels and the postal system
   to smuggle small quantities for personal use. Sources 1 Central
