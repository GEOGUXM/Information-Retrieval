   Highlights of SAIC Frederick Projects at FCRDC

   A FEW SAMPLES OF OUR PROJECTS

   AIDS Vaccine Program

   This lab provides support for AIDS and human retroviral research
   efforts ranging from viral assembly and infectivity, vaccine
   development and investigations of pathological manifestations of HIV
   and SIV infections, HIV virus production and purification, development
   and maintenance of reagents for vaccine studies, and detailed analysis
   of viral products.

   Advanced Biomedical Computing Center

   More than 1,200 scientists at SAIC -- and around the world -- use our
   Cray YMP supercomputer to do everything from using the latest
   biomedical software packages to determining optimal drug design
   specifications.

   Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing and Quality Operations

   The NCI has established state-of-the-art biological drug production
   facilities for the development of experimental therapeutics for
   preclinical and Phase I & II clinical trials in cancer and other
   diseases. The multi-use facilities employ cutting edge technology in
   mammalian and microbial cell reactors for production of monoclonal
   antibodies and recombinant proteins.

   Chemical Synthesis and Analysis Laboratory

   Researchers here examine new technologies, provide organic synthesis
   support and perform quality control tests. The analytical chemistry
   laboratories provide structural and dynamic information using advanced
   high-resolution mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy.

   Clinical Services Program

   Our clinical services program studies how the immune systems of
   patients with cancer, AIDS, chronic granulomatous disease and chronic
   fatigue syndrome react to treatment with biological response modifiers,
   anticancer or antiviral agents.

   Structural Biochemistry Program

   Our program is a multidisciplinary group that spans theoretical and
   experimental branches of structural biology and chemistry. Our mission
   is to study interactions between drugs and their receptors in atomic
   detail, and to develop a molecular understanding of the structural and
   biological mechanisms of drug resistance.
