   The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) opened
   officially on July 1, 1995. The U.S. Congress established the Office of
   Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) in the Office of the
   Director, NIH, in recognition of the key role that behavioral and
   social factors often play in illness and health. The OBSSR mission is
   to stimulate behavioral and social sciences research throughout NIH and
   to integrate these areas of research more fully into others of the NIH
   health research enterprise, thereby improving our understanding,
   treatment, and prevention of disease. To provide the OBSSR with counsel
   in fulfilling its mission, the Behavioral and Social Sciences
   Coordinating Committee serves as an internal advisory board. Now
   celebrating its fifth year, the Office is under the directorship of
   Raynard S. Kington, M.D., Ph.D.

     * Mission

   The major responsibilities of the office and its director are set forth
       in its mission statement.

     * Strategic Plan

   Under the leadership of its first director, Norman B. Anderson, in 1997
       OBSSR developed a strategic plan, designed to guide the office's
       activities for the next three to five years. The development of
       this plan was a multifaceted process, initiated by two meetings in
       February and March of 1996 with over 70 scientists and
       administrators. Based upon their deliberations and recommendations,
       the office established three principal goals:

     1. Advancing behavioral and social sciences research and training

     2. Integrating a biobehavioral perspective across the NIH

     3. Improving communication among scientists and with the public.

     * Activities and Accomplishments

   In order to fulfill its three principal goals, the Office engages in a
       variety of activities. Among these are:

     * Developing funding initiatives for research and training

     * Setting priorities for behavioral and social sciences research

     * Providing opportunities for training and career development for
     behavioral and scientists

     * Linking minority students with mentors

     * Organizing conferences, workshops, and lectures

     * Briefing key NIH staff on behavioral and social sciences research

     * Publishing a newsletter and press releases

     * Staff and Address
