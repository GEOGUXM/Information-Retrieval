     Precedents for Putting Limits in the "Reinsurance Bill"

        A Dozen Federal Laws That Prohibit or Limit Punitive Damages

     The House of Representatives passed its "reinsurance bill" (H.R.
     3210) on November 29, 2001, but the Senate has yet to act - in part
     because of differences over punitive damages. Because a "reinsurance
     bill" would make the taxpayers of the United States the ultimate
     guarantors of the financial health of the reinsurance industry, the
     House of Representatives voted to prohibit punitive damages. Many
     Senators think the House got it right, but other Senators want to
     give trial lawyers unlimited access to the "deep pockets" of the
     United States Treasury.

     There are numerous examples of Congress (and the courts) acting to
     forbid or limit punitive damages. Those who want to forbid punitive
     damages in the "reinsurance bill" often point to the example of the
     Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which is perhaps the most
     instructive example. That example and a sample of other bipartisan
     laws are listed below. (Many of these examples are taken from L.
     Nugent, PUNITIVE DAMAGES: A STATE BY STATE GUIDE TO LAW AND PRACTICE
     §1.5 (2001 pocket part).)

     1. Federal Tort Claims Act (1946). FTCA permits the U.S. Government
     to be sued for tort claims "in the same manner and to the same
     extent as a private individual under like circumstances," but "not
     be liable for . . . punitive damages." 28 U.S.C.A. §2674. The
     Supreme Court addressed the definition of "punitive damages" in
     Molzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301 (1992).

     2. Federal Employers' Liability Act (1908). FELA, 45 U.S.C.A. §51,
     authorizes "survivors of deceased employees to recover 'damages' for
     any person 'suffering injury' or 'death' resulting from the
     negligence of a railroad employer. It is clear that punitive damages
     are not recoverable by the beneficiaries of a decedent under the
     wrongful death provision of the FELA." J. Stein, STEIN ON PERSONAL
     INJURY DAMAGES §4:27.

     3. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). Under FSIA, "foreign
     states are protected from liability for punitive damages in any
     lawsuit in the United States in which a foreign state is a party,"
     28 U.S.C.A. §1606. [Nugent]

     4. Warsaw Convention (1929). "An air carrier's liability for
     injuries to passengers, their baggage, or goods during international
     flights is governed by the Warsaw Convention. . . . Those courts
     that have addressed the issue of the recoverability of punitive
     damages under the Warsaw Convention have concluded that punitive
     damages are not recoverable. In addition, courts have also held that
     the Warsaw Convention preempts state law claims for the recovery of
     punitive damages." [Nugent]

     5. Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001.
     This recently enacted law provides that liability for all claims
     against air carriers for the events of September 11, whether
     compensatory or punitive, "shall not be in an amount greater than
     the limits of the liability coverage maintained by" the carrier.
     Public Law 107-42, §§408-409.

     6. Jones Act (1915). 46 U.S.C.A. Appendix §762 permits seamen to
     recover for injuries caused by the negligence of their employers,
     but "punitive damages are not recoverable." [Nugent]

     7. Death on the High Seas Act (1920). DOHSA provides a cause of
     action for the wrongful death of a seaman, 46 U.S.C.A. Appendix
     §762. "[C]ourts have held that punitive damages are not recoverable
     under DOHSA." [Nugent]

     8. Y2K Act (1999). 15 U.S.C.A. §6604 was enacted to protect private
     entities and governments from Y2K lawsuits. For private
     organizations that are sued, the Act places several restrictions on
     obtaining punitive damages; for governments, the Act prohibits
     punitive damages. [Nugent]

     9. National Vaccine Program (1986). Congress set up procedures for
     bringing lawsuits for injuries caused by vaccines. Under those
     procedures, "punitive and exemplary damages" are not permitted, 42
     U.S.C.A. §300aa-15(d).

     10. Civil Rights Act of 1991. Prior to 1991, punitive damages were
     not available in many employment discrimination cases. However, the
     1991 Act permits punitive damages, 42 U.S.C.A. §1981a(b), but limits
     the size of the awards based on the size of the employer. [Nugent]
     No punitive damages may be gotten from a government or its agencies
     or subdivisions.

     11. Securities Exchange Act (1934). Punitive damages are not
     available for violations of the Act, Brant v. CCG Financial Corp.,
     693 F. Supp. 889 (D. Or. 1988). [Nugent, note 33]

     12. ERISA (1974). "[T]he Employee Retirement Income Security Act was
     established by Congress to provide a uniform federal law to govern
     employee benefit plans. Under ERISA, any state law that relates to
     employee benefit plans is preempted. . . . The only damages
     expressly available under ERISA are basic contract damages. . . . In
     a 1985 case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an ERISA plan
     beneficiary cannot recover punitive damages under §1132(a)(2) of
     ERISA which establishes liability for breach of a fiduciary duty,
     Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134
     (1985). Most federal courts that have subsequently addressed the
     issue have held that punitive damages are not recoverable under the
     civil enforcement provisions of ERISA." [Nugent]
