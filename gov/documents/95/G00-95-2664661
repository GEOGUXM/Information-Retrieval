   Water Conservation
   Making the most efficient use of the water we have means we do not have
   to find additional sources of water as often. On an annualized basis,
   Flagstaff uses about 134 gallons per person per day. This is good, but
   it still adds up to a lot of water! The City uses almost 3 billion of
   gallons of water per year. Conservation does not mean being skimpy on
   the water that you need. It means using the water that you need wisely
   and not wasting it. Information on water conservation is available in
   the Utilities Department at city hall. Alternatively, just type in
   "water conservation" on an Internet search engine, and you will have
   all the information that you can handle.
   [conserv1.jpg] Two conservation measures have made a remarkable
   difference in the total potable water consumption in the City. They are
   the promotion of low-flow plumbing fixtures and reclaiming water from
   the city sewage system for non-potable uses. Irrigation of parks, ball
   fields, and golf courses is done with recycled water that looks as good
   as what comes from your tap. Over the last 10 years the population has
   increased, but the demand for drinking water has not increased at the
   same rate.
   If you have old style high flow fixtures and are a City water customer,
   we may be able to assist you on the cost of replacement. If you want
   more information about this or our water recycling programs, contact us
   and we will be glad to provide this information.
