                            Along-Track Scanning Radiometer
                            graphic of horizontal waves


   T he Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) on board the European
   Remote Sensing (ERS) Satellite produces infrared images of the Earth at
   a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer. The data from these instruments is
   useful for scientific studies of the land surface, atmosphere, clouds,
   and oceans. The first ATSR instrument was launched on board the ERS-1
   satellite in July 1991 as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Earth
   Observation Program.

   Gridded brightness temperatures from the ATSR-2 are available in 512 x
   512 gridded arrays at a 1 kilometer resolution. Brightness temperatures
   are available for the 3 channels at both the nadir and forward view
   geometries. The ATSR-2 IR channels are at wavelengths of 3.7 magnetic
   permeability symbol , 11 magnetic permeability symbol , and 12 magnetic
   permeability symbol . A near-infrared channel is available at 1.6
   magnetic permeability symbol and visible channels at 0.87 magnetic
   permeability symbol , 0.67 magnetic permeability symbol , and 0.55
   magnetic permeability symbol . The preliminary data set available for
   distribution consists of the gridded brightness temperatures for April,
   May, and June of 1997.
   Other ATSR datasets are available through:
