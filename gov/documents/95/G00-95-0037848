                     THE CONTRACT TO FIGHT BREAST CANCER
                 GIVING TIME · TAKING TIME · SAVING LIVES


   Why The Contract To Fight Breast Cancer Is Necessary
   By Cruz M. Bustamante

   For too long, breast cancer has been a silent, serial killer. It is not
   commonly discussed in the workplace or by society at large. However, it
   has touched almost every American family and every California employer.

   Early detection of breast cancer can help save lives. This is a proven
   fact. The problem is that many working women--and men--do not have the
   time to schedule a breast cancer screening or may not be aware of the
   value of early detection. By signing the Contract to Fight Breast
   Cancer, employers agree to provide employees adequate time to undergo a
   yearly clinical breast cancer screening without penalty.

   The rewards for joining the Contract to Fight Breast Cancer are clear.
   Early detection can help keep workers (in whom employers have invested
   costly skills training) healthy and able to continue contributing to
   the success of the company. Early treatment will benefit employers
   through lower health care premiums. The cost for treating breast cancer
   at later stages is significantly more costly than early stage
   treatment. The agreement will therefore cut down on health care costs
   for employers and society at large, and can only enhance dedication and
   productivity among workers.

   The Contract to Fight Breast Cancer was launched in September 1999 with
   eight companies under the slogan, "Giving time, taking time, saving
   lives." Since then, approximately 200 other companies have signed on,
   among them Tower Records, The Gap, Wells Fargo, Paramount Pictures and
   Silicon Graphics, Inc. These companies have made a commitment to give
   their workers the opportunity to protect themselves.

   Everyone stands to benefit from the Contract to Fight Breast Cancer. We
   secure the most important unit in society--the family--by early
   detection. Most importantly, we reduce suffering and save lives. I
   encourage you to join us in the fight against breast cancer. In the
   21st century, no one should die because they could not find the time to
   get tested.

   Information about the Contract to Fight Breast Cancer, including a list
   of participating companies, can be obtained at www.ltg.ca.gov, the
   Lieutenant Governor's Web address, or by calling Erin Garvey at (916)
   445-8994.
