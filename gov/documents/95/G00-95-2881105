   . About GSA

   The US General Services Administration (GSA) handles all registration
   procedures for the .GOV and .FED.US domains. The GSA became the
   registrar for the Government as of October, 1997.

   What once took an average of three weeks, can now can be processed and
   approved in a matter of days -- The GSA's NIC.GOV site quickly and
   professionally handles legitimate requests for Governments requesting
   name space in the .GOV zone.

   History: GSA was established on July 1, 1949 by section 101 of the
   Federal Property and Administrative Services Act as a result of a
   recommendation by a Presidential commission chaired by former President
   Herbert Hoover. The commission recommended the consolidation of four
   small agencies into one agency to avoid "senseless duplication, excess
   cost, and confusion in handling supplies . . . and providing space."

   Since 1949, GSA has housed federal workers and provided products and
   services to support the important work of government throughout the
   country. GSA does it by negotiating contracts that account for $40
   billion of goods and services bought annually from the private sector.
   GSA employs about 15,000 people and has an annual budget of nearly $13
   billion.
