   Community Forums & Newsgroups

   Overview Active & Proposed Forums

      These Forums & Newsgroups have been established to provide a unified
    tool of communication among specified user groups. We have begun using
              the Netscape Collabra Newsgroups to expand our communication
   capabilities. The current list is preliminary and will be expanded over
                                                     time as need demands.
