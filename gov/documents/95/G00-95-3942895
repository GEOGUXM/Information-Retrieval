    Railroad Retirement Benefit and Financing Changes
       _______________________________________________________________

      President Bush signed the Railroad Retirement and Survivors'
      Improvement Act of 2001 into law on December 21, 2001.
      The legislation liberalizes early retirement benefits for 30-year
      employees, eliminates a cap on monthly retirement and disability
      benefits, lowers the minimum service requirement from 10 years to 5
      years of service if performed after 1995, and provides increased
      benefits for some widow(er)s. The financing sections of the new law
      provide for the investment of railroad retirement funds in
      non-governmental assets, adjustments in the payroll tax rates paid by
      employers and employees, and the repeal of a supplemental annuity
      work-hour tax.
      The following is a summary of the changes in railroad retirement
      benefits and financing provided by the new law, which was based on
      joint recommendations to Congress negotiated by a coalition of rail
      labor organizations and rail freight carriers.
      Railroad Retirement Benefit Provisions
      60/30 retirement. The new law amends the Railroad Retirement Act by
      eliminating the early retirement reduction applied to the annuities of
      30-year employees retiring between the ages of 60 and 62 if their
      annuities begin January 1, 2002, or later. The spouses of such
      employees would also be eligible for full annuities at age 60. Full
      60/30 benefits have not been payable to 30-year employees retiring
      before age 62 since 1983 legislation reduced such early retirement
      benefits.
      This provision is not retroactive and not applicable to 30-year
      employees who retired on the basis of age and service prior to January
      1, 2002, or to their spouses, even if their spouses retire after 2001.
      However, if a disability annuitant is age 60 and has 30 years' service,
      his or her spouse can now receive an unreduced annuity as early as age
      60 if the spouse's annuity beginning date is January 1, 2002, or
      later.
      Maximum provision. The new law eliminates, effective January 1, 2002, a
      maximum on the amount of combined monthly employee and spouse benefit
      payments which had been intended to prevent benefits from exceeding an
      employee's creditable earnings prior to retirement. This maximum
      provision had the unintended effect of reducing benefits for former
      employees with no earnings, or low earnings, in the 10-year period
      prior to retirement, and for long-service employees with moderate
      earnings.
      While not retroactive, the amendment will prospectively increase
      benefits, effective January 1, 2002, for almost 2,600 employee and
      12,000 spouse annuitants on the Board's rolls whose benefits were
      reduced by the maximum provision prior to 2002.
      In 2001, the average monthly employee benefit reduction under the
      maximum provision was $164, and the average spouse reduction was $78.
      The removal of any benefit reductions applied to affected annuitants
      should be completed by June 2002. Such annuitants can expect to receive
      accrual payments in late May 2002 retroactive to January, and increased
      regular monthly payments reflecting their new rates beginning with the
      monthly payment due on June 1, 2002. Notices are being sent by the
      Board to all affected annuitants in January 2002 advising them
      accordingly.
      Notices will also be sent in January to employees whose spouses may
      have been previously advised by the Board to defer filing for spouse
      benefits because of the adverse effects of the maximum provision, as
      their spouses would now want to consider filing for railroad retirement
      benefits.
      Basic service requirement. The new law lowers the minimum eligibility
      requirement for regular railroad retirement annuities from 10 years
      (120 months) of creditable railroad service to five years (60 months)
      of creditable railroad service for those with five years of service
      rendered after 1995. Benefits payable on the basis of this provision
      are not retroactive and are not payable earlier than January 1, 2002.
      Also, for those with less than 10 years of service, additional earnings
      credits acquired under social security coverage would be required for a
      tier I benefit. A tier II benefit would be payable even if the employee
      never worked under social security coverage. Additional requirements
      apply in disability cases. In addition, a deceased employee with five
      years' service after 1995 must still have had a "current connection"
      with the rail industry in order for survivor annuities to be payable by
      the Board under this provision, rather than the Social Security
      Administration.
      Anyone with five years of service performed after 1995, who was
      previously denied benefits because of the 10-year service requirement,
      will want to contact a Board office.
      Widow(er)s' benefits. The new law establishes an "initial minimum
      amount" which is based on the two-tier annuity amount that would have
      been payable to the railroad employee at the time the widow(er)'s
      annuity is awarded. The initial minimum amount is computed with a
      widow(er)'s tier II amount equal to 100 percent of the employee's tier
      II amount. Under prior law, the widow(er)'s tier II amount was equal to
      50 percent of the employee's tier II amount; only the tier I amount
      equaled 100 percent. Widow(er)s' annuities computed on the basis of the
      new initial minimum amount will not be adjusted for annual
      cost-of-living increases until the annuity amount is exceeded by the
      annuity amount the widow(er) would have been paid under prior law, with
      all interim cost-of-living increases otherwise payable.
      This provision is effective February 1, 2002, and is not payable
      retroactively. The Railroad Retirement Board estimates that about 20 to
      25 percent of the widow(er)s on its rolls in 2001 will see some
      increase in their annuity.
      This provision applies to widow(er)s on the rolls before the effective
      date only if the annuity the widow(er) is currently receiving is less
      than she or he would have received had the new law been in effect on
      the date the widow(er)'s annuity began. Most widow(er)s' annuities
      awarded before October 1986 will not be increased. Many of the
      widow(er)s' annuities currently being paid are already higher than the
      annuity that would be payable under the new law because of previous
      cost-of-living adjustments.
      Widow(er)s affected by this change can expect to receive any accrual
      payments, retroactive to February, in late April of 2002, and increased
      regular monthly payments reflecting their new rates beginning with the
      payment they receive on May 1, 2002. Letters will be sent in January to
      affected widow(er)s on the Board's rolls, advising them as to whether
      they will receive an increase. As a result, widow(er)s do not need to
      take any action or contact the Board.
      Railroad Retirement Financing Provisions
      Investment changes. The new law provides for the transfer of railroad
      retirement funds from the Railroad Retirement Accounts to a new
      National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust, whose Board of seven
      trustees is empowered to invest Trust assets in non-governmental
      assets, such as equities and debt, as well as in governmental
      securities.
      The Trust will not be treated as an agency or instrumentality of the
      Federal Government. Its Board of Trustees will be comprised of seven
      members: three members selected by rail labor to represent the
      interests of labor; three members likewise selected by rail management
      to represent management interests; and one independent member selected
      by a majority of the other six members. The new law also provides that
      if the parties involved cannot agree on the selection of Trustees
      within 60 days of the law's enactment date, an impartial umpire shall,
      at the petition of a party to the dispute, be appointed by the District
      Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. The Trustees
      will be appointed only from among persons who have experience and
      expertise in the management of financial investments and pension plans.
      The Trustees will be subject to reporting and fiduciary standards
      similar to those under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
      The new law also allows for railroad retirement benefit payments in the
      future to be issued by a qualified non-governmental financial
      institution, rather than the Treasury Department. The selection of the
      financial institution would be made by the Railroad Retirement Board,
      after consulting with the Board of Trustees and the Secretary of the
      Treasury. Railroad retirement payments will continue to be processed
      through the U.S. Treasury in the meantime.
      Effect on payroll tax rates. The new law reduces the tier II tax rates
      on rail employers, including rail labor unions, in calendar years 2002
      and 2003, and beginning with 2004 provides automatic adjustments in the
      tier II tax rates for both employers and employees. It also repeals the
      supplemental annuity work-hour tax rate paid by employers, beginning
      with calendar year 2002.
      The tier II tax rate on rail employers and rail labor organizations is
      reduced from 16.10 percent to 15.60 percent in 2002 and to 14.20
      percent in 2003, but the tier II earnings base is not changed; and for
      2002, that amount remains at $63,000. The tier II tax rate for rail
      employee representatives will be 14.75 percent in calendar year 2002
      and 14.20 percent in 2003.
      While there will be no change in the tier II tax rate of 4.90 percent
      on employees in the years 2002 and 2003, beginning with the taxes
      payable for calendar year 2004 tier II taxes on both employers and
      employees will be based on the ratio of certain asset balances to the
      sum of benefits and administrative expenses (the average account
      benefits ratio). Depending on the average account benefits ratio, tier
      II taxes for employers will range between 8.20 percent and 22.10
      percent, while the tier II tax rate for employees will be between 0
      percent and 4.90 percent.
      The new law does not affect tier I social security equivalent tax
      rates. The tier I tax on employees and employers remains the same as
      for social security covered employees and employers.
      Other revenue provisions. While supplemental railroad retirement
      annuities provided by the Railroad Retirement Act continue to be due
      and payable, the new law, in addition to repealing the supplemental
      annuity work-hour tax, also eliminates the separate Supplemental
      Annuity Account under the Railroad Retirement Act. Supplemental
      annuities provided under the Railroad Retirement Act will now be funded
      through the new National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust.
      No changes were effected in railroad unemployment insurance taxes on
      employers.
