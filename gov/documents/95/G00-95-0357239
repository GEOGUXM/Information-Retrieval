Database Abstract/Summary

   HazDat, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's
   Hazardous Substance Release/Health Effects Database, is the scientific
   and administrative database developed to provide access to information
   on the release of hazardous substances from Superfund sites or from
   emergency events and on the effects of hazardous substances on the
   health of human populations. The following information is included in
   HazDat: site characteristics, activities and site events, contaminants
   found, contaminant media and maximum concentration levels, impact on
   population, community health concerns, ATSDR public health threat
   categorization, ATSDR recommendations, environmental fate of hazardous
   substances, exposure routes, and physical hazards at the site/event. In
   addition, HazDat contains substance-specific information such as the
   ATSDR Priority List of Hazardous Substances, health effects by route
   and duration of exposure, metabolites, interactions of substances,
   susceptible populations, and biomarkers of exposure and effects. HazDat
   also contains data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
   Information System (CERCLIS) database, including site CERCLIS number,
   site description, latitude/longitude, operable units, and additional
   site information.

Database Access

   Internet HazDat may be queried directly from a World-Wide Web Browser
   with Forms support by clicking on any one of the database queries
   listed below. This method of access to our relational database was made
   possible by GSQL, a simple forms interface to SQL databases, developed
   at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) Exiting
   the ATSDR Web Site. . More information on GSQL may be found in NCSA's
   Tutorial on GSQL Exiting the ATSDR Web Site. .

Data Acquisition/Collection Summary

   ATSDR has conducted public health assessments at more than 1,650 sites,
   developed toxicological profiles for more than 180 substances on the
   ATSDR/EPA Priority List of Hazardous Substances, performed more than
   6,000 health consultations, and conducted or funded more than 190
   health studies. These activities have resulted in the publication of
   numerous Agency documents. Important information from these source
   documents has been abstracted into the Agency's HazDat database, and
   new information is added on a continuous basis. The information
   provided in Internet HazDat is updated at regular intervals.
