                         Current School Assignments


       The SRO Program is a nationally accepted program involving the
        placement of law enforcement officers within the educational
    environment.  The Officers’ are involved in a variety of functions.



   What is the School Resource Officer?
     * A visible, active law enforcement figure on campus dealing with any
       law-related subject.
     * A classroom source for instruction in the following areas:  safety
       programs, law-related education and educational programs in law and
       drug awareness.
     * An extension of the principal's office in dealing with specific or
       unique law-associated areas at the principal's request.
     * A resource for the students which will enable them to be associated
       with a Police Officer in the student's environment rather than in a
       law enforcement environment.
     * A resource to teachers, parents and students for conferences on an
       individual basis, dealing with individual problems or questions.
     * A counseling source in areas which may affect the educational
       environment and are of a law enforcement nature.

   School Resource Officer
   Program Mission Statement

   1.   To make our schools a safe and secure place for students to learn
   and teachers to teach.

   2.   To protect all physical property and assets owned or controlled by
   the Hamilton County Board of   Education.

   3.   To make our SRO program a model by which all others can be judged.

   The School Resource Officer (SRO) Program was introduced into Ooltewah
   High School on January 19, 1996.  The Hamilton County board of
   Education and the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department had agreed to
   implement this program on a trial basis.  All of the names of the
   Hamilton County Schools were placed in a pool and Ooltewah High School
   was selected.


   Lieutenant Charles O. Lowery, Jr. of the Hamilton County Sheriff's
   Department was selected as the officer to implement this program.  Lt.
   Lowery was a 19-year veteran with the Sheriff's Department and had
   undergone specialized training in the SRO program at the time of
   implementation.


   The School Resource Officer Program is a program where a sworn law
   enforcement officer is assigned to a school and is present daily for
   the duration of the school day.  The job responsibilities of the SRO
   fall into four different categories:


   1.  The SRO is the cop on campus.  The SRO will handle anything which
   requires law enforcement intervention or investigation.  This includes
   any type of police report, any complaints which the SRO is made aware
   of by either student, faculty, or administrator, and any arrests which
   need to be made.


   2.  The SRO serves as a "non-academic counselor/advisor."  Any personal
   problems which any student, family member, staff, faculty, or
   administrator has -- the SRO will work with that person in an attempt
   to address and resolve the problem.  Any and all discussions with the
   SRO are confidential.


   3.  At the request of a teacher, the SRO will serve as a guest
   instructor on any subject which is related to law enforcement.


   4.  The SRO is a resource person.  The SRO has access to any and all
   resources available for the entire school.  If a family needs
   professional counseling, if a student desires to get off of drugs, if a
   teacher needs a guest speaker in a specified field, if a faculty or
   staff member needs information or assistance, the SRO has access to
   those agencies.


   Since the inception of the SRO program at Ooltewah High School, OHS has
   seen a decrease in school violence (fights) by approximately 50% per
   term.  There has been a substantial increase monthly of students who
   are coming to the SRO to talk about situations and work out problems.
   There has also been an increase of parents making contact with the SRO
   to find out the correct way of dealing with conflicts inside the home
   as well as at school.


   The SRO is not an administrator and does not perform administrative
   tasks (i.e. suspensions, school discipline, etc.).


   The SRO Program allows the officer to become involved in many school
   activities to include coaching sports, sponsoring school organizations,
   serving as an advisor to a club.  These activities assist in
   establishing a communication between the students and law enforcement.
