   The"Bad Bug Book"

   This handbook provides basic facts regarding foodborne pathogenic
   microorganisms and natural toxins. It brings together in one place
   information from the Food & Drug Administration, the Centers for
   Disease Control & Prevention, the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service,
   and the National Institutes of Health.

   Some technical terms have been linked to the National Library of
   Medicine's Entrez glossary. Recent articles from Morbidity and
   Mortality Weekly Reports have been added to selected chapters to update
   the handbook with information on later outbreaks or incidents of
   foodborne disease. At the end of selected chapters on pathogenic
   microorganisms, hypertext links are included to relevant Entrez
   abstracts and GenBank genetic loci. A more complete description of the
   handbook may be found in the Preface.
