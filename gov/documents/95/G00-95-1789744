   New Drugs for Cancer Treatment
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   As knowledge of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying cancer
   has grown, so too has the range of options with which to counter the
   disease. Advances in biotechnology, drug design, and genetic
   manipulation have led to many promising avenues of drug delivery and
   design. In the new century, efforts are continuing to bring this
   knowledge into the clinical arena for patient treatment.

   In 1998, the NCI initiated a new program called RAID (Rapid Access to
   Interventional Development), which funds the rapid transition of new
   therapeutic agents from the laboratory to the clinic to identify the
   most promising proposals.

   The ongoing challenge in cancer drug design remains the same: to
   develop drugs that are effective at killing tumor cells without
   unnecessarily damaging healthy tissue. Greater specificity in drug
   action (that is, more efficiently targeting drugs toward the cancer)
   and reduced toxicity and side effects continue to be the major hurdles
   for drug design. The following are some of the most promising
   approaches.

   Immunotherapy
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system, either directly or
   indirectly, to fight cancer or to lessen side effects that may be
   caused by some cancer treatments. Immunotherapy seeks to boost, direct,
   or restore the body's own cancer-fighting mechanisms:

     Monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to fill a
      critical gap in the body's immune system. Although the human body
      naturally produces antibodies to identify and fight off viral and
      bacterial infections, the immune system does not recognize cancer cells
      as harmful. Therefore, cancer is able to grow and spread unchecked.
      Monoclonal antibodies are being developed to supplement the body's
      immune system by recognizing and attacking specific proteins expressed
      by cancer cells. These specific antibodies may be active on their own,
      or they may be linked to a drug to allow specific delivery of that drug
      to the cancer cell. Twenty years ago, basic immunologic research
      identified a molecule (CD20) specific to the surface of B lymphocytes
      that also was found to be highly expressed on the surface of most
      lymphomas. An antibody directed against this molecule was shown to be
      capable of killing cells  and thus began a 15-year odyssey to engineer
      an anti-CD20 antibody that could be used in treatment. These efforts
      succeeded, and an engineered antibody called Rituximab was approved in
      1997 by the Food and Drug Administration. It is becoming the treatment
      of choice for patients with low-grade lymphoma.

     Cancer vaccines. Unlike vaccines that are used to prevent infectious
      diseases, cancer vaccines are therapeutic, stimulating the body's own
      immune system to recognize and attack already existing cancer cells.
      The vaccine stimulates the immune system to recognize antigens on the
      cancer cells, eliciting an immune response against those cells.

   Genetic Approaches
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   The vast strides made in understanding genes have opened up new
   techniques for manipulating the genetic make-up of the cancer cell,
   allowing for highly selective approaches to treating the disease:

     Antisense therapy. Antisense therapy works at the genetic level to
      stop the process by which cancer-causing proteins are produced by
      cancerous cells. Antisense consists of a single strand of DNA designed
      in the laboratory to complement the single strand of messenger RNA in
      the tumor. The two strands bind into one, working much like a zipper,
      to block the synthesis of the harmful protein.

     Gene therapy. Addressing cancer at the genetic level has become
      increasingly possible with advances in medical technology. Scientists
      can use a virus to deliver a gene into a cancer cell, and this new
      information then becomes part of the cell's genetic make-up. Gene
      therapy can be used in three general ways: (1) to increase the
      sensitivity of cancer cells to a specific drug; (2) to replace some of
      the damaged genes that scientists believe are causing the cells to grow
      and spread abnormally; (3) to add certain genes to cancer cells, making
      them more recognizable to the patient's own immune system, which then
      destroys them.

   Chemotherapy
   [cleardot.gif]
   [cleardot.gif]
   Chemotherapy is a traditional approach to cancer treatment and remains
   the subject of extensive research. Advances in biotechnology have
   promoted the search for better drugs with fewer side effects:

     Anti-angiogenesis agents. A promising avenue of research involves
      drugs that inhibit angiogenesis, which is the development of new blood
      vessels. A solid tumor cannot grow beyond the size of a pinhead or
      spread to other parts of the body without inducing the formation of new
      blood vessels to supply its nutritional needs. Anti-angiogenesis agents
      disrupt this process, cutting off the tumor's supply of oxygen and
      nutrients. This interferes with its continued growth and spread to
      other parts of the body.

     Signaling therapies. Cells are constantly sensing their environment
      and making decisions about when to divide or not divide. The signaling
      pathways of cancer cells offer a prime target for anticancer drugs. By
      disrupting the signals within a cancer cell that tell it to divide and
      spread, the cancer cell can be killed or knocked into dormancy.
