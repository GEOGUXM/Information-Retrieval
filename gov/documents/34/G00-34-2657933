                Oceans Pathfinder


  Oceans The ocean exchanges vast amounts of gases and aerosol particles
         with the atmosphere as well as heat and energy. Because these air-sea
         interactions exert such a profound influence on the Earth's weather and
         climate patterns, scientists dubbed the ocean "the global heat engine."
         Will the ocean's circulation patterns remain stable? Is the El Niño
         phenomenon occurring more often and growing more severe?
