                               Welcome to the
              Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management's
              Office of Quality Assurance (OQA) reference page!

   The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is firmly
   committed to carrying out our mission in a manner that protects the
   health and safety of the public and workers, protects the environment,
   and satisfies applicable regulatory requirements.  In keeping with
   these commitments, we have developed a rigorous quality assurance
   program that we apply to work that could impact radiological safety or
   waste isolation.

   The overall OCRWM quality assurance program is described in the Quality
   Assurance Requirements and Description document (QARD).  The QARD
   identifies the quality assurance requirements that are applicable to
   our work and provides a top-level description of how the requirements
   will be implemented.

   OCRWM's Office of Quality Assurance is responsible for the development
   and maintenance of the QARD.  Additional responsibilities include
   providing guidance and direction to the line organizations on quality
   assurance matters, participating in reviews, and providing oversight of
   work subject to the QARD.  In its oversight role, the Office of Quality
   Assurance performs comprehensive audits and surveillances to verify
   that work is performed in accordance with the quality assurance
   requirements.  The results of these audits and surveillances are
   reported to the appropriate levels of line management, and any work
   which is not in compliance with the quality assurance program is
   identified and tracked to ensure that corrective action is taken by the
   responsible line organization.
