   California State Treasurer

   California State Treasurer Philip Angelides has made his mark in the
   civic life of California as an effective public leader and as a
   successful and innovative businessman.

   His key goals as Treasurer are to protect taxpayer funds, to
   cost-effectively finance schools and other infrastructure that
   California needs to succeed in the 21^st Century, and to invest more in
   California communities.

   Under Mr. Angelides' leadership, innovative investment policies and
   programs have been advanced to bolster California's long term economic
   strength. The Treasurers nationally acclaimed Smart Investments
   initiative has directed over $7 billion in state infrastructure and
   community development funding to support environmentally responsible
   growth patterns, a key element of which is investment in California's
   economically struggling communities.

   In May 2000, building on Smart Investments, Mr. Angelides launched a
   new initiative, The Double Bottom Line: Investing in California's
   Emerging Markets. This initiative calls for the direction of more than
   $8 billion in state investment capital, in partnership with the private
   sector, to broaden economic opportunity in the California communities
   left in the wake of the State's booming economy.

   Mr. Angelides, 48, is a graduate of Harvard University and a Coro
   Foundation Fellow. He served for eight years in California government,
   gaining a reputation as a leader in the affordable housing, urban
   planning, and public finance fields.

   He entered the private sector in 1984 and, in 1986, formed his own
   investment and management business, which quickly earned a reputation
   for economic success and innovation.

   Among his business ventures, the new town of Laguna West was featured
   in Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, U.S. News & World Report, and
   ABC-TVs "Good Morning, America," and sparked a national dialogue on
   how we can plan and build more livable communities.

   Mr. Angelides has been active in the civic life of his community and
   his State for more than 25 years. For example, he served as Co-Chair of
   the Mayors Commission on Education and the Citys Future in 1995-96,
   and then led a unique bi-partisan civic committee, which helped turn
   around the troubled Sacramento City Unified School District.

   Mr. Angelides served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party,
   through the 1992 election victories.

   Mr. Angelides and his wife, Julie, reside in their hometown of
   Sacramento.  They have three daughters  Megan, a recent graduate of
   the University of California at Davis who joined the Peace Corps in the
   fall of 2000; Christina; and Arianna.


   WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT STATE TREASURER

                             PHILIP ANGELIDES


   "No treasurer since Unruh combines his business background with his
   ample political skills."
   The Sacramento Bee
   April 4, 1999
   "Until Phil Angelides came along, calling someone an activist state
   treasurer would have been a contradiction in terms, like pacifist
   soldier or the old joke government intelligence."
   San Jose Mercury News
   July 2, 1999
   "California Treasurer Phil Angelides call for a state investment
   planis probably the closest to vision that any California statewide
   official has come since Gov. Pat Brown left office back in 1966."
   Contra Costa Times
   July 3, 1999
   "For the first time since 1991, California has vaulted above the single
   A category among all three major rating agenciesThe upgrade came as
   welcome news to first-term state Treasurer Phil Angelides, who
   campaigned on a platform to improve the states ailing credit strength.
   Angelides has already taken steps to improve the states credit
   reputation"
   The Bond Buyer
   August 11, 1999
   "Angelidesmade his case this summer in a report called Smart
   Investments. It could be one of those obscure government documents
   that break into sunlight and influence the debate nationwide."
   The Washington Post
   November 12, 1999
   "In his freshman year as an elected officialPhilip Angelides emerges
   as the most influential state treasurer since Jesse Unruh."
   The Wall Street Journal
   December 29, 1999
   "An energetic, imaginative ex-businessman with a sharp pencil, a social
   conscience and responsibility for investing public dollars, hes in an
   unusual position to make a difference. As state treasurer, Angelides
   operates, in his words, "at the intersection of public policy and
   financial capital."
   The San Jose Mercury News
   May 19, 2000
   "Angelidesis promoting state-supported investments that make money
   and stir progress."
