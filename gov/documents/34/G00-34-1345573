   search any OR all of the following fields.  However  for the best
   results when querying for information on a particular person or
   business, input just the name of the person or business. Do not input
   information in any other fields.
     * Last Name = Last name of individual.  Open text field  --  user

     * First Name = First name of individual.  Open text field  --  user
       types text
     * Business Name = Name of business.  Open text field  --  user types
       text
     * UPIN = Unique physician identification number.  Open text field

     * General = Individual or business area of employment.  Drop down
       menu  --  user selects menu option
     * Specialty = Individual or business specialty area.  Drop down menu
       --  user selects menu option
     * Exclusion = Exclusion type.  Drop down menu  --  user selects menu
       option
     * City = City where individual or business was located when
       excluded.  Open text field  --  user types text

   Once the criteria has been entered, click the Search button.

    Multiple Search

   The multiple search function allows the user to search for up to 5
   individuals or businesses at one time using the last name, first name
   or business name fields.  You may enter ALL or PART of the information
   in order to search.  Example: if you entered the letters JO in the last
   name field, all last names with JO at the beginning of the name would
   be returned, JONES, JOHNSON, JOB, JOBBS, etc.
   Once the criteria has been entered, click the search button.

   Selecting and Verifying

   You will be provided with a list of results that match your criteria.

   The results will be in columnar format listing the individuals' last
   and first names or business's names along with the general
   classification, specialty, exclusion type and exclusion date.

   You may be provided with more that one page of information.  To proceed
   to the next page, click the next button located at the bottom of the
   page.

   Scroll through the results until you find the individual or business
   that matches the one you wish to verify. SSNs are available for most,
   but not all, individuals in the database.  EINs are not available for
   businesses currently in the database, but will be included with new
   entries. If the providers SSN is listed in the database a verify link
   will appear in the last column.  If the SSN is not listed, a N/A link
   will appear and you will not be able to verify the provider on-line.

   Click the verify button located in the last column to proceed.

   Upon clicking the verify button you will be presented with a screen
   that displays the individual or business information.  In the lower
   left corner of the page there is a field titled SSN/EIN. Enter the
   individual's social security number (SSN) or the business's employee
   identification number (EIN) and press the verify key.

   If a match of the SSN/EIN IS found in the database, the screen will
   display the match information along with the date and time the search
   was performed.  If the a match of the SSN/EIN IS NOT found, a screen
   indicating the SSN/EIN entered did not match will appear. This screen
   includes the SSN/EIN, the provider information and the date and time
   the search was performed.

   If you do not receive any results in your initial query, check the
   criteria that you have entered.

                                  Background

                                  The Office of Inspector General's (OIG) List of Excluded
   Individuals/Entities (LEIE) provides information to health care
   providers, patients, and others regarding individuals and entities that
   are excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other
   Federal health care programs.  Information is readily available to
   users in two formats on over 21,000 individuals and entities currently
   excluded from program participation through action taken by the OIG.
   The on-line searchable database allows users to obtain information
   regarding excluded individuals and entities sorted by 1) the legal
   bases for exclusions; 2) the types of individuals and entities excluded
   by the OIG; and 3) the States where excluded individuals reside or
   entities do business. In addition, users may query the database in
   order to ascertain whether a particular individual or entity is
   currently excluded from program participation by submitting pertinent
   information regarding the subject. Users may obtain data sorted by
   name, profession or specialty, city, state, zip code, or sanction type.
   Users may input information in any of these fields and will receive a
   list of currently excluded individuals and entities which meet the
   criteria entered.
   In addition to the on-line searchable database, the OIG continues to
   provide information on excluded individuals and entities in a
   downloadable database file format, which will allow users to download
   the data to their personal computers and either set up their own
   databases or combine it with their existing data. Monthly exclusion
   supplements to the downloadable database file will be posted on our web
   site in the same format as the LEIE, as will separate files containing
   individuals and entities that have been reinstated each month. This
   downloadable file is current through September 30, 2000.
   These two sites provide information to health care providers who are
   considering hiring or contracting with an individual or entity, as well
   as the public in obtaining information about the Medicare or Medicaid
   participation status of an individual or entity.
