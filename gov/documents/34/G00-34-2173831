   Standard Forms and Agreements
     * Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is used when
       NIH and Industry collaborate to further develop a technology for
       commercialization.
     * Letter of Intent (LOI) for CRADA - Prior to final approval of the
       CRADA, a Letter of Intent (LOI) may be signed allowing the research
       to proceed pending final negotiation and review.
     * Materials-Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (Materials
       CRADA) - is a simpler form of CRADA. It is limited in time to one
       year and does not allow for funds to be provided for support of
       research personnel, but does provide for the transfer of
       intellectual property rights to the collaborator.
     * Material Transfers - used for the exchange of materials with
       outside organizations for research purposes. NIH Staff may use
