   What is the mission of the U. S. Geological Survey?
   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has the principal responsibility
   within the Federal Government to collect and evaluate water information
   needed for the optimum use and management of the Nation’s water
   resources. The agency is unique among Government organizations because
   it has neither regulatory nor developmental authority — its sole
   product is information. Its primary role is
   that of a scientific organization concerned with providing impartial,
   credible, relevant, and timely information that can be used for making
   informed and supportable land and water-resource management decisions.
   What are the water-resource activities of the USGS in Virginia?
   Our highly trained staff of more than 40 hydrologists, hydrologic
   technicians, and support personnel conduct water-resource activities
   from offices in Richmond and Marion. The activities include maintenance
   and analysis of information from long-term (since1898) hydrologic data
   networks for streams, reservoirs, estuaries, and ground water; and (2)
   short-term interpretive investigations of specific water-resource
   problems. Much of our work is conducted in partnership with and jointly
   funded by Federal, State, and local agencies.
