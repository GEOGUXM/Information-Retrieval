    The National Weather Service Mission

      The National Weather Service provides weather, hydrologic, and climate
      forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent
      waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the
         enhancement of the national economy. NWS data and products form a
       national information database and infrastructure which can be used by
       other governmental agencies, the private sector, the public, and the
          global community. It is accomplished by providing warnings and
        forecasts of hazardous weather, including thunderstorms, flooding,
       hurricanes, tornadoes, winter weather, tsunamis, and climate events.
       The NWS is the sole United States OFFICIAL voice for issuing warnings
                    during life-threatening weather situations.
