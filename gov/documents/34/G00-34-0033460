   Due to the recent events, NIH has heightened security around the NIH
   campus and facilities.  This will likely impact you as you arrive for
   the NPP workshop.


   As many of you know, visitor parking is very limited on the NIH campus;
   this is even more so now.  We strongly recommend that you walk, metro
   or take a cab to the meeting.


   If you choose to drive or take a cab, be prepared to have your car and
   any bags searched thoroughly.


   Be certain to bring a valid picture ID.


   Please allow for the extra time it will take to enter the NIH campus,
   regardless of your mode of transportation.


   Also, upon arriving at Lister Hill, you will likely need to show your
   ID again and may have your bags searched.  Lister Hill is preparing
   visitor tags that will need to be worn, in addition to your
   registration badge.


   Should you have any questions or concerns, please call (301-496-1447)
   or email (npp@ninds.nih.gov).


   We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!!
