   About NICHD
   Mission Statement

   The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
   seeks to assure that every individual is born healthy and wanted, that
   women suffer no adverse consequence from the reproductive process, and
   that all children have the opportunity to fulfill their potential for a
   healthy and productive life unhampered by disease or disability. In
   pursuit of this mission, the NICHD conducts and supports laboratory,
   clinical, and epidemiological research on the reproductive,
   neurobiologic, developmental, and behavioral processes that determine
   and maintain the health of children, adults, families, and populations.

   The NICHD Administers a multidisciplinary program of research, research
   training, and public information, nationally and within its own
   facilities, on reproductive biology and population issues; on prenatal
   development as well as maternal, child and family health; and on
   medical rehabilitation. Institute Programs are based on the concepts
   that adult health and well-being are determined in large part by
   episodes early in life, that human development is continuous throughout
   life, and that the reproductive processes and the management of
   fertility are of major concern, not only to the individual, but to
   society. NICHD research is also directed toward restoring or maximizing
   individual potential and functional capacity when disease, injury, or a
   chronic disorder intervenes in the developmental process.

   The Institute supports and conducts basic, clinical, and
   epidemiological research in the reproductive sciences to develop
   knowledge enabling men and women to regulate their fertility in ways
   that are safe, effective and acceptable to various population groups,
   and to overcome problems of infertility.

   The purposes of Institute sponsored behavioral and social sciences
   research in the population field are to understand the causes and
   consequences of reproductive behavior and population change. Research
   for mothers, children, and families is designed to advance knowledge of
   pregnancy, fetal development, and birth; to develop strategies to
   prevent infant and child mortality; to identify and promote the
   prerequisites of optimal physical, mental, and behavioral growth and
   development through infancy, childhood, and adolescence; and to
   contribute to the prevention and amelioration of mental retardation and
   developmental disabilities. Much of this research focuses on the
   disciplines of cellular, molecular, and developmental biology to
   elucidate the mechanisms and interactions that guide a single
   fertilized egg cell through its development into a multicellular,
   highly organized adult organism. Research in medical rehabilitation is
   designed to develop improved techniques and technologies with respect
   to the rehabilitation of individuals with physical disabilities
   resulting from diseases, disorders, injuries, or birth defects.

   Research training is an area supported across all NICHD research
   programs, with the intent of adding to the cadre of trained
   professionals available to conduct research in areas of critical public
   health concern. An overarching responsibility of the NICHD is to
   disseminate information emanating from the Institute research programs
   to researchers, practitioners and other health professionals, and to
   the general public.
