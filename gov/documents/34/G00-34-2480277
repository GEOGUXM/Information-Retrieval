   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001

              Important Announcement from the National Archives
             for School Groups Planning to Visit Washington, DC,
                         between July 2001 and 2003

     Washington, DC. . . The exhibit halls of the National Archives
     Building in downtown Washington, DC, will close for renovation on
     July 5, 2001 and reopen in 2003. During this period, when the
     Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights are
     off public display, they will continue to be available online and
     the research side of the building will remain open. In addition, the
     National Archives and Records Administration will launch a new web
     portal this June, and in the fall, will begin a major nationwide
     tour of documentary treasures from its holdings.

     During the renovation of the Rotunda, the Charters of Freedom will
     be removed from their current encasements for the first time in 50
     years, examined by conservators, and re-encased in new airtight
     containers. In addition, the two oversized murals by Barry Faulkner
     depicting the presentation of the Declaration of Independence and
     the Constitution will be restored. The display cases for the
     Charters of Freedom will also be reconfigured, allowing all four
     pages of the Constitution to be displayed (currently only the first
     and last pages can be displayed), and making the Declaration of
     Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights
     accessible to visitors with disabilities.

     When the Rotunda reopens, visitors will be welcomed to a new,
     state-of-the-art, public exhibition space in which documents from
     the holdings of the National Archives will be complemented by media
     presentations, computer interactives, and immersive environments. A
     new Learning Center will make an exciting schedule of interactive
     workshops, lectures, films, and tours available.

     Additional information is available on the National Archives web
     site at www.nara.gov.
