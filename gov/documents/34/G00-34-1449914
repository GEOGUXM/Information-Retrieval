   This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your

   If you visit our site to read or download information, such as consumer
   brochures or press releases:

          We collect and store only the following information about you:
          the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
          example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
          account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton
          University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and
          the Internet address of the website from which you linked
          directly to our site. We do not store any personal identifiers.

          For site management, information is collected for statistical
          purposes. This government computer system uses software programs
          to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes
          as assessing what information is of most and least interest,
          determining technical design specifications, and identifying
          system performance or problem areas. We use the information we
          collect to measure the number of visitors to the different
          sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful
          to visitors. This information is only used internally, does not
          contain personal identifiers, and will only be used for internal
          management purposes.

   questionnaire or guestbook:

          You also may decide to send us personally-identifying
          information, for example, in an electronic mail message
          containing a complaint. We use personally-identifying
          information from consumers in various ways to further our
          customer's protection and to provide better service. This may be
          to correct broken links that you have identified or provide
          additional information that you have requested. Visit Talk to Us
          to learn what can happen to the information you provide us when
          you send us e-mail or fill out a questionnaire or guestbook..
          Any information that we collect via a questionnaire or a
          guestbook may be subject to disclosure, but will be handled in
          accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act and the
          Freedom of Information Act to ensure the greatest protection of
          personal privacy in the face of any required disclosure.


          We want to be very clear: We will not obtain
          personally-identifying information about you when you visit our
          site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
          Except as might be required by law, we do not share any
