   Overview

   Mayor Anthony A. Williams took office on January 2, 1999, and
   identified his vision and a plan of action for Washington, DC. Mayor
   Williams asks the people of DC to come together and work together to
   improve the quality of life in the District for both its citizens and
   the local business community.

   A Vision for the District of Columbia

   The vision for the District is a simple vision, but one that is shared
   by citizens from Anacostia to Adams Morgan: our citizens deserve the
   best city in America. That means:
     * Strong schools, safe streets, clean communities, affordable
       housing, and reliable transportation;
     * Access for all people to health care where our senior citizens and
       children at risk receive quality services;
     * A wealth of social and cultural growth opportunities;
     * Vibrant economies downtown and in the neighborhoods;
     * True inclusion, a seat at the table for all;
     * Taking advantage of the District's truly unique assets â€” tourism
       that is second to none, unique partnerships with federal agencies,
       a strong regional economy that lacks only a vital urban center; and
     * Empowering men, women, and children of all communities to solve
       problems together. Coming together, working together, succeeding
       together.

     * A Call to Action
     * Cities Are at the Heart of Our Culture and History
     * Economic Recovery
     * Realizing the Vision
