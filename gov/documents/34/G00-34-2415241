   This website contains information provided and approved by the Unified
   Command for specific spill incidents. The Unified Command is the group
   responsible for conducting response operations at the scene of an
   incident. It is usually comprised of the U.S. Coast Guard Federal
   On-Scene Coordinator, the State On-Scene Coordinator, and a
   representative of the responsible party.

   Information is posted on the site as it becomes available. The timing
   of updates depends on the nature of each spill and resources available
   to post the material. The date of updates is noted on each page. During
   rapidly-evolving events, the site might be updated several times per
   day. In the later phases of a response, the site might be updated once
   per week.

   The site is maintained by the Hazardous Materials Response Division,
   Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service, National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in support of U.S. Coast Guard
   incident response operations.
