                             ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM

   The Board is mandated to protect consumers from licensees who practice
   in an unsafe, incompetent or impaired manner. To achieve this goal, the
   Board administers a licensing exam to ensure that candidates possess
   the minimum level of competence. The Board currently regulates the
   practice of over 92,500 vocational nurses and 15,500 psychiatric
   technicians in the State of California.

   The Board has authority to revoke, suspend, or place on probation any
   license if the licensee has violated a provision of the law governing
   the profession (Business and Professions Code, Division 2, Chapter 6.5,
   Article 3). Further, the Board has authority to deny licensure to
   anyone convicted of a crime substantially related to the profession or
   who has done any act which, if done by a licensee, would be grounds for
   revocation or suspension of the license.

   The Board has established an aggressive enforcement program to ensure
   that timely and appropriate disciplinary action is taken against
   unprofessional, incompetent, or grossly negligent practitioners. The
   Board utilizes the services of the Attorney General's (AG) Office and
   the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to ensure that disciplinary
   actions are handled in a fair and judicious manner.
