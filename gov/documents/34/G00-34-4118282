     This service is a general tool for displaying ENSDF-formatted
     nuclear data. The following features are currently implemented:
     * HTML Tables from data sets (several varieties)
     * ENSDF/2 formatted data sets
     * Level drawings and Band drawings (Java)

     The function displaying HTML tables is reasonably well debugged and
     works for most JavaScript-enabled browsers. The Java drawings are in
     a very preliminary stage of development and require the latest
     version of Netscape Navigator (v.4.5 or later on the Windows, Linux
     and Sun UNIX platforms works).

     ENSDF data are from the ENSDF file, which is maintained by the
     National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) at Brookhaven. Please contact
     Jagdish K. Tuli (Tuli@BNL.GOV) for errors in the data.

     Superdeformed data are from an evaluation by Balraj Singh
     (balraj@mcmail.cis.McMaster.CA).

     UNSDF data are unevaluated ENSDF formatted data usually from one
     publication or experiment.

     Please contact Frank Chu (SYFChu@LBL.GOV) for presentation problems.

     Example of usage:

     To get a gamma table for ^60Co decay:
    1. Enter 60 in the Nuclide field
    2. Select beta- decay in the Data set select box
    3. Click the Get List button
    4. Select 60Ni 60Co b- decay (5.2714 Y) in the appearing Data set
       select box
    5. Select Gamma table in the Output select box
    6. Click the Display button

     The references button    [refs.gif]    gives access to the NSR
     server. With this facility you can search the Nuclear Science
     References file.
