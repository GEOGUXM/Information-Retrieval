   The Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Branch at NASA Langley Research
   Center (LaRC) represents the major thrusts of the NDE research program.
   The program focuses on maintaining an NDE science base core, developing
   new technologies for the Agency, and transferring problem solutions to
   our customers. As a research and technology organization, we interact
   with scientists and engineers at LaRC, at other field centers,
   aerospace contractors, U.S. industry in general, and universities. The
   LaRC NDE research program is focused in two Offices - Safety and
   Mission Quality and Aero-Space Transportation Technology which covers
   applications primarily for Space Operations/Transportation System
   (spacecraft integrity), Subsonic,Supersonic and Hypersonic Aeronautics
   (aircraft integrity). The branch is matrix managed through technology
   groups and project activities as shown below.

   As a National Laboratory, it is our philosophy to provide a national
   focal point for advancing aerospace NDE technologies and transfer our
   technology to other appropriate government, industry, and university
   centers. We hold periodic technology workshops to acquaint U.S.
   industry with our technology and to facilitate technology transfer
   through licensing and resulting commercialization of our techniques.
