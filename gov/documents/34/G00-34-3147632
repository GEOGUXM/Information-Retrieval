   Free Air CO[2][[ ]]Enrichment (FACE)
                                                         [BER%20Logo50.gif]

   Climate model predictions are no better than error estimates for the
   driving variable atmospheric CO[2] concentration ([CO[2]][atm]). The
   biosphere is the primary regulator of atmospheric CO[2] over the period
   of years to decades. Reducing uncertainties in estimates of future
   [CO[2]][atm ]and carbon sequestration requires narrowing errors in
   estimates of present and future biosphere-atmosphere CO[2] gross
   fluxes. Expanded eddy flux networks will tell us how the
   biosphere-atmosphere system works now, with well documented error
   estimates (Global C fluxes).

   FACE facilities can tell us how increasing atmospheric CO[2] will
   change terrestrial biosphere system behavior. .

What is FACE?

   FACE provides a technology by which the microclimate around growing
   plants may be modified to simulate climate change conditions. Typically
   CO[2]-enriched air is released from a circle of vertical pipes into
   plots up to 30m in diameter, and as tall as 20 m. (Engineering)

   Fast feedback control and pre-dilution of CO[2] provide stable,
   elevated [CO[2]] simulating climate change conditions.

   No containment is required with FACE equipment and there is no
   significant change in natural air-flow. Large FACE plots reduce effects
   of plot edge and capture fully-functioning, integrated ecosystem-scale
   processes. FACE Field data represent plant and ecosystems responses to
   concentrations of atmospheric CO[2] expected in the mid-twenty-first
   century.

FACE - A Window on the Future
(Understanding Long-term Carbon Sequestration)

   Measurements of photosynthesis and carbon sequestration under present
   conditions do not reveal how these processes will behave in the
   CO[2]-enriched atmosphere of the future. FACE creates realistic,
   mid-21^st century CO[2] conditions in which processes regulating plant
   and ecosystem responses to future conditions are quantified.

   We need to predict ecosystems responses to [CO2][atm] of the next
   century, but the stature, diversity or longevity of many ecosystems
   preclude the use of chambers for CO[2] enrichment studies at the
   ecosystem scale. FACE does not disturb microclimate variables that
   impact plant growth and ecosystem responses. FACE allows realistic
   assessment of long-term responses of intact systems to elevated
   [CO2][atm] while being less disruptive to the ecosystem than other
   exposure approaches.

   FACE provides a means for manipulating ecosystems and quantifying the
   responses of critical processes regulating carbon exchange.

   The size of FACE experimental plots provides the only means of
   conducting experiments on forest stands in their normal setting,
   simultaneously encompassing below-ground processes.

                   7 Sites have large diameter FACE systems now on line (Sites).

   FACE technology now has a long track record of operating efficiently
   and cost effectively for a broad range of ecosystems providing a
   research platform for many hundreds of investigators.
