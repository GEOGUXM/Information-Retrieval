      History
   [dotclear.gif]

        South Florida's subtropical extremes of hurricane, flood and
   drought--combined with efforts to populate this "new frontier"-- led
   the U.S. Congress to adopt legislation creating the Central and
   Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C&SF) in 1948. [dotclear.gif]
         In 1949, the Florida Legislature created the Central and Southern
   Florida Flood Control District, the predecessor to the South Florida
   Water Management District (District). In 1972, with the Florida Water
   Resources Act (Chapter 373), the state created five water management
   districts, with expanded responsibilities for regional water resource
   management and environmental protection. The districts' boundaries are
   determined by watersheds and other natural, hydrologic and geographic
   features. In 1976, voters approved a constitutional amendment giving
   the districts the authority to levy property taxes. [dotclear.gif]

        Today, the District operates and maintains this massive project,
   which today includes 1,800 miles of canals and levees, 25 major pumping
   stations and about 200 larger and 2,000 smaller water control
   structures. [dotclear.gif]
          The District spans 16 counties with a total population of about
   six million residents. This geographic region covers 17,930 square
   miles and includes vast areas of agricultural lands, water conservation
   areas, and areas of enormous urban growth and development.

          The agency provides flood control protection and water supply
   protection to residents living and working in cities or on farms within
   this region; and is working to restore and manage ecosystems from the
   Kissimmee River to the Everglades and Florida Bay. [dotclear.gif]
