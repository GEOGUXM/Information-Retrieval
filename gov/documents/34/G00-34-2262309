   Wastewater Treatment Division
   Clean Water: A Sound Investment

      Our mission is to protect public health and the environment by
      conveying and treating the regionâ€™s wastewater. Since 1958, when King
      County citizens voted to build a regional wastewater system to clean
      the polluted waters of Lake Washington & Puget Sound, we have helped to
      improve water quality, while recycling and reusing natural resources.
