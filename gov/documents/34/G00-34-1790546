             STS-91 will mark the final Shuttle/Mir Docking Mission. This
             Phase 1 Program is a precursor to the International Space
             Station maintaining a continuous American presence in space and
             developing the procedures and hardware required for an
             international partnership in space.

             STS-91 will also carry into space the Alpha Magnetic
             Spectrometer Investigation (AMS). The objectives of this
             investigation are to search for anti-matter and dark matter in
             space and to study astrophysics.

             The mission will also be the first use of the super lightweight
             external tank (SLWT) which is the same size (154ft long and 27ft
             in diameter) as the external tank used on previous launches but
             7,500 lbs lighter. The tank is made of an aluminum lithium alloy
             and the tank's structural design also has been improved making
             it 30% stronger and 5% less dense. The walls of the redesigned
             hydrogen tank are machined in an orthogonal waffle-like pattern,
             providing more strength and stability than the previous design.
             These improvements will provide additional payload capacity to
             the International Space Station. (Reference NASA Press Release
             98-6)

   Launch:

             Launch June 2, 1998 6:06:24 p.m. EDT at the opening of the 10
             minute launch window.

             On Tuesday, June 2, 1998 launch preparations continued on
             schedule. Go for tanking was given at 9:30am after receiving a
             briefing about the readiness of the Mir Space station. By noon,
             at the T-minus 3 hour mark, LH2 cryogenic propellant loading was
             complete and in stable replenish mode. Loading of the Liquid
             Oxygen tank was about 80% complete. At 12:30am EDT, tanking
             operations were complete and the external tank was in stable
             replenish mode. The crew departed the Operations and Checkout
             Building at 2:19pm EDT, traveled to Launch Pad 39A and were
             installed into the orbiter by 3:30pm EDT. At 4:02pm EDT the
             Discovery's hatch was closed for flight. At 5:47pm EDT and
             T-minus 25 minutes and counting the white room close out was
             complete and the closeout team left Launch Pad 39A. At T-minus
             14 minutes and holding, the mission management team decided to
             move the T-0 time to the opening of the launch window at 6;06pm
             EDT. At 5:15pm EDT, the countdown entered a planned 40 minute
             hold at the T-minus 9 minute and holding mark. At 17:57 EDT the
             coundown came out of the T-minus 9 minute hold with the only
             concern being tracked was a slightly low pressure on the Orbiter
             Access Arm (OAA). The OAA retracted successfully at 17:59 EDT.
             Liftoff occured at 6:06pm EDT. SRB Sep 2.5min into flight,
             downrange 56 miles.

             On Monday, June 1, 1998, launch preparations continued on
             schedule and final preflight preparations of Shuttle main
             engines concluded. On Tuesday, at about 12:30 a.m. the Rotating
             Service Structure will be retracted into the launch position.
             Loading of the external tank with its flight load of cryogenic
             propellants begins at about 9:14 a.m. 6/2/98 and continues for
             about 3 hours. Managers continue to monitor the situation with
             Mir's motion control computer. At this time, systems aboard Mir
             have stabilized sufficiently for managers to proceed with
             countdown operations. A final check of Mir's systems will occur
             prior to tanking activities tomorrow morning. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 6/1/1998)

             On Sunday, May 31, 1998, The countdown for launch of mission
             STS-91 began as scheduled at 9 p.m. 5/30/98 at the T-43 hour
             mark. All pre-launch activities at Kennedy Space Center.continue
             without problem toward a target lift-off time of 6:10 p.m. on
             Tuesday, June 2, from Launch Pad 39A. Today at KSC, engineers
             are preparing the Shuttle Discovery for the loading of cryogenic
             reactants into the onboard power reactant and storage
             distribution tanks. Loading is set to begin at about 5 p.m.
             Prior to this operation, a standard orbiter and solid rocket
             booster pyrotechnic initiator controller test will be performed.
             Cryogenic loading operations are expected to conclude by
             midnight tonight. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/31/1998)

             On Saturday, May 30, 1998 The countdown for launch of mission
             STS-91 remains on schedule to begin tonight at 9 p.m. at the
             T-43 hour mark. All prelaunch activities continue on schedule.
             The contingency space suits have been installed into the
             orbiter's airlock and check-out of those suits completed. Flight
             crew equipment stowage in the orbiter's mid-deck continued and
             aft main engine compartment close-outs were completed and final
             main propulsion system checks under way. The crew for mission
             STS-91 arrived at KSC's Shuttle Landing Facility at about 12:50
             p.m. EDT. They will spend the days prior to launch at KSC
             reviewing their flight plans, undergoing final medical
             examinations and flying in the Shuttle Training Aircraft.
