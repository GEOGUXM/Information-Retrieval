                              Contact My Office



     My office now has a more convenient e-mail system!  After you enter
      your personal information for the first time, our new system will
    recognize you when you contact me again and won't require you to fill
     in your personal information a second time. The data you give me is
       completely confidential and will never be given to anyone else.

      Do not use this form if you are on a public computer. There is a
       possibility that the next computer user could see your personal
    information. If you are on a public computer, please use "Write Your
     Rep" instead of this form; it is completely secure even on library,
                         school, or work computers.
     If you would like more information on how this system works, please
                        read my "How It Works" page.

     ** If you would like to contact my office by phone or mail, please
                          visit my address page. **
