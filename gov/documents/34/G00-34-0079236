                      FLORIDA MANATEE STATUS STATEMENT

                   Manatee Population Status Working Group

                                9 March 2001

   Years of scientific study of the Florida manatee have revealed both
   good news and some cause for concern regarding the status of this
   endangered aquatic mammal, according to the Interagency Manatee
   Population Status Working Group.  The Manatee Population Status Working
   Group comprises biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
   Commission, Chicago Zoological Society, and Wildlife Trust.  The
   group's primary tasks are to assess manatee population trends, to
   advise the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on population criteria to
   determine when species recovery has been achieved, and to provide
   managers with interpretation of available information on manatee
   population biology.
   Long-term studies suggest four relatively distinct regional
   subpopulations of the Florida manatee:  Northwest, Southwest, Atlantic
   (including the St. Johns River north of Palatka), and St. Johns River
   (south of Palatka). These divisions are based primarily on documented
   manatee use of wintering sites and from radio-tracking studies of
   individuals' movements.  Although some movement occurs among
   subpopulations, researchers found that analysis of manatee status on a
   regional level provided insights into important factors related to
   manatee recovery.
   The exact number of manatees in Florida is unknown. Manatees are
   difficult to count because they are often in areas with poor water
   clarity, and their behavior, such as resting on the bottom of a deep
   canal, may make them difficult to see.  A coordinated series of aerial
   surveys and ground counts, known as the statewide synoptic survey, has
   been conducted in most years since 1991.  The synoptic survey in
   January 2001 resulted in a count of 3,276, the highest count to date.
   The highest previous count was 2,639 in 1996.  Survey results are
   highly variable, and do not reflect actual population trend.  For
   example, statewide counts on 16 and 27 January 2000 differed by 36%
   (1,629 and 2,222, respectively).  Excellent survey conditions and an
   unusually cold winter undoubtedly contributed to the high count in
   2001.
   Evidence indicates that the Northwest and Upper St. Johns River
   subpopulations have steadily increased over the last 25 years. This
   population growth is consistent with the lower number of human-related
   deaths, high estimates of adult survival, and good manatee habitat in
   these regions.  Unfortunately, this good news is tempered by the fact
   that the manatees in these two regions probably account for less than
   20% of the state's manatee population.
   The picture is less optimistic for the Atlantic coast subpopulation.
   Scientists are concerned that the adult survival rate (the percentage
   of adults that survives from one year to the next) is lower than what
   is needed for sustained population growth.  The population on this
   coast appears to have been growing slowly in the 1980s but now may have
   leveled off, or could even be declining.  In other words, it's too
   close to call.  This finding is consistent with the high level of
   human-related and, in some years, cold-related mortality in the
   region.  Since 1978, management efforts to reduce human-related manatee
   deaths have included strategies focused on reducing manatee collisions
   with boats, reducing hazards such as entrapment in water control
   structures and entanglement in fishing gear, and protecting manatee
   winter aggregation sites to reduce cold-related mortality.  Managers
   are continually challenged to develop innovative protection strategies,
   given the rapidly growing human population along Florida's coasts.
   Estimates of survival and population growth rates are currently
   underway for the Southwest region.  Preliminary estimates of adult
   survival are similar to those for the Atlantic region, i.e.,
   substantially lower than those for the Northwest and Upper St. Johns
   River regions.  This area has had high levels of watercraft-related
   deaths and injuries, as well as periodic natural mortality events
   caused by red tide and severe cold.  However, pending further data
   collection and analysis, scientists are unable to provide an assessment
   of how manatees are doing in this part of the state.
   Over the past ten years, approximately 30% of manatee deaths have been
   directly attributable to human-related causes, including watercraft
   collisions, accidental crushing and drowning in water control
   structures, and entanglements in fishing gear.  In 2000, 34% (94 of
   273) of manatee deaths were human-related.  The continued high level of
   manatee deaths raises concern about the ability of the overall
   population to grow or at least remain stable.  The Manatee Population
   Status Working Group is also concerned about the negative impacts of
   factors that are difficult to quantify, such as habitat loss and
   chronic effects of severe injuries.
   The group agrees that the results of the analyses underscore an
   important fact:  Adult survival is critical to the manatee's
   recovery. In the regions where adult survival rates are high, the
   population has grown at a healthy rate. In order to assure high adult
   survival the group emphasizes the urgent need to make significant
   headway in reducing the number of human related manatee deaths.

   THE MANATEE POPULATION STATUS WORKING GROUP

   The 1996 Florida Manatee Recovery Plan identified the need for a
   population status working group to assess manatee population trends.
   The Manatee Population Status Working Group is an
   interagency/organization team of scientists with research or management
   expertise in manatee biology and ecology.  The Working Group has been
   meeting 2-3 times per year since 1998.  The goals of the Working Group
   are to:
   1) Assess the status of the Florida manatee population on an annual
   basis;
   2) Advise U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on appropriate population
   criteria for determining when recovery has been achieved and
   downlisting or delisting should be considered;
   3) Provide interpretation of available information on manatee
   population biology to managers;
   4) Make recommendations to research groups concerning needed research
   directions and methods;
   5) Obtain rigorous external review of manatee population data,
   conclusions, and research methods by independent researchers with
   expertise in population biology and biometrics.
