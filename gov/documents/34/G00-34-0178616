   Protein Folding Studies

   [protg.gif]

   Protein folding is a particular focus area. Theoretical analysis
   includes the nature of protein folding pathways; an analysis of the
   complexity of folding; and the role of chaos in folding. Applied
   folding studies aim at developing effective methods of predicting
   structure from sequence through the implementation of more thorough
   search algorithms and the evolution of discriminatory functions better
   able to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect structures.
   Search methods currently studied are molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo;
   co-operative methods, in particular genetic algorithms; graph based
   methods; and dynamic pathway models. New methods of assessing available
   search methods and potentials are being developed, through the
   organization of large scale objective structure prediction experiments,
   and the implementation of web based collaborative systems.

   Computational methods are also being used to guide experimental
   studies, through the development of protein- ligand docking methods,
   mutational studies of signal transduction in a muscle protein, the
   analysis of the catalytic mechanisms and specificity of enzymes, and
   studies of mutational and chemical modifications of hemoglobin, aimed
   at producing a better blood substitute.
