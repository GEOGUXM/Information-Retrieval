   NHMFL user facilities support a broad range of research topics and
   techniques, including magneto-optics, high pressure, transport,
   magnetoresistance, millimeter wave spectroscopy, specific heat, low to
   medium resolution NMR, materials characterization, solution state and
   solid state NMR, ICR, EMR, and many others.

   The main facilities of the laboratory are located at FSU in a 330,000
   sq. ft. complex housing the continuous fields (DC) magnet resources,
   the Center for Interdisciplinary Magnetic Resonance (CIMAR), and the
   Geochemistry facilities. The NHMFL Pulsed Field Facility is located at
   LANL in New Mexico, while the High B/T (magnetic field/temperature)
   Facility and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Spectroscopy (MRI/S) assets
   of the laboratory are located at UF in Gainesville.
