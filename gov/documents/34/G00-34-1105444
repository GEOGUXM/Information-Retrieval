   How can I tell if a case has been assigned to the Pittsburgh or Erie
   division?

   Bankruptcy cases are assigned a case year number that includes the
   divisional office number. Erie is office "1" and Pittsburgh is office
   "2." Each bankruptcy case begins with a two digit number that specifies
   the year it is filed followed by a dash and a 5 digit number that
   begins with the divisional office number. For example, 99-12345 is an
   Erie case, because the first number after the dash is a "1." An example
   of a Pittsburgh case number is 99-23456. The Pittsburgh or Erie
   Division will be listed at the top page of the case docket.

                               [aglarule.gif]

   What is a Bankruptcy Discharge?

   EXPLANATION OF BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE IN A CHAPTER 7 CASE

   This court order grants a discharge to the debtor. It is not a
   dismissal of the case and it does not determine how much money, if any,
   the trustee will pay to creditors.

   Collection of Discharged Debts Prohibited:

   The discharge prohibits any attempt to collect from the debtor a debt
   that has been discharged. For example, a creditor is not permitted to
   contact a debtor by mail, phone, or otherwise, to file or continue a
   lawsuit, to attach wages or other property, or to take any other action
   to collect a discharged debt from the debtor. A creditor who violates
   this order can be required to pay damages and attorney 's fees to the
   debtor.

   However, a creditor may have the right to enforce a valid lien, such as
   a mortgage or security interest, against the debtor's property after
   the bankruptcy, if that lien was not avoided or eliminated in the
   bankruptcy case. Also, a debtor may voluntarily pay any debt that has
   been discharged.

   Debts That are Discharged:

   The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to
   pay a debt that is discharged. Most, but not all, types of debts are
   discharged if the debt existed on the date the bankruptcy case was
   filed. (If this case was begun under a different chapter of the
   Bankruptcy Code and converted to chapter 7, the discharge applies to
   debts owed when the bankruptcy case was converted.)

   Some of the common types of debts which are not discharged in a chapter
   7 bankruptcy case are:

   [aglabul1.gif] Debts for most taxes
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts that are in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or
   support
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts for most student loans
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts for most fines, penalties, forfeitures, or
   criminal restitution obligations
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts for personal injuries or death caused by the
   debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated
   [aglabul1.gif] Some debts which were not properly listed by the debtor
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts that the bankruptcy court specifically has decided
   or will decide in this bankruptcy case are not discharged
   [aglabul1.gif] Debts for which the debtor has given up the discharge
   protections by signing a reaffirmation agreement in compliance with the
   Bankruptcy Code requirements for reaffirmation of debts

   This information is only a general summary of the bankruptcy discharge.
   There are exceptions to these general rules. Because the law is
   complicated, you may want to consult an attorney to determine the exact
   effect of the discharge in this case.

   While the information presented above is accurate as of the date of
   publication, it should not be cited or relied upon as legal authority.
   It is highly recommended that legal advice be obtained from a
   bankruptcy attorney . For filing requirements, please refer to the
   United States Bankruptcy Code (title 11, United States Code), the
   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and the Local Rules for the
   United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of
   Pennsylvania.

                               [aglarule.gif]

   Does a chapter 7 discharge order entered after the death of the debtor
   have to reference that the debtor is no longer living?

   No, nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or Rules requires that a discharge
   order entered after the death of the debtor reference the debtor’s
   death. Rule 1016 of the Bankruptcy Rules specifically provides that a
   chapter 7 bankruptcy case should be administered, so far as possible,
   as though the death had not occurred. Further, commentary in
   legislative history provides that if a debtor dies during the
   bankruptcy case, the discharge will apply in personam to relieve the
   debtor, and thus his probate representative, of liability from
   discharged debts. If a chapter 11, 12, or 13 case is pending when the
   debtor dies, the case may be dismissed or may proceed if further
   administration is possible and in the best interest of the parties. See
   Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1016.

   What is a section 341(a) meeting of creditors?

   Section 341(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires every debtor to
   personally attend a meeting of creditors and to submit to an
   examination under oath. The United States Trustee, his designee or, in
   a chapter 7 or 13 case, a panel or standing trustee, presides at the
   meeting. Creditors may question the debtor under oath, elect a trustee
   other than the one assigned, and conduct such other business as may be
   appropriate. Creditors are not required to be represented by counsel or
   attend the meeting.

   While the information presented above is accurate as of the date of
   publication, it should not be cited or relied upon as legal authority.

   What is a motion?

   A motion is a written formal statement in which the party who is
   requesting an action, the movant, sets forth his grounds for the action
   requested. The party against whom the action is requested is the
   respondent. An order granting the relief requested must be attached to
   each motion filed.

   In an adversary proceeding, is there a filing fee for a third-party
   complaint?

   No, there is no filing fee for a third-party complaint. A filing fee
   has already been paid for filing the original complaint (unless a
   filing fee exception applied).

                               [aglarule.gif]

   What is the difference between Chapters 7, 11, 12 and 13?

   Chapter 7 is designed for individuals, corporations and partnerships in
   financial difficulty who do not have the ability to pay their existing
   debts. Under chapter 7, a trustee takes possession of all the debtor's
   non-exempt property, if any, liquidates it for cash and uses the
   proceeds to pay creditors according to priorities of the Bankruptcy
   Code.

   Chapter 11 allows a business to reorganize and restructure its finances
   so that it may continue to operate, provide employees with jobs, pay
   its creditors, and produce a return for its stockholders, if any. While
   chapter 11 is primarily designed for a business it is also available to
   individuals. In a chapter 11 case the debtor proposes a plan to
   creditors which, if accepted by the creditors and approved by the
   court, will allow a debtor to reorganize. A debtor may also propose a
   plan of liquidation and cease doing business.

   Chapter 13 enables individuals with regular incomes, under court
   supervision and protection, to repay their debts over an extended
   period of time according to a plan. The plan may call for full or
   partial repayment. Corporations cannot file under Chapter 13 of the
   Bankruptcy Code.

   Chapter 12 allows family farmers with financial difficulties to repay
   debts over a period of time from future earnings. In many ways it is
   similar to a chapter 13 case. The eligibility requirements are
   restrictive and limits its use to those whose income arises primarily
   from a family-owned farm.

   What will happen to my case if I filed bankruptcy before and did not
   pay the entire filing fee?

   A Bankruptcy Judge may take any of the following steps when a
   bankruptcy case is dismissed, the entire filing fee has not been paid,
   and the debtor tries to file another case within 180 days of the entry
   of the dismissal order: (1) dismiss the case for failure to abide by an
   order of the court pursuant to §109(g)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code; (2)
   refuse to allow the debtor to pay the filing fee for the current case
   in installments; or (3) take other action that is appropriate for the
   case.

   If the debtor files a case after 180 days, the court can deny a motion
   to pay the fee in installments based on the failure to pay previous
   fees.

   Is it permissible that attorneys sign amendments to bankruptcy
   schedules?

   No.  Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure 1008 and 9011 specifically state
   that the debtor is the only person authorized to sign amendments.
