   AO Lessons Learned
     * The ESSP Program conducted an open public forum at the Crystal City
       Sheraton on July 30-31, 1997 to solicit lessons learned based on
       the recently completed ESSP AO-1 solicitation. The conference was
       structured to actively solicit input from diverse perspectives.
       Participants included Principal Investigators (PI's) and mission
       partners from academia, industry, government and FFRDC's
       representing both selected and non-selected proposal teams.
       Representatives from NASA Headquarters and the ESSP Project Office
       at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) were also present. All
       present were invited to provide constructive feedback on their
       experience with the initial ESSP solicitation. To view the final
       conference report, choose the file format you desire below...
