   PART 1. General Provisions

   LR 9029-1. Effective Date

   By Order entered on the 10th day of July, 1987, these Rules were
   adopted by the Judges of this District and became effective thirty (30)
   days after entry thereof.

   LR 9029-2. Scope and Construction of Rules

   These Rules govern practice and procedure in the United States
   Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. The Rules
   shall govern all proceedings, including proceedings under Part VII of
   the Bankruptcy Rules, and Bankruptcy Rule 9014, in all cases filed
   after the effective date and in all further proceedings in cases
   pending on the effective date, unless otherwise specifically ordered by
   the Court.

   The rules, and any form which may be provided herein, shall be
   construed in a manner consistent with the United States "Bankruptcy
   Rules and Official Forms".

   These rules shall be construed to achieve an orderly administration of
   the business of this Court; to govern the practice of attorneys before
   this Court; to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination
   of cases; and to promote consistency in the practice of this Court
   alone, together with consistency of practice in this Court, and sister
   courts within the United States Bankruptcy System, and the United
   States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia.

   LR 9029-3. Rescission of Prior Effective General Orders

   Prior to the effective date of these rules, local practice and
   procedure were governed by entry of various General Orders. The
   effective General Orders of this Court have been incorporated in these
   rules and by adoption of the rules, all general orders of the Court are
   rescinded; provided, general orders may be entered which govern
   internal office practices or the duties and responsibilities of Court
   personnel and panel trustees.


   PART 2. Court Administration

   LR 5001-1. Sessions of Court

   The Court shall be in continuous session for transacting judicial
   business on all business days throughout the year.

   LR 1071-1. Divisions of Business -- Venue, Geography

   The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of West
   Virginia is the proper venue for cases in which the debtor's residence
   is in one of the thirty-two (32) counties as listed in these Local
   Rules.

   The Northern District of West Virginia includes four (4) divisional
   offices located in the cities of Wheeling, Clarksburg, Elkins, and
   Martinsburg. The Bankruptcy Court will, in the interests of the
   parties, conduct hearings and other proceedings, including meetings of
   creditors, at each of the divisional locations whenever feasible.

   All pleadings and other papers shall be filed with the Clerk of the
   Bankruptcy Court at either the Wheeling or Clarksburg division as
   follows:

                       United States Bankruptcy Court

                          12th and Chapline Streets

                             Post Office Box 70

                             Wheeling, WV 26003

                            U.S. Bankruptcy Court

                            324 West Main Street

                            Clarksburg, WV 26301

              See also, Bankruptcy Rule 1014 (Change of Venue)


   LR 9072-1. Preparation of Orders

   Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, the party prevailing at any
   hearing or trial shall submit to the Court an order conforming to the
   Court's decision not later than five (5) working days following the
   hearing or trial. The use of telephone or other authorization not
   requiring counsel's actual signature is permitted, but the preferred
   method of insuring accuracy of the order is to obtain the written
   endorsement of counsel for any party in interest.

   LR 2002-1. Notice Practice

   Consistent with the directives of the Administrative Office of the
   United States Courts and the Office of Audit and Review, the Court may,
   from time to time, require counsel for an applicant or movant to serve
   or transmit required notices to all creditors or particular parties in
   interest.

   Unless otherwise required by these Rules, counsel for the applicant or
   movant shall prepare all notices which are required to be served,
   whether service is to be made by counsel or by the Clerk of the Court.

                               Cross Reference

                    For ยง 522 practice, see LR Bk P 4.01

                    For ยง 722 practice, see LR Bk P 4.02

   LR 9010-1. Attorneys -- Law Students

   (a) Attorneys: The regulation of attorneys who are authorized to
   practice before this Court, the practice of nonresident attorneys, pro
   se appearances, procedures for an attorney withdrawing from a
   particular matter, stipulations by parties, and courtroom conduct are
   amply governed by LR Gen P 1.04 and shall govern such practices before
   the Bankruptcy Court.

   (b) Law Students: The Bankruptcy Court has determined that the West
   Virginia College of Law is interested in providing legal assistance to
   "income eligible" individuals who have need for such assistance in
   cases before the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court has found the
   neither 11 U.S.C. ยง 1101(3), Bankruptcy Rule 9010, the Rules of the
   District and Magistrate Courts nor any other statute, rule, regulation,
   or order prohibits an eligible law student from assisting indigent or
   otherwise qualified persons, before the Bankruptcy Court. The
   Bankruptcy Court has further found that Rule 6.000 of the Rules for
   Admission to Practice before the Courts of West Virginia, contains
   ample guidance with respect to the practice and procedure to be
   followed by the law student who appears before the Court.

   Therefore, certified, and otherwise qualified law students are
   permitted to appear before the Bankruptcy Court and render legal
   assistance to indigent or "income-eligible" individuals under the terms
   and conditions set forth in Rule 6.000 of the West Virginia Rules for
   Admission to Practice as contained in the West Virginia Code.

   LR 5075-1. Actions of Clerk Authorized by Court

   (a) The Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court, or his authorized designee, may
   reject for filing any petition, list, schedules, pleadings, claims, or
   other papers that contain the following deficiencies, except that such
   rejection by the office of the Clerk may be suspended, altered, or
   rescinded by the Court for cause shown:

   1. Petitions:

     A. Where not accompanied by the proper filing fee or an application
     to pay in installments.

     B. Where not accompanied by a properly completed mailing matrix.

     C. Where offered for filing by an attorney not admitted to practice
     before this Court.

     D. Where not verified by signature of the attorney or not containing
     an unsworn declaration with signature of all debtors.

     E. Where two or more individuals are listed, or two or more entities
     listed, except that married persons may file joint petitions.

   2. Adversary Proceedings:

     A. Where not accompanied by the proper filing fee.

     B. Where not accompanied by a properly completed Proceeding Cover
     Sheet [BC-104].

     C. Where offered for filing by an attorney not admitted to practice
     before this Court.

   3. Claims:

     A. Where the claim does not contain the caption of the case or the
     case number.

     B. Where not properly signed by the claimant or an authorized agent.

   4. Motions and Other Pleadings:

     A. Where offered for filing by an attorney not admitted to practice
     before this Court.

     B. Where offered for filing by a corporation or its agent or
     employee.

   (b) Requests for Judicial Review.

   Where a proponent of a proposed filing objects to any rejection to
   filing by the Clerk or his designee, the proponent may request that the
   Clerk receive as lodged but not filed the proposed filing. The
   proponent shall, by written motion, request judicial review by the
   Court of the rejection and appropriate relief. Such motion for judicial
   review shall be filed within seventy-two (72) hours of the rejected
   filing.


   LR 9074-1. Telephone Conferences

   For the convenience of the attorneys, the litigants, and the Court and
   in the interest of cost and efficiency, wherever practicable the Court
   will conduct conferences and hearings by telephone. The Clerk shall
   give notice of the time and date of such telephonic conferences or
   hearings together with the names of the participants. Unless otherwise
   directed, it shall be the duty of the proponent of a motion,
   application, or other request to initiate such telephonic conference.

   PART 3. Proceedings in Bankruptcy

   LR 1002-1. Commencement of a Case

   A voluntary or involuntary case is commenced by filing a petition with
   the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court together with the required filing
   fee. A voluntary petition shall conform substantially with Official
   Form No. 1 of the Bankruptcy Rules and the involuntary petition shall
   conform substantially with Official Form No. 5. A separate petition
   must be filed by each entity seeking an order for relief.

   The Clerk shall refuse to file a corporate bankruptcy petition if the
   debtor is not represented by an attorney.

                               Cross Reference

                       Official Forms No. 1 and No. 5

                                   Comment

   There are certain limited things which a corporation can do for itself
   (e.g., file a proof of claim ... ). At the same time, a corporation is
   prohibited from appearing in a case and practicing law. See, Rule 9010
   of the Bankruptcy Rules, cases such as In re Las Colinas Development
   Corp., 585 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1978), W. Va. Code Ann. ยง 30-2-5, and cases
   decided under West Virginia law, such as Frieson v. Isner, 285 S.E.2d
   641 (W.Va. 1981) (collection agency representing third parties). By
   this rule, the Court does not wish to discourage a corporation from
   protecting its rights and, indeed, recognizes the practical
   considerations with which the corporate entity is confronted. However,
   this Court is mindful of the policy considerations underlying the
   subject prohibition and is duty-bound to follow the law.

   LR 1007-1. Filing of Petitions and Mandatory Support Documents.

   (a) Number of Copies.

   In a case under Chapter 7, there shall be filed:

     an original and two copies of the petition and all mandatory support
     documents except for the mailing matrix, of which the original only
     shall be filed and, for corporate debtors, the corporate resolution,
     of which the original only shall be filed.

   In a case under Chapter 11, there shall be filed:

     an original and six copies of all documents except the mailing
     matrix, of which the original only shall be filed, and, for
     corporate debtors, the corporate resolution, of which the original
     only shall be filed.

   In a case under Chapter 13, there shall be filed:

     an original and two copies of all documents except the mailing
     matrix, of which the original only shall be filed.

     Mailing Matrix - NOT ATTACHED TO PETITION

     9. List of Equity Security Holders

                               Cross Reference

                      See also Rule 11, Fed. R. Civ. P.


   LR 1007-2. Cost of Preparation of Lists, Schedules, or Statements of
   Affairs by Person Other Than Debtor

   If any list, schedule, or statement required to be prepared and filed
   under Bankruptcy Rule 1007 is not timely prepared and filed, and if the
   Court orders the trustee, petitioning creditors, creditors' committee,
   or other party to file the list, schedule, or statement, such party who
   prepares it may make application to be reimbursed by the debtor's
   estate as an administrative expenses.


   LR 1007-3. Deficiencies in Filing Petitions, Schedules, and Statement
   of Affairs

   The Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court may give notice to the debtor or
   debtor's counsel of any material deficiencies in the documents filed,
   which deficiencies, if not corrected, would impair the performance of
   the Clerk's duties under the Bankruptcy Code and Rules. Failure to
   correct the deficiencies noted may be deemed sufficient cause for the
   Court to dismiss the case.

   LR 1007-4. The Mailing Matrix

   (a) A Petition, upon filing, must be accompanied by a "scanable"
   mailing matrix, typewritten on 8-1/2 inch by 11 inch paper, consisting

   (b) The official charged with responsibility for conducting the first
   meeting of creditors (U.S. Trustee or case trustee) shall inform
   counsel for the debtor at the Section 341 meeting of any deficiency in
   the matrix and shall preserve a record of the information so given;
   counsel for the debtor shall acknowledge that he has been informed of
   such deficiency. Counsel for the debtor shall have continuing
   responsibility for keeping informed of the accuracy of the mailing
   matrix-creditors names and addresses.

   Comment The importance of the accuracy of the mailing matrix cannot be
   overemphasized. It is perhaps the single most vital document which is
   filed. An incorrect address or zip code may well deprive an entity of
   due process and ultimately lead to great expense, delay, and other
   hardship. Accuracy of the matrix is the responsibility of counsel for
   the debtor.

   (d) Applications to pay the filing fee in installments shall be
   accompanied by an affidavit following Official Form No. 2, pursuant to
   Bankruptcy Rule 1006(b). Such fee shall be paid in full within four (4)
   months of the filing, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

   (e) Filing fees may be paid only by cash, certified check, money order,
   or check drawn on an attorney's trust account. The Clerk may refuse to
   accept personal checks and may also refuse to accept a check from any
   person who is known by the Clerk to have previously presented a check
   that was subsequently refused for payment.

   LR 1009-1. Amendment Practice

   (a) Fee Required.

     An amendment fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) is required if the
     amendment is filed after mailing of the notice of the first meeting
     of creditors and the amendment affects the "D", "E", or "F"
     schedules, the "Debts" portion of the Chapter 13 Statement, or the
     matrix.

   (b) Verification.

     As set forth in LR Bk P 3.03 the amendment shall be verified by the
     debtor.

   (c) Certificate of Service.

     Amendments to the Schedules must be accompanied by a certificate of
     service indicating that a copy of the amendment has been served on
     each party named therein or affected thereby, the trustee, and the
     examiner, if any.

   (d) Amendments to "D", "E", and "F" Schedules extend the time for
   objecting to discharge, dischargeability, and the debtor's claim of
   exemptions.

     The filing of an amendment to add a creditor or change the address
     of a creditor will operate to extend the times for the new creditors
     listed to object to the debtor's claim of exempt property, to
     dischargeability of a debt, and to discharge by sixty (60) days from
     filing the amendment. The Court will enter an order rescheduling the
     discharge hearing and extending the time to object, if necessary.

   (e) Amendments to "C" Schedules Extend Time for Objecting to Debtor's
   Claim of Exemptions.

     The filing of an amendment to the exemption schedule will be deemed
     a motion to extend the time for objecting to the debtor's claim of
     exempt property by thirty (30) days from filing the amendment.

   (f) Non-Conforming Amendments.

     Amendments which do not conform to these criteria may be refused for
     filing or returned with file-stamp voided.

   LR 9013-1. Motion and Application Practice Generally

   (a) Motion and application practice in the main bankruptcy case are
   governed principally by Rules 5 and 7 of the Federal Rules of Civil
   Procedure and, among others, Rule 9013 of the Bankruptcy Rules.
   Particular attention should be paid to the notice-service provisions
   required by law.

   (b) Motion and application practice in adversary proceedings are
   governed principally by Rules 5 and 7 of the Federal Rules of Civil
   Procedure and the comparable Rules 7005 and 7007 of the Bankruptcy
   Rules.

   (c) Papers to Accompany Motions and Applications.

   Each motion or application shall be accompanied, when appropriate, by
   the following papers:

     1. In appropriate circumstances, a proposed form of order which, if
     entered by the Court, would grant the relief sought by the motion.
     Such orders should not bear the engraved or printed firm name;

     2. A notice, to be served by the Clerk, upon all interested parties
     which sets forth with particularity the nature of the pleading and
     relief sought and which provides that "a hearing will be conducted
     at the Federal/Post Office Building in City, West Virginia, at ___
     o'clock, __ m., on the ___ day of ______, 19__." Likewise, the
     movant or applicant may obtain a time and date from the Court Clerk
     prior to preparing the notice and submit the completed notice for
     service by the Clerk; or,

     3. A "negative" notice, to be served by the Clerk, which sets forth
     with particularity the nature of the pleading and relief sought and
     which provides that "an order may be entered granting the relief
     sought unless a specific written objection is filed within _____ ( )
     days of the date of the mailing of this notice";

     4. The notice provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
     the Bankruptcy Rules, and these Local Rules are neither intended to
     supersede, nor be a substitute for, the requirement that pleadings
     and orders be served upon the interested parties. A certificate of
     service shall be utilized when required.

                                   Comment

   Bankruptcy is largely a matter of keeping a great number of persons
   informed of many issues which may affect property rights. When
   particular entities are affected by a motion or application, the
   proponent should serve the pleading on the party affected [(e.g.,
   motions under 11 U.S.C. ยงยง 362, 522(f) (lien avoidance), ยง 722
   (redemption)]. Often, upon receipt of such pleadings by the Clerk, a
   notice will issue by the Clerk's office, which will set a hearing or
   provide a time to object and will briefly, and redundantly, summarize
   the nature of the pleading. As provided in these Rules (LR Bk P 2.04),
   the Court may direct the proponent to serve the notice of motion and
   hearing.


   LR 9006-1. Extensions of Time to Plead

   Each party to an action may obtain stipulated extensions of time not to
   exceed a total of twenty (20) days in which to file motions or
   responsive pleadings. This may be done by filing with the Clerk a
   written stipulation between the parties for such extension, provided,
   that the aggregate time for all extensions by stipulation during the
   action shall not exceed a total of twenty (20) days. A stipulation
   filed with the Clerk shall affirmatively state that no prior stipulated
   extensions to that party, together with the stipulated extension then
   filed, exceed a total of twenty (20) days. Neither the stipulation nor
   any entry to that effect need to be submitted to the Court for such
   extensions. If no such stipulation is obtained, or if additional
   extensions beyond the stipulated period are requested, the party
   desiring an extension must move the Court for the additional extension
   within the original or extended response time.


   LR 5071-1. Continuances

   Continuances of hearings and other proceedings may be had only upon
   written motion served upon all interested parties. The motion shall set
   forth with particularity the grounds therefor. Every such motion shall
   be accompanied by an affidavit signed by counsel for the proponent
   which signifies that he has orally informed every other party of the
   motion and contain a statement that there are no objections to the
   relief sought. Every such motion shall be accompanied by an order
   granting the relief sought. In order to be entertained by the Court,
   such motion must have been filed and served prior to five (5) days
   before the scheduled proceeding, absent extraordinary circumstances. If
   there are objections to the motion then counsel for the proponent shall
   arrange a hearing before the court.

   LR 2004-1. Discovery - Depositions

   Rule 2004 of the Bankruptcy Rules governs discovery within the
   bankruptcy case. Upon proper motion, the Court may order that a person
   appear and be examined.

   The proponent of a motion for examination shall attempt to arrange a
   mutually agreeable time, place and date for the examination and the
   motion shall reflect the agreement of the parties; if there is such
   agreement, an order shall be tendered with the motion which likewise
   reveals the agreed time, place and date of the examination.

   In the event that the parties cannot agree on the terms of the
   examination, a notice of hearing shall accompany the motion and the
   Court will decide the dispute upon evidence or argument.

   LR 4008-2. Reaffirmations

   (a) Time For Filing -- Court Approval Not Required.

   To be effective, a reaffirmation agreement must be filed before the
   discharge is granted. A discharge is granted upon entry of the order of
   discharge.

   (b) Contents of Agreement.

   The reaffirmation agreement should include, at minimum, the following:

     (1) the amount of the debt reaffirmed;

     (2) the annual rate of interest to be paid (except for variable rate
     home mortgages);

     (3) the amount of period payment;

     (4) the number of payments remaining;

     (5) a statement which reveals that the debtor understands that the
     agreement may be rescinded prior to entry of the discharge order or
     within sixty (60) days of filing of the agreement, whichever occurs
     later.

   If the debtor is represented by an attorney, the attorney shall file
   his affidavit with the reaffirmation agreement, which affidavit shall
   reveal that the debtor entered into the agreement voluntarily and after
   having been fully informed, and that such agreement does not impose an
   undue hardship upon the debtor or his dependents.

   (c) Court Approval Required.

   If the reaffirmation agreement is filed after the discharge order is
   entered, but before the case is closed, then the debtor must request a
   hearing for reaffirmation or otherwise proceed as directed by the
   Court.

   If the debtor was not represented by an attorney during negotiation of
   the reaffirmation agreement, a hearing shall be held and the Court, at
   the time of the reaffirmation hearing, shall inquire of the debtor to
   insure that the agreement was knowingly and voluntarily entered into,
   that the agreement will not impose a burden upon the debtor and is in
   the best interests of the debtor, and that the debtor understands his
   rights with regard to rescission of the agreement.

   LR 4001-1. Motion to Lift Stay

   (a) Generally.

   Upon filing of a motion for relief from the automatic stay provisions
   of 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(a), the Court shall enter an order setting the
   matter for a preliminary hearing. If such hearing is to be conducted by
   phone, the proponent of the motion shall initiate the call.

   (b) Notice.

   Counsel for the moving party shall serve the motion for relief from
   stay upon the debtor, the debtor's attorney, the trustee, and any other
   party which may be affected by the relief sought; notice shall be
   evidenced by a certificate of service.

   (c) Fee.

   A filing fee is required under this Rule unless the debtor and creditor
   agree to relief from the stay.

   Any opponent of the motion should attempt to file and serve a
   responsive pleading prior to the date of the preliminary hearing.

   (e) Preliminary Hearing.

   proponent, the debtor, and any other party in interest. As set forth in
   these Local Rules, the proponent shall initiate the telephonic hearing.

   The Judge may designate his Law Clerk as the Court's representative at
   the preliminary hearing; providing, if any party objects to the Law
   Clerk acting in the Court's stead, then the Judge shall preside.

   If it appears that genuine issues of fact exist between the interested
   parties, then the preliminary hearing will allow an opportunity to
   discuss the dispute, set necessary deadlines, and schedule the matter
   for final hearing. If it appears that only legal issues exist, then the
   Court will set a briefing schedule.

   In the event that the parties agree that the proponent should be
   granted relief from the stay, or if the motion is deemed unopposed,
   then the Clerk shall issue a notice to all creditors and other parties
   in interest of the proposed disposition of the property which is the
   subject matter of the motion. If there is no objection to the notice,
   then an appropriate order will be entered. Upon the fling of a proper
   objection, a hearing will be set. If the trustee has abandoned the
   property and the time for objection to abandonment has expired, then
   the notice of proposed disposition is not required.

   Debtor(s).


                        MOTION TO AVOID NONPOSSESSORY

                     NONPURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTEREST

   This day comes the Debtor(s) by counsel, pursuant to Title 11 United
   States Code ยง 522(f) and Bankruptcy Rules 4003(d) and 9014, and moves
   the Court for an order permitting avoidance of a nonpossessory,
   nonpurchase money security interest in household goods and furnishings
   maintained by the Debtor(s) for personal and family use.

   The Creditor, who holds the nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security
   interest, is as follows:

                                   (Name)

                                  (Address)

                           (City, State, Zip Code)

   The Debtor(s) further represent that the security interest held by the
   above-named Creditor impairs an exemption to which the Debtor(s) would
   be entitled under ยง 38-10-4, W.Va. Code Ann., and is property of the
   type described under ยง522(f) of Title 11, United States Code.

   The lien attached after the 6th day of November, 1978.

   WHEREFORE, the Debtor(s) pray that the Court enter an order permitting
   avoidance of the lien of the Creditor to the extent that such lien
   impairs the exemption to which the Debtor(s) are entitled.

     Address


                           NOTICE TO THE DEBTOR(S)

   By entering in to this agreement, you give up your protection  from
   this debt as gained by being granted a discharge in bankruptcy.

   As a further result of this agreement, the Creditor may be able to take
   your property or wages if you do not pay the agreed amounts. The
   creditor may also take action to collect the debt in other ways.

   You may rescind (cancel) this agreement at any time before the
   bankruptcy court enters a discharge order or within 60 days after this
   agreement is filed with the court, whichever is later, by notifying the
   creditor that the agreement is cancelled.

   You are not required to enter into this agreement by any law.  It is
   not required by the Bankruptcy Code, by any other law, or by any
   contract [except by another reaffirmation agreement made in accordance
   with Bankruptcy Code  524(c)].

   You are allowed to pay this debt without signing this agreement.
   However, if you do not sign this agreement and are later unwilling or
   unable to pay the full amount owed to the creditor, the creditor will
   not be able to collect the debt from you. The creditor will also not be
   allowed to take your property to satisfy the debt unless the creditor
   has a lien on that particular property.

   If the creditor has a lien on your personal property, you may have a
   right to redeem the property  and eliminate the lien by making a single
   payment to the creditor which is equal to the current value of the
   property, as agreed to by you and the creditor or as determined by the
   court.

   A reaffirmation agreement is not  valid or binding unless it is filed
   with the clerk of the bankruptcy court. If you were not represented by
   an attorney during the negotion of  the reaffirmation agreement, the
   agreement cannot be enforced by the creditor unless:  1.) you have
   attended a reaffirmation hearing in the bankruptcy court;  and,   2.)
   the agreement has been approved by the bankruptcy court. (Court
   approval is not required if this is a consumer debt secured by a
   mortgage or other lien on your real estate.)


                           REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT

   The Debtor(s) and the creditor named above have agreed to reaffirm the
   obligation described in this agreement according to the terms and
