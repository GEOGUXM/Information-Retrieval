Potential

   The applications listed above are likely to expand and have many more
   added in the future. Beyond these, however, NASA expects to see a
   mushrooming of "Smart Mechatronic Devices" with embedded miroprocessors
   in which "Capaciflector" technology plays a key role in the sensing
   capabilities of these devices (a fundamental requirement of
   "Smartness"). This technology will appear in many forms such as
   Micromachining Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), large machine shop
   tools, and Space and Commercial Robots. Partnering arrangements through
   the combined efforts of NASA and industry will be very important and
   contribute to the growth of "Capaciflector" technology.
