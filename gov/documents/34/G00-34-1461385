   What Microwaves Teach Us About the Atmosphere   [ MSU Home ]

   [tropo_temp.gif] Mankind's impact on the global climate and whether
   pollution from modern energy use is indeed warming the Earth have
   become important issues for national and international policy makers.
   Political pressure and public sentiment are based on complex data sets
   that, alone, cannot tell the whole story. The ultimate question is
   whether our climate is becoming warmer because of the slow build-up in
   atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The answer is not clear,
   because much of what we know about global climate change in inferred
   from historical evidence of uncertain quality. Reliable ground-based
   measurements by scientific instruments have been made just in this
   century. These measure conditions only at the location of each
   instrument, and they are usually land-based, although 75% of the Earth
   is covered with water. We have been able to take precise, direct
   measurements only in the last four decades, and not until the advent of
   precision spaceborne instruments in the 1970s were we able to measure
   global temperatures at a range of altitudes across the entire
   atmosphere.

   [strato_temp.gif] GHCC scientists have compiled two decades of data
   showing how atmospheric temperature has behaved over the entire globe.
   All matter emits microwave radiation that varies with its temperature,
   among other factors. Microwave sensors on weather satellites can take
   more than 60,000 temperature measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere,
   from the surface to about 10 km (6 mi) altitude. The story that these
   measurements tell is more complex than simply saying the Earth is
   warming or cooling. Temperatures in the lower troposphere (the portion
   of the atmosphere where we live) have shown a series of ups and downs
   since 1979, mostly in a Â±0.4oC band, with negligible trends over that
   period. This contrasts with surface thermometers that show warming
   during the same period of time. The 1997-98 El Nino caused strong lower
   tropospheric warming in late 1997, and record warmth in February 1998.
   Satellite measurements of the lower stratosphere reveal two marked warm
   periods (as much as 1.5oC warmer), caused by sulfuric acid aerosols
   deposited in this layer by the eruptions of two large volcanoes. These
   two warm periods are superimposed upon a strong cooling trend over the
   19-year period that has been attributed to ozone depletion in the lower
   stratosphere. In 1997, record low stratospheric temperatures were
   recorded. This is an ongoing research effort that will have greater
   impact as more data are collected and analyzed.

   Microwave measurements from satellites are also being utilized to
   measure rainfall. Because oceanic rainfall is particularly difficult to
   measure by conventional methods, additional data from the satellites
   have been utilized since 1979 to monitor oceanic precipitation and
   temperatures. Studies of tropical rainfall from these data have
   revealed large increases during El Nino years, such as 1997-98. Future
   satellite data from planned instruments, such as the Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer, will fuel further research into such processes.
   These efforts will help us better understand how the atmosphere adjusts
   to climate perturbations, such as increasing levels of greenhouse
   gases.
