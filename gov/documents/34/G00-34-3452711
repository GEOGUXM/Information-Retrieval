   Turning Visions Into Reality

      Solving technical problems in energy, environment, and industrial
      competitiveness depends on breakthroughs in the fields of chemistry or
      materials science.

      Merging expertise from these two interrelated disciplines, Battelle's
      Pacific Northwest Division has established extraordinary capabilities
      for turning visions into reality. Our scientists and engineers within
      the Materials Department at the Laboratory are addressing issues of
      national importance and creating major economic opportunities for U.S.
      companies.

      We develop materials that unleash revolutionary applications, chemical
      processes that convert liabilities into assets, and analytical
      capabilities that guide clients in making knowledgeable decisions on
      important environmental and waste management issues.

      Our technical strengths focus on:

   [bullet1.gif] Synthesis, processing, and environmental interactions of
                 advanced materials

   [bullet1.gif] Chemical processing science, engineering, and technology
                 deployment

   [bullet1.gif] Analytical instrumentation and technology development

   [bullet1.gif] Advanced analytical chemistry approaches and techniques

  Developing Materials for Tomorrow's Technologies

   Technological advancement and economic survival in the world
   marketplace depend on innovative processes for producing new and
   improved materials.

   Our staff--with expertise in chemistry, materials sciences, chemical
   engineering, and computer science--are developing synthesis processes
   and evaluating material performance for a wide range of needs. For
   example, research on the relationships between structural and optical
   properties has led to technology that allows fabrication of multilayer
   optical coatings on large surfaces.

   We also are looking to nature to unlock some mysteries of material
   synthesis. By imitating the mechanisms by which nature controls the
   formation of the shells of mollusks and other shellfish, we are
   developing a new generation of ceramic composites. Potential
   applications of these biomimetic materials include high-density
   magnetic storage tapes, rust- and corrosion-resistant coatings,
   adhesives, sensors, laser optics, and bioactive bone implants.

   Expensive ultrafine ceramic powders can be simply and economically
   produced in significant quantities using a high-temperature combustion
   synthesis technique we discovered. This glycine-nitrate process may
   contribute to the commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells and other
   important industrial breakthroughs. It was recognized by R&D Magazine
   as one of the 100 most important new technologies in 1992.

   Other areas of research include:

   [bullet1.gif] composite materials for light-weight armor

   [bullet1.gif] superplastic forming of lightweight automotive components

   [bullet1.gif] polymer multilayer thin-film deposition

   [bullet1.gif] intermetallic compounds for high-temperature structural
                 applications

   [bullet1.gif] superconducting thin films

   [bullet1.gif] advanced sensors

   [bullet1.gif] fission and fusion reactor materials

   [bullet1.gif] glasses and grouts for stabilization of nuclear and
                 hazardous wastes.

  Delivering Advanced Analytical Technology

   Environmental and waste management issues require sophisticated means
   of detecting and measuring hazardous chemicals or radionuclides.
   Delivering innovative technological developments in these areas is a
   major focus at the Laboratory.

   Our chemical analysis efforts include:

   [bullet1.gif] studies of fundamental phenomena governing the
   application and performance of analytical measurement instrumentation
   [bullet1.gif] research requiring advanced analytical capabilities
   [bullet1.gif] development of new analytical instruments and methods.

   We also conduct research and development activities associated with the
   detection, measurement, and characterization of radionuclides,
   radioactive materials, and chemical constituents. To meet the needs of
   our clients, we develop highly specialized and sensitive instruments
   and methods for various applications. Other activities range from basic
   nuclear physics and chemistry research to environmental radioactivity
   measurements and advanced radiochemical separations.

   The Materials Resource consists of the following nine technical groups:
