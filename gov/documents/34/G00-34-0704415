                             SAGE III Instrument


   The SAGE III instrument is a grating spectrometer that measures
   ultraviolet/visible energy. It relies upon the flight-proven designs
   used in the Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement (SAM I) and SAGE I and II
   instruments.

   The new SAGE III design incorporates Charge Coupled Device (CCD) array
   detectors and a 16 bit A/D converter.

   Combined, these devices allow for wavelength calibration, a
   self-consistent determination of the viewing geometry, lunar
   occultation measurements, and expanded wavelength coverage.

   SAGE III sensor assembly is illustrated below and consists of pointing
   and imaging subsystems and a UV/visible spectrometer.

   The pointing and imaging systems are employed to acquire light from
   either the Sun or Moon by vertically scanning across the object.

   The spectrometer uses an 800 element CCD linear array to provide
   continuous spectral coverage between 290 and 1030 nm. Additional
   aerosol information is provided by a discrete photodiode at 1550 nm.

   This configuration enables SAGE III to make multiple measurements of
   absorption features of target gaseous species and multi-wavelength
   measurements of broadband extinction by aerosols.

   The SAGE III instrument was developed and managed by NASA Langley
   Research Center and was built by Ball Aerospace in Boulder, CO. Three
   copies were produced. One instrument is mounted on the Meteor-3M
   spacecraft and a second will be place in orbit on the International
   Space Station in 2005.
