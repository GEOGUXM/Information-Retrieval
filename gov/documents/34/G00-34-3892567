                 NOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE BAR AND LITIGANTS

                    U.S. District Court, District of Utah

                        Office of the Clerk of Court
     __________________________________________________________________

                                January 2002

   In an effort to provide easier access to court records and in
   anticipation of moving toward electronic filing, the Court now creates
   electronic images of documents in civil case files, with the exception
   of Social Security cases and cases under Court seal, and provides
   remote electronic access to them via PACER. (This does not include
   affidavits, declarations, or exhibits to documents filed with the
   Clerk.) Remote electronic access makes these court records accessible
   to a much wider  potentially worldwide  audience.

   In that interest, attorneys and litigants are advised to exercise
   discretion when preparing documents for filing with the Court and to
   carefully consider whether to include sensitive or confidential
   personal information.

   Policies promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States
   now require litigants to modify or partially redact certain personal
   data identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth,
   financial account numbers, and names of minor children in court
   documents that, when filed, will be made electronically and remotely
   accessible to the public. Please take notice of this responsibility.
   More information on the action taken by the Conference is available at
   http://www.privacy.uscourts.gov

   Conference policy also places a temporary two-year moratorium on
   providing remote electronic access to criminal case documents so the
   issues can be thoroughly reviewed by relevant Conference committees.
