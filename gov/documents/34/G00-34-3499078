               March 15, 1999
                      Members of the National Hurricane Center's staff are touring
                      destinations in Central America and the Caribbean. Follow their
                      travels on the 1999 Hurricane Awareness Tour pages, where we
                      will provide you with press releases and images.

               August 7, 1998
                      We've compiled historical hurricane records to show what a
                      "typical" hurricane season looks like. The figures and tables on
                      our Climatology page show the average cumulative number of
                      storms throughout the season.

               March 31, 1998
                      We've overhauled the structure and look of our website to help
                      you find your favorite weather products.

               March 17, 1998
                      A 1997 Atlantic hurricane season track map and a page on TPC
                      hurricane forecast models.

               January 8, 1998
                      Finished adding the preliminary reports for the 1997 Atlantic
                      and Eastern Pacific hurricane seasons.

               November 13, 1997
                      New preliminary reports for the 1997 Atlantic and Eastern
                      Pacific hurricane seasons.

               October 31, 1997
                      Notice the new graphic at the top of the page? Also, we've added
                      more preliminary reports for the 1997 hurricane season, updated
                      the radiofax schedule, and updated the personnel page. There are
                      also new products on the Other Products page.

               October 15, 1997
                      New pages for the 1997 Atlantic and Eastern Pacific hurricane
                      seasons, as well a few of the preliminary reports for the
                      individual storms.

               July 1, 1997
                      A new home page, new text home page, new TAFB home page, revised
                      Weather links and National Weather Service links pages, and a
                      new page on a inland hurricane winds model. We've also found a
                      new source of Gulf Stream and sea surface temperature data
                      courtesy of the Naval Atlantic Meteorology and Oceanography
                      Center in Norfolk, VA.

               May 1, 1997
                      We've updated the pages for the 1995 and 1996 Atlantic and
                      Pacific hurricane seasons with client-side image maps. Lynx
                      users don't worry, as we've also added appropriate text pages
                      where needed. Also, the track maps images on those pages (as
                      well as others around the site) are now smaller and hopefully
                      more user friendly. We've replaced the costliest, deadliest, and
                      most intense hurricane image graphics with new tables
                      (originally courtesy of Timothy Reece at the NWS Brownsville,
                      TX. We've also added new tables on on U.S. hurricane strikes by
                      decade and by state. Last, but certainly not least, we've add a
                      report on deadliest hurricanes of the Atlantic from 1492 to the
                      present day.

               March 17, 1997
                      We've added new images for the preliminary reports for Tropical
                      Storm Gabrielle and Hurricane Noel. We've also (hopefully)
                      killed a few more bugs in our site!

               March 12, 1997
                      We've finished adding the preliminary reports for the 1995 and
                      1996 hurricane seasons, including brief information on the
                      tropical depressions. We've also added internal links to make it
                      easier to navigate through the reports. We've updated the TPC
                      radiofax schedule and the world-wide tropical cyclone name
                      lists. We've also added new images to the Hurricane Andrew and
                      Hurricane Hugo pages. Finally, we've updated the TPC Links page
                      and the TPC National Weather Service Links page.

               January 28, 1997
                      We've added many more preliminary reports for the 1995 and 1996
                      hurricane seasons. We've also split the 1996 season page into
                      Atlantic and Eastern Pacific pages. We've also added a new OFAGX
                      area of responsibility GIF (119K), and updated many pages to add
                      graphics, correct mistakes, and correct sloppy HTML code.

               November 27, 1996
                      We've added several more new preliminary reports for the 1995
                      and 1996 Hurricane Seasons. In addition, we now have two
                      meteorological links pages with one dedicated to National
                      Weather Service sites. We also have a publications page
                      detailing additions sources of TPC information. We've added lots
                      of links to our introductory pages. Finally, we've cleared up a
                      lot of little glitches in our site.

               November 6, 1996
                      We've made many updates to the preliminary reports of the 1995
                      Atlantic Hurricane Season (Image Page, Text Page). Additionally,
                      we've added new reports for the 1996 Atlantic and East Pacific
                      Hurricane Seasons, and for the 1995 East Pacific Hurricane
                      Season. We've also updated the glossary of NHC terms.

               June 1, 1996
                      Brand new web page for the 1996 season.

               July 4, 1996
                      We have added a page with numerous Hurricane and Natural Disater
                      brochures by NOAA, the American Red Cross and FEMA.
