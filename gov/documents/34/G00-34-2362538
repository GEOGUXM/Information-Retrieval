   The Privacy Act makes it difficult for any agency of the United States
   Government to disclose private information and addresses of
   individuals. When seeking information, provide to the agency as much
   information and documentation as possible (for example, a birth
   certificate or information about the date and place of birth), and
   explanations of why you are seeking the individual.

   Suggestions for your search.
