Searches Using Explorit

   From within any document under Explorit the search screen may be
   accessed by clicking on the Search button on the Explorit Tool Bar. On
   the search screen click once in the search criteria field, type the
   words or phrases for your query, and click on the Submit button to
   launch the search.

   Explorit returns a list of documents arranged by score in descending
   order (1.00 is highest). From this results list, click on the
   highlighted ID for the document you wish to view.

   Most documents under Explorit are in ASCII or PDF format. To return to
   the results list from within a document, close the Acrobat Reader (in
   the case of a PDF document) or use the Up button on the Explorit Tool
   Bar.

   Focus and refine your searches by becoming familiar with the examples
   hyperlink found on all Explorit search form screens and by reading the
   following tips. The more you fine tune your queries, the greater your
   success will be in finding the exact information you need.

   To avoid long irrelevant results lists focus your query by using more
   specific terms and various operators. If you are getting little or no
   results from a search query, try broadening your search using stemming
   and wild cards, or by simply broadening your terms.

   Searches under Explorit are not case sensitive. The search results list
   will be the same regardless of whether you use uppercase or lowercase
   letters in your query.

   The default connector for words in a phrase is <or>. To override this
   default and search for an exact word or phrase enclose your query in
   double quotes.
