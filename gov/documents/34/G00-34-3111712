   The MMI Ranking Function Alan R. Aronson March 4, 1997 The MMI (MetaMap
   Indexing) ranking function calculates a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for a
   UMLS速 Metathesaurus速 concept1 with respect to a given MEDLINE速
   citation. This value is intended to indicate the characterizing power
   or aboutness of the concept for the citation. The sequel consists of
   the definition of the function and several examples of its use. 1.
   Definition of the ranking function Generally speaking, the MMI ranking
   function is the product of a frequency factor and a rele- vance factor.
   The relevance factor is, in turn, a weighted average of four components
   (listed in order of importance): a MeSH tree depth factor, a word
   length factor, a character count factor, and a MetaMap score factor.
   For concepts found in the title of the citation, there is a simplified
   form of the function. 1. Currently only Metathesaurus concepts which
   include a MeSH速 heading in their definition are handled fully by the
   ranking function. This is because the MeSH tree depth plays a critical
   role in the function. Hierarchies other than the MeSH hierarchy may
   eventually be used by the function. 1. Definition of the ranking
   function 1.1 The components of the function Before definining ranking
   function components, themselves, it is worthwhile to point out that
   each component is normalized before being combined with other function
   components. Normal- ization is accomplished by applying a sigmoidal
   function to a value. Each sigmoidal function maps from the unit
   interval [0,1] to itself and is determined by an index. An index of
   zero deter- mines the identity function (hence, no normalization). A
   positive index determines a sigmoidal function which lies above the
   identity and consequently accentuates the differences between small
   values. Larger indexes produce more accentuation. Conversely a negative
   index determines a sig- moidal function lying below the identity and
   consequently accentuates the differences between large values. If we
   denote the normalization function with index n by n:[0,1] [0,1], then
   the for- mal definition of them is * 0(x) = x; * for n > 0,  +  n(x) en
   1 = -------------- 1 e nx ------------------ en  1 1 + enx * for n < 0
   (letting m=-n), ( + ) + (em  1)x m(x) = ln em 1
   (-------------------------------------------------) m (em + 1)  (em
   1)x Now the basic ranking function components are defined as follows: *
   the frequency, simply denoted f, is the number of times the concept
   occurs (i.e., is discovered by MetaMap) in the title or abstract fields
   of the citation divided by 10;1 * the MeSH tree depth, m, is the
   maximum depth of all MeSH tree codes associated with the con- cept
   divided by 9. The computation is actually done by counting the number
   of periods in the tree code; * the word length, denoted w, is the
   number of words2 in the concept divided by 26; * the character count,
   denoted c, is the number of characters in the concept divided by 102;
   and * the MetaMap score, denoted mm, is just the score divided by
   1,000. 1. The constants for each of the components is determined by
   values actually occurring in the MMI test set. Values outside the unit
   interval are rounded to the nearest endpoint. 2. The number of words is
   the number of tokens produced by the wordind tokenization algorithm
   which starts a new token at whitespace and punctuation characters. MMI
   Ranking Function 2 2. Ranking examples 1.2 Putting it all together
   Using weighting factors denoted by wm, ww, wc, wmm for MeSH tree depth,
   word count, character count, and MetaMap score, respectively, the
   ranking score can be written as w + w + w + w m m m ( ) w w w ( ) c c c
   ( ) mm mm mm ( ) f ( f )
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ------------------------------------------------------------ wm + ww +
   wc + wmm xxx: the following is an example of the function with specific
   weights. check!! 12 + 2 w ( ) + 2 c ( ) + 1 mm ( ) 0 m ( ) 10 10 10 5(
   f )
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------------------------------------------------- 12 + 2 + 2 + 1
   When the concept occurs in the title of the citation, the frequency
   factor f(f) is replaced by 1. This has the effect of giving title
   concepts overwhelmingly good rankings. 1.3 Setting the function
   parameters TBD 2. Ranking examples This section contains five examples
   with 3-point average precisions ranging from superior to the worst
   possible. Each example consists of the MEDLINE citation and the ranked
   MMI output. An exclamation mark indicates that the MeSH heading found
   by MMI occurs in the MH field of the citation; an asterisk indicates a
   main heading. MMI Ranking Function 3 2. Ranking examples 2.1 The best

   Cigarette smoking increases the mean platelet volume in elderly
   patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis. AB - To study the
   effects of cigarette smoking and atherosclerosis on platelet size, we
   measured the mean platelet volume (MPV) and other platelet parameters
   in 142 elderly smokers and nonsmokers with or without atherosclerotic
   risk factors. The MPV and the platelet count were highest and their
   inverse correlation was strongest in the atherosclerotic smokers (r =
   0.54, P < 0.05) when compared with the nonsmoking and
   non-atherosclerotic groups. A 10% decrease of MPV was found in 8
   smoking subjects in the atherosclerotic group, who successfully
   discontinued smoking (P < 0.05). These results suggest that smoking may
   increase platelet consumption in atherosclerotic vessels and that
   subsequently megakaryo- cytes are activated to produce larger
   platelets, which are more active. Thus, an increase in MPV due to
   smoking may also contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerosis and
   should be considered as a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. MH -

   Bellemare F TI - Evaluation of human diaphragm function. AB - When
   single supramaximal shocks are delivered during relaxation to both
   phrenic nerves simultaneously, the resulting transdiaphragmatic
   pressure twitch (PdiT) or mouth pressure twitch (PmT) are found to
   decrease linearly with increasing lung volume thereby reflect- ing
   changes in diaphragm contractility. Whereas fatigue decreases PdiT at
   any given lung volume, chronic lung hyperinflation tends to increase
   PdiT at any given lung volume. When the phrenic nerve shocks are
   delivered during ongoing voluntary contractions, PdiT decreases with
   increasing level of diaphragm activation. Its amplitude thus detects
   the reverse left for full activation of the diaphragm by the voluntary
   motor drive. The ability to maximally activate the diaphragm decreases
   with fatigue but is retained in patients with chronic lung
   hyperinflation. MH - Diaphragm/*PHYSIOLOGY ; Human ; Lung Diseases,

   TI - Pharmacokinetics of glafenine and glafenic acid in patients with
   cirrhosis, compared to healthy volunteers. AB - Pharmacokinetic
   parameters were evaluated in 12 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and
   12 healthy volunteers after a single 400 mg oral dose of glafenine.
   Glafenine (G) and its major active metabolite glafenic acid (GA) were
   measured at regular intervals using a spe- cific high performance
   liquid chromatographic method. Glafenine absorption was signifi- cantly
   delayed in cirrhotic patients (CP) (Tmax = 2.8 +/- 1.3 hvs 1.5 +/- 0.4
   h, p less than 0.01) and was dramatically reduced in 3 patients. The
   large hepatic 'first pass' effect observed in healthy volunteers was
   markedly reduced in CP (ratio Cmax GA/Cmax G = 3.6 +/- 2.9 vs 18.9 +/-
   9.8, p less than 0.001; ratio areas under the curves AUC GA/AUC G = 2.3
   +/- 2.3 vs 18.2 +/- 11.2, p less than 0.001). The elimination half-life
   of G was pro- longed in the CP (13.0 +/- 13.1 h vs 1.5 +/- 0.5 h, p
   less than 0.01). In CP, GA elimination half-life was increased (12.0
   +/- 13.4 h vs 4.3 +/- 1.3 h, NS) but the difference did not reach
   statistical significance because of large variability. The significant
   rise of G plasma concentrations (Cmax = 2.2 +/- 2.1 mg/L vs 0.7 +/- 0.2
   mg/L, p less than 0.05) and its longer half-life would lead to an
   accumulation if the usual dosage regimen was prescribed for CP and
   could result in nephrotoxicity. On the other hand, lower dosage would
   be inef- fective because only GA is active and nephrotoxic. Hence, G
   should be given with great caution to CP. MH - Administration, Oral ;

   Characterization of conserved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120
   neutralization epitopes exposed upon gp120-CD4 binding. AB -
   Interaction with the CD4 receptor enhances the exposure on the human
   immunodeficiency type 1 gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein of
   conserved, conformation-dependent epitopes recognized by the 17b and
   48d neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The 17b and 48d antibodies
   compete with anti-CD4 binding antibodies such as 15e or 21h, which rec-
   ognize discontinuous gp120 sequences near the CD4 binding region. To
   characterize the 17b and 48d epitopes, a panel of human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 mutants was tested for recognition
   by these antibodies in the absence or presence of soluble CD4. Single
   amino acid changes in five discontinuous, conserved, and generally
   hydrophobic regions of the gp120 glycoprotein resulted in decreased
   recognition and neutralization by the 17b and 48d antibodies. Some of
   these regions overlap those previously shown to be important for
   binding of the 15e and 21h antibodies or for CD4 binding. These results
   sug- gest that discontinuous, conserved epitopes proximal to the
   binding sites for both CD4 and anti-CD4 binding antibodies become
   better exposed upon CD4 binding and can serve as targets for
   neutralizing antibodies. MH - Amino Acid Sequence ; Animal ;
