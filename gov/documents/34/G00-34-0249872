   Historic Documents Inventory (HDI)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Introduction

   Excelsior is a SIRSI Unicorn system, designed to be the starting place
   for access to material in the New York State Library and the New York
   State Archives and Records Administration. Library collections include
   major holdings in law, medicine, the social sciences, education,
   American and New York State history and culture, certain pure sciences,
   and technology. Information resources include books, journals, computer
   files, manuscripts, government documents, newspapers, microforms, and
   research aids such as abstracting, indexing and looseleaf services.

   Excelsior also contains information about more than 55,000 cubic feet
   of State government and archival records, including paper files,
   photographs, audio and video materials, and electronic records,
   available at the New York State Archives and Records Administration.

   The Historical Documents Inventory (HDI) is also a part of Excelsior.
   These records are the electronic equivalent of the print county guides
   in the State Library's reference collection entitled "Guide to
   historical resources in _xxx_ County" published by Cornell University.
   For retrieval information see the HDI section of this guide.

   Records may be searched separately for the following:
     * New York State Library
     * New York State Library's Manuscripts and Special Collections Unit
     * New York State Archives and Records Administration
     * Historical Documents Inventory

   Please be aware that not all records are online. The following is a
   list of the types of materials that will not be found in this catalog:
     * Bill Jackets (New York State)
     * College catalogs
     * ERIC microfiche
     * Historical publications - many 18th and 19th century publications
     * Journal articles (full-text)
     * Journal holdings for individual unbound issues
     * Medical journals (early)
     * Microforms (individual titles in collections)
     * Newpapers (online full-text)
     * NTIS microfiche
     * Online databases
     * Patents
     * Records and Briefs (individual)
     * Series (some titles within series)
     * Standards and specifications
     * Telephone books and city directories

   Volume records do not appear for unbound volumes of journals. Try
   requesting year/volumes not shown. You may see NONE for copies or call
   number in a record. Most likely, the item is in our collection and it
   can be requested. Ask a librarian for help locating any of these items,
   or any other material not located in the catalog.

   VIEW
          Select a record to view from a list of records by clicking on
          the VIEW button. This button is located to the left of the
          record.

   Searching the Catalog
    1. On the Login to WebCat screen, select from the choices below:
          + Library/MSC and Archives Catalogs
            Search the combined records of the New York State Library
            (including Manuscripts and Special Collections) and the New
            York State Archives. NOTE: This option also includes the
            Historic Documents Inventory records described below. These
            records are not part of the New York State Library or Archives
            holdings but are listed here with a note as to where they are
            housed. These records say (Repository) at HDI on the initial
            search results screen.
          + Archives
            Search only the archival records of New York State Government
            and selected local government records preserved by the State
            Archives and Records Administration.
          + NYSILL
            Use only if you are a library registered with the New York
            State Library's Interlibrary Loan Unit. Click here for more
            information
          + Historic Documents Inventory
            Search catalog records for more than 25,000 archives and
            manuscripts collections housed in most, but not all, New York
            repositories (libraries, historical societies, and other
            organizations with established archives). The search excludes
            the holdings of the State Library and the State Archives.
    2. From the Search the Library Catalog screen, select the type of
       search. There are two choices: Quick Search and Complex Search. In
       both types, if a search retrieves one record, the full record will
       be displayed. If a search retrieves more than one record, a list of
       brief records will be displayed. The number of records retrieved
       will be indicated at the top of the screen. If there are multiple
       screens, use the FORWARD and BACKWARD buttons to move between
       screens. To view a full record, click on the VIEW button next to
       the item. Use the GO BACK button to return to the list of brief
       records.
       If no records match a search, a Browsing the Catalog screen appears
       with the message "Item not found - perhaps the following list will
       help." The item(s) needed may still be in the catalog. Be sure the
       search terms were spelled correctly or reformulate the search using
       different terms or another index.
          + Quick Search - This is the opening screen. Keyword is already
            selected. Click on a radio button to choose Browse or Exact.
               o Keyword
                    # Keyword and SEARCH EVERYTHING
                      Type keyword(s) or phrase(s) and click on SEARCH
                      EVERYTHING. Additional information on searching
                      phrases can be found later in this document.
                      This combination retrieves the largest number of
                      results because the system searches all indexes
                      (AUTHOR, TITLE, SUBJECT, etc.) at once. Start here
                      if the formal subject heading is unknown. Popular
                      language terms can be retrieved, such as casino
                      gambling, Megan's law, school uniforms, etc.
                         @ TRANSPORTATION PLANNING will retrieve records
                           with the words transportation and planning in
                           the title, in the subject headings, in the
                           description, etc. Both words must appear in the
                           same field.
                         @ TRANSPORTATION AND PLANNING will retrieve
                           records with the words transportation and
                           planning in any field, and also the words in
                           any field in the same record. (See the section
                           on Combining Search Terms for more on searching
                           with Boolean operators).
                           Articles, prepositions and punctuation are not
                           needed as they are ignored by the system.

             Articles     Examples: a, an, the
             Prepositions Examples: at, in, to, by
             Punctuation  Examples: apostrophes, colons, commas

                           For hyphenated words, you may want to search
                           both with and without the hyphen.
                    # Keyword and AUTHOR
                      Type in all or part of the author's name in any
                      order. (An author can be either a person or an
                      organization, such as a State agency. For Archives
                      materials, the "author" is the creating agency.)
                      Click on the AUTHOR button.
                      If no matching author name is found in the catalog,
                      the system will provide an alphabetical listing of
                      authors nearest the spelling entered.
                      ALFRED SMITH
                      SMITH ALFRED

                      SHAKESPEARE
                    # Keyword and TITLE
                      Type in all or part of the title in any order. Click
                      on the TITLE button.
                      DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK
                      DRUMS MOHAWK
                      MOHAWK DRUMS
                    # Keyword and SUBJECT (Library of Congress Subject
                      Headings)
                      Type in a subject phrase or a subject word or words
                      in any order. Then click on the SUBJECT button. The
                      system will return records which include the search
                      term(s) in the subject headings attached to those
                      records. If the word(s) or phrase is not found in
                      any subject headings, the system will return an
                      alphabetical, browsable list of subject headings
                      nearest the spelling entered. The following searches
                      yield the same results in this search mode:
                      ACID RAIN
                      ACID AND RAIN
                      Note: If you are not familiar with Library of
                      Congress subject headings, you may want to search by
                      selecting Keyword and SEARCH EVERYTHING. Then click
                      on the hypertext links to select a particular
                      subject heading.
                    # Keyword and SERIES
                      Type search terms. Click on the SERIES button.
                      SCIENCE AND CULTURE SERIES
               o Browse
                    # Retrieves a list of all headings in the catalog
                      indexes beginning with those closest alphabetically
                      to the search term. Click on FORWARD or BACKWARD to
                      view other result screens.
                      To view an item in a Browse results list, click on
                      the hypertext link to retrieve a list of the
                      record(s) which match.
                      The following catalog indexes can be browsed:
                         @ SEARCH EVERYTHING (all indexes combined)
                         @ AUTHOR (type last name first, or name of agency
                           or organization)

                         @ SUBJECT
                         @ SERIES (library series, not an archival records
                           series)
               o Exact
                 The system searches for terms in the same order in which
                 they are typed, character by character. This is useful,
                 for example, for searching exact titles. Omit a an or the
                 at the beginning of a title, but be sure to type the rest
                 of the title exactly:
                 Journal of the American College of Surgeons
                 Search by any of the following:
                    # SEARCH EVERYTHING (all indexes combined)
                    # AUTHOR (type last name first)
                    # TITLE
                    # SUBJECT
                    # SERIES

   Search Tips and Shortcuts
     * Boolean or Positional Operators
       Words and abbreviations used as Boolean or positional operators
       must be placed in double quotes when used as part of a search
       string, or unexpected results will occur. The following are such
       operators:
       and       or       not       xor       adj       near       same
           with
     * Exact Phrase
       To search an exact phrase, put it in single quotes (to be sure any
       stop words are included):
       'ALL THE KING'S MEN'
     * Exact Title
       Use Exact and TITLE. If the search is unsuccessful, redo in Keyword
       and TITLE or Keyword and SEARCH EVERYTHING.
     * Hypertext Links
       When viewing a full record, click on the hypertext links to
       retrieve records for related materials.
       Hypertext links labeled Electronic Access are Internet addresses.
       Click on these to access a full text document.
     * Scanned documents in the State Library's collection
       For information see http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/Scandocs.html
     * Stopwords
       The following words are stopwords and must be placed in double
       quotes if part of a search string, or they will be ignored by the
       system:
       a       an       as       at       be       but       by       do
           for       if       in       is       it       of       on
       the       to
     * Subject Searching
       If you are not familiar with Library of Congress subject headings,
       use Keyword and SEARCH EVERYTHING instead of Keyword and SUBJECT.
     * Truncation
       End the first few letters of a word with a dollar sign to locate
       words that begin with the same letters. It is generally advisable
       to enter at least the first four letters. If the result is a browse
       list, redo the search using Boolean operators, and omit the
       truncation symbol.
          + TRANSPORT$ will find records containing TRANSPORT, TRANSPORTS,
            TRANSPORTED, TRANSPORTATION, etc.
     * Wildcard
       Substitute a question mark for one character to look for different
       forms of a word, or variations in spelling.
          + WOM?N will find records containing WOMAN or WOMEN.
     * Other Hints
          + The number of results from a search is displayed at the top of
            the screen. Up to 20 will show on each screen. If there are
            more than 20, scroll down to view all the results on the
            screen, then click on the TOP button (located at the bottom
            right corner of the screen). Use the FORWARD button to move to
            the next screen.
          + There are two ways to search part of a title and the author's
            last name. More precise results may be obtained by using
            Complex Search.
            Complex Search
            author==>WIGMORE
            title==>EVIDENCE
            Quick Search
            Wigmore and evidence
          + To search a general topic and any other information such as
            series, use Complex Search options.
            keywords or phrases==>PEDIATRIC$
            series==>OXFORD MEDICAL PUBLICATIONS
          + To search a general topic and part of a Library of Congress
            Subject Heading, use Complex Search.
            keywords or phrases==>TELECOMMUNICATION$
            subject==>DIRECTORIES
            In the above example, the same results occur by searching
            TELECOMMUNICATION$ AND DIRECTORIES in KEYWORD and SEARCH
            EVERYTHING. (Note that if you typed TELECOMMUNICATION$
            DIRECTORIES in Quick Search, fewer records are in the result
            list because the two words are retrieved only when appearing
            in the same field, such as both in the title).

   Return to Table of Contents

   Advanced Search Techniques
     * Combining Search Terms with Boolean Operators
       Use Boolean operators between two search terms to broaden or narrow
       a search.
       Boolean operators are:

       AND terms must be in the same record (narrows search)
       OR  either one or both terms must be in the same record (broadens
           search)
       NOT the first term must be in the record, and the second term must not
           be in the record (narrows search)
       XOR one or the other term must be in the record, but both terms cannot
           be in the same record (narrows search)
       Examples:
       ALCOHOL AND ABUSE$ (the $ sign is the truncation symbol)
       ALCOHOLIC OR ALCOHOLISM
       DOGS OR CATS
       ALCOHOL NOT DRUG
       NARCOTICS XOR ALCOHOL
       POLLUTION AND (WATER OR AIR)
       (ADIRONDACK$ OR CATSKILL$) AND (PARKS OR RECREATION)
       Note: If Boolean operators or stopwords are part of a search
       string, put them in double quotes. To search the term
       not-for-profit, type "NOT FOR" PROFIT.
       If two or more terms are typed in a text input box without using a
       Boolean operator between them, the system understands the
       positional operator SAME (the terms must be in the same field) and
       requires all the terms to appear in the same field.
       Note: Boolean operators do not work in Browse or Exact search
       options, which match words with indexes character by character.
     * Combining Search Words With Positional Operators
       Use positional operators between two words to retrieve records in
       which the two are in a particular physical relationship to each
       other. Positional operators are:

       SAME terms must be in the same field
       WITH terms must be in the same sentence in a field
       NEAR terms must be adjacent to one another, in any order
       ADJ  terms must be adjacent to one another and in the order in which
            they were entered
       Examples:
       REVOLUTION SAME CLAIMS
       INVESTIGATION WITH INFORMANTS
       DELINQUENT$ NEAR JUVENILE$
       Note: If stop words or operator words are part of a search string,
       put them in double quotes. To search for the phrase NEAR EAST, type

   View/Print/Save/Email
     * View/Print/Save/Email Marked Results
       Marking and preliminary steps are the same for viewing, printing,
       saving and emailing records.
       To mark records, click in the small box to the left of a brief
       record, or above and to the left of a full record. Then click on
       the PRINT/CAPTURE button at the top of the screen.
       When records are marked, the record numbers are displayed on the
       PRINT/CAPTURE screen. However, if needed, these can be changed by
       just typing other record numbers from the search (1,11-15,22).
       Options:
       The options on the screen default to those needed for request
       slips.
          + Sort by author and title
          + Sort by ascending or descending call numbers
          + View of records. Display choices are ALL, FULL or BRIEF.
          + Type of output. If you need a MARC record, select FLAT ASCII.
          + Library
       After selecting from the above options and clicking on the VIEW,
       PRINT or SAVE button, a pop-up window will appear.
          + To Print - You must use your browser's print command from this
            pop-up window. Otherwise, the record will not print, and only
            a Data Missing phrase will be on the printout.
          + To Save - Use your browser's save command from this pop-up
            Window.
          + Emailing Search Results - simply input the email address to
            where you want to send the results and click EMAIL.

     * Printing a Request Slip
       For items that need to be retrieved from the stacks, print marked
       records and submit to the Circulation Desk. Please do NOT submit
       printouts with a list of records (brief display) since this display
       does not contain the information needed for retrieval.
       Be sure the printout has bibliographic information (title, author,
       etc.), call number and location. A printout of a marked record will
       include all the needed information. (For more information, click on
       Info Desk at the top of any page, click on Library Information and
       view the item called Onsite Request for Materials.) Items with an
       Archives or MSC call number should be taken to the 11th floor.
       For records with lengthy holdings, such as serials, be sure to
       print only the first two pages to provide the information necessary
       for retrieval. For instructions, please ask staff for assistance.

   Historical Documents Inventory

   The Historical Documents Inventory (HDI) was a project undertaken by
   Cornell University in 1976, and completed in 1993. Therefore in some
   cases the information may be 20 years old.

   These records are the electronic equivalent of the print county guides
   in the reference collection entitled "Guide to historical resources in
   _xxx_ County" published by Cornell University. The print county guides
   are still available for purchase from the State Archives. The guides
   include either repository descriptions or summaries of the holdings of
   particular repositories.

   Some HDI items are in the New York State Library, but an HDI location
   code cannot be used for retrieval. Records or items in the New York
   State Library's collection will have a State Library call number, not
   an HDI location code. To eliminate the HDI records, select the NYSL
   library. However, this will exclude the State Archives and Manuscripts
   and Special Collections records which may be pertinent to your search.

   Selecting a library from:
     * Quick Search - Libraries can be selected by clicking on the down
       arrow of the Library box, located to the right of the text box.
     * Complex Search - Scroll down, if needed, to the Library box under
       Search Limits.
