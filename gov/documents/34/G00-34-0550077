   Introduction 2 The ultimate goal of livestock and meat science research
   3 should be to identify the most efficient means to produce 4
   wholesome, nutritious, highly palatable products that fit the 5 needs
   of consumers. In the United States, per capita consumption 6 of red
   meat has steadily declined over the last thirty years due 7 to a
   failure of the meat industry to provide economical products 8 that meet
   all of the needs of the modern consumer. Many factors, 9 most of which
   are beyond the scope of the present discussion, 10 have contributed to
   the failure of the red meat industry to keep 11 up with changing needs
   and desires of consumers. One factor that 12 has limited the red meat
   industry's ability to improve product 13 desirability is genetic
   antagonisms. The present discussion 14 centers on the genetic
   antagonism between carcass composition and 15 meat tenderness
   associated with the callipyge condition in lamb. 16 Information gained
   from studying this antagonism in lamb should 17 help researchers to
   chart a course for overcoming similar 18 antagonisms, including those
   not yet discovered, in species of 19 greater economic importance. Given
   the high level of conserved 20 genomic synteny among ovine and bovine,
   this information should 21 be readily applicable to cattle. 22
   Inheritance of Callipyge 23 To fully understand the potential effects
   of the callipyge 24 phenotype on the lamb industry, one must have an
   understanding of 25 the mode of inheritance of the callipyge condition.
   Inheritance 26 of the callipyge condition has been described as polar
   27 overdominance (Cockett et al., 1996) because only heterozygous 3 1
   individuals that have inherited the mutant callipyge allele from 2
   their sire and the normal allele from their dam express the 3 callipyge
   phenotype. 4 Although the inheritance of the callipyge condition is 5
   complex, it would still be rather easy to implement mating 6 systems to
   maximize the production of callipyge lambs. 7 Production of callipyge
   lambs would be maximized by mating 8 homozygous callipyge rams, which
   would appear phenotypically 9 normal, with homozygous normal ewes.
   Until recently, the only 10 method to identify homozygous callipyge
   sires for such a mating 11 program was to progeny test those rams by
   mating them to a large 12 number of homozygous normal ewes and
   evaluating the phenotype of 13 offspring. Since the gene responsible
   for the callipyge 14 condition has been localized to ovine chromosome
   18 (Cockett et 15 al., 1994) and its position refined (Freking et al.,
   1998a), it 16 is now possible to use marker-assisted selection to
   identify 17 homozygous callipyge animals. Thus, flocks of homozygous 18
   callipyge animals could be established to produce homozygous 19
   callipyge rams for a terminal mating system. The most logical 20
   approach would be to introgress the mutant callipyge allele into 21 a
   terminal (meat type) sire line. When homozygous callipyge rams 22
   produced from such a line are mated to normal, maternal line 23 ewes,
   100% of the progeny would be expected to express the 24 callipyge
   phenotype. 25 Characterization of Callipyge 26 For most traits of
   economic importance to the lamb industry, 27 the effect of the
   callipyge condition has been well documented. 4 1 Compared with normal
   lambs of similar breed type, lambs 2 expressing the callipyge phenotype
   have similar birth weights, 3 weaning weights, and post-weaning growth
   rates (Jackson et al., 4 1997a). The incidence and severity of dystocia
   are similar for 5 normal and callipyge lambs. Callipyge lambs do not
   appear 6 phenotypically different from their normal siblings until 7
   approximately 2 to 12 wk of age. 8 Grain-fed Market Lambs 9 Dressing
   percentage is 3 to 5 percentage points higher for 10 callipyge
   carcasses than normal carcasses (Koohmaraie et al., 11 1995b; Jackson
   et al., 1997b). The increased dressing percentage 12 of callipyge
   results from a combination of a tendency for reduced 13 weights of most
   dress-off items (internal organs, perinephric 14 fat, and pelt but not
   head or blood) and a tendency for callipyge 15 carcasses to be heavier
   (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b). 16 Callipyge lambs produce carcasses that
   are approximately 30% 17 more muscular and that have 30% less fat
   (Koohmaraie et al., 18 1995b; Jackson et al., 1997b). The callipyge
   phenotype reduces 19 subcutaneous, intermuscular, intramuscular, and
   perinephric 20 fatness. The combined effects of the callipyge condition
   on 21 dressing percentage, muscularity, and fatness result in dramatic
   22 improvements in yields (Table 1; Jackson et al., 1997b). 23
   Depending on the retail fabrication style, trim level, and method 24 of
   expressing yields, the improvement in yield associated with 25 the
   callipyge condition ranged from 7.7% (bone-in, untrimmed 26 retail
   product as percentage of carcass weight) to 32.6% 5 1 (boneless,
   completely trimmed retail product as percentage of 2 live weight). 3
   The increased muscling associated with the callipyge 4 phenotype is not
   uniform across all muscles (Table 2). Weights 5 of most major muscles
   are increased by the callipyge condition; 6 however, the effect is not
   uniform and, in fact, weights of some 7 shoulder muscles are not
   affected by the callipyge condition 8 (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b;
   Jackson et al., 1997c). 9 Why are callipyge more muscular? 10 Knowing
   that callipyge lambs were more muscular than their 11 siblings, we set
   out to determine the mechanisms responsible for 12 the increased
   muscularity of callipyge. 13 Hyperplasia or hypertrophy? 14 The first
   question that we attempted to answer was if the 15 increased
   muscularity of callipyge was due to hyperplasia or 16 hypertrophy.
   Before we initiated our experiments to determine if 17 the increased
   muscularity of callipyge was due to hyperplasia or 18 hypertrophy, we
   already had a preconceived notion that the 19 increased muscularity of
   callipyge was due to hypertrophy because 20 of observations that
   callipyge lambs did not appear more muscular 21 at birth. That is, if
   callipyge was a result of increased 22 hyperplasia, which occurs mostly
   prenatally, we would have 23 expected callipyge lambs to be more
   muscular at birth. 24 We (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b) observed similar
   estimates of 25 apparent muscle fiber number for normal and callipyge
   26 semitendinosus suggesting that hyperplasia was not responsible 27
   for the increased muscularity of callipyge lambs. Furthermore, 6 1 we
   (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b) observed increased cross sectional 2 areas
   of -red and -white muscle fibers and a higher proportion 3 of -white
   muscle fibers for callipyge longissimus and 4 semitendinosus. The
   combined changes in size of -red and - 5 white muscle fibers and the
   shift in muscle fiber types resulted 6 in overall estimates of
   longissimus and semitendinosus cross 7 sectional muscle fiber area
   being 48 and 62% higher for callipyge 8 (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b).
   Collectively, these findings support 9 the hypothesis that the
   increased muscularity of callipyge lambs 10 is caused by hypertrophy
   and not hyperplasia. 11 Increased protein synthesis or decreased
   protein degradation? 12 Having established that the increased
   muscularity of 13 callipyge lambs is caused by hypertrophy we next
   attempted to 14 determine if the hypertrophy was a result of increased
   protein 15 synthesis or decreased protein degradation. In market lambs,
   we 16 (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b) observed that the callipyge phenotype
   17 increased longissimus and semitendinosus DNA, RNA, and protein 18
   content by approximately 30%, suggesting a greater capacity of 19
   callipyge muscles to synthesize and maintain protein. Also, we 20
   observed that calpastatin activity was higher for most skeletal 21
   muscles from callipyge, suggesting that protein degradation may 22 be
   reduced in callipyge skeletal muscles via calpastatin-induced 23 down
   regulation of calpain. In support of that hypothesis, we 24 showed that
   the relative effect of the callipyge condition on 25 weights of the
   various muscles was proportional (R2 = .91) to the 26 relative effect
   of the callipyge condition on calpastatin 27 activity (Figure 1). 7 1
   To establish if there was a direct effect of the callipyge 2 condition
   on protein synthesis or degradation, we (Lorenzen et 3 al., 1997)
   measured protein accretion, synthesis, and degradation 4 rates in
   muscles and tissues of 8 wk old lambs. Both the 5 fractional rate of
   protein synthesis and the fractional rate of 6 protein degradation were
   lower for callipyge longissimus and 7 biceps femoris. Additionally, for
   infraspinatus and 8 supraspinatus, which are not hypertrophied by the
   callipyge 9 condition, neither the fractional rate of protein synthesis
   nor 10 the fractional rate of protein degradation was affected by 11
   callipyge phenotype (Figure 2). 12 Collectively, these findings support
   the hypothesis that the 13 increased muscle hypertrophy of callipyge
   lambs is caused by 14 decreased protein degradation. But, present data
   do not permit 15 exclusion of a role of protein synthesis in causing
   callipyge- 16 induced muscle hypertrophy before 5 wk of age. 17 The
   Antagonism 18 Because the callipyge phenotype greatly increases (19 to
   19 126%) calpastatin activity for most major muscles, the rate of 20
   postmortem proteolysis is dramatically reduced for those 21 callipyge
   muscles and, thus, those callipyge muscles are much 22 tougher than
   normal muscles even after extensive aging 23 (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b;
   Shackelford et al., 1997; Freking et 24 al., 1998b). The negative
   effect of the callipyge condition on 25 meat tenderness appears to be
   particularly large for longissimus 26 (Shackelford et al., 1997). In
   fact, oven roasting eliminates 27 the toughness of callipyge lamb legs
   (Shackelford et al., 1997). 8 1 Therefore, most efforts to insure the
   tenderness of callipyge 2 meat have focused on longissimus. 3
   Mitigating the Callipyge Antagonism Genetically 4 It appears that there
   is a direct association between the 5 effects of the callipyge
   condition on carcass muscularity and 6 meat tenderness. Apparently, by
   increasing calpastatin activity, 7 the callipyge condition results in
   decreased rates of antemortem 8 and postmortem protein degradation.
   Given that calpastatin 9 appears to play an essential role in the
   increased muscularity of 10 callipyge, it appears that any attempt to
   improve the tenderness 11 of callipyge by selecting against calpastatin
   would result in a 12 loss of both the positive and negative aspects of
   callipyge. 13 It might be possible to mitigate the negative effects of
   the 14 callipyge condition on meat tenderness by selecting for genetic
   15 combinations that are moderate to the present callipyge 16
   condition. That is, the optimal genetic combination might be one 17
   that results in a modest increase in calpastatin activity, a 18 modest
   decrease in fractional breakdown rate, a modest increase 19 in carcass
   muscularity, and a modest decrease in meat tenderness. 20 Carwell Locus
   for Lamb Muscling 21 Recently, research in Australia suggested that a
   locus for 22 extreme muscling was segregating in some families of
   Australian 23 Polled Dorset (Banks, 1997). The Carwell condition has
   been 24 reported (Nicoli et al., 1998) to result in a smaller increase
   in 25 longissimus area than has been reported for the callipyge 26
   condition (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b; Jackson et al., 1997b). 9 1 Data
   are not yet available for the effect of the Carwell 2 condition on meat
   tenderness. 3 The Carwell condition has been linked to the region of
   the 4 ovine genome that has been shown to contain the callipyge locus 5
   (Cockett et al., 1996; Freking et al., 1998a). However, 6 phenotypic
   data indicate that this condition is not as extreme as 7 the callipyge
   condition. It is possible that a different allelic 8 form of the same
   gene as the one that causes the callipyge 9 condition causes the
   Carwell condition. The Carwell condition 10 appears to show the same
   type of polar overdominant inheritance 11 as Cockett et al. (1996)
   described for the callipyge phenotype. 12 As with the callipyge
   phenotype, it appears that only 13 heterozygous individuals that have
   inherited the mutant allele 14 from their sire and the normal allele
   from their dam express the 15 Carwell phenotype. 16 Mitigating the
   Callipyge Antagonism Environmentally 17 Numerous approaches to
   overcoming the inadequate tenderness 18 of callipyge have been examined
   (Table 3). The first approach 19 explored for tenderizing callipyge was
   extended postmortem aging 20 (Koohmaraie et al., 1995b). Koohmaraie et
   al. (1995b) reported 21 that aging callipyge longissimus from 1 to 21
   days resulted in a 22 25% (P < .001) reduction in Warner-Bratzler shear
   force. 23 However, callipyge longissimus aged 21 days tended (P = .12)
   to 24 be less tender (higher Warner-Bratzler shear force) than normal
   25 longissimus at 1 day postmortem. Thus, it appeared that aging 26
   alone would not serve to overcome the inadequate tenderness of 27
   callipyge. This was confirmed by Busboom et al. (1997) who 10 1 showed
   that Warner-Bratzler shear values were higher for 2 callipyge loin
   chops aged 80 days than normal loin chops aged 14 3 days. 4
   Calcium-activated tenderization has been shown to be an 5 effective
   method to increase the rate of postmortem proteolysis 6 in beef and
   lamb (Koohmaraie et al., 1993). Therefore, there has 7 been much
   interest in the use of calcium-activated tenderization 8 as a method to
   overcome the inadequate tenderness of callipyge. 9 All of the studies
   reviewed showed that calcium-activated 10 tenderization resulted in
   improved tenderness of callipyge 11 longissimus (Koohmaraie et al.,
   1995a; Leckie et al., 1997; 12 Duckett et al., 1998). However, there
   was disagreement among 13 studies in the level of effect achieved with
   calcium-activated 14 tenderization. Whereas Koohmaraie et al. (1995a,
   1998) reported 15 that calcium-injected callipyge longissimus had
   Warner-Bratzler 16 shear values 41 to 113% higher than non-injected
   normal 17 longissimus, Leckie et al. (1997) reported that callipyge 18
   longissimus injected with calcium chloride and aged until 14 or 19 28
   days postmortem had Warner-Bratzler shear values similar to 20
   non-injected normal longissimus aged until 14 days postmortem. 21
   Electrical-stimulation is a rather simple tenderization 22 technology
   that could be easily utilized by lamb packers; 23 however,
   high-voltage, high-frequency electrical stimulation has 24 little or no
   effect on callipyge longissimus Warner-Bratzler 25 shear force (Leckie
   et al., 1997; Shackelford et al., 1998). 26 Frozen storage has been
   shown to result in loss of 27 calpastatin activity (Koohmaraie, 1990)
   and, thus, if beef 11 1 samples are frozen and held for approximately
   30 d, thawed, and 2 then aged, the rate of proteolysis may be slightly
   increased 3 (Crouse and Koohmaraie, 1990). Therefore, there has been 4
   interest in using freezing as a method to decrease the level of 5
   calpastatin activity in callipyge muscles. Leckie et al. (1997) 6
   reported that freezing of callipyge chops for 4 days before 7 thawing
   and aging did not affect longissimus Warner-Bratzler 8 shear force.
   However, Duckett et al. (1998) reported that when 9 callipyge chops
   were frozen at 24 h postmortem for 6 weeks and 10 subsequently thawed
   and aged for 24 days, callipyge chops had 11 longissimus
   Warner-Bratzler shear force values similar to normal 12 longissimus
   chops. 13 Koohmaraie et al. (1998) showed that callipyge longissimus 14
   tenderness could be improved by limiting the extent of postmortem 15
   sarcomere shortening. At approximately 17 minutes postmortem, 16
   carcasses were submersed in liquid nitrogen for a period of 15 17
   minutes. This resulted in longissimus temperatures of 18 approximately
   2.3 and 14.5°C at 35 and 62 min after slaughter, 19 respectively. This
   process did not completely inhibit rigor 20 shortening. However, as
   compared with conventionally-chilled 21 carcasses, carcasses frozen in
   liquid nitrogen had increased 22 longissimus sarcomere length (1.99 vs
   1.63 µm). That increase in 23 sarcomere length translated into a
   reduction in longissimus 24 Warner-Bratzler shear force of 32 and 30%
   at 7 and 14 days 25 postmortem, respectively. Nonetheless, those shear
   values were 26 still 51 and 63% higher than normal longissimus at 7 and
   14 days 27 postmortem, respectively. To consistently produce loin chops
   12 1 with Warner-Bratzler shear values less than 5 kg, Koohmaraie et 2
   al. (1998) found that it was necessary to combine liquid nitrogen 3
   freezing, calcium-activated tenderization, and aging in a 4 multiple
   hurdle approach (Figure 3). 5 Another approach to tenderizing callipyge
   is the Hydrodyne 6 process, which functions by mechanical disruption of
   the muscle 7 ultrastructure (Solomon et al., 1997). Hydrodyne appears
   to be 8 an effective method of instantaneous tenderization of callipyge
   9 (Leckie et al., 1997). 10 Economics 11 As lamb producers, processors,
   and marketers make plans to 12 strengthen consumer demand for lamb,
   they will be forced to 13 decide whether or not to utilize callipyge
   genetics. If 14 callipyge lambs are produced, then packers, processors
   and 15 retailers will have to decide whether to tenderize callipyge
   lamb 16 before passing that product down the marketing chain to the 17
   consumer. Ultimately, the consumer will decide to what extent 18 the
   desirable characteristics of callipyge offset its negative 19 effects
   on meat tenderness. 20 We have summarized how each segment of the
   marketing chain 21 would be affected if callipyge genetics were
   introgressed into a 22 terminal sire line (Table 4). Because the
   callipyge phenotype 23 does not affect survivability, dystocia, or
   growth rate, 24 production of callipyge lambs would have little effect
   on the 25 breeding segment of the industry. However, commercial lamb 26
   producers may have to pay a premium to procure homozygous 27 callipyge
   rams. Lamb feeders would benefit from the improved 13 1 feed efficiency
   of callipyge. Packers would reap the benefits of 2 the effect of the
   callipyge phenotype on dressing percentage; 3 however, packers may have
   to bear the cost of tenderizing 4 callipyge. Retailers would reap the
   benefits of the effect of the 5 callipyge phenotype on cutting yields.
   Because of increased 6 muscle size and the higher percentage of lean in
   callipyge cuts, 7 consumers would likely find callipyge cuts to be more
   attractive 8 than typical lamb cuts. This would likely result in an
   initial 9 increase in the volume of lamb sold by retailers. However, 10
   consumers may react negatively to the toughness of callipyge. 11
   Therefore, introduction of callipyge lamb to the marketplace 12 might
   adversely affect long-term trends in lamb consumption 13 unless
   callipyge was tenderized sufficiently. 14 It is likely that the packing
   segment will have to bear the 15 cost of tenderizing callipyge. Thus,
   we have approximated the 16 potential economic benefits of callipyge to
   the packing segment 17 (Table 5). In our calculations, we assumed that
   packers buy 18 lambs on a live weight basis and sell three-way boxed
   lamb. With 19 this approach, the only one of the advantages of
   callipyge that 20 would be captured by the packing segment would be
   dressing 21 percentage. If a packer were to fabricate carcasses into
   trimmed 22 subprimals, the callipyge advantage would be greater (Table
   1). 23 We conservatively estimate that the multiple hurdle
   tenderization 24 approach described by Koohmaraie et al. (1998) would
   cost 25 $5.00/carcass. The economic advantage associated with the
   higher 26 dressing percentage of callipyge is likely great enough to
   offset 27 the cost of tenderization. 14 1 Comparison to Double Muscling
   in Cattle 2 Double muscling in cattle, which is caused by mutations in
   3 the myostatin gene (Smith et al., 1997, 1998), and the callipyge 4
   condition in lamb are similar in that both conditions increase 5
   carcass muscularity and decrease carcass fatness. However, there 6 are
   several distinct differences between double muscling in 7 cattle and
   the callipyge condition in lamb (Table 6). The 8 increased muscling
   associated with double muscling is primarily a 9 result of hyperplasia,
   whereas the increased muscling associated 10 with callipyge is a result
   of hypertrophy. Because double 11 muscling is a result of hyperplasia,
   which occurs primarily 12 prenatally, double muscling increases birth
   weight and the 13 incidence and severity dystocia. Because callipyge is
   a result 14 of hypertrophy, which occurs primarily postnatally,
   callipyge 15 does not affect birth weight or the incidence and severity
   of 16 dystocia. 17 Because double muscling increases the incidence and
   severity 18 of dystocia, cow-calf producers have been reluctant to
   produce 19 double-muscled calves. However, when intermediate
   double-muscled 20 calves are produced by mating double-muscled bulls to
   normal, 21 mature cows, the effect on birth weight and dystocia is
   small 22 (Casas et al., 1998). Thus, intermediate double-muscled calves
   23 could be produced in a roto-terminal mating system without 24
   deleterious effects on calving. 25 Whereas the callipyge phenotype has
   deleterious effects on 26 longissimus tenderness (Koohmaraie et al.,
   1995b), the 15 1 intermediate double muscling phenotype does not effect
   2 longissimus tenderness (Casas et al., 1998). 3 Avoiding Antagonisms 4
   The callipyge condition in lamb and double muscling in 5 cattle
   represent two different methods to increase carcass 6 muscularity and
   decrease carcass fatness. However, both methods 7 result in improvement
   in carcass composition at the expense of 8 other traits. Given the link
   between proteolysis rates in 9 antemortem and postmortem muscle, it
   would appear that selection 10 for decreased protein degradation would
   almost certainly have 11 negative consequences on meat tenderness. On
   the other hand, 12 selecting for increased hyperplasia will almost
   certainly 13 increase the incidence and severity of dystocia in cattle.
   14 However, the intermediate double muscling phenotype only has 15
   minor effects on birth weight and the incidence and severity of 16
   dystocia when intermediate double muscled calves are produced 17 from
   mature, normal phenotype cows. The effect of selection for 18 increased
   hyperplasia on dystocia may be less in litter-bearing 19 species.
   Muscle growth could be increased by selecting for 20 increased protein
   synthesis. However, selection for increased 21 protein synthesis may
   result in decreased efficiency of 22 utilization of protein as it has
   been shown that exogenous growth 23 hormone results in increased rates
   of both protein synthesis and 24 protein degradation (Tomas, et al.,
   1992). It would appear that 25 growth hormone has the opposite effect
   on protein turnover as the 26 callipyge condition. 16 1 Until
   marker-assisted selection schemes can be developed to 2 circumvent
   genetic antagonisms, it appears that selection for any 3 trait should
   be conducted with attention to the effects of that 4 selection on other
   traits. Ultimately, the best alleles for meat 5 production may be those
   that have moderate effects on production 6 traits, carcass composition,
   and meat tenderness rather than the 7 extreme effects induced by
   callipyge and myostatin. 8 17 1 References 2 Banks, R. 1997. Proc.
