   Bullet Forthcoming article on the organizational sentencing guidelines
   by Judge Diana E. Murphy, Chair, United States Sentencing Commission:

     Diana E. Murphy, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for
     Organizations: A Decade of Promoting Compliance and Ethics, __ Iowa
     L. Rev. __ (forthcoming 2002). In this article, Judge Diana E.
     Murphy, Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission and Judge
     for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
     recounts the history behind the sentencing guidelines for
     organizations, discusses their impact on corporate culture and
     corporate law, and reviews some recent suggestions regarding
     potential amendments to them.

   Bullet Recent conference paper by Vice Chair John R. Steer on the
   organizational sentencing guidelines.

     John R. Steer, Changing Organizational Behavior -- The Federal
     Sentencing Guidelines Experiment Begins to Bear Fruit (unpublished
     paper presented at the Twenty-Ninth Annual Conference on Value
     Inquiry, Tulsa, Oklahoma (Apr. 26, 2001)). In this paper, John R.
     Steer, Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, and
     former General Counsel to the Commission, spotlights the system of
     sentencing guidelines for organizational defendants and discusses
     how their application to convicted organizations, as well as their
     threatened application to other potential law breakers, provides a
     novel and ambitious approach to punishment. This approach combines
     the threat of heavy criminal fines for law violators and the
     likelihood of court-supervised probation (the "sticks"), with the
     opportunity for very substantial fine mitigation (and perhaps no
     probation) (the "carrots") for those convicted entities who either
     have instituted an "effective program to prevent and detect
     violations of law," or who promptly report their wrongdoing and
     fully cooperate with law enforcement.
