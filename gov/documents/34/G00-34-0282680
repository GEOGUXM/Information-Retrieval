   Background

   Education:
     * Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Moscow State
       University, USSR.
       (Thesis: Some problems of ab initio quantum chemical calculations
       and theoretical investigation of the set of oxygen containing
       compounds)
     * M.Sc. in Physics (Fast Process Chemistry), Moscow Institute of
       Physics and Technology, Moscow, USSR.

   Research
     * Photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy
     * Application of density functional theory for prediction of
       molecular properties and for studying reactivity.
     * Development of efficient methods of transition state location that
       are suitable for investigation of biological systems and transition
       metal complexes.
     * Theoretical modeling of the process of peptide bond cleavage under
       different catalytic conditions (particularly, under enzymatic
       environment of HIV protease).
     * Density functional studying of ligand-metal interactions and
       principals of enzymatic activities in metalloenzymes
     * Quantum biochemistry and enzymatic activity modeling
