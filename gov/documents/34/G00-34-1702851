   MR

   The instrument mentor has requested that the sensors be returned to him
   due to his operation is shutting down the experiment.  Packaged up the
   sensors and returned them to him.  No further PM or CM on this
   instrument until further notice.

   Removed the pond sensor from the pond.  The cattle have broke the
   anchor wire and needs to be replaced.  The pond is very shallow so the
   pond sensor will be removed until the pond refills with water.
   Notified the mentor about the situation and he said he would send a new
   anchor cable.  Downloaded the data from the sensor and sent it to the
   mentor.

   performed until the water level returns in the pond.

   The mentor is on site today to change out the sensor and provide us
   with training. Removed the old sensor and installed the new sensor in
   the pond. Matt Parker left the proper hardware and software to perform
   maintenance and provided instruction to me on how and what he wants
   done. He wants the sensor exchanged and downloaded every 2 weeks
   starting during the week of 5/15-5/19. No particular day was
   recommended but Friday seems to be best choice. Will provide training
   to other personnel starting on the first PM.

   JT

   Representative from Savana River Lab arrived on site and installed a
   floating temperature sensor in the pond directly North of the entrance
   gate to the CF. Site Operations will retrieve data from the sensor via
   sneakernet once every two weeks and send to PI. Expect cabling and SW
   needed for sneakernet collection to arrive at SGP sometime after first
   of year.
