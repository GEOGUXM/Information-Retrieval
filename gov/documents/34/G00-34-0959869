   Water Quality and Environment CRIS:
   - Evaluation of soil hydraulic properties affecting water and solute
   movement in root and vadose zone. [Lehrsch]
   - Evaluation of the movement of nitrate and other soluble salts in the
   vadose zone of silt loam soil. [Wright]
   - Evaluating the effect of PAM on water and solute movement below the
   root zone under furrow irrigation. [Lentz]
   - Evaluate the effect of PAM on the movement of weed seeds and
   microorganisms off of surface irrigated fields. [Sojka][Entry]
   - Evaluate the effect of different filter strips to trap microorganisms
   and nutrients in surface runoff. [Entry]
   - Determine the relationship between selected soil P availability
   indices and the potential for P losses in irrigation and rainfall
   runoff. [Westermann]
