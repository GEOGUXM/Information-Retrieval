     [square.jpg] [squ-clear.jpg] The vision of the USGS is to be a world
     leader in the natural sciences through our scientific excellence and
     responsiveness to society's needs. USGS emphasis has always been,
     and should always be, on contributing world class science. But it is
     also essential that USGS specifically focus on society's needs and
     how we can ensure that we conduct, integrate, and translate the
     science necessary to be responsive.
     [square.jpg] [squ-clear.jpg] What we have long needed is to build a
     solid bridge between science and society. This is the goal of the
     USGS Center for Science Policy (USGS-CSP).

     [square.jpg] [squ-clear.jpg] There have been many cases that
     illustrate how USGS science has been vital in helping policy makers
     make good decisions, but there are definitely barriers to the use of
     good science in responding to society's needs. USGS-CSP will break
     down these barriers, allowing for more successful use of good
     science in policymaking.
     To accomplish this, we will conduct work on three research agendas:


   [square.jpg] Research on how policy is set and how policy can be
                improved with better scientific information. INCLUDE (Integrated
                Science and Community-based Values in Land Use Decisionmaking)


   [square.jpg] Research on translating the science into policy-relevant
   forms and metrics READII (Risk and Environmental Analysis for Decision
   Information and Implementation)

   [square.jpg] Research on using geographic analysis to integrate
                multidisciplinary science parts. GAT (Geographic Analysis Team)
