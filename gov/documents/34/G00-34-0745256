               Evaluation of Potential Bridge Scour in Montana

   PROBLEM:
   Scour of the streambed in the vicinity of bridge piers and abutments
       during floods has resulted in more bridge failures nationally than
       all other causes in recent history. Sudden bridge failure due to
       scour may result in tragic loss of life as well as large economic
       loss.

   OBJECTIVE:
   To address the problem of bridge scour on a national basis, the Federal
       Highway Administration (FHWA) established in 1991 a program to (1)
       conduct scour-related research and data collection, (2) improve
       methods for evaluation of scour, and (3) identify potentially
       scour-critical bridges on federal-aid highways. In Montana, the
       USGS initiated a program in cooperation with the Montana Department
       of Transportation (DOT) to address all three goals of the national
       program.

   APPROACH:
   The Montana USGS began a program to assess scour using detailed
       hydraulic analyses at about 80 key bridges. In addition, the USGS
       began collecting on-site scour data at about 6 bridges. At several
       of these, the collected data will be used to calibrate and
       investigate use of a mobile-bed hydraulic model (BRI-STARS) for
       detailed scour analyses. The USGS also developed a method for the
       rapid-estimation of scour that could be used to quickly assess
       scour potential at a large number of sites by a deadline date set
       by the FHWA. This rapid-estimation method was intended for use as a
       screening tool that would quickly identify which bridge sites might
       require more detailed future hydraulic analyses.

   STATUS
   The rapid-estimation method was used to estimate scour at over 1,500
       bridge sites in Montana. Work is ongoing on completion of detailed
       hydraulic scour assessments at about 15 sites. On-site scour data
       collection is continuing.
