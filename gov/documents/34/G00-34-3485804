   FCC REALLOCATES AND ADOPTS
   SERVICE RULES FOR TELEVISION CHANNELS 52-59

   Washington, D.C. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has adopted
   allocation and service rules for 48 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum in the
   698-746 MHz band (Lower 700 MHz band) currently occupied by television
   channels 52-59 in many markets. This spectrum is being reclaimed for
   new commercial services as part of the transition of television
   broadcasting from analog to digital transmission systems. The
   Commissions new flexible allocation for this band will allow service
   providers to select the technology they wish to use to provide new
   services that the market may demand.

   Background

   The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Commission to
   assign spectrum reclaimed from broadcast television using competitive
   bidding and to auction this spectrum by September 30, 2002. The
   reclamation of the 700 MHz band is occurring as a result of the planned
   migration of broadcasters into the "core" broadcast spectrum (currently
   Channels 2-51) that will occur when they convert from analog to digital
   operations. The FCC previously reallocated the upper portion of the 700
   MHz band (747-806 MHz, or television Channels 60-69),^ and adopted
   service and licensing rules for that spectrum. As part of the
   conversion process, Congress has provided for a transition period
   during which broadcasters may continue to operate their existing analog
   systems while using a second channel to transmit their digital
   television (DTV) signals. While Congress enacted a statutory
   requirement to auction this spectrum by September 30, 2002, the
   transition period is targeted to end in 2006, the Commission is
   statutorily required to extend that date on a market-by-market basis if
   one or more of the four largest network stations or affiliates are not
   broadcasting in digital, digital-to-analog converter technology is not
   generally available, or 15% or more television households in the market
   are not receiving a digital signal. At the end of this transition,
   analog service will cease, and the remaining broadcast operations above
   Channel 51 will be relocated into the core broadcast spectrum.

   Specifics of Todays Action

   The Report and Order adopted by the Commission takes the following
   actions:

   Reallocation: Reallocates the entire 48 megahertz of spectrum in the
   Lower 700 MHz Band to fixed and mobile services and retains the
   existing broadcast allocation for both new broadcast services and
   incumbent broadcast services during their transition to DTV.

   Incumbent broadcasters: Establishes technical criteria designed to
   protect incumbent television operations in the band during the DTV
   transition period, allows Low Power Television (LPTV) and TV translator
   stations to retain secondary status and to operate in the band after
   the transition. The Order dismisses pending petitions for new NTSC
   allotments in Channels 52-59 and provides a 45-day window for
   modification of pending applications for new NTSC construction permits
   to provide analog or digital service in the core television spectrum or
   digital service in the 698-740 MHz band (Channels 52-58).

   New service rules: Determines that all operations on the Lower 700 MHz
   Band will be regulated under the framework of the Commissions Part 27
   technical, licensing, and operational rules. To permit both wireless
   services and certain new broadcast operations in the Lower 700 MHz
   Band, however, the FCC amends Part 27's maximum power limits to permit
   50 kW effective radiated power transmissions in the Lower 700 MHz Band,
   subject to specific requirements for notification and non-interference.

   Spectrum blocks and licensing areas: In its service rules, the
   Commission divides the Lower 700 MHz Band into three 12 -megahertz
   blocks, with each block consisting of a pair of 6-megahertz segments,
   and two 6-megahertz blocks of contiguous, unpaired spectrum. The FCC
   will license two of the three 12-megahertz blocks and the two
   6-megahertz unpaired blocks on a regional basis using six Economic Area
   Groupings (EAGs). The remaining 12-megahertz block of paired spectrum
   will be licensed using MSAs and RSAs (734 licenses).

   Band clearing:
   Adopts no specific band clearing rules and therefore provides that
   regulatory requests related to voluntary band clearing in the Lower 700
   MHz band will be considered on a case-by-case basis, considering all
   relevant public interest factors.

   Action by the Commission December 12, 2001, by Report and Order (FCC
   01-364). Chairman Powell, Commissioners Abernathy, and Copps with
   Commissioner Martin approving in part, concurring in part and
   Commissioners Copps and Martin issuing separate statements.
