      The Rutland Community Based Outpatient Clinic opened on September 11,
      2000. The clinic will serve the primary health care needs of eligible
      veterans. Most of the cost of services provided to veterans enrolling
      in the plan will be paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Family
      members of enrolled veterans may also be able to be seen at the Rutland
      Primary Care Clinic under their own insurance plan.

      SERVICES:
        * Primary care physicians
        * Laboratory Tests
        * Preventive services such as annual flu and pneumonia shots
        * Electrocardiograms (EKG)
        * X-rays
        * Medications
        * Gynecological services for female veterans

      ADVANTAGES OF THE CBOC
        * Veterans will have one primary care doctor to coordinate care on an
          ongoing basis.
        * Veterans can receive primary medical care closer to home and don't
          have to travel to the White River Junction VAM&ROC.
        * Veterans can schedule their routine appointments, usually within 72
          hours.
        * Family members of veterans may be able to receive their primary
          care, under their own insurance plans, in the same health center as
          the veteran.
        * Veterans will still be eligible for specialty outpatient care,
          inpatient care and all other entitlements through the White River
          Junction VAM&ROC.

      DIRECTIONS:

      Road traffic signal. The clinic is approximately 3/4 mile from the stop
      light and is on the right side of the road. See sign for Rutland
