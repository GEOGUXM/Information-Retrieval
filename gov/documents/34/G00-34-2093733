            MAIL DELIVERY NOTICE :
            November 29, 2001

            We have been advised by the Post Office that all mail backlogs have
            been caught up.  You should check PACER to determine if your case is
            current.  If you mailed a pleading more than two weeks ago, and it
            is not showing up on PACER, you should submit a second set of the
            pleadings, making sure to indicate on the pleading that it is your
            second submission of the pleadings.

            The process of distributing pleadings that are hand delivered to the
            Clerk's Office for filing would be expedited if pleadings were not
            submitted in envelopes.  Because of current circumstances, any
            pleading received in an envelope by this Office must first be
            forwarded to our special mail handling room for opening.  We would
            be very appreciative if the use of envelopes to deliver pleadings
            would cease, unless the pleading being filed must be filed under
            seal.
