     GPPD is one of three powder diffractometers at Argonne National
     Labratory's Intense Pulsed Neutron Source division that use
     time-of-flight (TOF) neutron powder diffraction (NPD). The GPPD
     instrument is extremely versatile and can be used to resolve a
     diverse range of materials science problems. Experimental programs
     include structural characterization of framework modified zeolites,
     radiation-induced amorphization of transuranic materials, in situ
     electrochemistry, thermal behavior of advanced ceramic catalysts and
     residual stress measurement.

     If you are interested in submitting a proposal to perform studies on
     GPPD, go to the IPNS home page and click on the proposals page.

     Please contact Dr. James Richardson, Jr. or Evan Maxey if you have
     any questions.
