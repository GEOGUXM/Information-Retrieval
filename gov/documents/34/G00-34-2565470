   President Discusses Energy Plan, Economic Stimulus In West Virginia
   "We can create more opportunities by selling more products overseas. I
   spent a lot of time as the governor of Texas with the farmers. The
   agricultural sector is an incredibly important part of our economy. And
   one of the benefits we have as a nation is we can feed ourselves.
   That's good for the national security interest, by the way. But we
   produce more food than we need. We ought to be selling it overseas. The
   more markets available for U.S. products, the more likely it is
   somebody is going to find work."
