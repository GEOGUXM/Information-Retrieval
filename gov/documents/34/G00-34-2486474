                             Investigator Costs

   Investigators pay a nominal processing fee for specimens received from
   the CHTN: $20/sample for researchers at academic institutions and
   $60/sample for researchers at non-academic institutions. Slides and
   blocks accompanyng tissue samples may be available at costs ranging
   from $3-7. The charges are not for the tissue, but to partially offset
   the costs of collecting, handling and preparing the specimens in
   accordance with the detailed requirements of the investigator. The
   investigator must also pay the cost of shipping specimens to his/her
   laboratory.
