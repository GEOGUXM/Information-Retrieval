   Dr. Floyd L. Thompson (1898-1976) was Director of NASA Langley Research
   Center from May 1960 to May 1968. He was a prominent researcher in the
   areas of science and technology for a variety of important aeronautical
   and space programs, including the national effort to land a man on the
   moon and safely return him to earth. He guided research leading to a
   number of programs of world importance including Project Mercury, the
   concept of erectable space vehicles which led to the development of the
   world's first passive communications satellite, and the first solid
   fueled launch vehicle to propel a satellite into orbit.
