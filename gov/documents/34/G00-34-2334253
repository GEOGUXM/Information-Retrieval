   Strategic Plan

The NASA Professional Development Program

     The Professional Development Program (PDP) is designed to broaden
     the participants' knowledge and understanding of the Agency through
     a combination of expanded work experiences and formal training.
     Participants in this program identify a developmental work
     assignment away from their home center. Benefits include learning
     new job skills, being exposed to new areas of NASA and senior NASA
     officials, and participating in a variety of developmental
     activities.

     Participants identify developmental work assignments and re-locate
     for the program. Many of the participants come from a Center to NASA
     Headquarters for the year, but participants may also travel from
     their Center to another Center or from NASA Headquarters to a Center
     to participate in the PDP. Another option is to seek an assignment
     outside of NASA at another government agency or in private industry.

     Training Costs: Headquarters covers the cost of this program
     including related travel expenses, partial per diem, and training
     funds.

     Who Should Apply: Professional personnel with five to ten years of
     NASA experience who are willing to re-locate for a developmental
     work assignment. There are three levels of participation. Level I
     (GS-15) and Level II (GS-13-14) require assignments at locations
     different from one's home installation. Level III operates within
     the home installation for various lengths of time, up to one year.

     Length of Program: The PDP is a six-month to one-year program that
     begins in August. A five-day orientation program is held in June to
     prepare participants for the transitions they will experience during
     the PDP year.
