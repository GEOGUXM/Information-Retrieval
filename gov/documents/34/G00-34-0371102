   PRIVACY NOTICE

      We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website
      unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, we
      collect and store certain information automatically. Here is how we
      handle information about your visit to our website.

   What We Collect and Store Automatically

      If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
      read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
      information about your visit automatically. This information does not
      identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
      following information about your visit:
       1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
          private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect
          from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a
          number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
          are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
       2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
       3. The date and time you access our site;
       4. The pages you visit; and
       5. If you linked to our website from another website, the address of
          that website.

      We use the information we collect to count the number and type of
      visitors to the different pages on our site, and to help us make our
      site more useful to visitors like you.

   Cookies

      These pages use "session cookies" or their equivalent to temporarily
      store information about your visit and to track transactions while you
      are online. Session cookies expire automatically after you leave the
      site and the information is discarded and non-retrievable.

      "Persistent cookies" - sometimes used to track user activity over
      multiple sessions and/or web sites - are not used on this site.

   If You Send Us E-mail

      You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail
      with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our
      service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your
      e-mail to other government employees who may be better able to help
      you. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not
      share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.

   Links to Other Sites

      Our website has many links to our partners, especially other federal
      agencies. In a few cases we link to private organizations. When you
      link to another site, you are no longer on our site and are subject to
      the privacy policy of the new site.
