  Description

   Stopwatch does what its name implies - enables hand timing much like a
   physical stopwatch. Stopwatch may run as a traditional program or in a
   browser. If you want to run stopwatch outside the browser, download and
   install it.

   Stopwatch has millisecond accuracy and no limit on hours. Stopwatch
   runs on UNIX, Windows, and MacOS.

  Directions [stopwatch.gif]

  Press "start" to start the stopwatch and "stop" to stop it. "record" records
  the current time and selects it so that it can readily be pasted into other
  programs. Recorded times are marked with an L for "lap" or T for "total". When
  stopped, you can cut/paste/edit the time by hand and set it to any valid time.
  "zero" resets the time to zero.

  Installation

  There is no installation step (such as "configure" or "Make"). Once
  downloaded, simply run stopwatch with wish or any Tk-enabled interpreter.
  PriceStopwatch is free. Copy and Reuse InformationStopwatch is in the public
  domain. Caveats

  Stopwatch requires Tcl/Tk 7.5 or later. Millisecond timing is only available
  when using Tcl 8.3 or later.

  By default, the maximum time is just over 596 hours (about 25 days). The range
  may be increased (to about 68 years) by disabling the millisecond timer. To
  disable the millisecond timer manually, edit the source and set
  time(doMilliseconds) to 0.
