   Aerodynamics Curriculum and Experiments
   This is a curriculum to teach aeronautics in K-6 using engineering
   principles. It was written by Yvetta Pols and has been successfully
   tested in several schools. It consists of a number of hands-on
   experiments for the kids to perform in the classroom, along with
   explanations of the principles involved for the teachers. It also
   consists of more advanced experiments which use a wind tunnel (see
   below for how you can make your own), and a computer, if desired.
   Wind Tunnel Picture The Wind Tunnel
   This is the wind tunnel that can be for many of the experiments. We
   have provided plans for two different tunnels so that those of you who
   feel motivated can build your own. The Baals Wind Tunnel is more
   expensive but gives better results. The other wind tunnel is less
   expensive but the results aren't as good.
   Check Out what the Savannah section of the AIAA has done with the Baals
   Wind Tunnel.

   Explanations of Physics concepts and fun demonstrations that go with
   them.
