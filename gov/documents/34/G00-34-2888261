   IRLab Thermography Experiments

   [blrule.gif]
   The human eye can't see the heat that shines off of everyday objects.
   But with the help of infrared imagers, researchers can "see" and
   measure this heat which radiates from every surface. This data can
   produce images called thermograms that are based on the temperature of
   objects. Researchers Dariush Arasteh, Brent Griffith, Daniel Türler,
   Paul LaBerge, Howdy Goudey, and Christian Kohler of the Building
   Technologies Program have developed an Infrared Thermography Laboratory
   to measure and image the surface temperatures of windows and other
   insulated systems. This type of thermal testing has the advantage that
   large amounts of surface temperature data can be collected without
   disrupting the test situation. The data are collected as an image that
   allows for a quick understanding of the relative performance of various
   parts in the system.

   Thermogram

      [therm.jpg] This image is called a thermogram. Each pixel of a
      thermogram has a temperature value and the image's contrast is derived
      from differences in surface temperature. The specimen here is a normal
      dual pane window. Cold air is blowing along the back side. The scale at
      the bottom shows the relation between temperature and color. Note the
      cooler conditions around the perimeter of the glass, this is due to
      high heat flow through the aluminum spacer located between the two
      panes of glass.




   Thermal Chambers and Lab Equipment

      This photograph shows the the two chambers and a window specimen.  The
      chamber on the left produces cold, blowing air and the chamber on the
      right produces room temperature still air.  The windows are first
      mounted in a foam surround panel and then clamped between the warm and
      cold chambers. .


      [labequip2.jpg] This photograph shows the main components of the
      Infrared Thermography Laboratory. The infrared imager is pointed into
      the warm chamber. The cold chamber is in the back. The computer data
      acquisition and control system is on the right. The flexible bellows
      and support structure allows varying the imaging distance from 1.5 to
      4.0 meters.

      The facility uses the two temperature-controlled chambers to create a
      steady flow of heat through the test specimens. Standard conditions
      used in building design for winter are typically used, -17.8°C or 0°F
      with high wind on the cold side and 21.1°C or 70°F on the warm side.
      The infrared imager measures the warm side surface of the specimen. A
      special reference emitter technique is used to improve the accuracy of
      the infrared temperature measurement with uncertainty estimated at ±
      0.5°C. The test section size is about 1 meter square. The Infrared
      Thermography Laboratory is available to researchers outside of LBNL to
      solve scientific problems consistent with the facility's purpose.
      Testing is also available to window manufactures who are developing or
      proving major new products and design approaches; results are not to be
      used for commercialism.
