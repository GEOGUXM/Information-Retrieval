   General Instructions and Help

   [0.620c?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif] How does the registration
   work?

   First you need to register your company. If nobody at your company has
   registered the company yet, then you should do so from the OSDBU Home
   Page by pressing the "Register Company" button.
   The registration form has 2 parts: first is company information, then
   the first users information. You must register the first person when
   registering the company or the registration will not be complete.
   After you register the company, and the first person, then that person
   (usually you) will have the ability to add new accounts and change
   passwords or information on other people's accounts for your company
   only.

   ID and Password:
   .

   If your company is already registered and you would like to add new
   points of contact:
   1- Log in under an existing account at your company.
   2- Go to the OSDBU Services page (the page that comes up after you
   logged in successfully).
   3- Press "Examine Your Account" button on the top of the screen.
   4- Press the "Company Information" button at the top of the screen.
   5- On the company information screen, you can contact points for your
   company. It has to be done here so the new contact can be associated
   correctly with the company information.

   [0.6b9e?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif] If you already have a user ID
   and Password:
   .

   1- Press the "Login to your account" button
   2- Enter the ID and Password you registered with.
   3- From here you can view your account or a list of other people's
   accounts that are with your company. You can change other user's
   passwords within your company. If you have any problems contact the
   adminstrator of this system from the main page. Information about you
   and your company is sensitive and passwords must be maintained and
   controlled by you and your company.
   .

   [0.6fb6?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif] If you don't know your
   employer's DUNS number:
   .

   See your employer. All companies registering with OSDBU must have this
   number assigned by Dun & Bradstreet. If you cannot obtain this number,
   please return to the OSDBU Homepage and send an email to the
   administrator of this database (mailbox icon).
   .

   [0.72dc?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif] If your login name is already
   in use:
   .

   Put your middle name or initial
   OR
   Put a number appended at the end of your last name. For example: John
   Smith is taken, so list as John Smith2. This will ensure you are unique
   in the system. The primary identification for this system is your
   company's DUNS number, so your name can be changed this way. We are a
   popular site, this happens sometimes!
   .

   [0.763c?OpenElement&FieldElemFormat=gif] If you forgot your password or
   can't log in:
   .

   Contact the adminstrator of this system from the main page. Your
   account will have to be reset.
