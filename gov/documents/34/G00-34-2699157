                            LEGAL INTEREST RATES

                                 [line9.gif]

     Legal interest is determined by reference to Article 2924 of the
     Louisiana Civil Code. It changes every December 1 for the subsequent
     year. The rate is published in the Louisiana Register by the
     Commissioner of Financial Institutions and is based on a formula set
     forth in the Code. Interest rates for years prior to 1988 are set
     forth in the Article. Prior to 1988:

   (A) Prior to September 12, 1980, the rate shall be seven percent per
   annum.
   (B) On and after September 12, 1980, until September 11, 1981, the rate
   shall be ten percent per annum.
   (C) On and after September 11, 1981, until January 1, 1988, the rate
   shall be twelve percent per annum.

     The current year's (2000) rate is 7.285 percent per annum. Interest
     rates for the years falling between the current year and January 1,
     1988, are as folows:

                        1988 --- 9.75 1995 --- 8.75
                        1989 --- 11.5 1996 --- 9.75
                        1990 --- 11.5 1997* --- 9.25*
                        1991 --- 11.0 1998 --- 7.60
                        1992 --- 9.0  1999 --- 6.73
                        1993 --- 7.0  2000 --- 7.285
                        1994 --- 7.0  2001 --- 8.241

     * Interest for 1997: From January 1, 1997 until August 1, 1997, the
     rate was 9.25% per annum, and after August 1, 1997, and for the
     remainder of 1997, the interest rate was 7.9% per annum.
