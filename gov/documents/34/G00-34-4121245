                               VIOLENT CRIMES

   The Violent Crime/Major Offender's (VCMO) Program investigates
   violations of Federal Statutes involving violent crimes including Bank
   Robbery, Kidnapping, Fugitive Matters, Crimes in Indian Country and on
   Government Reservations, Crimes Against Children, Crimes Aboard
   Aircraft and certain Interstate Property Crimes among others.

   VCMO Agents provide investigative support to Indian Reservations in
   Colorado and Wyoming and serve as primary investigators for all crimes
   committed in Federal Penitentiaries. The FBI in Colorado Springs is the
   proponent for the Southern Colorado Fugitive Task Force, a group of
   Agents and Police Officers whose primary mission is the apprehension of
   violent fugitives in Southern Colorado. Denver FBI Agents work closely
   with local robbery investigators through the Colorado Association of
   Robbery Investigators (CARI) to identify and apprehend armed bank
   robbers.
