         Jinkui Zhao is the instrument scientist responsible for the design and
         construction of this instrument.

         At the SAS99 meeting in May of 1999, the small angle neutron scattering
         community gathered at Brookhaven to discuss the instrument needs of the
         community and the opportunities SNS would offer. An extended-Q range
         small angle scattering machine was proposed for SNS and an Instrument
         Advisory Team was formed.

         The following document contains more detailed information about the
         expected performance and design of the diffractometer:
         Extended Q-Range, High Precision, High Intensity Small Angle
