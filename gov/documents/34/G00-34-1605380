   SECTION I. GENERAL
       A.
       Purpose
       The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to EES-1
       personnel on the preparation of Hazard Control Plans (HCPs) for
       field work and standard operating procedures during the conduct of
       field operations to maximize the safety of EES-1 employees involved
       in field work. It supplements the EES Division HCP for Field
       Operations by providing specific Safe Work Practices requirements
       for EES-1 personnel.
       B.
       Hazards Associated with Field Work
       Many times field work is done under conditions in which accidents
       or serious problems are likely to occur if proper precautions are
       not taken. These conditions could result from one or more of the
       following: operations in remote areas; the presence of poisonous
       insects/snakes or large animals that may attack humans; hazardous
       terrain; sudden, unexpected changes in the weather; heat or cold
       exposure; vehicle breakdown; electrical storms; drilling
       operations; illness; and other conditions encountered in the field.
       Because potentially hazardous conditions and emergencies may occur
       in the field, the requirements and procedures outlined in Sections
       II, III, and IV, must be followed by all EES-1 employees and
       associated personnel. The Group Leader will review each field work
       HCP to evaluate its completeness, the hazards identified, and the
       hazard controls. The majority of the field activities performed by
       EES-1 personnel are routine in that they involve normal activities
       associated with geologic studies (collecting rock samples, geologic
       mapping, and the like) where the hazards are those a hiker or
       backpacker would be exposed to. The residual risk associated with
       such work is typically minimal. Higher risk field work includes
       operations that involve exposure to hazards where detailed HCPs and
       more robust emergency response procedures are required. Examples of
       higher risk activities are geothermal or CSDP coring operations
       where heavy equipment, high temperatures, or toxic gases are
       present; sample collections in active volcanic areas; and
       operations in foreign countries. The Group Leader will authorize
       all field operations plans with minimal to low residual risk. The
       EES Division Director will authorize all field work with medium
       residual risk and all field work in foreign countries regardless of
       the residual risk level.
       C.
       Compliance
       The Group Leader and supervisors have the responsibility of
       ensuring compliance with the procedures specified in this HCP;
       however, every individual conducting field work is ultimately
       responsible for his or her own safety.
       D.
       Field Work with Others
       Group members who are to perform field operations for other
       Laboratory organizations, federal or state government agencies, or
       private industries will adhere to the ES&H plan of that
       organization, a copy of which will be furnished to the Group Leader
       prior to commencing the work. The employee and Group Leader will
       review the plan and ensure that no Laboratory ES&H precautions have
       been overlooked or negated. If the organization does not have an
       ES&H plan, the employee will furnish a document that describes what
       they will be doing and the system in effect to protect them.
       Employees and other EES-1 personnel are reminded that safety is
       their responsibility and that any concerns they may have should be
       brought to the attention of the Group Leader. The Group Leader will
       not allow employee participation if the plan or document does not
       sufficiently cover ES&H issues.

                   SECTION II. ROUTINE DOMESTIC FIELD WORK

   A.
       Activities Prior to Departure
       The following actions must be taken before leaving to work in the
       field:
       1. Prepare a Hazard Control Plan

   a. Field workers will prepare a field hazard control plan (Type 1 or
       Type 2) in accordance with LIR300-00-01.1 (Safe Work Practices) and
       LIR300-00-02.1 (Safe Work Practices Documentation) as specified in
       Figure 1 (and a Missing Person Form if required), and submit it to
       the Group Office Administrator for the Group Leader's review and
       approval
       prior to leaving for the field. For projects that require frequent,
       repeated local trips to the same destination/site and hazards,
       submit a field HCP the first time out and during subsequent trips
       simply note on the sign-out board in the Group Office that a plan
       is on file. All persons doing local field work will sign out on the
       sign-out board in the Group Office and erase their name from the
       board when they return.
       The Personal Information form with the General, Physical
       Description, and Outdoor Experience Sections completed must be on
       file in the Group Office (Appendix C).
       [Image36.gif]
       Figure 1. Field HCP and buddy system requirements. (HCP = Hazard
       Control Plan; MPF = Missing Persons Form; NTS = Nevada Test Site;
       YM = Yucca Mountain). "Local" refers to Los Alamos County and
       nearby areas.

   c. Persons working in remote domestic areas and all foreign areas will
       complete the Missing Persons Information form and attach it to the
       field HCP (Appendix C), Parts 1, Area; 2, Equipment Carried; and 3,
       Clothing).
       d. Field workers at the NTS will prepare a routine domestic HCP
       (assuming the residual risk is minimal or low) and follow the
       procedures of Remote Area Operations (Nevada Test Site and Adjacent
       Areas) (Appendix D) and complete a "Safety Checklist for NTS/Nevada
       Remote Area Projects" (Appendix E). These should be submitted as
       shown on the distribution list at the bottom of the Safety
       Checklist form. See Section IV.
       2. Equipment
       Ensure the Government vehicle is equipped with the following items:
       A Guide to Your Interagency Fleet Management System Vehicle
       General Services Administration Motor Vehicle Accident Reporting
       Kit
       Fire extinguisher
       First aid kit
       Jack
       Cellular phone
       Shovel
       Spare tire
       Survival kit
       Windshield scraper
       Personal vehicles need to be equipped with the same set of
       equipment as Government vehicles plus a cellular phone when working
       outside Los Alamos County.
       When working in remote areas or foreign countries field workers
       will check out from the Group Office Administrator a survival kit
       (vehicle size, small pack size, or hypothermia kit) before going
       into the field.
       3. Training
       Each EES-1 employee (see Section I, B) who participates in field
       work must have first aid and CPR. Arrange for training by calling
       ESH-13 at 7-0059. In addition, the Group Leader may require
       survival training for participants in operations in remote areas
       where medical or emergency assistance is not readily available or
       in extreme weather conditions. Planning for Field Safety and How to
       Survive on Land and Sea are good books on this subject and are
       available in the Group Office. Additionally, as a minimum, each
       employee will be familiar with this document and the following:

   a. EES-1 Group ES&H Plan, Dec 99
       b. LIR201-00-04.0, Los Alamos National Laboratory Incident
       Reporting Process, 10 Feb 97
       c. LIR300-00-01.1, Safe Work Practices, 6 Oct 99
       d. LIR300-00-02.1, Documentation of Safe Work Practices, 6 Oct 99

   As applicable and appropriate, each employee will be familiar with "A
   Guide to Your Interagency Fleet Management System Vehicle" (located in
   the glove compartment of each Government vehicle).



   B.
   Activities During Routine Domestic Field Work (Other than the NTS)

   1. Remote Areas
   Field crews should exercise due caution when working in remote areas.
       Good work habits, as set forth in training, and accepted field
       procedures should be followed to ensure safe operations and the
       best chance of dealing with any emergencies should they arise. A
       primary concern for remote area operations is communication both
       for routine matters and emergencies (see below). Workers should be
       as self sufficient as possible. The proper clothing, equipment, and
       survival gear that is essential to a safe operation are the
       responsibility of each field worker.

   2. Buddy System
   Field work shall be conducted in teams of two or more persons. Use of
       this "buddy system" is mandatory unless the field worker is in
       two-way radio (or telephone) contact with a base station and has
       established a regular check-in schedule (at least every other day,
       unless a different schedule is established and approved by the
       Group Leader in advance). If work is being performed locally along
       a well maintained and frequently traveled federal, state, or county
       road (such as collecting samples at road cuts or from springs or
       streams along roadways), the buddy system or a radio is not
       required. Field trips connected with professional meetings, DOE
       briefings, student training, and the like where most participants
       are from industry, universities, or other organizations are not
       considered field work.

   3. Changes in Itinerary or Points of Contact
   Advise the Group Office of any changes in itinerary or points of
       contact before they occur.

   4. Check-in Schedule and Local Contacts
   Check in with the Group Office on the schedule outlined in the field
       work HCP. Whenever possible this will be every other day. If
       possible, inform someone locally each day (such as a motel
       employee) where you will be working and the time you expect to
       return. After each day's field work, let this person know when you
       have returned. Provide the contact with the telephone number of the
       Group Office, the home telephone numbers of the Group Leader and
       Deputy Group Leader, and the non-work hours number of the Emergency
       Management and Response Office (7-6211). Make arrangements for the
       contact to call one of those numbers if you do not return or report
       in within two (2) hours of your expected return time.

   5. Return Procedure
   Upon returning from field work, notify the contact person you
       designated on the field work HCP (this will normally be your
       supervisor) of your return. If during work hours, also notify the
       Group Office. When you realize that you are going to miss your
       estimated time of arrival (ETA) by more than two hours, call the
       Group Office or your contact to revise your ETA, if possible. If
       you do not return within two hours of your ETA, your contact person
       must notify the Group Leader or Deputy Group Leader, who will take
       action as outlined in Section D below. If the Group Leader or
       Deputy Group Leader cannot be located, the contact person must
       notify the Division Office or the Emergency Management and Response
       Office (7-6211).

   C.
   Vehicles

   1. Scheduling
   Use of Group vehicles is coordinated by the Group Office Administrator
       with priority to members of EES-1. Four-wheel drive vehicles should
       be used for off road travel in rough or sandy terrain and during
       inclement weather. Use of private vehicles is allowed if all safety
       and equipment requirements outlined in this SOP are met.

   2. Local Usage
   All Group vehicles are available for local use. The Group Office
       Administrator has a calendar in the Group Office on which vehicle
       reservations are recorded.

   3. Care and Maintenance
   If any defects that need repair are observed, notify the Group Office
       Administrator. When problems develop with Government vehicles
       outside Los Alamos County, follow A Guide to Your Interagency Fleet
       Management System Vehicle in the vehicle glove compartment.

   4. Fueling
   All vehicles will be returned with the gas tank at least one-half full.
       When gassing up use the U.S. Government Fleet Credit Card in the
       key holder and get a receipt for reimbursement that shows the
       license plate number and mileage. See the Quick Reference Guide To:
       Fueling GSA Vehicles in the glove compartment for detailed
       instructions. FILL WITH REGULAR UNLEADED FUEL ONLY at self-service
       pumps. If you fill a Government Vehicle with premium gasoline, you
       have to pay for it. Check the oil and water on each fill up.
       Make sure that the following information is clearly noted on the
       credit card sales tickets:

   Date
       Quantity of Fuel Purchase
       Other Items Purchased, such as oil
       Odometer Reading
       Type of Fuel
       Total Cost
       Signature

   When using your own vehicle, get receipts for gas and oil purchases.

   5. Seat Belts
   All persons in the vehicle must be in a seat and wearing a seat belt
       while on Laboratory business, whether in a Government or private
       vehicle.




   6. Fire Precautions
   Fire prevention/precautions must be taken when traveling off the road.
       Each vehicle must carry a fire extinguisher and shovel.

   7. Vehicle Breakdowns
   In the event of a breakdown in a Government vehicle, follow the
       appropriate instructions outlined in A Guide to Your Interagency
       Fleet Management System Vehicle in the vehicle glove compartment.
       For repairs costing more than $100.00 authorization must be
       obtained from the Maintenance Control Center at 1-888-622-6344. If
       traveling in a private vehicle, follow standard procedures of the
       private sector.

   8. Vehicle Accidents
   In the event you are in an accident in a Government vehicle, follow the
       instructions in the GSA Motor Vehicle Accident Reporting Kit found
       in the glove compartment.

   D.
   Emergency Actions

   When a field worker has not returned or reported in within two (2)
   hours of the expected time, the Group Leader or Deputy Group Leader or
   responsible manager shall:

   1. Verification
   Verify, insofar as possible, the known circumstances and conditions of
       the field worker's absence.

   2. Forms
   Having verified the absence of a field worker, complete either the
       Missing Person Information Form or the Accident/Incident Alert:
       Request for Help Form, whichever is appropriate.

   3. Notification

   a. Notify the EES Division Office of the situation and provide a
       completed copy of the appropriate form mentioned in "2" above with
       a recommendation of the action to be taken. Generally, this
       recommendation will involve contacting the agency responsible for
       search and rescue in the state where the individual is missing. In
       New Mexico, the State Police are in charge of search and rescue. In
       most other states the responsibility is delegated to the local
       sheriff.

   b. Notify S-8, Emergency Management and Response Office (7-6211).

   APPENDIX D (Remote Area Operations – Nevada Test Site and Adjacent
   Areas) to EES-1 HAZARD CONTROL PLANS AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
   FOR FIELD WORK

   REMOTE AREA OPERATIONS
       (NEVADA TEST SITE AND ADJACENT AREAS)

   1.0 INTRODUCTION

   These procedures are intended to inform Laboratory personnel involved
   in remote area operations at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and adjacent
   areas of coordinating requirements and support available to them for
   such projects.

   2.0 PURPOSE

   These procedures provide guidance for Laboratory personnel when
   planning, conducting and supporting activities away from their normal
   laboratory environment. They specify the minimum requirements and the
   support available to personnel to minimize the risks associated with
   field work in remote areas in Nevada.

   3.0 SCOPE

   These procedures provide supplemental guidance for Laboratory personnel
   conducting remote area operations in Nevada and are intended for use
   with existing Laboratory requirements provided in the Environment,
   Safety and Health Manual and in their specific organizational
   procedures.

   4.0 DEFINITIONS

   None

   5.0 RESPONSIBILITIES
   5.1 Los National Laboratory Test Office
       The Los Alamos Test Office is responsible for the conduct and
       safety of all Los Alamos employees and for all projects at the NTS
       sponsored by or that utilize assets from the Test Office in Nevada.
       5.2 DX-4, Nevada Operations Team
       The Test Office delegates to the DX-4 (Field Operations and
       Experiment Support Group) Nevada Operations Team the responsibility
       for all aspects of coordination involving remote area work at the
       NTS and adjacent areas.
       5.3 Line Management
       Line managers must ensure that all risks associated with the field
       work are minimized prior to allowing personnel to proceed with a
       project. Factors such as required training, remoteness of the
       location, availability of emergency response assets and the
       environment, to name a few, must be considered when approving a
       remote area operation.
       5.4 Project Leader
       The Project Leader is responsible for coordinating the planned
       activities with the appropriate Nevada support personnel with
       sufficient lead time so they may schedule the requested safety,
       security, logistical and other support as required.
       The Project Leader is also responsible for all team members
       complying with the requirements of this document.

   6.0 PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
   6.1 General Precautions
       Occurrences resulting from the conduct of operations in remote
       areas of the NTS have placed Laboratory personnel in potentially
       hazardous situations. Due to limited access and sometimes
       unavailability of emergency response equipment and personnel,
       possible range fires, radiological contamination, and
       meteorological conditions, it is essential that Laboratory
       personnel take extra- precautionary measures to assure their safety
       in a remote environment.
       6.2 Training
       Personnel planning to conduct operations on the NTS are required to
       view the DOE Security Awareness Video for the NTS initially and
       annual basis. Coordination for viewing this video can be made
       through Joint Test Organization (JTO) Travel Office at (702)
       295-6071.
       In addition to the security training mentioned above, a briefing
       for first-time field workers to the NTS is also required. This
       briefing covers additional security, ES&H, travel, and logistical
       requirements as well as other useful information peculiar to the
       NTS and adjacent areas in Nevada
       6.3 Environment
       The Nevada Test Site covers over 1,350 square miles of high desert
       terrain. Rugged basins, high mesas reaching 7,679 feet, and dry
       lake beds produce hot, dry summers and cold, dry winters.
       Temperatures, ranging from 110 to -14 degrees F, with very little
       annual rainfall, create extreme outdoor working conditions.
       Personnel should guard against exposure-related injuries.
       Changes in moisture levels of vegetation and wind patterns in the
       summer months will generally bring about increased range fire
       conditions. Extreme caution should be exercised when off-road
       driving is necessary.
       Treat all wildlife with proper caution. Animals, such as field
       mice, rabbits, and coyotes can carry parasites and dangerous
       diseases. Feeding wild animals on the NTS is prohibited. The Desert
       Tortoise, found throughout Nevada, is an endangered species. Be
       watchful for them and under no circumstances should you harass or
       intentionally cause harm to them.

       6.4 Remote Area Support
       By nature, field work in remote areas requires activities in areas
       removed or isolated from established facilities--in essence, where
       emergency support and medical assistance are not readily available.
       At the NTS, medical, fire, search and rescue services are
       moderately available. In areas adjacent to the NTS, similar
       services are available but limited. Longer response times must be
       anticipated. Survival and first aid kits are available at the JTO
       Travel Office.
       Two means of communication are mandatory for all field work at the
       NTS. Government vehicles are normally equipped with a two-way radio
       tied to the DOE radio network. Portable radios are available for
       issue and should be planned for pickup prior to beginning field
       operations. Contact DX-4 Operations at CP--45 in Area 6 for
       portable communications equipment. The DOE radio network is
       monitored 24 hours per day. Cellular telephone NTS and adjacent
       areas is limited to nonexistent. Personally-owned cellular
       telephones may not be taken into security areas without express
       permission of DOE. Government--owned cellular telephones may be
       carried into security areas, but must be turned off while in the
       area. Do not rely on a cellular telephone as a means of
       communication at the NTS. Periodic communication checks are
       required at planned intervals while remote area operations are
       being conducted. Failure to report within a reasonable period of
       time may result in the initiation of an emergency response.
       Off-road driving, for other than official purposes, is prohibited
       on the NTS. The NTS has a road network that supports most remote
       areas; however, field work may require experiment set-up off of
       these established roads. Four wheel drive vehicles are available
       for issue, as well as "pioneer tools" such as shovels, axes and
       picks. Fuel and water cans are also available for issue from the
       DX-4 Warehouse
       6.5 Radiological Hazards
       At the NTS, all four types of ionizing radiation may be
       encountered. Site specific radiological training is required to
       enter Radiological or Radiological Controlled Areas in Nevada.
       Dosimeters are available and can be obtained at the Badge Office at
       Gate 100 to the NTS. The Laboratory ALARA policy is also in effect.
       ESH-12 Group personnel are knowledgeable of areas on the NTS that
       may be radiologically contaminated. They may be contacted at (702)
       295-7620.
       Equipment and materials used or obtained on the NTS require
       screening for contamination prior to being removed from the NTS.
       RADSAFE procedures and support may be obtained by contacting the
       LANL Warehouse in Area 6, telephone (702) 295-3710.
       6.6 Security
       DOE has published a booklet entitled "NTS Security Rules and
       Regulations Handbook." It contains information on badging, items
       requiring a permit, prohibited items, searches, area access,
       barriers and barricades, special convoys, and property removal
       requirements. This booklet is available from DX-4, telephone (702)
       295-3400.
