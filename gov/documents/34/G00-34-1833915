                                  Sunspot Numbers

      In 1610, shortly after viewing the sun with his new telescope, Galileo
      Galilei made the first European observations of Sunspots. Daily
      observations were started at the Zurich Observatory in 1749 and with
      the addition of other observatories continuous observations were
      obtained starting in 1849. The sunspot number is calculated by first
      counting the number of sunspot groups and then the number of individual
      sunspots. The "sunspot number" is then given by the sum of the number
      of individual sunspots and ten times the number of groups. Since most
      sunspot groups have, on average, about ten spots, this formula for
      counting sunspots gives reliable numbers even when the observing
      conditions are less than ideal and small spots are hard to see. Monthly
      averages (updated monthly) of the sunspot numbers (25 kb GIF image),
      (37 kb postscript file), (62 kb text file) show that the number of
      sunspots visible on the sun waxes and wanes with an approximate 11-year
      cycle.

      (Note: there are actually at least two "official" sunspot numbers
      reported. The International Sunspot Number is compiled by the Sunspot
      Index Data Center in Belgium. The NOAA sunspot number is compiled by
      the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The numbers
      tabulated in spot_num.txt are the monthly averages (SSN) and standard
      deviation (DEV) derived from the International Sunspot Numbers)

                                The Maunder Minimum

      Early records of sunspots indicate that the Sun went through a period
      of inactivity in the late 17th century. Very few sunspots were seen on
      the Sun from about 1645 to 1715 (38 kb JPEG image). Although the
      observations were not as extensive as in later years, the Sun was in
      fact well observed during this time and this lack of sunspots is well
      documented. This period of solar inactivity also corresponds to a
      climatic period called the "Little Ice Age" when rivers that are
      normally ice-free froze and snow fields remained year-round at lower
      altitudes. There is evidence that the Sun has had similar periods of
      inactivity in the more distant past. The connection between solar
      activity and terrestrial climate is an area of on-going research.

                               The Butterfly Diagram

      Detailed observations of sunspots have been obtained by the Royal
      Greenwich Observatory since 1874. These observations include
      information on the sizes and positions of sunspots as well as their
      numbers. These data show that sunspots do not appear at random over the
      surface of the sun but are concentrated in two latitude bands on either
      side of the equator. A butterfly diagram (142 kb GIF image) (570 kb
      postscript file) (updated monthly) showing the positions of the spots
      for each rotation of the sun since May 1874 shows that these bands
      first form at mid-latitudes, widen, and then move toward the equator as
      each cycle progresses.

                            The Greenwich Sunspot Data

      The Royal Greenwich Observatory data has been appended with data
      obtained by the US Air Force Solar Optical Observing Network since
      1976. This newer data has been reformatted to conform to the older
      Greenwich data and both are available in a local directory of ASCII
      files. Each file contains records for a given year with individual
      records providing information on the daily observations of active
      regions.

                             Sunspot Cycle Predictions

      MSFC Solar Physics Branch members Wilson, Hathaway, and Reichmann have
      studied the sunspot record for characteristic behavior that might help
      in predicting future sunspot activity. Our current predictions of solar
      activity for the next few years can be found at this link. Although
      sunspots themselves produce only minor effects on solar emissions, the
      magnetic activity that accompanies the sunspots can produce dramatic
      changes in the ultraviolet and soft x-ray emission levels. These
      changes over the solar cycle have important consequences for the
      Earth's upper atmosphere.
