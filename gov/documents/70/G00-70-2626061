   OCC 2002-4 OCC Bulletin Subject: Community Reinvestment Act and Home
   Mortgage Disclosure Act Description: Year 2002 Mailing Address Date:
   January 17, 2002 TO: Chief Executive Officers and Compliance Officers
   of All National Banks, Department and Division Heads, and All Examining
   Personnel The purpose of this issuance is to inform all national banks,
   federal branches and agencies, and District of Columbia banks of the
   change of mailing address for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and Home
   Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data submissions, which are due March 1,
   2002. The Federal Reserve Board, which processes all national bank CRA
   and HMDA data, is changing the mailing addresses for these data due to
   heightened security concerns. This change is effective immediately.
   Because this change may delay receipt of the submissions, the Federal
   Reserve Board strongly encourages all CRA and HMDA data reporters to
   submit data via e-mail. To submit data electronically, the data files
   must be encrypted using the FFIEC's CRA and HMDA data entry software.
   This software may be downloaded from
   [http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/softinfo.htm] and
   [http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/softinfo.htm]. No other encryption software
   is acceptable. If you do not use the FFIEC software to collect and
   prepare your CRA and/or HMDA data, you must install the Internet
   Submission component of the data entry software on your computer and
   run the Internet Submission program against your CRA and/ or HMDA data
   file in order to properly encrypt the file. Help screens are available
   in both the FFIEC's CRA and HMDA data entry software applications to
   assist you with this process. Once the file is encrypted, you should
   attach the encrypted file to an e-mail message containing institution
   and contact information as described in the software help screens. For
   HMDA e-mail submissions, the message with attached file should be
   e-mailed to [hmdasub@frb.gov]. For CRA e-mail submissions, the message
   with attached file should be e-mailed to [crasub@frb.gov]. If you must
   send data via diskette, CD-ROM, or cartridge tape, the changed mailing
   addresses are: CRA: Federal Reserve Board Attention: CRA Processing
