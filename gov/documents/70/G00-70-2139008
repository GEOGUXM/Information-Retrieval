   The SOS'99 Nashville study continues the research of the Southern
   Oxidant Study (SOS) to provide a sound scientific foundation for
   pollution regulation and mitigation in the Southeastern United States.
   This campaign is intended to provide a better understanding of the
   basic chemical meteorological and transport processes that determine
   ozone and fine particle distributions and assist policymakers in
   devising optimal management strategies.

   ETL contributes to this study by
     * Using windprofilers to study the meteorological conditions
       responsible for the regional transport of pollutants.
     * Operating ground-based and airborne lidars which characterize the
       spatial distribution, time evolution and transport of ozone and
       aerosols.
