Recycled Product Trade Show

   Trade show logo 3rd Annual Recycled Product Trade Show
   April 4-5, 2002
   Disneyland® Hotel, Anaheim

   The Board's annual Recycled Product Trade Show is a unique opportunity
   for product suppliers, state and local government staff, and private
   sector buyers to meet and discuss recycled-content products. At this
   expanded two-day show, exhibitors will have an audience of more than
   2,000 curious buyers who are eager to learn about the wide variety of
   quality, cost-effective recycled-content products. And the California
   Integrated Waste Management Board's (CIWMB) Trade Show is a bargain to
   both attendees and exhibitors!
