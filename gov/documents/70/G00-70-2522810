           Argonne's metal nanofluids can dramatically enhance the
           thermal conductivity of conventional heat transfer fluids and
                                    flow
              smoothly in microchannel passages. Bright-field transmission
    electron microscope (TEM) micrograph of copper nanoparticles produced
                  by direct evaporation in ethylene glycol.
