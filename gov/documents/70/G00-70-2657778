    The Goddard Space Flight Center's ATS Group supports the development
     and implementation of mission concepts by identifying frequent and
     affordable opportunities for access to space and advocating changes
   that reduce the cost of access. Through partnerships with all potential
   space access suppliers, the ATS Group supports the efficient use of all
   access modes and facilitates the exchange of ideas between customer and
     supplier. This interaction supports NASA's continuing drive to make
         space accessible to everyone whose dreams take them there.
             **************************************************
   The Access to Space group has formulated it's Stategic Plan and it was
       signed by Mr. Diaz (Director, GSFC) on 10/22/98. The ATS group
     co-sponsored a Rideshare conference with the NRO's Office of Space
    Launch on April 15th and 16th of this year. Attendees and presenters
       represented all aspects of the Access to Space community. This
    conference will be held annually. Next year's conference will be held
    sometime in the last two weeks of April and will be hosted at a site
   local to the Goddard Space Flight Center. Proceedings from this year's
    conference will be available sometime in the January 2000 timeframe.
