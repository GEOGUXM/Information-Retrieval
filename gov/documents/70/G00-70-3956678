    Free Health Information for Hispanic Seniors Offered by the National
                             Institute on Aging

     Reliable information on diabetes, cancer, stroke, high blood
     pressure, HIV/AIDS, sleep problems, medicines, forgetfulness,
     weather-related health hazards, and foot care is now available in
     Spanish from the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Eleven new Age
     Pages describe how to recognize and treat these conditions, which
     are common in older people, and provide up-to-date addresses and
     telephone numbers for further help.

     The free, science-based leaflets are written for older people but
     also are useful to family members and health professionals who care
     for older adults. The award-winning Age Pages have been carefully
     adapted into Spanish and tested in community centers with older
     Hispanics.

     The NIA has pledged to make health information available to minority
     elders a vital part of its 5-year strategic plan. In 2000, there
     were 1.9 million Hispanic adults age 65 and older in the U.S., a
     number that is expected to increase rapidly, according to the Census
     Bureau.

     For single or bulk copies of these Age Pages, call the NIA
     Information Center weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. est.
     toll free at 1-800-222-2225 or TTY 1-800-222-4225. An information
     specialist is available to respond to inquiries in Spanish.

     The NIA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services
     National Institutes of Health, is the lead Federal agency supporting
     and conducting biomedical, social, and behavioral research and
     training related to aging and the diseases and special needs of
     older people.
