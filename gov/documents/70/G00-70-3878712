                   GOES-M STATUS last update 30 December 2001

Spacecraft

   In late 2000, GOES-M spacecraft completed construction and testing at
   Space Systems/Loral in Palo Alto, California. The GOES-M spacecraft has
   a number of technical upgrades to improve orbit-and-attitude control
   for image stability. The GOES-M launch date was planned for Sunday, 15
   July 2001, but delayed until 22 July to replace and retest a rocket
   controller.

Imager

   Imager SN07 was constructed and tested at ITT in Fort Wayne, Indiana in
   the late 1990's. It was delivered to SS/Loral and integrated onto
   GOES-M in 2000. There are no significant issues with the Sounder. The
   GOES-M Imager will have some changes in the wavelength and spatial
   resolution of two channels:
     * The 6.7 micron water vapor channel (number 3) will have a 4 km
       footprint instead of 8 km.
     * The 12 micron water vapor channel (number 5) will be moved to 13
       microns and given a 8 km footprint instead of 4 km to determine
       cloud cover.

Sounder

   Sounder SN07 was constructed and tested at ITT in Fort Wayne, Indiana
   in the late 1990's. It was delivered to SS/Loral and integrated onto
   GOES-M in 2000. There are no significant issues with the Sounder.

SXI

   A Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) prototype has been built by NASA-MSFC. The
   SXI flys on GOES-M's solar panel to provide soft x-ray images of the
   Sun minute-by-minute to warn of solar flare activity.

       (SEC)
     * Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) at NASA-MSFC
     * Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) for GOES-NOPQ
     * SXI archives

Launch & Storage

   GOES-M was assembled and tested by Space Systems/Loral during
   1997-2000. After one week's delay to replace a faulty controller in the
   wecond stage rocket, and one day's delay to double check the systems
   after lighning struck an adjacent launch pad, GOES-M was launched on 23
   July 2001. There was 3 months of on-orbit testing, and then on-orbit
   cold storage as GOES-12. GOES-M is nominally planned as the replacement
   for GOES-10 (GOES-WEST) circa 2004, but it may be called up earlyier to
   replace GOES-8 as GOES-EAST at 75W, in order to get solar data from the
   unique SXI instrument during the waning years of the solar cycle.

   If GOES-M were stored on the earth, it would have to be to be called
   out of storage to replace an on-orbit failure. There would be 9 to 12
   months of preparation between call-up and launch, followed by 3 months
   of post-launch deployment and testing before it could become
   operational. On-orbit storage reduces this delay to less than a week,
   and avoids the chance of a launch failure when you can least afford it.

Orbit Raising History

   GOES-M suffered overheating of the built-in third-stage rocket designed
   to circularize the orbit by three successive burns totalling 90 minutes
   of 100-lb thrust at apogee near geosynchronous altitude. Instead, the
   satellite was raised by nine 11-minute burns at apogee. Here is the
   day-by-day history of those manuevers, as they happened (most recent
   first).

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (21 August):

Orbit raising activities were officially completed tonight  (August 20)
with the successful execution of TMF #3.  This final TMF parked GOES-12
at a 90 degree west station longitude.  The total burn duration was 65.2
seconds and was executed with no problems.  Following the maneuver, the
spacecraft was then returned back to a stationkeeping control mode and
then transitioned back to normal on-orbit V1 mode at 0230z.  DIRA 2
(gyros) which have been on since launch, were turned off following V1
mode transition and will remain off until the next maneuver. The XRP was
then slewed back to Sun.   This was also the final night for scan mirror
contamination avoidance. Communications subsystem PLTs continue to be
performed at CDA during evening shifts.  All activities were
successfully completed without incident.

Activities for GOES-12 for August 19 were highlighted with a successful
TMF#2.    The execution of TMF#2 contained two separate Thruster Fire
burns. The maneuver was conducted in two separate firings due to east
face thruster firing constraints using the on-board propellent
management device which constrains total contiguous thruster on times to
37 seconds.  The first Thruster Fire Command procedure was initiated at
13:49:40Z with a duration of approximately 26 seconds.  This burn was
successful and all parameters remained within limits. The second
Thruster Fire of TMF#2 occurred approximately 15 minutes later at
14:05:40Z.  This burn lasted approximately 25.5  seconds with all
parameters again remaining within limits. Following the completion of
TMF#2, GOES-11 was transitioned back to Normal On-Orbit V mode at
14:34:00Z.  The XRP was then slewed back to Sun (18.8 degrees).
All events performed nominally.

Activities for August 17 were highlighted with the GOES-12 First
Full-disk Image.  This image can be found at /www.osei.noaa.gov/>
.    TMF #1 and normal V mode configuration were also successfully
performed today. Trim Maneuver #1 was the first translation maneuver on
GOES-12 to be performed using the attitude thrusters.   The execution of
TMF#1 occurred at 01:57:57z and lasted approximately 20 seconds.
Following the completion of the burn GOES-12 was transitioned to Pitch
Earth Acq Mode.  The  Reaction Wheel was turned off with Momentum Wheel
#1 then being spun-up to the V mode configuration at approximately
02:00z.  MW#1 stabilized nominally at 2900 RPM.  Transition to Normal
On-Orbit V-mode (with both momentum wheel #1 and #2 at 2900 RPM) from
Stationkeeping mode occurred at 02:45Z.  The XRP was then slewed back to
the operational position.   All events performed nominally.

All other telemetry parameters remained within limits throughout the events.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (14 August)

GOES-12 activities for Imager/Sounder initialization, L2 Wheels spin-up
and Solar Sail deployment executed extremely smoothly.  Command Units #1
and #2 were configured to secure mode and the sensor data transmitter
was turned on in preparation for Imager/Sounder initialization.   The
sounder was successfully initialized at 5:08pm EDT.   The reaction wheel
(RW) was commanded on at 5:50pm EDT and Momentum wheel (MW) #2 commanded
on at 6:00pm EDT and spun up to 5350 RPM in preparation for the Solar
Sail Deployment.  The Imager was successfully initialized at 6:25pm EDT.
 CDA Sensor Processing System (SPS) successfully processed and recorded
wide-band data throughout both imager and sounder initializations.

The Solar Sail was successfully deployed at 7:-13pm EDT.  The deployment
took approximately 14.5 minutes to complete.  Just prior to the
deployment, the CDA transmitter was configured to transmit dwell
telemetry for indication of Solar Sail 3-inch status.  All solar sail
release and deployment switches indicated a successful deployment.

Shortly after the deployment, operations engineers enthusiastically
executed command sequences to isolate the MST.  Normal on-orbit L-2 mode
(MW #2 and RW used for control) was successfully commanded at 8:30pm EDT
and the Solar Array put into run mode.  The XRS was deployed and was
aligned to the sun-line within .1 degree in the east/west direction as
measured by the SAS.  The spacecraft will stay in L-2 configuration with
MW #2 at 4500 rpm until TMF#1 on August 17, at which time the spacecraft
will be configured to V1 mode (both MW#1 and #2 on and at 2900 RPM, RW
off).   Imager/Sounder scan mirror contamination avoidance activities
will continue for the next 7 nights.

During this evenings activities, the SAS cooled enough to toggle the
yellow low limit at 30 degrees C (still considerably higher than the 36
degrees C red low limit).  This was consistent with what was observed
for GOES-9, 10, and 11.   SAS temperatures quickly returned to normal
following XRS turn-on and slew.  All other telemetry parameters remained
within limits throughout the event.

The SXI UV lamp continues to be cycled on/off every hour for
approximately 5 minute on-time durations.  After tonight this will be
made part of the daily ops schedule.

GOES-12 will now start Post-Launch Testing!

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (13 August)

GOES-M was officially renamed to GOES-12 today.

Dipole estimation maneuvers were successfully performed today.   The
Dipole maneuvers were performed for final determination of the
spacecrafts magnetic field for future correction of magnetometer data.
The maneuver was conducted in roll, pitch, and yaw axes, and was
entirely uneventful.  Worst case DOD during the pitch maneuver was
approximately 24%  (as predicted).  As part of the Dipole maneuver the
solar array was successfully slewed 90 degrees in the reverse direction
(2 X 45 degree slews) and slewed 90 degrees back in the forward
direction to the original 270 index position.  At completion of the
Dipole estimation activities the spacecraft was commanded back to Normal
Sun Acq mode.

All telemetry parameters remained within limits.

The SXI UV lamp continues to be cycled on/off every hour for
approximately 5 minute on-time durations.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (12 August):

On August 12, 2001, GOES-M successfully achieved a series of milestones
with the AAM part 2, final deployment of the magnetometer boom and solar
array, and SXI turn on.

AAM part 2 was executed at 9:47am EDT.  This maneuver was performed at
perigee 28.  The burn lasted exactly 45.5 seconds.  The Main Spacecraft
Thruster (MST) flange temperature reached 104 degrees C.  The JPL/DSN
Goldstone 34 meter antenna (D27) was used as the primary commanding site
for this maneuver.  This maneuver reduced the apogee by 950 km.  Current
station location is 91 degrees West longitude and drifting approximately
.4 degrees per day.  The orbital period is a near nominal 24 hours.  All
telemetry parameters remained well within limits throughout this
maneuver.

The spacecraft was then configured to DIRA Attitude Reference (DREF)
mode in preparation for Magnetometer Boom deployment.  Magnetometer 1
turn-on occurred at 10:00am EDT.  In-flight magnetometer calibration was
then performed and valid data receipt verified.  DIRA rates observed
during the deployment (10:06am EDT) were nominal and consistent with the
GOES-11 magnetometer deployment signature.

The spacecraft was then slewed to S/A deployment attitude.  Notch
filters #1&2 were enabled prior to the SA deployment.  SA phase 1
outboard panel deployment was executed at 10:45am EDT in DREF mode.
Attitude transients experienced were nominal.  A series of yaw
reorientations were performed to warm the solar array hinges while
keeping adequate T&C coverage.   Solar Array Phase 2 deployment sequence
was successfully executed at 11:33am EDT.  Battery DOD reached 24.1%,
which was slightly lower than GOES-L.  The Trim Tab was slewed back to
120 degrees.  SXI was successfully commanded on at 11:51am EDT following
solar array phase 2 deployment.  The SXI was powered on to maintain
thermal constraints on the instrument.  In addition, the SXI UV lamp
will be cycled on every hour (for a 5 minute duration) then turned-off
to ensure the UV lamp stays within thermal limits.  Spacecraft bus and
payload heaters were then configured for transfer orbit.  Power amps A &
C were also turned on to provide heating as well.

After returning to Normal Sun Acq mode the SA was briefly placed in run
mode to verify solar array drive motor (10 minutes forward and 10
minutes reverse motion) for a total of 2.5 degrees each direction.   In
addition, the solar array was slewed 30 degrees in a reverse direction
and slewed back to the original 270 degree position.  The slew test was
performed in preparation for tonight's Off-axis Sun Acq. mode entrance
which will require a 30 degree solar array slew to sun-line normal to
prevent excessive SAS cooling.  Magnetometer  #2 was powered on and
calibrated to verify proper operation then reconfigured back to
Magnetometer #1.


Again, the MST will not be permanently isolated until Tuesday evening
following the Solar Sail deployment.  The orbit will be circularized
into the final orbit over the next week through a series of 3 trim
maneuvers using the 5 lb attitude thrusters.

All other telemetry parameters remained within limits.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (11 August):

Part 1 of the GOES-M Apogee Adjust Maneuver (AAM) was successfully
executed today, Saturday, August 11, at 9:29am EDT.  This maneuver was
performed at perigee 27.  The burn lasted 4 minutes and 25 seconds.  The
Main Spacecraft Thruster (MST) flange temperature reached 182 degrees C.
The Goldstone 26 meter antenna was used as the primary commanding site
for this maneuver.  This maneuver reduced the apogee by 6024 km and the
orbital period decreased to a near nominal 24 hours.  All telemetry
parameters remained well within limits throughout the entire maneuver.
The spacecraft was configured back into normal sun acquisition mode. Off
Axis Sun Acquisition will be commanded in the back orbits in order to
reduce telemetry and command nulls.  The MST will be permanently
isolated on Tuesday evening following the Solar Sail deployment.  The
orbit will be circularized into the final orbit over the next week
through a series of 3 trim maneuvers using the 5 lb attitude thrusters.

The next maneuver, AAM, Part 2 is scheduled for Sunday, August 12, at
9:49am EDT, and will have a burn duration of .75 minutes.  Following AAM
Part 2, the MB and SA deployments will occur as scheduled below.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (August 9):

Our ninth, and final, Apogee Maneuver Firing (AMF #9) was successfully
executed today, Thursday, August 9, at 1:47pm EDT.  The burn lasted 6
minutes and 15 seconds- 375 seconds in total.  The Main Spacecraft
Thruster (MST) flange temperature reached 201 degrees C, well below the
abort criteria limit.  The flange temperature profile tracked that of
the previous burns.  Following this maneuver the spacecraft was
configured back to a normal sun acquisition mode.  All subsystems are
safe and remain well within limits.  Off Axis Sun Acquisition will be
commanded during back orbits in order to reduce telemetry and command
nulls.  This maneuver raised perigee approximately 6168 km and increased
the orbital period to approximately 27 hours.  The orbit after AMF#9
will actually be slightly super-synchronous, and won't be GEO until
after the AAMs.  The last MST firings will occur at perigee during the
upcoming AAMs which will be performed this weekend.

The next maneuver, AAM, part 1 is scheduled for Saturday, August 11, at
9:29am EDT, with a burn duration of 4.67 minutes

Other Significant Activities

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (August 7):

Our eighth Apogee Maneuver Firing (AMF #8) was successfully executed
today, Tuesday,  August 7, 2001 at 1:37pm EDT.  The burn lasted 8
minutes and 35 seconds- 515 seconds in total.  The Main Spacecraft
Thruster (MST) flange temperature reached 231 degrees C, well below the
abort criteria limit.  The flange temperature profile tracked that of
AMF#7.  Following this maneuver the spacecraft was configured back to a
normal sun acquisition mode and will remain in this mode until the next
maneuver.  All subsystems are safe and remain well within limits.  The
maneuver raised perigee approximately 6724 km and increased the orbital
period to approximately 24 hours.

1 AMF remains in order to achieve geosynchronous orbit.

The next maneuver, AMF #9, is planed for Thursday, August 9, at 1:46pm
EDT, with a burn duration of 6.25 minutes

Other Significant Activities

Prior to the actual burn the JPL/DSN 26-Meter Subnet, D16, experienced a
CPA (Command Processor Assembly) failure.  Commanding was immediately
switched over to NASA Wallops where burn execution was successfully
performed.  A fail-over to the backup CPA at D16 was performed post
AMF#7.  Handover back to D16 ensued and successful commanding was
performed.  A trouble report has been initiated by the DSN regarding
this D16 CPA issue.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (July 26):

Our second Apogee Maneuver Firing (AMF) #2 was executed today.  The burn lasting
 11 minutes, 55 seconds was terminated approximately 4.5 seconds early due to th
e Main Spacecraft Thruster (MST) flange temperature exceeding its 260 degree abo
rt criteria limit.  The flange temperature profile during this burn was nearly i
dentical to the first AMF.  Following this maneuver the spacecraft was configure
d back to a normal sun acquisition mode and will remain in this mode until the n
ext maneuver.  All subsystems are safe and remain well within limits.  The maneu
ver raised perigee approximately 1500 km and increased the orbital period to app
roximately 14 hours.

A meeting was conducted following the maneuver with spacecraft manufacturer, NAS
A and NOAA project management, and operations personnel to analyze AMF data and
to finalize future AMF sequence plans.  As a result, the plan is to continue to
perform shorter and more frequent AMFs on the order of 11 to 12 minutes in durat
ion.  A total of 9 or 10 AMFs will now be required to achieve geosynchronous orb
it.

The next maneuver is planned for Saturday, July 28, at 10:47pm EDT (DOY 210 @ 02
47z).

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (July 25):

Apogee Maneuver Firing (AMF) #1 was terminated early today by ground
command when the Main Spacecraft Thruster (MST) flange temperature
exceeded its 260 degree abort criteria limit.  The burn was terminated
approximately 13 minutes into a scheduled 53 minute burn.  The flange
temperature is used to give an indication of the thruster valve
temperature trends that will be experienced as a result of soakback
following maneuver completion.  The spacecraft was configured back to a
normal sun acquisition mode following the abort command with no
problems.  All subsystems are safe and remain well within limits.

Shortly after achieving Sun Acquisition, engineers and flight dynamics
personnel convened a meeting to start discussing AMF re-plans that will
be implemented over the next several days.   Preliminary analysis and
results from the meeting indicate that the only impact to the mission
timeline will be to conduct shorter more frequent AMFs over the next
several days to raise the orbit to a geostationary altitude.   Mission
planners are in the process of scheduling ground station and network
resources to accommodate the additional maneuvers.    Additional
meetings will be conducted on a Thursday to finalize AMF plans.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS TIMELINE:

A meeting was held earlier today to discuss AMF re-planning efforts
resulting from this morning's AMF#1 Abort.  With both NASA ad NOAA
management on hand it was determined that a 12 minute AMF#2 burn will be
executed tomorrow, July 26th, at 3:24pm EDT.  Data from this AMF#2 burn
will then be analyzed against not only the aborted GOES-M AMF#1 burn,
but also the AMF burn data observed during the previous GOES missions.
Upon completion of their analyses, the engineering staff from NASA,
NOAA, and SS/L will then recommend to NASA and NOAA management the
subsequent AMF burn scenario/timeline to safely raise the GOES-M
satellite orbit to a geostationary altitude.

Mission planners are actively in the process of re-scheduling the ground
station and network resources to accommodate this maneuver.  Additional
meetings will be conducted on an as needed basis in order to optimize
the overall AMF plan.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES (July 23):

GOES-M was successfully launched at 204/072301z.  Apogee was approximately 25 km
low- overall an excellent ride from the Atlas/Centaur.   Following separation
the sequence of command activities leading up to solar array deployment were
successfully executed with a maximum DOD of 22% on the batteries well below the
60% maximum allowable DOD and consistent with GOES-9, GOES-10, and GOES-11
launches.   Initial acquisitions at Diego Garcia, Perth, and Canberra occurred
close to predicts.   Three-way doppler between Diego Garcia and Canberra was
successfully processed by Flight Dynamics to aid in quickly determining a
post-separation orbit.

Initial commanding was performed through Diego to initialize the Attitude and
Orbit Control Electronics (AOCE #1), vent the propellant lines, perform 300 msec
thruster firings using the primary thrusters, command an off-axis sun
acquisition, and deploy the solar array outer panel.  All command sequences were
performed flawlessly and the spacecraft responded as expected.  Following solar
array deployment, a command hand-over to Canberra was performed and two-way
ranging was initiated to provide Flight Dynamics range data to accurately
determine a post-launch orbit.  Following command handover, the trim tab was
slewed 180 degrees away from the solar array panel.    As the spacecraft
approached first apogee, intermediate attitude thruster control modes required
from AMFs were all successfully exercised.   Following first apogee the side-B
thrusters were exercised by performing 200 msec individual thruster firings with
the spacecraft in a sun acquisition mode.  The launch script was completed two
hours ahead of schedule.   The spacecraft will remain in a normal sun
acquisition mode until preparation for  a 4th apogee maneuver firing scheduled
for Tuesday evening.
