                      OHIO'S INTERNET PORTAL PRIVACY NOTICE

     The Ohio Internet Portal, a service provided by the Department of
     Administrative Services, recognizes the importance of privacy to our
     web site visitors. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the following
     information.
     PUBLIC RECORDS

     Visitors should be aware that, subject to certain statutory exceptions,
     most documents and records maintained by the state of Ohio, including
     but not limited to electronic data, are public records under Ohio law.
     Therefore, information submitted through this web site may be subject
     to disclosure pursuant to a public records request.
     USAGE STATISTICS

     In order to generate usage statistics to help us improve our web site,
     we automatically collect certain information on every visitor to the
     web site. However, this information does not disclose "personal
     identifiers" (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address,
     etc.). Each time a request is made to view a page within this web site,
     our web site creates a log file capturing generic user information.
     Examples of this type of information includes the type of Internet
     browser or computer operating system you are using, the date and time
     you accessed this site, the Internet protocol address of the individual
     computer (or proxy server) making the request, and the Internet address
     of the site from which you may have linked to this site.

     All information collected by way of server log files is used in
     aggregate form only, and may be analyzed for trends and statistics.
     ONLINE FORMS AND E-MAIL

   This web site will not collect personally identifiable information
   (such as name, address, telephone number, etc.) unless you provide such
   information voluntarily. We may ask for such information so that we can
   tailor interactive features of this web site to your specific interests
   and needs (including periodically forwarding information that matches
   your selected interests). You are free to provide or not to provide the
   requested information. If you choose not to provide this type of
   information, you can still visit most of the web site, but you may be
   unable to participate in certain online forums. Any personal
   information voluntarily provided by visitors, including personal
   information submitted on online forms and e-mail, will be used for the
   purposes stated on the web page and may also be shared with other
   agencies as required by law or pursuant to agency authority.
   Information submitted through this web site also may be subject to
   disclosure pursuant to a public records request.
   WEB COOKIES

   Visitors who submit information via this web site should be aware that
   data linking your computer to this web site (a "cookie") may be
   created. Temporary cookies may be used when necessary to complete a
   transaction, to process data submitted to us online or to facilitate
   ongoing Internet interaction. Information collected on our web sites,
   including cookies, may also be subject to disclosure pursuant to a
   public records request.
   SECURITY MEASURES

   We take very seriously the integrity of the information and systems
   that we maintain. Therefore, we have instituted security measures for
   all information systems under our control. These security measures are
   designed to identify attempts to tamper with this web site. Information
