                       News from Senator John Edwards

                       NORTH CAROLINA HEALTH CARE AND
                EDUCATION PROJECTS WIN FINAL SENATE APPROVAL

     December 20, 2001

   WASHINGTONÂ–The Senate on Thursday voted 90 - 7 for a $123 billion
   package of education, health and labor programs that allocates funding
   for schools, health care and medical research throughout North
   Carolina.

   North Carolina public schools are expected to receive $212 million
   under the legislation's formula for distributing assistance to
   elementary and secondary schools. In addition, $250,000 is set aside
   for technology programs at North Carolina Community colleges. Another
   $800,000 is provided to continue a highly successful Reading Together
   USA program administered by the University of North Carolina at
   Greensboro to teach second graders reading skills. The bill allots
   $250,000 for technology grants to rural schools under a program
   sponsored by the North Carolina Electronics and Information
   Technologies Association.

   The North Carolina Museum of Art will receive $100,000 and $150,000
   will go to the Museum of Life and Science, both in Raleigh. In
   addition, $440,000 was set aside for Discovery Place to help the
   Charlotte museum expand its science exhibitions and programs. The Rocky
   Mount Children's Museum is allotted $100,000. North Carolina aquariums
   will share a $440,000 contribution to a drive to raise $6 million for a
   major expansion program and new exhibits.

   The measure that President Bush is expected to sign is dotted with
   other specific health care and education projects in North Carolina.
   They include $1 million for feeding some 1,200 homebound senior
   citizens in Mecklenburg County. The same bill sets aside $300,000 for
   Carolinas Medical Center at Charlotte to develop a computer system to
   monitor drug prescriptions that will eliminate paperwork and reduce
   mistakes.

   Another $250,000 was set aside for Project Access in Buncombe County to
   support the award-winning partnership of public and private hospitals,
   physicians, pharmacies and other organizations that provide health care
   for low-income families without insurance. The measure also authorized
   support for expanding the Olson Huff Center for Child Development at
   the Ruth and Billy Graham Children's Health Center in Asheville.

   Durham County Hospital will receive assistance for operating clinics at
   three public schools that serve low-income neighborhoods, and to
   enhance Lincoln Community Health Center services for the area's
   rapidly-growing Hispanic population. The University of North Carolina
   School of Public Health also is in line for federal support for
   construction of a new laboratory, research and teaching facility.

                         Complete list of projects.
