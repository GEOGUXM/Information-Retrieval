   The District's Speakers Bureau coordinates staff experts and

   business groups, or to address professional, governmental or technical
   groups on a variety of issues. [dotclear.gif]
          Staff from the District's Service Centers and/or the Big Cypress
   Basin will work to respond to requests for speakers or presenters. In
   many cases, Spanish-speaking presenters can appear before your group.
   If possible, please make your request for a District Speaker 2-6 weeks
   in advance. With your request, please be sure to include your name,
   address, and a phone number or e-mail address where you can be reached.
