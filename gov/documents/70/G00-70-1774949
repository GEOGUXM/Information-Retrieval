   Statement of Dan L. Crippen Director The Budget and Economic Outlook:
   Fiscal Years 2003-2012 before the Committee on the Budget U.S. House of
   Representatives January 23, 2002 This document is embargoed until 2:00
   p.m. (EST), Wednesday, January 23, 2002. c The ontents may not be
   published, transmitted, or otherwise commu- nicated by any print,
   broadcast, or electronic media before that time. Mr. Chairman,
   Congressman Spratt, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to be
   here today to discuss the current outlook for the budget and the
   economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will release its report
   on that topic, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2003-2012,
   on January 31. My testimony today will summarize that report. The
   economic recession and recent laws have combined to sharply reduce the
   budget surpluses projected a year ago. In January 2001, CBO projected
   that under the laws and policies then in force, the federal government
   would run surpluses in fiscal years 2002 through 2011 totaling $5.6
   trillion.1 In CBO's new projections, that cumulative surplus has fallen
   to $1.6 trillion-a drop of $4 trillion (see Table 1 on page 7). About
   60 percent of that decline results from legislation-the tax cuts
   enacted in June and additional discretionary spending-and from its
   effect on the cost of paying interest on the federal debt. Changes in
   the economic outlook and various technical revisions since last January
   account for the other 40 percent of that decline. For both 2002 and
   2003, CBO now projects that, instead of surpluses, the total bud- get
   will show small deficits, if current policies remain the same and the
   economy follows the path that CBO is forecasting. In 2001, by contrast,
   the federal govern- ment recorded a surplus of $127 billion (see Table
   2). The deficit projected for this year-$21 billion-represents a change
   of more than $300 billion from last January's projection. Over 70
   percent of that reduction results from the weak economy and related
   technical factors, which have considerably low- ered the revenues
   expected for this year and next. For the current 10-year projection
   period, 2003 through 2012, CBO estimates a total surplus of nearly $2.3
   trillion. However, almost half of that total comes from the surpluses
   projected for 2011 and 2012-the last two years of the projection period
   and thus the most uncertain. The surpluses for those years also reflect
   the scheduled expiration in December 2010 of the tax cuts enacted last
   June. In CBO's new baseline, the off-budget accounts (which reflect the
   spending and revenues of Social Security and the Postal Service) run
   surpluses throughout the projection period. In the on-budget accounts,
   by contrast, surpluses do not reemerge until 2010. 1. That projection
   appeared in Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic
   Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002- 2011 (January 2001). CBO's baseline
   projections are intended to serve as a neutral benchmark against which
   to measure the effects of possible changes in tax and spending
   policies. They are constructed according to rules set forth in law and
   long-standing practices and are designed to project federal revenues
   and spending under the assumption that current laws and policies remain
   unchanged. Thus, these projections will almost certainly differ from
   actual budget totals: the economy may not follow the path that CBO
   projects, and lawmakers are likely to alter the nation's tax and
   spending policies. Therefore, CBO's baseline should be viewed not as a
   forecast or prediction of future budgetary outcomes but simply as the
   agency's best judgment of how the economy and other factors will affect
   federal revenues and spending under current law. THE BUDGET OUTLOOK If
   current policies remain in place, CBO projects, the budget will be in
   deficit for the next two years. Those deficits are expected to be quite
   small, amounting to only 0.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic
   product (GDP) in 2002 and 0.1 percent of GDP in 2003. After that,
   surpluses are projected to reemerge and gradually increase. For the
   five years from 2003 through 2007, CBO projects a cumulative surplus of
   $437 billion. That figure represents off-budget surpluses totaling more
   than $1 trillion offset by on-budget deficits that add up to $617
   billion. For the 10-year period through 2012, the total budget surplus
   under current policies is projected to approach $2.3 trillion. Again,
   that amount is made up of surpluses in Social Security ($2.5 trillion)
   offset by a cumulative on-budget deficit ($242 billion). Without the
   scheduled expiration of tax-cut provisions in 2010, the total 10-year
   budget surplus would fall to $1.6 trillion. The total surplus is
   projected to equal 1 percent of GDP by 2006 and grow to 3.7 percent of
   GDP by 2012. Estimates of large surpluses should be viewed cautiously,
   however, because future economic developments and estimating
   inaccuracies could change the outlook substantially. In addition,
   future legislative actions are almost certain to alter the budgetary
   picture. Changes in the Past Year As an illustration of how quickly the
   budget outlook can change, CBO's projection of the cumulative surplus
   for 2002 through 2011 has plunged by $4 trillion in just 2 one year
   (see Table 1).2 Some $2.4 trillion of that drop can be attributed to
   legisla- tive actions. The legislation with the largest effect was the
   Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, enacted in
   June. That law is estimated to reduce surpluses by nearly $1.3 trillion
   over 10 years (not including associated debt- service costs).
   Additional discretionary spending since last January accounts for
   another $550 bil- lion reduction in the projected surplus for the
   2002-2011 period. That amount stems from both regular and supplemental
   appropriations. CBO's January 2001 baseline assumed that discretionary
   budget authority for 2002 would total $665 billion.3 The actual amount
   appropriated for 2002 in the 13 regular appropriation acts totaled $691
   billion. In addition, the Congress and the President enacted $20
   billion in supple- mental budget authority in December as part of their
   response to the terrorist attacks of September 11-thereby generating a
   total of $711 billion in budget authority for 2002, $45 billion more
   than CBO assumed last January. Under the provisions of the Balanced
   Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, CBO's baseline
   assumes that annual appropriations for discretionary programs continue
   at their current level, increasing only by the rates of inflation
   projected for each year. As a result of the appropriations enacted for
   2002, projections of discre- tionary spending in the current baseline
   begin at a level that is $45 billion higher than a year ago.
   Furthermore, two supplemental appropriation laws enacted in fiscal year
   2001-one for defense personnel and readiness programs and another in
   immediate response to the attacks of September 11-will generate outlays
   totaling around $25 billion in 2002 and beyond. However, budget
   authority from actions in 2001 is not carried forward into the baseline
   projections for future years because those appropriations occurred
   before the current year. Overall, legislated reductions in revenues,
   additional discretionary spending, and other laws with smaller
   budgetary effects have reduced projected surpluses-and thereby
   increased the government's borrowing needs-by $1,858 billion for 2002
   2. About 45 percent of that reduction results from changes made since
   CBO issued its updated Budget and Economic Outlook in August. The drop
   since August totals $1.8 trillion and is attributed, in relatively
   equal measures, to legislative, economic, and technical changes. 3.
   That figure was calculated by assuming that the amount appropriated for
   the base year of 2001 would grow at specified rates of inflation. 3
   through 2011. That increased borrowing is projected to result in an
   extra $562 bil- lion in net interest costs over the 10-year period.
   Changes in the economic outlook since January 2001 account for another
   $929 bil- lion decline in the 10-year surplus. About three-quarters of
   that total reflects lower revenue projections, mostly resulting from
   the substantially weaker economic growth expected in the near term and
   the slightly lower average growth rates projected for the following
   several years. Much of the rest of the decline attributable to the eco-
   nomic outlook represents additional debt-service costs resulting from
   the reduction in anticipated revenues. Technical changes-those not
   driven by new legislation or by changes in CBO's economic forecast-have
   reduced the projected 10-year surplus by a total of $660 billion since
   last January. As with the economic changes, revenues account for over
   75 percent of the technical changes, and debt service accounts for much
   of the rest. The technical changes to revenues stem primarily from
   revised projections of capital gains realizations and adjustments for
   lower-than-expected tax collections in recent months. Homeland Security
   Since the attacks of September 11, federal agencies, state and local
   governments, and the private sector have perceived a heightened threat
   to the United States and a need to commit more resources to homeland
   security. On the federal level, legislation following the attacks
   increased the budget authority provided for such security from $17
   billion in 2001 to $22 billion for 2002. What level of resources to
   commit to homeland security will undoubtedly be a key issue as the
   Congress and the President make decisions about spending and other
   policies this year. The Outlook for Federal Debt In the January 2001
   Budget and Economic Outlook, CBO estimated that federal debt held by
   the public would reach a level in 2006 that would allow the Treasury to
   retire all of the debt available for redemption. At that time, CBO also
   projected that the statutory ceiling on all federal debt (which
   includes debt held by government ac- counts) would not be reached until
   2009. Now, CBO estimates that debt held by the public will not be fully
   redeemed within the 10-year projection period and that the current debt
   ceiling will be reached in the next few months. Nevertheless, if the 4
   surpluses projected in the current baseline materialize, debt held by
   the public will fall to about 15 percent of GDP in 2010-its lowest
   level since 1917. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK In CBO's opinion, the most
   likely path for the economy is a mild recession that may already have
   reached its nadir. CBO expects the annual growth rate of real
   (inflation-adjusted) GDP to accelerate from -0.2 percent in 2001
   (measured from the fourth quarter of calendar year 2000 to the fourth
   quarter of 2001) to 2.5 percent in 2002 and to accelerate further to
   4.3 percent in 2003. Some unusual features of the current recession
   will cause it to be mild, CBO be- lieves. Chief among those features
   are the rapidity of policymakers' responses, the moderating behavior of
   prices, and an early reduction in businesses' inventories. In less than
   one year, the Federal Reserve has cut the federal funds rate 11
   times-from 6.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Also, the tax cuts enacted in
   June prevented consump- tion from slowing more than it might have
   otherwise, and additional federal spending in response to the terrorist
   attacks will boost GDP in 2002. Lower prices for oil and natural gas
   and mild price increases for other items are supporting consumption by
   boosting real disposable income. Furthermore, businesses began to
   reduce inven- tories earlier in this recession than they did in past
   downturns, which may mean that fewer cuts in inventories remain than at
   this stage of the typical recession. CBO projects that weak demand in
   the short run will translate into weak employ- ment, pushing the
   unemployment rate higher for the next several quarters while
   restraining inflation. With growth of real GDP near zero early this
   year, the unem- ployment rate is expected to increase to 6.1 percent in
   calendar year 2002 from 4.8 percent last year (see Table 3). The rate
   of inflation faced by consumers is forecast to fall from 2.9 percent
   last year to 1.8 percent in 2002. Lower oil prices account for most of
   the projected decline in inflation, although the recession also plays a
   role. As oil prices stabilize in CBO's forecast, inflation bounces back
   to 2.5 percent in 2003. Looking out through 2012, CBO expects the
   growth of real GDP to average 3.1 percent during the 2002-2012
   period-roughly the same as it projected last January for the 2002-2011
   period. Nonetheless, the level of real GDP is lower each year than in
   last January's projections, primarily because actual GDP ended up much
   lower in 2001 than CBO had expected a year ago. 5 UNCERTAINTY OF THE
   PROJECTIONS CBO's baseline projections represent the midrange of
   possible outcomes based on past and current trends and the assumption
   that current policies do not change. But considerable uncertainty
   surrounds those projections for two reasons. First, future legislation
   is likely to alter the paths of federal spending and revenues. CBO does
   not predict legislation-indeed, any attempt to incorporate future
   legislative changes would undermine the usefulness of the baseline as a
   benchmark against which to measure the effects of such changes. Second,
   the U.S. economy and the federal budget are highly complex and are
   affected by many economic and technical factors that are difficult to
   predict. As a result, actual budgetary outcomes will almost cer- tainly
   differ from CBO's baseline projections. In view of such uncertainty,
   the outlook for the budget can best be described as a fan of
   probabilities around the point estimates presented as CBO's baseline
   (see Fig- ure 1). Not surprisingly, those probabilities widen as the
   projection period extends. As the fan chart makes clear, projections
   that are quite different from the baseline have a significant
   probability of coming to pass. THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK Despite the
   sizable surpluses projected for the later years of CBO's 10-year budget
   outlook, long-term pressures on spending loom just over the horizon.
   Those pres- sures result from the aging of the U.S. population (large
   numbers of baby boomers will start becoming eligible for Social
   Security retirement benefits in 2008 and for Medicare in 2011), from
   increased life spans, and from rising costs for federal health care
   programs. According to midrange estimates, if current policies
   continue, spend- ing on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid
   combined will nearly double by 2030, to almost 15 percent of GDP.
   Taking action sooner rather than later to address long-term budgetary
   pressures can make a significant difference. In particular, policies
   that encourage economic growth -such as running budget surpluses to
   boost national saving and investment, enacting tax and regulatory
   policies that encourage work and saving, and focusing more gov- ernment
   spending on investment rather than on current consumption-can help by
   increasing the total amount of resources available for all uses. 6

   SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTES: This figure shows the
   estimated likelihood of alternative projections of the surplus under
   current policies. The calculations are based on CBO's past track
   record. CBO's baseline projections fall in the middle of the darkest
   area. Under the assumption that policies do not change, the probability
   is 10 percent that actual surpluses will fall in the darkest area and
   90 percent that they will fall within the whole shaded area. Actual
   surpluses will of course be affected by legislation enacted during the
   next 10 years, including decisions about discretionary spending. The
   effects of future legislation are not included in this figure. An
   explanation of how this probability distribution was calculated will
   appear shortly on CBO's Web site (www.cbo.gov). 10 Additional Tables

   SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office. NOTES: CBO's baseline projections
   assume that discretionary spending grows at the rate of inflation after
   2002, using the inflators specified in the Balanced Budget and
   Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (the gross domestic product
   deflator and the employment cost index). In CBO's projections,
   discretionary outlays always exceed budget authority because of
   spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust
   Fund, which is subject to obligation limitations in appropriation acts.
   The budget authority for such programs is provided in authorizing
   legislation and is not considered discretionary. Another reason outlays
   exceed budget authority is that outlays include spending from
   appropriations provided in previous years. 14 CBO's Current and
