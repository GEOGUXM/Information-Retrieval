      "Fermi was a physicist's physicist whose legacy was one of style as
      well of substance - a style so attractive and so productive for science
      that it became substantive in itself."
      - Excerpt from "Enrico Fermi's Impact on Science" by John Marburger,
      White House Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, at
      the Italian Embassy on November 27, 2001.



   Enrico Fermi

      Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy, on September 29, 1901. The son of
      a railroad official, he studied at the University of Pisa from 1918 to
      1922 and later at the universities of Leyden and Gottingen. He became
      professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rome in 1927.

      Fermi's accomplishments were in both theoretical and experimental
      physics, a unique feat in an age in which scientific endeavors have
      tended to specialize on one aspect or the other.

      Fermi received the Nobel Prize in 1938 for "his discovery of new
      radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for the
      discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons." Fermi
      and his family used the opportunity offered by his trip to Sweden for
      the awards ceremonies to come to the United States where Fermi accepted
      a position as professor of physics at Columbia University.

      Fermi moved to the University of Chicago to be in charge of the first
      major step in making feasible the building of the atomic bomb. In the
      squash courts under the west stand of the University's Stagg Field,
      Fermi supervised the design and assembly of an "atomic pile", a code
      word for an assembly that in peacetime would be known as a "nuclear
      reactor". Today, a plaque at the site reads: "On December 2, 1942, man
      achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby
      initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy."

      Fermis momentous accomplishments caused him to be recognized as one of
      the great scientists of the 20th century. Following his death on
      November 28, 1954, a number of science institutions and awards have
      been named in his honor. Visit the web site at Fermi National
      Accelerator Laboratory for a more detailed biography from which this
      sketch is drawn.

   Fermi Honored:

      Presidential Award of Merit
     "The President of the United States of America ... for especially
     meritorious contributions to the development, use, or control of atomic
     energy, grant[s] an award of merit to Enrico Fermi for his
     contributions to basic neutron physics and the achievement of the
     controlled nuclear chain reaction."

      The Enrico Fermi Award
     "The Enrico Fermi Award is a Presidential awardone of the oldest and
     most prestigious science and technology awards given by the U.S.
     Government. It recognizes scientists of international stature for their
     lifetimes of exceptional achievement in the development, use, or
     production of energy (broadly defined to include the science and
     technology of nuclear, atomic, molecular, and particle interactions and
     effects)."
