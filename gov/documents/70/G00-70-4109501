[cog.gif] Route 30 has a new name. It has been officially designated as State
Route 210.

   Why a Project Updates?
   Building a 28-mile freeway project through seven cities is a dynamic
   process. One of the many challenges SANBAG and Caltrans face is keeping
   residents and businesses informed during construction.

   This Project Update is a bi-monthly newsletter that will highlight what
   activities are ongoing in each of the cities in San Bernardino County.
   As with any large construction project changes are normal and expected.
   This Project Update will help to explain those changes and provide the
   latest information on the schedule.
