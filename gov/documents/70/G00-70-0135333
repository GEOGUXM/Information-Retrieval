   from 6:45pm to 9:15pm at the U.S. Army Reserve Center located on the
   grounds of the Camp Pendleton Marine base in Oceanside, California.

   prepared to show your driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
   of insurance if asked.

   If you have any questions, please feel free to call.
   The phone number is (760)943-7780.

   Enter Camp Pendleton through the main gate.
