   Office of the Procurement Executive

   Welcome to A/OPE's Internet Home Page


   A/OPE Home Page

   This home page has been designed to assist businesses and State
   Department procurement personnel with information on contracting
   opportunities and procurement resources.

   A new site index lists subjects in alphabetical order for easy
   reference, and a text-only version of the page is also posted..  Most
   of the information available on this page is found under four topic
   headings:  "Programs" (A/OPE and State Department programs and
   initiatives), "Policy" (procurement policy topics), "GOV Links"
   (internet links to other procurement-oriented US Government web sites),
   and "State Links" (internal State Department links and information). A
   list of quick links for more commonly used items is provided below each
   heading, allowing the user to go directly to the desired topic.  By
   clicking on the topic headings themselves, a more detailed menu on each
   subject appears.  The detailed menus may contain more subjects than are
   listed in the quick links section of the main page.

   Please contact the webmaster if you have any problems with the new
   format.  We welcome your comments, questions, and suggestions.
