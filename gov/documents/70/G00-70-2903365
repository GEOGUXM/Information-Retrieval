 Salt Lake City is laid out in a grid pattern that starts from the City
 center. Most streets reflect this grid pattern referring to streets in
 North and East, South and East, North and West, and South and West
 addresses, as in 2222 West 2300 South. Many major thoroughfares have
 place name references: 1700 South is referred to as Redwood Road, 2320
 South is often referred to as Printers Row. Another common practice is
 to refer to streets like 3300 South as 33rd South.
