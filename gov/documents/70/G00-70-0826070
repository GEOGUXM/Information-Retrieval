                               Procedures for
                   Registering Institutional Review Boards
                                     and
    Filing Federalwide Assurances of Protection for Human Subjects (FWAs)
     __________________________________________________________________

   This website introduces a process through which Institutional Review
   Boards (IRBs) and (international) Independent Ethics Committees (IECs)
   can register with HHS and thereby receive timely information from HHS
   about the protection of human subjects.

   The website also introduces a simplified process for filing
   Institutional Assurances of Protection for Human Subjects with the HHS
   Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). Assurances approved under
   this process will cover all of the institutions Federally-supported
   human subject research. Each legally separate institution will need its
   own Federalwide Assurance (FWA).

   After February 28, 2001, OHRP will no longer routinely accept
   Assurances that are limited to HHS-supported research, to special
   categories of research, or to individual research projects.

   OHRP invites your comments and suggestions about these processes during
   their initial phase of implementation, which will last approximately 3
   months. During this initial phase, completed materials must be sent to
   OHRP for processing (for IRB Registration) or approval (for FWAs).

   Based on feedback and experience during the first phase, OHRP will make
   necessary modifications and launch an interactive, on-line version that
   will permit direct submission and updating of most IRB Registration and
   Institutional Federalwide Assurance (FWA) materials. Of course, OHRP
   will continue to receive materials on paper from entities that do not
   have access to the world-wide-web.
