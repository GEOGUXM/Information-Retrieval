   Dear Friend,

   I am pleased to inform you that after years of planning, study, and
   review, King County now has an approved Regional Wastewater Services
   Plan (RWSP). photo of Ron Sims Having an approved plan is good news for
   this region because we can finally begin to build the extra capacity we
   need to meet the demands of rapid population growth (check out the
   tutorial). And just as importantly, we can meet these demands while
   protecting public health and our valuable water resources.

   The RWSP outlines a number of important projects and programs that King
   County will implement over the next 30 years, and work is already well
   underway. For example, we have already established a comprehensive
   process to find a site for the new Brightwater Treatment Plant, and we
   are busy improving the conveyance system in the north end.

   Thank you for your involvement to date in helping us develop the
   Regional Wastewater Services Plan. I encourage you to contact us to
   continue your involvement by signing up for our mailing list to receive
   information about upcoming meetings and workshops and to offer your
   comments and suggestions about RWSP projects and programs.

   Sincerely,
   Ron Sims
   King County Executive
