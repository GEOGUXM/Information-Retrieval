   Section B. Information Collected and How it is Used

   Information collected if you only browse this site.

   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit. This information does not identify you
   personally. We automatically collect and store the following
   information about your visit:
    1. The Internet domain and IP address used to access this site. The
       Internet domain is the portal through which you access the
       Internet, such as AOL if you are an AOL user, "xcompany.com" if you
       use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you
       connect through a school. An IP address is a number that is
       assigned to your computer whenever you are using the Internet;
    2. The type of browser and operating system used;
    3. The date and time;
    4. The pages you visit; and
    5. The last web site you visited before coming to ours.

   The information we automatically collect is logged and used by the
   Office of the Governor only to improve the content of our Web services
   and help us understand how people are using our services. We analyze
   this information to determine how our web site is being used, so that
   we may continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

   What we collected if you volunteer information

   If during your visit to our Web site you participate in a survey, send
   an e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following
   additional information will be collected:
    1. The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who
       communicate with us via e-mail.
    2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
    3. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other
       purpose.

   The information collected is not limited to text characters and may
   include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

   We use e-mail you send to respond appropriately. This may be to respond
   to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our web
   site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate
   action.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Section C. Personal Information and Choice

   You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone
   number, and does not include the users domain name or IP address.

   We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or
   completing an on line form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail,
   participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an
   on line form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will
   not impair your ability to browse this web site and read or download
   any information provided on the site.

   If personal information is requested on the Web site, or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and
   may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   federal or state law.

   If you believe that your personal information is being used for a
   purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact
   the Office of the Governor as shown in the Contact Information Section
   of this statement.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be
   treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject
   to public access.

   Section D. Public Access to Information

   In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is
   open and the public has a right to access appropriate records and
   information possessed by State Government. At the same time, there are
   exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve
   various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are
   provided by both state and federal laws.

   All of the information collected at this site is considered public
   information and may be subject to inspection and copying by members of
   the public. RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that:

     Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make
     available for public inspection and copying all public records,
     unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection
     (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or
     other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific
     information or records. To the extent required to prevent an
     unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW
     42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details
     in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it
     makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each
     case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in
     writing.

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act, the Public Records Act provision will control.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Section E. Public Access to Your private Information

   The Office of the Governor does not currently collect personally
   identifiable information, unless you send us an e-mail.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Section F. Your Right to Review and Correct Personally Identifiable
   Information.

   State law requires agencies that collect personally identifiable
   information to provide "procedures for correcting inaccurate
   information, including establishing mechanisms for individuals to
   review information about them and recommend changes in information they
   believe to be inaccurate." (RCW 43.105.310)

   In the event the Office of the Governor decides to begin collecting
   personally identifiable information in the future, section E. above
   will be changed to describe that activity. You will be able to access
   any personally identifiable information we collect about you by using
   the Contact Information at the end of this Notice. You will be able to
   correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by
   submitting an e-mail or written request that credibly shows the error.
   We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting
   access or making corrections.
