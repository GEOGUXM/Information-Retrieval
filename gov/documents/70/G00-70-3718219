             Protecting California's Agriculture and Environment

   The Purpose of CDFA's Animal and Plant Laws and Regulations

   The illegal importation or smuggling into this state of unapproved,
   uninspected, or uncertified wild or domesticated animals, whether as
   pets or livestock, and live plants and plant products, can have serious
   legal and financial consequences for the persons involved, and could
   result in potentially damaging impacts to California's agriculture and
   environment.

   Certain types of animals, plants, insects and other organisms,
   including microorganisms, are not allowed into California or require a
   special permit to legally enter this state. For those that are allowed,
   an import permit and/or a health certificate or phytosanitary
   certificate may be required.

   CDFA's Animal Health and Pest Exclusion branches work cooperatively
   with other agencies, including California's Department of Fish and Game
   and the United States Department of Agriculture, to prevent the
   introduction and spread of harmful pests and diseases into California,
   and provide certification that our animal and plant exports to other
   states and countries are free from pests and diseases.

   We need to work together to protect and preserve our valuable state
   agricultural and environmental resources from the harmful effects
   caused by the introduction of exotic organisms.
