   Introduction

   This document reports significant accomplishments of each of the boards
   and departments within the Cal/EPA family for the first six months of
   2001. It also defines goals for the second six months of 2001.

   The purpose of this document is to ensure that all interested parties -
   legislators and staff, environmental organizations, media, and industry
   - have a clear picture of where we have been and where we are going.

   Future reports will be published shortly after the end of each
   six-month period so that we account for our activities and generate a
   dialogue regarding the direction Cal/EPA is taking.

     Winston H. Hickox, Agency Secretary
