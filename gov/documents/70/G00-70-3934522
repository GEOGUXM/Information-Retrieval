   Low Enriched Uranium: Final Affirmative Antidumping Duty Determination
    for France; Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations for
       France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; Final
   Negative Antidumping Duty Determinations for Germany, the Netherlands,
                           and the United Kingdom.

   On Friday, December 14, we announced our final determinations in the
   above mentioned investigations. We found a final subsidy rate of 2.26
   percent for imports of LEU from Germany, the Netherlands, and the
   United Kingdom, and a rate of 13.21 percent for imports of LEU from
   France. We also made a final affirmative determination in the
   antidumping investigation of LEU from France, with an antidumping
   margin of 19.57 percent. However, we made final determinations that
   sales of LEU from Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom were
   not dumped in the United States.

   Background:

   These petitions were filed on December 7, 2000, by USEC Inc., and its
   wholly owned subsidiary, United States Enrichment Corporation
   (collectively USEC). Subsequent to the filing of the petitions, the
   Paper, Allied -Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International
   Union, AFL-CIO, CLC, and Local 5-550 and Local 5-689 (PACE) joined
   USEC, Inc. as petitioners in these cases. The Department initiated
   these investigations on December 27, 2000.

   Product Description:

   The merchandise subject to these investigations is low enriched uranium
   (LEU). The technical language describing the scope of these
   investigations will be included in the final determination notices
   which will be published in the Federal Register. LEU imported into the
   United States solely for further processing and consumption outside of
   the United States is excluded from these investigations.
