   value of a Burning Plasma experiment Scientific readiness to proceed
   with such an experiment Is the FIRE mission scientifically appropriate?
   Is the initial FIRE design point optimal? * Extensive PAC Reports
   provide detailed recommendations for the FIRE activity to address.
   NSO-PAC reports are on FIRE (http://fire.pppl.gov), will discuss in
   more detail under FY 2001-03 Plans. Fusion Science Objectives for a
   Major Next Step Magnetic Fusion Experiment Explore and understand the
   strong non-linear coupling that is fundamental to fusion-dominated
   plasma behavior (self-organization) * Energy and particle transport
   (extend confinement predictability) * Macroscopic stability ( -limit,
   wall stabilization, NTMs) * Wave-particle interactions (fast alpha
   particle driven effects) * Plasma boundary (density limit, power and
   particle flow) * Test/Develop techniques to control and optimize
   fusion-dominated plasmas. * Sustain fusion-dominated plasmas -
   high-power-density exhaust of plasma particles and energy, alpha ash
   exhaust, study effects of profile evolution due to alpha heating on
   macro stability, transport barriers and energetic particle modes. *
   Explore and understand various advanced operating modes and
   configurations in fusion-dominated plasmas to provide generic knowledge
   for fusion and non-fusion plasma science, and to provide a foundation
   for attractive fusion applications. Stepping Stones for Resolving the

   Operation Recent Innovations have Markedly Improved the Technical Basis
   for a Compact High Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Exp't. Tokamak
   experiments (1989-1999) have developed enhanced confinement modes that
   scale (e.g.,ITER-98H) 1.3 times higher than the 1989 CIT design
   assumption. Alcator C-Mod - the prototype for Compact High Field
   tokamaks has shown: * Confinement in excess of 1.4 times the 1989
   design guidelines for CIT and ~1.15 times the recent ITER-98H design
   guidelines. * Successful ICRF heating at high density in shaped
   diverted plasmas. * Successful detached divertor operation at high
   power density. D-T experiments on TFTR and JET have shown: * Tritium
   can be handled safely in a laboratory fusion experiment!!! * D-T
   plasmas behaved roughly as predicted with slight improvements in
   confinement in plasmas with weak alpha-heating. Engineering Innovations

   2015 Year * Even with ITER, the MFE program will be unable to address
   the alpha-dominated burning plasma issues for 15 years. * Compact
   High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would be a natural
   extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and could begin
   alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one high gain
   burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade. Summary * The
   FIRE "Pre-Conceptual" design point has been chosen to be a "stepping
   stone" between the physics accessible with present experiments and the
   physics required for the ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A
   compact high field tokamak, like FIRE, can: * address the important
   burning plasma issues, * most of the advanced tokamak issues and, *
   begin to study the strong non-linear coupling between BP and AT under
   quasi-stationary conditions in a $1B class facility. * Many
   opportunities exist for improving/optimizing the FIRE design *
   optimimum aspect ratio for BP and AT with adequate pulse length *
   stronger shaping with more feedback * assume higher H factors, or base
   design on AT * Utilize bucking/wedging coil design to allow OFHC Cu
   longer pulse * Develop neutron damage resistant TF insulation -
   increase fluence * others from this workshop!! Laboratories are Needed
