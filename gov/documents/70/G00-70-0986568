   COMMUNITY OUTREACH

   Employees of the Jacksonville FBI Division dedicate a large amount of
   time to a number of community outreach programs. These employees
   regularly appear at speaking engagements throughout their designated
   territory. Additionally, the Jacksonville FBI office has instituted a
   Citizens Academy which began in the summer of 1999. This Academy brings
   together many of Jacksonville's most prominent civic, business,
   education, and financial leaders for seminars hosted by the
   Jacksonville FBI. The Citizens Academy is intended to give those
   attending an understanding of today's FBI.

   Jacksonville FBI employees and their families are committed to several
   restoration projects throughout Florida such as, "Paint the Town,"
   Community Rehabilitation Week at Jacksonville, and the Saint Francis
   Men's Shelter in St. Augustine, Florida. Other community programs
   include the Jacksonville Chapter of the Weed and Seed, the Florida
   Blood Drive Alliance, and the Otis Smith Foundation (a youth mentoring
   program).

   The FBI also provides guest speakers to schools, churches, and other
   civic organizations. To request a speaker for your school or
   organization, please send a letter to:

                       Federal Bureau of Investigation
