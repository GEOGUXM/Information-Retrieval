   To qualify for the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health
   Service, the following requirements must be met:
     * United States Citizenship
     * Graduation from, or current enrollment in, an ADA-accredited U.S.
       dental school
     * Less than 44 years of age, unless the age limit is offset by prior
       active duty military service (e.g., 3 years of active duty service
       in the U.S. Navy extend the age limit to 47 years)
     * No more than 8 years of prior active duty military service
     * Fitness for duty, as determined by a USPHS physical examination
     * Professional ability, as determined by college transcripts and
       references

   Other qualifications will be determined through a security clearance,
   questionnaire for non-sensitive duty positions, etc.
   The qualifying process may take 2-3 months; however, you're invited to
   discuss possible assignments with the IHS Dental Recruiter while your
   paperwork is being reviewed. Because there is no obligation to accept
   an assignment, you're encouraged to complete an application and qualify
   for the Commissioned Corps. This will allow you to be considered for
   any opportunities that may appeal to you. Should such an assignment be
   offered, you will then be able to accept the position as a Commissioned
   Officer. On the other hand, you may withdraw your application at any
   time, should you choose a different career path. Qualifying for the
   Commissioned Corps simply broadens your employment options.
   If you feel that you meet the commissioning requirements of the U.S.
   Public Health Service and would like an application packet, please
   contact the IHS Dental Recruiter. Dr. Timothy L. Lozon may be reached
   at 800/IHS-DENT (800/447-3368) or his e-mail address,
   tlozon@hqe.ihs.gov. You will also receive additional information about
   the Indian Health Service and the Commissioned Corps. Thank you for
   your interest!
