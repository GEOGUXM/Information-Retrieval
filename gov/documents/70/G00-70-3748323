   A crucial of element of energy and environmental policy analysis is the
   dissemination of results so that the optimal policy solutions can be
   properly applied. Cheap, effective and focused distribution of policy
   analysis results to stake-holders and policy makers is an essential
   element to effective policy development. In this regard, information
   technology is an important tool for the communication of policy impact
   results and cost/benefit analyses.

   For many developing countries, information distribution infrastructure
   is weak. Under such conditions, it is appropriate to develop
   information distribution and publication tools that are customized to
   the needs of developing countries. For developing countries, the cost
   of computer communication bandwidth relative to local income is very
   high, and there are often cultural and linguistic barriers to to the
   use of computer information services.

   Efficient international bandwidth utilization, multi-lingual content,
   friendly data retrieval interfaces, and easy local content generation
   are all key elements for effective developing country information
   distribution and exchange systems. Efficient international bandwidth
   utilization reduces the cost of information access for developing
   country users. Multi-lingual content makes information more accessible
   and understandable to developing country users. Friendly data retrieval
   interfaces also make data and information accessible and usable by
   stakeholders. And easy local content generation tools allow developing
   country users to more easily exchange data with U.S. collaborators.
   Therefore, if the development of energy and environmental analysis
   tools can integrate appropriate information distribution infrastructure
   development, the effectiveness of the policy tools can be greatly
   enhanced.

   We therefore include customized information services development and
   innovation as part or our policy tools development research.

   Additionally we shall experiment with the development of network
   modeling methods in an effort to provide mechanisms for collaborative
   complex model development. For more details on this research
   initiative, consult the links under "Network Models" (Under
   development).
