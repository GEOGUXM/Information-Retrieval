                                  See a Launch

   NASA and the Department of Defense operate several launch facilities,
   of which NASA's Kennedy Space Center is the best known. Members of the
   public interested in seeing launches must bear in mind that schedules
   can change significantly, quickly and at the last minute. Some launch
   facilities may provide better views and accessibility than others.
   Launch facilities that have Web sites include:
     * Kennedy Space Center, FL. NASA's Space Shuttle launch site. There
       are a variety of ways to see a launch. (Current launch schedule.)
     * Patrick Air Force Base, FL. The Defense Department's East Coast
       launch facility, adjoining NASA's Kennedy Space Center. There are
       no public viewing areas on the base, but many of the launches can
       be seen from the beaches south of the facility.
     * Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA. NASA's facility for
       launching research aircraft, balloons and sounding rockets. The
       best viewing is from the NASA Visitors Center.
