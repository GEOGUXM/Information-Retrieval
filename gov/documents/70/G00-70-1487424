                    Philadelphia Tax Review Board

                    Mission
                    In the fall of 1995, the Mayor consolidated the Bureau of
   Administrative Adjudication (BAA) and the Tax Review Board (TRB), and
   created the OAR as a single point of contact for the resolution of all
   non-judicial disputes regarding City taxes, charges, fees and fines.

   All disputes are screened for eligibility, referred to the appropriate
   department or agency as an initial step toward resolution, tracked,
   and, if a settlement with the department cannot be reached, referred
   for a hearing at the BAA or TRB.

   The Tax Review Board, which adjudicates taxpayer appeals from all City
   assessments or bills, with the exception of real estate tax assessments
   and tax principal.

   Frequently Asked Questions

   1. What can I appeal at the Tax Review Board?
   A taxpayer can request a hearing for any money or claim collectible by
   the Department of Revenue, for or on behalf of the City or the School
   District of Philadelphia. This includes but is not limited to, any tax,
   water or sewer, license fee or other charge and the related interest
   and penalty. Refunds and the related interest and penalty paid to the
   City may also be appealed.

   2. How do I apply for a hearing?
   Taxpayers should first attempt to resolve any billing disputes with the
   appropriate department. If the dispute cannot be resolved at the
   department, an appeal may be filed with the TRB. A TRB Petition must be
   filled out, in triplicate, and filed with the TRB office by mail or in
   person.

   3. How long does it take to have a hearing scheduled?
   A hearing will be scheduled approximately 60 days after the petition is
   received by the TRB. Smaller cases are scheduled before a Master. The
   larger or more complex cases are scheduled before the full TRB.

   4. Is it necessary to have a lawyer or accountant to represent me at
   the hearing?
   No, TRB hearings are informal administrative hearings. A taxpayer can
   represent him/herself before either a Master or the full Board.

   5. Is there a time limit to file an appeal?
   Yes, for a petition for review you must file 60 days from the mailing
   date of the bill; and for a refund you must file 90 days from the
   mailing date of the notice of denial from the Department of Revenue.

   6. Is there a filing fee for me to request a hearing?
   No, the City offers this service free of charge.
