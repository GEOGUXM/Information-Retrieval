                  Judicial Conference of the United States

     The Conference of Senior Circuit Judges was created by Congress in
   1922, to "serve as the principal policy making body concerned with the
   administration of the United States Courts." In 1948, Congress enacted
    section 331 of title 28, United States Code, changing the name to the
   Judicial Conference of the United States. District judges were formally
                      added to the Conference in 1957.

   As in 1922, the fundamental purpose of the Judicial Conference today is
    to make policy with regard to the administration of the United States
   courts. Section 331 of title 28 specifically provides that the Judicial
                              Conference shall:

     * Make a comprehensive survey of the conditions of business in the
       courts of the United States;
     * Prepare plans for the assignment of judges to or from courts of
       appeals or district courts, where necessary;
     * Submit suggestions to the various courts in the interest of
       promoting uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious
       conduct of court business;
     * Exercise authority provided in 28 U.S.C. ยง 372 (c) for the review
       of circuit council conduct and disability orders filed under that
       section; and
     * Carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the
       general rules of practice and procedure in use within the federal
       courts, as prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to law.

         The Judicial Conference also supervises the Director of the
   Administrative Office of the United States Courts in the performance of
    his duties as the administrative officer of the courts of the United
    States under 28 U.S.C. ยง 604. In addition, certain statues authorize
    the Judicial Conference to act in a variety of specific areas dealing
                   with the administration of the courts.
