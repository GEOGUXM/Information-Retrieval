   The California Department of Insurances (CDI) Producer Licensing
   Bureau now has a toll-free number available for agents, brokers and
   insurance companies to call the CDI with their licensing concerns. The
   Producer Licensing Bureau is responsible for licensing agents and
   brokers who sell insurance in California. Most licensed agents are
   located in California although in some cases they reside outside of the
   state.

   In 1999, the Producer Licensing Bureau received over 530,000 telephone
   calls from its 200,000 agents and brokers. The Producer Licensing
   Bureaus toll-free number provides better service for those who call
   with their licensing concerns.  The current telephone number for the
   Producer Licensing Bureau, (916) 322-3555, will remain active and
   available for your use.
