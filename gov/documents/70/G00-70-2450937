   _______________________________________________________________________

      Mr. Secretary, Director Brown, eminent former directors, honored
                                   guests.

      Thank you, Karen, for that introduction, and thank you, Secretary
                      Evans, for your support of NIST.

       It is indeed an honor for me to represent not only the Visiting
    Committee on Advanced Technology, but also all of American industry,
    before such a distinguished audience.  It would be a hopeless task to
    comment in detail on the myriad contributions of NIST in millions of
         interactions, over a century, so Ill speak only in general.

       There are three simple messages to NIST from American industry:

     First:  Congratulations for 100 years of technology and scientific
      achievement and for becoming the worlds premier measurements and
                           standards organization.

     Second:  Thank you!  Thank you to the institution; thank you to its
    supporters in government and industry, and above all thank you to the
                men and women of NIST.  We are proud of you!

             And third: stay with uswe need you more than ever!

   As we begin a new century, NIST is a national treasure.  NIST stands at
     the confluence of three major themes in American historyscience and
     technology, commerce, and cooperation.   These do not stand apart.
       NIST exemplifies the complex and productive ways in which they
                                 intertwine.

    We honor NIST not only for its leading-edge science, but also for its
    integrity, impartiality, openness and outreach to industry.   Through
      its measurements and standards activities, its stewardship of the
      Malcolm Baldrige Quality Program, its service to small and large
        businesses, its high-leverage support of high-risk technology
     development, and its role in convening partnerships, NIST is a true
                  enabler of the American economic miracle.

   The strength of the American system is its ability to respond to change
       and unpredictability.   In science and technology as much as in
   government and the economy, this ability rests on our decentralization,
       diversity, and flexibility, coupled with a willingness to work
            together.   NISTs role must support these strengths.

   In the last century we have gained incredible insight into our physical
    world through analysis in increasingly fine-grained microscopicdare I
    say nanoscopic? detail.   NIST has been a leader in the measurements
                          that make this possible.

      But progress for the citizens depends on a tortuous process from
    science to technology to commercialization to economic benefit.  This
     process by which we advance requires integration across boundaries
    between sectors, institutions, disciplines, and people.  Increasingly
   the challenges of the 21st century will require us not only to isolate
   and understand specific phenomena and causes, but to think holistically
     and to integrate our fragmented understanding back up to the system
                level, where it benefits the lives of people.

    As we face these challenges, American industry is confident that NIST
    will continue to lead, to listen, to change, and to be our pro-active
                           and responsive partner.

                                 Thank you!
