   ELECTRONIC CASE FILES

   The D.C. Circuit is participating in the development of a Case
   Management/Electronic Case Files ("CM/ECF") system for the federal
   appellate courts. Ultimately, it is hoped that CM/ECF will replace the
   Court's current docketing system, and will permit electronic filing in
   almost all cases.  A portion of the CM/ECF propotype system was used to
   enable electronic filing in No. 00-5212, United States v. Microsoft.
