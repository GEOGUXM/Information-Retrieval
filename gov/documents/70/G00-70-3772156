   All source code, documents, and associated products produced by NIST
   are placed in the public domain.

   Caution: The NIST DASE Development Environment PAE prototype
   implementation is written towards the ATSC DASE Balloted specification
   (version T3-531 R4) dated November 20, 2001. This is an intermediate
   release which implies that not all functionality is implemented and the
   completed sections of the implementation may not reflect the intended
   semantics of the DASE specification. NIST has ended development (as of
   December 2001) of the implementation, and therefore provides the code
   as is.
