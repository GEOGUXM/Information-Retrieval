   Introduction In the fall of 1990 we submitted a proposal [1] to extend
   the data taking of E760 to the next fixed target period, now scheduled
   to start in the fall of 1994, in order to complete the study of the
   masses, widths and branching fractions of charmonium states and to
   extend the program to include a search for cryptoexotics and a study of
   J= formation in nuclear matter. During the five month data taking
   period in 1991 we have obtained not only significant physics results
   but acquired a better understanding of what is needed in order to
   complete our study of charmonium states. In spite of the fact that we
   have collected data for an integrated luminosity (30pb\Gamma 1) which
   was in excess of what we had hoped for, we achieved only part of our
   goals. If we compare the estimates given in the previous version of
   this proposal to the actual experimental situation, (see Table 12 in
   the Appendix) we find that, in general, the expected cross sections
   were overestimated and while the measured background levels and
   efficiencies are close to prediction for channels with a large mass
   e+e\Gamma in the final state, they compare unfavorably with the
   predictions for neutral final states. In the light of the results
   obtained during the 1991 run it is therefore mandatory to review our
   program giving new estimates for the required luminosities and
   restating the priority we assign to each measurement. In section 2 we
   discuss the measurements of highest priority : a) determination of mass
   and total width of the jc and of the product of the branching fractions
   B(jc ! _pp) \Theta B(jc ! flfl) b) confirmation of the 1P1 signal and a
   more precise determination of the 1P1 parameters c) search for the j0c
   and determination of its mass and width d) determination of the mass
   and total width of the O/0 and of the products of the branching
   fractions B(O/0 ! _pp) \Theta B(O/0 ! flfl) and of B(O/0 ! _pp) \Theta
   B(O/0 ! J= + fl) Since we shall spend some calibration time at the
   well-measured resonances, we also discuss 1 a measurement of the
   angular distributions in radiative decays of the O/1 and O/2. In
   section 3 we discuss the feasibility of a search for the missing
   D-states of charmonium. The discovery of these states is very important
   but the uncertainties on mass values and formation/decay branching
   fractions make this measurement risky. For this reason we will not
   begin this search until the measurements described above are
   successfully completed. Section 4 gives a description of measurements
   which are unrelated to charmonium physics but are of considerable
   interest and can be done concurrently with the measurements on
   charmonium states. According to the new estimates, the program outlined
   will not be completed in the next fixed target run unless we
   substantially increase the instantaneous luminosity of the experiment.
   This will be possible with the expected increase in stacking rate of
   the Antiproton source and with an upgrade of the hydrogen gas-jet
   target system. A description of the planned modifications to the target
   and of the implications of running with high currents in the Antiproton
   Accumulator is given in section 5. Section 6 contains a description of
   the detector upgrades needed to cope with the increased instantaneous
   rates. Finally in section 7 we discuss other measurements to which we
   do not attach high priority but which could be performed with some
   extra running time. These include the study of _pp ! jc ! OEOE and the
   measurement of J= - nucleon cross section. 2. Measurement of the
   parameters of jc, 1P1, O/0 and search for the j0c Measurement of the
   line parameters of the jc Fig.1 shows the excitation curve for the
   reaction _pp ! jc ! flfl obtained in 1991 with an integrated luminosity
   of , 3:6pb\Gamma 1. The acceptance\Theta efficiency factor is only 0.13
   since to 2 reject the large background we are forced to restrict the
   acceptance to jcos `cmj ^ 0:2. A large (and unanticipated) component of
   the background comes from the process _pp ! ss0 +fl. If we fit this
   data to a Breit-Wigner plus a background we determine a total width
   \Gamma T ot = (20 \Sigma 10) MeV and, using the current value [2] for
   B(jc ! _pp) = (1:2 \Sigma 0:4) \Theta 10\Gamma 3, we extract from the
   product of branching ratios to the initial and final states, B(jc !
   flfl) = (3:3 \Sigma 1:4) \Theta 10\Gamma 4 (preliminary). This
   branching fraction gives in good approximation the ratio \Gamma (j
   c!flfl) \Gamma (jc!light hadrons) , a quantity from which the value of
   the strong coupling constant at the mass of the c-quark ffs(mc) can be
   directly derived[3]. We notice that this measurement represents already
   a substantial improvement on existing ones [2], however the result
   depends on the value of the branching fraction to _pp measured by other
   experiments. A precise measurement of the total width and of the
   product of branching ratios to the initial and final states, coupled
   with the measurement of the partial width to flfl at e+e\Gamma
   colliders would provide enough information to check the internal
   consistency of all these measurements. We have estimated that, with the
   same background rejection as obtained in the past run, we need , 20
   pb\Gamma 1 of total integrated luminosity to obtain a 25% measurement
   of the total width and a 15% measurement of the product of branching
   ratios. Precise measurements of the parameters of the jc are a
   milestone essential for planning and understanding the measurements
   described in the next two subsections. Study of the 1P1 Precise
   measurements of the parameters which characterize the hc(1P1) state are
   useful to resolve a number of open questions in heavy quark physics.
   The value of the hyperfine splitting of P states is a sensitive probe
   of the deviation from a 1r dependence of the vector part of the
   potential[4]. A measurement of the total width and of the partial width
   to jc + fl will provide an estimate of the partial width to gluons.
   Since calculations of partial gluonic widths of 1;3P1 states suffer
   from infrared divergences to leading order, a comparison with measured
   values will be of guidance. Calculations of branching ratios for
   hadronic decays to lower (_cc) states also give contradictory answers
   and the debate could profit from some actual data[5]. 3 Ours is
   apparently the only experiment which can at present study the 1P1 state
   of charmonium. However it will be hard to obtain enough data to resolve
   all the issues mentioned above. Fig. 2 shows the rate versus center of
   mass energy for the reaction _pp ! J= + ss0 measured in 1991 with an
   integrated luminosity of , 16pb\Gamma 1 [6]. A careful analysis of the
   statistical significance of the structure observed in Fig. 2 shows that
   the probability that a signal of magnitude equal to or greater than the
   one observed could originate from a fluctuation of the continuum
   anywhere in the scanned interval is 1 in 400. We clearly must repeat
   the scan with higher statistics. In the 1991 run we have measured the
   1P1 mass to be 3526:2 \Sigma 0:15 \Sigma 0:2 M eV =c2 but could only
   set an upper limit of 1.1 MeV ( 90%C:L:) to its width. We estimate the
   luminosity to perform a 30% measurement of the width in the hypothesis
   that it is in the range from 0:6 to 1:0M eV , to be 75pb\Gamma 1. For
   this measurement it is essential that the beam width be ' 300keV . It
   will be important to detect other decay channels; we have found no
   events from the decay 1P1 ! J=ssss and set a limit of ^ 0:18 (90%C:L:)
   to the ratio 1P1!J=ssss 1P1!J=ss0 . The most pessimistic prediction for
   this ratio[5] is , 0:05 and therefore, in a 75pb\Gamma 1 run we should
   expect to see some events in this background free channel. As for the
   decay channel 1P1 ! jc +fl, unfortunately in our experiment we can only
   see the jc through its decay to flfl which, as mentioned above, has a
   branching fraction of (3:4 \Sigma 1:1) \Theta 10\Gamma 4 . \Lambda If
   the branching fraction for 1P1 ! jc + fl is , 50% we expect the signal
   in the 3fl final state to show up at approximately the same level as
   the (e+e\Gamma )J= + ss0 signal. However in this case the background,
   which comes from incompletely observed neutral final states, is much
   higher than for the (e+e\Gamma )J= + ss0 channel. The present data
   sample does not show evidence for this decay mode. In order to extract
   this signal it will be important not only to increase substantially the
   data sample but also to reject the background more efficiently. The
   background to 3fl events comes predominantly from neutral final states
   with \Lambda Consideration is being given to the feasibility of
   studying the reaction: _pp !1 P1 ! j cfl ! OEOEfl ! 2K+2K\Gamma fl. The
   background comes mainly from four charged particles plus ss o. The
   fraction of sso's that would give only one photon above 50 MeV in the
   acceptance and survive all the remaining selections is 1/30. This and
   the absence of a OEOEfl continuum background are the factors that might
   make this channel accessible in spite of the small cross section. 4
   three ss0's where three of the fl0s escape detection either because
   they have energy below the calorimeter detection threshold or because
   they fall outside the acceptance. The two ways of reducing the
   backgrounds are then obviously to increase the detector acceptance and
   to lower the threshold, and we propose to pursue them both. We postpone
   to section 6 a detailed discussion of how we plan to use the existing
   detector more effectively. To increase the acceptance we propose to
   build a compact calorimeter (see Fig. 3) to cover the polar angle range
   from 700 to 1400 and 75% of the full azimuthal range. There are many
   advantages in adding this detector: an important one is the possibility
   of extending the angular acceptance for events with a large mass
   electron pair in the final state. We have calculated that by increasing
   the acceptance for the electron tracks from the present polar angle
   fiducial range (150 ^ ` ^ 600) to the range 50 ^ ` ^ 1100 we would
   increase the geometrical acceptance by a factor 2 even accounting for
   the 75% coverage in azimuth at large angles. The advantage would not
   only be that of reducing the luminosity requirements but also of
   substantially improving angular distribution measurements. Using the
   information available in our present data we are now trying to
   establish if it will be possible to trigger and extract a low level
   signal for this new type of events. Search for the j0c The only
   evidence for the j0c comes from an early experiment at SPEAR [7] which
   measured a mass difference of , 90 MeV between the j0c and the 0. This
   large difference is hard to reconcile with theoretical predictions
   unless coupled channel effects are large. It is important to confirm
   the result of the SPEAR experiment and to measure accurately the mass
   and total width of the j0c and the product of its branching ratios to
   the initial (_pp) state and to the flfl final state. E760 started but,
   for lack of running time, did not complete a search for the j0c. Fig. 4
   shows the result of the scan done at center of mass energies above 3.5
   GeV searching for flfl final states. The only high point is at the O/2
   where we see a , 4oe signal[8]. We now compare the observed , 11pb
   background cross section level with what we expect for the j0c signal.
   In this estimate we take the branching fraction to flfl to be the same
   as for the jc, and the branching fraction to _pp to scale as M \Gamma
   8R [9]. Using as an input value the 5 peak cross section measured by
   E760 for the jc we obtain oepeak(j0c) ss 47pb which must be reduced by
   an efficiency\Theta acceptance factor , 0:71 \Theta 0:4 to 13 pb. If
   the assumptions made in the calculation are correct, we should have
   seen a cross-section jump comparable to that seen at the O/2 if, in our
   scan, we had landed on the peak of the j0c resonance. It is clear that
   no conclusion can be drawn at this time from the date taken in 1991,
   and that we will need some luck to spot this state quickly in the next
   run. From the existing information, the best guess is that the j0c
   width is about 7 MeV. A possible scan strategy could then be the
   following: maximum range covered ps = 3585M eV to ps = 3646M eV , step
   size 2.5 MeV, luminosity/point 1:5pb\Gamma 1. Start at the lower end to
   check the SPEAR result. Assuming the background is known (certainly
   true after the first few points) a point at the peak would give us a
   3oe enhancement. The scan over the full range would cost us
   approximately 35 pb\Gamma 1. Once the resonance is found we will need
   only 10 pb\Gamma 1 to measure its width to 20% and the product of the
   branching ratios to the initial and final state to 15%. This
   calculation assumes that the background level is the same as in the
   past run. However the improvements in the calorimeter readout and the
   addition of a new detector at large angles may reduce substantially the
   main background component which, at these energies, comes from 2ss0
   final states where one of the photons either falls outside the
   acceptance or is below the energy detection threshold. Measurement of
   the line parameters of the O/0 Recently the study of P-state
   annihilations into two photons and two gluons has received much
   attention and calculations involving relativistic corrections [10]and
   new factorization schemes[11] have been performed. E760 has obtained
   new precise results for the total width of the O/1 and O/2[12] and for
   the partial width to flfl of the O/2[8]. Similar quality measurements
   on the O/0 will complete our knowledge of 3P states and provide
   stringent tests of the theoretical predictions. We note that
   perturbative QCD calculations directly relate 3P2 and 3P0 states and
   not the 3P1 state. The mass of the O/0 has been measured with
   sufficient accuracy at SPEAR (M (O/0) = (3415:1 \Sigma 1:0) M eV =c2 )
   [7] to allow for an efficient scan. To estimate the amount of
   luminosity needed to perform a good measurement of the total 6 width we
   assume that the branching ratio to _pp is close to that measured for
   the O/1 and the O/2 ,, :8 \Theta 10\Gamma 4. We will study two decay
   channels O/0 ! J= + fl and O/0 ! flfl. The first branching ratio has
   been measured reasonably well ((6:6 \Sigma 1:8) \Theta 10\Gamma 3) and
   the second only approximately ((4:0 \Sigma 2:3) \Theta 10\Gamma 4).
   Using these values we find that the luminosity needed for a 30%
   measurement of the O/0 width is , 20pb\Gamma 1. At the same time we
   will measure to 15% the product of the branching ratio to _pp and the
   branching ratio to J= + fl and of the ratio O/0!flflO/ 0!J=+fl . In
   Table 1 we summarize the luminosity requirements and the precision
   expected in the measurements for each resonance. Table 1: Decay channel

   Brout pb\Gamma 1 1P1 ! J= + ss0 75 30 30 j0c ! flfl 45 20 15 jc ! flfl
   20 25 15 O/0 ! J= + fl 20 25 20 Total 160 Angular distributions in
   radiative decays of O/1 and O/2. During the 1990 and 1991 running
   periods we have collected about 3000 O/2 events and 400 O/1 events in
   the reaction pp ! O/J ! J= fl ! e+e\Gamma fl. Using those events we
   have measured a2 (the quadrupole amplitude in the radiative decay) with
   an accuracy of 0.06 for both O/2 and O/1. The measurement of a2(O/2) is
   already the most accurate in the world. This is not the case for O/1,
   where there exists a more accurate measurement done by the Crystal Ball
   collaboration [13]. In order to achieve their accuracy (\Sigma 0:02) we
   would have to increase our statistics by a factor of 8:5, which would
   require approximately 3:3 pb\Gamma 1 of integrated 7 luminosity. It is
   important to measure both angular distributions to the same accuracy in
   the same experiment and compare the ratio a2(O/2)a 2(O/1) with the
   value of 3=p5 predicted by theory [14]. This prediction is not affected
   by uncertainties in the values of the quark mass and anomalous magnetic
   moment. 3. The Search for the Spin 2 Charmonium D States The charmonium
   D states are a poorly studied sector of heavy quark physics. The J=2 D
   states ought to be extremely narrow despite being above the open charm
   threshold. Their annihilation and radiative decays provide an
   interesting test of QCD. The charmonium D state which has been observed
   is the (3770), generally considered to be largely triplet D1 with a
   small admixture of the n=2 triplet S1. Its decay is dominated by the
   _DD mode. Measured partial widths are: e+e\Gamma (0.26 keV), J=ssss (50
   keV), light hadrons [ggg+virtual gamma] (300 keV), and E1 radiative
   decay to O/0 and O/1 (500 keV and 440 keV respectively). The triplet D3
   state may also decay to _DD without violating conservation laws and
   ought to have a comparable total width, at least 10 MeV. It would have
   partial widths to J= inclusive decay modes comparable to (3770). The
   masses of charmonium D states have been estimated. A recent estimate
   based upon a relativistic formulation gives a 3D2 state mass of about
   3800 Mev and a 1D2 state mass of about 3790 MeV [15]. Previous
   estimates give comparable values, [16] also well below the DD?
   threshold of 3875 MeV. The J=2 D states are expected to be narrow
   because neither has a decay channel into open charm. The 3D2 cannot
   decay into _DD or into 2 gluons. Its remaining decay modes are 3 gluons
   and hadronic and radiative decays to O/ states and the J=. The 1D2
   state cannot decay to _DD and decays primarily to 2 gluons and to
   radiative and hadronic modes 8 including the J= or another charmonium
   state. Table 2 gives the decay modes of these states. Table 2: Decay
   Modes of Spin 2 D States Decays of 3D2 Decays of 1D2 J=sso (I-spin
   forbidden) J=ss+ss\Gamma (I-spin forbidden) J=j J=ssss O/0fl (0.04 keV
   [17]) 1P1fl (108 keV [18]) O/1fl (82 keV) J=fl (1.5 keV) O/2fl (31 keV)
   0fl (0.006 keV) 3 gluons (0.3 MeV, see below) 2 gluons (2 MeV, see
   below) Estimates for the partial and total widths of the D2 states can
   be obtained from the measured decays of the (3770) [19] and other
   charmonium states. We take the width of the 3D2 to light hadrons (3
   gluons) to be approximately 0.3 MeV, its total width to be 1 MeV and
   its width to J= + X to be 70 keV where we sum the contributions of
   J=ssss and the E1 transitions O/1fl and O/2fl. The 1D2 width is
   dominated by the 2 gluon decay and is expected to be larger. We take
   the O/2 decay as a guide and estimate 3 MeV for the total width and
   take 20 keV for the I-spin forbidden width to J=ss+ss\Gamma . The
   branching ratios into proton antiproton of the 0, the O/0; O/1; O/2 and
   1P1 are approximately 10\Gamma 4 of the gluonic branching ratio.
   However the respective ratios for J= and jc are about 10\Gamma 3. One
   may expect the branching ratios to _pp for the D states to be no
   greater than 10\Gamma 4 of glue and potentially an order of magnitude
   less. We use the above estimates to compute cross sections to J=
   inclusive where the J= decays to an electron pair. For both states we
   take the rather pessimistic _pp branching ratio of 10\Gamma 5. We find
   100 pb for the peak 3D2 cross section and 10 pb for the peak 1D2 cross
   9 section. The acceptance of our detector for a J= inclusive state is
   approximately 0.5 as demonstrated in our 1P1 discovery. The expected
   cross sections for the D2 states are similar to the approximately 15 pb
   (acceptance corrected) that we found for the I spin violating J=sso
   decay of the 1P1. The expected width for the 3D2 is comparable to the !
   1M eV we found for the 1P1. The background to J= inclusive in the 1P1
   and j0c regions is approximately 6 pb. One would expect it to be
   roughly the same in the D region and conclude that the J= inclusive
   decay is our best channel. The strategy of the search for the D2 state
   will be the same as for the 1P1; take 1-2 pb\Gamma 1 of luminosity at
   intervals separated by 1-2 MeV over the region of interest which is
   approximately 30 MeV, requiring about 50 pb\Gamma 1 of integrated
   luminosity. It is worth noting that the discovery of the 1P1 has
   "sharpened" the predictive power of theory. One expects that the
   anticipated discovery of the j0c will give theory better capability to
   accurately predict the D2 state masses. Since we plan to find the j0c
   before starting the search for the D states, it may be possible to
   discover the D states with less integrated luminosity than suggested
   above. An important piece of physics which is related to the D state
   search is the measurement of the excitation cross section for D and _D
   mesons (open charm). This can be done with a trigger similar to the J=
   inclusive trigger, namely an inclusive trigger on relatively low mass
   electron positron pairs to observe events in which both D mesons have
   semileptonic decays into electrons. Data is taken above _DD threshold
   (which includes the data for the D state search) plus some running
   below threshold to establish as "charmless" baseline. 10 4. Other
   measurements done concurrently with the main charmonium program Light
   Quark Spectroscopy As a result of triggering on the total energy
   deposited in the central calorimeter, we have accquired in parallel
   with the Charmonium data a large number of events where light mesons
   were produced. We first illustrate with some examples the nature of the
   data, and then discuss possibilities for extending these studies.
   Results from the 1991 run We show first data from the processes: _p + p
   ! 3ssffi, 2ssffi+j and ssffi+2j. Fig. 5 a,b show the 2ssffi mass
   spectrum for the 3ssffi and 2ssffi + j channels respectively for
   cos`\Lambda X in the range 0.2 - 0.6. Apart from the well known
   f2(1270) resonance, the 3ssffi data shows clearly the f2(1520) recently
   seen in annihilation at rest [20], and further structures at higher
   mass, which have not been previously seen in antiproton annihilation.
   We also observe an f2(1520) signal in the 2ssffi+j channel. Measurement
   of the relative production of f2(1520) in these two channels is
   important, in view of its possible interpretation as a 4-quark or
   quasi-nuclear bound state [21] [22]. Unlike the 2ssffi case, the 2j
   spectrum (Fig. 5 c) is almost completely unknown. The features of this
   are a narrow state at 1500 MeV, possibly the f2(1520), and a striking
   enhancement at 2.1 GeV which does not correspond to any well-known
   state, though there exist in the literature [2] several observations of
   narrow states in this region. The channels already mentioned, with up
   to 6 clusters in the Central Calorimeter, are relatively well measured
   with the present detector. We are also able to study 3-body decays of
   mesons, (events with 8 photons) and the j+2ssffi system is a
   particularly interesting case. We show in Fig. 5 d the mass plot for
   the lowest mass j+2ssffi combination from the channel: _p + p ! 3ssffi
   + j. Here we see the j0(958) in its 3-body decay mode, and a clear
   signal 11 identified with the f1(1285). Future Program It is clear from
   what we have seen that this experiment can study a wide range of
   light-meson states, not possible anywhere else including LEAR. We now
   discuss some particularly interesting topics which we wish to pursue.
   Study of the f2(1520) Further investigation of this unique state, seen
   only in _pp annihilation, is clearly very important. A spin-parity
   analysis of the 2ss0 system is in progress, using the 1991 data. As
   well as this, measurement of its branching ratio to eg 2j, 4ss0 would
   obviously help in understanding its nature. Search for new States
   decaying to j+j, j+j0 and !+!. With a larger sample of data on these
   rarer channels, we will be able to clarify the status of some of the
   new states which have been reported, eg by the GAMS collaboration, and
   search for others. The interest here centers on glueballs and hybrid
   mesons which are predicted in the 2 GeV mass region. The f1(1285),
   f1(1420) and Search for Exotics The whole question of the nature of the
   a0(980), possibly a KK state, and its relation with the other states
   around the KK * threshold is extremely interesting. The mass-range
   1350-1500 MeV is known to contain several states eg f1(1420) and
   j(1440) decaying to a0(980) + ss, whose nature is quite controversial.
   We have also investigated the channel with 4ss0 + j in the final state
   which has been suggested as a possible place to look for exotic mesons
   in the 2-2.5 GeV mass range OE Physics Since we see a very clear !(783)
   signal, in the present data, we should be able to detect the OE(1020)
   in the same way, decaying to j+fl (B.R. = 1.28%). The ability to do
   this could lead to some very interesting physics, eg exotic states
   [21]. With the present solid-angle coverage, we are as yet unable to
   extract a significant OE signal. The inclusion of a Fitch Cerenkov
   Counter (see section 6 below) to detect OE ! K+K\Gamma in pairs would
   greatly enhance this physics, eg _p + p ! OE + OE + ss0, and studies of
   the OE + OE, OE + ss0 systems. 12 Topics with the Upgraded detector
   With the acceptance proposed for the 1P1 discussion in section 2, we
   will be able both to study an increased range of production angle of
   the states, and to eliminate background due to unseen products. We
   illustrate this using the process _p + p ! ss0 + X(1500), where X !
   2ss0. Fig. 6 shows the acceptance for various ranges of angular
   coverage, generating decays of the X according to phase-space. The
   present detector covers the range 10ffi \Gamma 70ffi . We see that
   including the forward cone, 3ffi\Gamma 70ffi, gives very little
   increase in acceptance (15%), without also covering the backward
   direction. On the other hand extending our coverage in the range 70ffi
   \Gamma 140ffi, as described in section 2, gives a 270% increase in
   acceptance. In general, backward produced particles will have low
   energy, with photon energies up to a few hundred MeV. In the present
   data, these constitute a background which cannot be eliminated by
   kinematic fitting, given our resolution, and are particularly serious
   for rarer channels eg involving j0 or !(783), and for higher
   multiplicity final states. Thus the proposed enlargement of the
   detector will make an enormous difference to the quality of the data in
   most of the channels mentioned above. The Drell-Yan process and 4-quark
   states It has been suggested that Drell-Yan produced electron-positron
   pairs in antiproton annihilation might be accompanied by 4- quark
   mesons [23]. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation using the geometry
   of our present detector are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a is the expected
   invariant mass of the e+e\Gamma pair and Fig. 7b the recoil mass. We
   have analysed a sample of approximately 440nb\Gamma 1 from the 1991 0
   scan, selecting clean e+e\Gamma pairs. The mass distributions are shown
   in Figs 7c, 7d. The measured crosssection for e+e\Gamma masses greater
   than 1 GeV is found to be approximately 15% of the expected value, 0.8
   nb [23], probably due to the fact that the trigger was optimized for
   higher-mass e+e\Gamma pairs. In future runs we expect to be able to
   collect several hundred thousand Drell-Yan events, 13 which will enable
   us to make an effective search for such 4-quark states. At the same
   time, we wil be able to study cleanly the spectrum of vector mesons in
   the 1-2 GeV region, by means of their e+e\Gamma decay mode.
   Electromagnetic form factors of the proton The electromagnetic form
   factors of the proton have been measured, for the first time at high q2
   in the time-like region by E760 [24]. The uncertainty on the
   experimental point at the highest energy was around 35%. With the
   proposed increase in the total integrated luminosity we expect to
   improve this measurement to 10%. 5. Luminosity upgrade The upgrade
   program of the E760 internal target system Performance of the present
   system. A diagram of the target system of E760 is shown in Fig. 8. The
   system consists of the expansion stage, the sink stage, two
   differential pumping stages on each side and an additional pumping
   system acting on the accumulator vacuum chamber. A schematic view of
   the system is shown in Fig. 9. The nozzle geometry has been designed
   for the following expansion conditions: T= 77o K, (liquid nitrogen) and
   P= 12 bar; it has a diameter of 25 _m and a special geometric shape
   (trumpet nozzle). Out of a flux of 10 torr\Theta liter/sec of molecular
   hydrogen (H2) passing the nozzle throat, the useful fraction of H2 in
   cluster form is about 1%. This corresponds to a target density of ,
   0:75\Theta 1014 atoms/cm3 The transverse shape of the beam is shown in
   Fig. 10. During the 1991 running the lifetime of the antiproton beam
   was determined by the target density (that is the amount of gas flowing
   in the 'jet'), by the amount of gas entering the experiment vacuum
   chamber but not absorbed by the sink system ( diffused gas ) and by the
   residual gas present in the Antiproton Accumulator vacuum chamber. 14
   The Target upgrade program. For the next run we propose to increase the
   density of the internal target. The power of the proton cooling system
   of the Antiproton Accumulator is such that a value of the target
   density larger than 1014 atoms/cm3 of H2 can be envisaged. An upgrade
   of the cooling system of the Accumulator could give us the possibility
   to use even larger densities. The increased target density can be
   obtained with new conditions for the expansion parameters. A lower
   temperature of the nozzle (with respect to the present 77oK value)
   will: 1) increase the efficiency of the process of clusterization; 2)
   reduce the speed of the H2 clusters (the speed is proportional to pT )
   hence increase the target density. In fact the target density is
   inversely proportional to the speed of the clusters. The new expansion
   system is being designed as a collaboration of the Genoa group and the
   Fermilab Research Division. It will use a cryogenerator to cool the
   nozzle to a temperature in the range 20-25o K. This will require a
   complete modification of the exsisting expansion stage. The nozzle will
   be directly attached to the cold finger of the cryogenerator and the
   first skimmer will be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Using the
   same flux (10 torr \Theta liter/sec) and the same geometry for the
   collimation of the cluster beam, we should obtain a target density
   increase of 2.5. A preliminary design of the new expansion stage is
   shown in Fig. 11. To implement this modification in the actual target
   system we need also to change the mechanics for the pumping in the
   expansion chamber. This requires the construction of two new vacuum
   fittings but no major modification of the gas jet proper. Antiproton
   beam The typical beam lifetime, peak luminosity and gas jet intensity
   achieved during the 1991 fixed target run is summarized in Table 3 o/on
   and o/off are beam lifetime with gas jet on and off respectively. L0
   and d are peak luminosity and gas jet density respectively. 15 Table 3:

   source during the collider run is to increase the _p stacking rate by a
   factor of 3 from 2 \Theta 1010/hr achieved at the end of 1989 collider
   run to 6 \Theta 1010/hr after the Linac upgrade. We will assume that
   the _p beam intensity for this experiment will be 3 times higher than
   the 1991 fixed target run in the following. We have calculated the
   running conditions to produce the maximum integrated luminosity as a
   function of gas jet density and the results are given in Table 4. Table
   4: Optimal Integrated Luminosity d(1014Atoms cm\Gamma 2) Integrated
   Luminosity 0.35 L 2 \Theta 0:35 53L 3 \Theta 0:35 2L The integrated
   luminosity is optimized with the assumption that the overhead for
   deceleration and change over between data taking and _p stacking is 16
   hours and the beam lifetime as a function of gas jet density is
   calculated from o/on and o/off in Table 3. In all cases, the optimal
   data taking time is ss 1 beam lifetime. Note that the integrated
   luminosity does not scale with the gas jet density because the beam
   lifetime is almost inversely proportional to gas jet density. We see
   that the goal of improving the integrated luminosity by a factor of 5
   can be achieved if both the gas jet density and beam intensity increase
   by a factor of 3. 16 The RMS emittance growth due to beam-gas
   scattering and intrabeam scattering has been calculated and the results
   are given in Table 5. The beam intensity is taken to be 40 mA. The 95 %
   emittance is 2ss mm-mrad ( RMS ffl = 0:33 mm-mrad). oe p P is 5:6
   \Theta 10 \Gamma 5 and 1:5 \Theta 10\Gamma 3 for 1P1 and jc
   respectively. Note that at both energies, even in the case that the gas
   jet is on, the intrabeam scattering dominates the beam gas scattering.

   \Theta 10\Gamma 5 10:5 \Theta 10\Gamma 5 15:4 \Theta 10\Gamma 5 In the
   scenario that the beam intensity will be a factor of 3 higher (i.e. 120
   mA), the beam heating due to intrabeam scattering will also increase by
   a factor of 3. But the stochastic cooling rate will be reduced by a
   factor of 3 because the cooling rate is inversely proportional to the
   beam intensity. To maintain the same emittances as in 1991 with three
   times more beam, the stochastic cooling system needs to be improved by
   a factor of 9 (3 for intrabeam scattering increase, 3 for cooling rate
   decrease). S!,=nT as a function of ,G is plottedy in Fig. 12. S! is the
   stochastic cooling rate at the center of symmetric beam frequency
   distribution f (!), G is the system gain and , = ssN f (!)=nT where N
   is the total number of beam particles and nT is the total number of
   Schottky bands in the stochastic cooling frequency bandwidth. S!,=nT is
   proportional to the cooling rate times the beam intensity. We would
   like to increase it by a factor of 9. We typically ran the cooling
   system at ss 1db signal suppression which corresponds to S!,=nT = 0:6.
   We see from the figure that it is possible to increase the cooling by a
   factor of 2. To get a factor of 9 improvement, a 8-16 GHz bandwidth
   system which corresponds to increase nT by a factor of 2 and thus the
   cooling rate by a factor of 4 is required. yJoseph Bisognano and
   Christoph Leeman, LBL-14106 17 The 8-16 GHz bandwidth system will cool
   the beam to the same emittances as we had during the 1991 run. Without
   this system, even when optimized, the beam emittances will be
   considerably larger than in 1991. We estimate the transverse emittance
   will be ss 4ss mm-mrad and oe p P ss 4:2 \Theta 10 \Gamma 4. This leads
   to a transverse size (95% containment) of the beam at the interaction
   region of \Sigma 0:5 cm and \Gamma B = 1:5 MeV/c2 in the center of mass
   at 1P1 which is unacceptably large. In Table 6 are summarized the
   values of the parameters which optimize the integrated luminosity for
   three values of the target density. In the last line are given the
   integrated luminosities that one can obtain in a 3 month run. Table 6:

   particle detectors: To face the higher instantaneous luminosity and
   have good background rejection we have to make improvements to the
   charged particle detection 18 of E760. The general characteristics we
   need are the following. ffl Fast response and short dead time ffl Good
   angular resolution of the order of 3 mrad in both ` and OE. ffl
   Redundancy in both ` and OE measurement, in order to maintain efficient
   performance if one layer is missing ffl dE=dx measurement ffl Small
   thickness (few % of a radiation length) To fulfill these requirements
   using as much as possible of the existing E760 detectors, we propose to
   build a tracking system completely contained inside the ^Cerenkov
   counter (see Fig. 13 and 14) consisting of the following elements: ffl
   The existing H1 hodoscope ffl A four layer straw tube drift chamber,
   with stereo view for z(`) and OE measurement. ffl A 24-fold
   scintillator hodoscope (H20) to be used in coincidence with H1 as a
   veto for neutral trigger. Its thickness (4 mm) will also provide a
   measurement of dE=dx with the same resolution as the existing H2. ffl A
   silicon strip detector with cylindrical geometry for z(`) and dE=dx
   measurement. ffl A modified version of the existing RPC with the drift
   path reduced to , 1 cm for OE measurement. ffl The existing MWPC for
   z(`) measurement and adding wire readout to solve right-left ambiguity
   in the RPC drift time measurement. ffl The existing H2 hodoscope for
   triggering and dE=dx measurement. 19 The overall small radius of the
   charged detector allows us to track the K\Sigma coming from the decay
   of (cc) ! OEOE without significant decay losses. The expected
   performances of each element are summarized in Table 7 Table 7:

   320/4=80 (OE) H2 16.2 16.8 - - 60% 32 In the following we give a short
   description of the new proposed detectors. Straws The new straw chamber
   will be composed of 2 modules, each of them containing one tilted (with
   10 degrees stereo angle) and one straight layer, both supported by the
   same structure. Each layer will contain 80 mylar tubes. The tubes range
   in diameter from 4.4 to 6.1 mm. Each tube will have a drift time
   measurement, requiring a total of 320 TDC channels with the standard
   front-end electronics. The OE measurement will be obtained from the
   radial drift time in the coaxial tubes, while 20 the z measurement will
   use the stereo angle between the different layers. In order to solve
   left-right ambiguities and to reduce the inefficiency of the detector
   due to the cracks between adjacent tubes, the two modules will be
   staggered by half element. The single layer inefficiency of the tilted
   layer, due to the increased distance between tubes at the endcaps, is
   of the order of 5%. The existing E760 gas system will be used for the
   new chamber. Silicon barrel The silicon barrel will have an internal
   radius of 9.5 cm, an external radius of 11 cm and a length of 38.4 cm.
   It will be composed of 24 slabs of silicon strips (3 cm\Theta 2
   mm\Theta 280 _m). The detectors will be supported by 24 multilayer
   printed circuit boards which will also contain the read-out
   electronics. In order to avoid inefficiencies due to cracks, the boards
   will be positioned at two different radii with a small overlap. The
   overall thickness is expected to be ,2 % of a radiation length. The
   total number of strips is 4608, 196 per slab. The proposed read-out is
   a chain developed at CERN [25] by which the analog pulses from the
   strips are read out using a pulse stretching method which allows for
   serial-parallel multiplexing. The electronic chain is composed of two
   parts: ffl close to the detector: integrating preamplifier,
   track-and-hold circuit, analog multiplexer, driving amplifier; ffl at
   the counting room: receiving amplifier, ADC and buffer memory. A
   complete readout cycle takes ' 100_s. Calorimeter upgrades The
   Calorimeters, particularly the Central Calorimeter which is the crucial
   element in the 21 experiment apparatus, worked very well throughout
   E-760. There were essentially no hardware failures, the energy
   resolution was adequate and most importantly the segmentation proved
   adequate for determining event topologies and for obtaining the
   designed rejection of symmetric ss0's simulating single photons. The
   upgrades to the calorimeters are motivated by the same requirement as
   our desire to increase the instantaneous luminosity. That is we wish to
   identify and measure states of smaller cross-section, particularly in
   the flfl decay mode. We concentrate here on decays such as j0c ! flfl.
   Given the excellent rejection of symmetric ss0's, the major improvement
   in background rejection available is in the detection of the low energy
   photon from asymmetric ss0 decays. Table 8 shows the signal to
   background expected at the j0c for an acceptance with jcos `cmj ^ 0:4
   for various values of the energy threshold for detecting a photon.
   Table 8: Signal/Background as a Function of Photon Energy Threshold at
   the j0c Energy Threshold Signal/ (MeV) Background 0 8.8 20 2.9 25 2.6
   50 1.3 75 0.8 100 0.5 In the case of the j0c we first have to find the
   mass of the state. Fig. 15 shows the luminosity needed per point of an
   energy scan to observe a three sigma effect in the measured
   cross-section as a function of the signal to background ratio. It
   should be noted that the vertical axis scales as n2 where n is the
   number of sigma desired for the observed effect. Below a
   signal-to-background ratio of ss 3, the luminosity required increases
   rapidly. Referring to table 8 this leads to our goal of a 20 MeV
   threshold. Analysis of our present data shows 22 an effective threshold
   of about 30 MeV. There is enough light generated in the lead-glass to
   allow us to detect energy deposits down to 10 MeV and we need to
   increase the dynamic range of our signals compared to the noise level
   in the system. For much of the array, this can be achieved with our
   present ADC's; we are studying the issue in detail for the forward part
   of the apparatus but do not anticipate any major difficulties here
   either. A much more serious concern arises from the increase in
   interaction rate which could lead to event pile-up. Since the
   experiment depends on identifying exclusive channels, one approach
   might be simply to reject from consideration any events which do not
   have the exact characteristics of the specified mode. For example,
   events which do not have exactly two energy deposits would be excluded
   from searches for j0c ! flfl unless we could identify the extra energy
   deposit as being out of time. We have calculated the effect of such a
   cut using our present data by taking a very clean and large signal, the
   O/2 ! + fl; ! e+e\Gamma . Table 9 shows the efficiency for the O/2
   signal as a function of the energy threshold for identifying deposits
   as out-of-time at the E-760 luminosity and at the P-835 luminosity.
   Table 9: Efficiency versus the threshold for identifying energy as
   Out-of-Time Threshold Efficiency at Efficiency at (MeV) 1031=cm2 5
   \Theta 1031=cm2 20 1.0 1.0 25 0.94 0.71 35 0.89 0.55 50 0.83 0.40 100
   0.76 0.25 200 0.71 0.18 In the E-760 setup, we have latches on sums of
   8 blocks with effective threshold of 200 MeV. It is clear that at the
   luminosity we need it is essential to identify the timing of energy 23
   deposits as small as 20 MeV. There are several ways to achieve this
   under consideration including ADC's with an early gate on each channel
   and putting a discriminator on each channel with its output going to
   either a TDC or a latch with a narrow (! 20ns) gate at the event time.
   In all cases, this implies a fairly significant increase in the amount
   of electronics per channel. The number of channels (1500) involved,
   however, is relatively modest. We will make a choice based on
   effectiveness, including the amount of data to be read out, and
   feasibility of implementation considering time and cost. Trigger System
   The trigger system is made of two levels: 1) level 1 is a fast logic
   trigger (, 100 nsec) to select: a) events with electron pairs and/or fl
   pairs with large invariant mass (O/0;1;2;1 P1; 0;1 D2;3 D2 ! J=(!
   e+e\Gamma ) + X, J= ! e+e\Gamma ; O/0;2; jc; j0c ! flfl;1 P1 ! jc(!
   flfl)fl); b) neutral final states with a large fraction of the total
   energy deposited in the calorimeters ( jc; j0c ! jjj; jssosso;1 P1 !
   jc(! jjj; jssosso)fl) and annihilation processes into any combinations
   of sso; j; j0; ! c) four charged tracks with two close pairs (jc ! OE(!
   K+K\Gamma )OE(! K+K\Gamma );1 P1 ! jc(! OEOE ! 4K\Sigma )fl); d) two
   body reaction final states (_pp ! _pp; ss+ss\Gamma ; K+K\Gamma ) with
   prescaling. The total rate at the first trigger level output has to be
   contained below ~10 kHz, which is the limit of the manageable rate of
   the Level 2 trigger. 2) level 2 trigger is based on a set of * 6 VME
   processors, which is described in the DAQ upgrade subsection. For
   simplicity, the description of the logic will be divided into two
   subsystems: a) the 24 charged trigger, based on the scintillator
   hodoscopes and the ^Cerenkov counter; b) the calorimeter trigger, using
   summed outputs of the calorimeter signals. Charged Trigger Description
   Based on the experience gained from E760, the charged trigger will be
   mainly used, together with the calorimeter trigger, to obtain fast and
   effective selection of events with an electron pair of large invariant
   mass. This event category includes several interesting decay channels
   from J=; 0; O/0;1;2;1 P1;1;3 D2. The hadronic decay chain jc ! OEOE !
   2K+2K\Gamma will be selected by a different logic using the charged
   trigger elements. The hodoscopes signals will also be used as a veto in
   the neutral trigger logic. We propose some changes with respect to
   E760, with the aim of being better equipped to cope with higher
   luminosity and of improving our background rejection. As in E760,
   plastic scintillator hodoscopes H1(8 counters) and H2 (32 counters),
   coaxial to the beam line, will signal the passage of charged tracks,
   the gas threshold ^Cerenkov counter will be used to tag electrons, and
   the forward counters will veto tracks at small polar angle. No
   modifications are envisaged for these detectors, except possibly a new
   light collection system for H2. To allow room for the new backward
   detectors, we are investigating the possibility of reading this
   hodoscope out at the downstream end of the apparatus. From what was
   learnt from E760, maximum benefit for the experiment comes from a
   careful mix of the charged and calorimeter triggers. Electron
   identification, a powerful feature of the charged trigger, combines
   very effectively with the energy measurement capability and uniformity
   of response of the calorimeter, providing high selectivity and good
   efficiency over the large acceptance of the experiment. (a) For the
   e+e\Gamma trigger, we will keep the same logic that worked well in E760
   as the OR of 3 subtriggers: 1) T (1)e+e\Gamma = (H1 \Theta H2sect
   \Theta C)i \Theta (H1 \Theta H2sect \Theta C)j \Theta mult(H2) \Theta
   copl(H2) \Theta P BG1 25 where: H2sect is the OR of a number of H2
   elements corresponding in azimuthal angle to a given H1 element,
   mult(H2) is a requirement on the H2 multiplicity; copl(H2) is a
   requirement on two tracks coplanarity as found by H2, P BG1 is a
   calorimeter trigger, requiring two clusters above threshold with large
   (? 90ffi) azimuthal opening. 2) T (2)e+e\Gamma = (H1 \Theta H2sect
   \Theta C)i \Theta (H1 \Theta H2sect)j \Theta mult(H2) \Theta copl(H2)
   \Theta P BG1 where everything is the same as in T (1)e+e\Gamma except
   for a tighter H2 multiplicity requirement. This will be implemented to
   monitor the Cherenkov efficiency. 3) T (3)e+e\Gamma as T (1)e+e\Gamma
   without requirements on P BG1 and a tighter H2 multiplicity constraint.
   This last trigger will be implemented to monitor the calorimeter
   efficiency. (b) In order to trigger on OEOE final states, a special
   logic will be implemented, based on a scheme already tested for a short
   period in E760. We plan to have the following charged trigger: TOEOE =
   (H1 \Theta H2sect)i \Theta (H1 \Theta H2sect)j \Theta mult(H2) \Theta
   copl(H2) \Theta veto \Theta clust(H2) \Theta mult(H1) \Theta CCAL(ring1
   ! ring5) where: mult(H2)=3 or 4 is a requirement on the H2
   multiplicity, clust(H2) = 2 or (3 and 1 gap) is a requirement on the H2
   pattern, that there be either two clusters of H2 counters or 3 clusters
   with a gap of 1 counter between two of the clusters, veto includes the
   new backward detector and the forward veto hodoscopes, mult(H1) ! 4 is
   a requirement on the H1 multiplicity, CCAL(ring1 ! ring5) is a
   calorimeter veto to exclude from the acceptance regions where the
   background is expected to be high and the signal small. We collect in
   Table 10 the projected trigger rates for selected reactions. For
   e+e\Gamma X, the rates are projections from E760 measured rates to P835
   luminosities. For OEOE and OEOEfl, the rates are obtained from E760
   test runs and simulations of a number of background reactions
   accounting for more than 50 % of the measured rate. Altogether, the
   quoted rates are estimated to be realistic within a factor 2. 26 Table

   and Montecarlo Neutral Trigger The Neutral Trigger hardware in E-760
   consisted of two major items: a total energy sum of all 1280 counters
   in the Central calorimeter and a set of 40 energy 'sums' (8 in OE and 5
   in `) of 40 counters. The energy sum was required to exceed a given
   threshold (typically 90% of the available energy) and was used for
   inclusive neutral events. The cluster sums were used for two body
   decays by setting a ` dependent threshold on the sums and requiring two
   sums to fire with \Delta OE ? 90ffi. This scheme produced a trigger
   rate of ss 1 kHz into the Level 2 microprocessors. While we plan to
   improve the rate capability of the electronics where necessary, we do
   not anticipate a major improvement in rejection. As a consequence, the
   event read-out time must be reduced and the level 2 processing power
   increased to cope with the increased data to avoid excessive dead-time.
   This is described in the next section. An aspect of the neutral trigger
   which will require hardware improvements is the charged particle veto
   and a new detector, the H20 scintillator hodoscope, has been designed
   to this end. In E760, the veto action was performed by H1, which was
   built explicitly to match 27 the polar acceptance of the central
   calorimeter. However, we found a serious problem with this since the
   total H1 rate is affected by the large ffi-ray production in the
   source, resulting in a sizeable random veto. The new H20 will have
   higher segmentation and the same polar acceptance as H1, covering `
   down to 9ffi, the veto action being performed by the coincidence
   H1\Theta H20. (On the other hand, we will keep the existing H2, rather
   than H20, to define the polar acceptance of the charged trigger, in
   order to avoid the large increase in trigger rate coming from small
   angles and to match the ^Cerenkov acceptance.) We are also considering
   the usefulness of inserting another anticounter array just around the
   beam pipe, in order to veto against beam-gas interactions downstream
   the target. This would consist of 8 scintillator bars placed along the
   beam pipe, with the same readout structure as H2 and H20. Data
   Acquisition upgrade Experiment E760 collected data at a maximum trigger
   rate of 1 kHz with a 15% deadtime. A new high rate data acquisition
   system is necessary for the next run due to the anticipated 5-fold
   increase in instantaneous luminosity. The major upgrades that will be
   done within the next two years are described below. In E760 the CAMAC
   crates were read-out through their CAMAC back-plane to Fermilab RBUF
   buffers via the Fermilab Smart Crate Controllers. Most of these crates
   contain the LeCroy Fera ADCs which provide a fast readout via their ECL
   port. This readout can reach a speed of 100 ns/word which is 10 times
   faster than the corresponding readout via the CAMAC dataway. To speed
   up the readout, P835 plans to read-out all its data via the ECL port
   and is selecting its electronics accordingly. The Fermilab RBUF buffers
   will be replaced by 8 Q+ modules. These new buffers are integrated I/O
   controller and dual ported VME memory modules being designed and
   implemented by the Fermilab Computing Division. These modules are
   single width, 6-U high, VME-resident units, capable of sustaining an
   overall throughput rate of 20 Mbytes/sec. 28 The maximum expected data
   rate for P835 is about 5 Mbytes/sec. Buffer management is handled by a
   local processor. The Q+ modules comply fully with the VME slave
   interface specifications, providing for random or block transfer
   operations. 23 ACP modules served as the Level 2 processors for E-760.
   These will be replaced by a system of a at least 6 Motorola MVME167
   single board computers, running VxWorks as operating system. The
   MVME167 is based on the MC68040 microprocessor which is about 25 times
   faster than the ACP one. It has SCSI and Ethernet ports and provides
   for block transfers over the VME backplane at a rate of 20 Mbytes/sec.
   The total CPU power of the system (100 MIPS) is more than 6 times the
   one available in E760. A test is under way to estimate the exact number
   of the MVME167 modules. Space is available in the VME crate for up to 5
   additional modules, which would almost double the CPU power of the
   system, in case more CPU power is needed. The experiment plans to rely
   on the Fermilab computing division to provide general system and
   environment support for code development and the use of VxWorks. The
   system will be configured in a way similar to the ACPs. One MVME167
   will be the "boss" and the rest the "slaves". The "boss" will poll the
   "slaves" and assign one at a time as "master" of the VME. The "master"
   will read the data from the buffers while the other "slaves" are
   analyzing and filtering events. When a "slave" finishes filtering the
   events in its input buffer, it informs the "boss" which reads the
   "slave's" output buffer. The "slave" will then wait to be assigned as
   "master". The "boss" logs the data to 8mm tapes, in the drives
   connected to its SCSI port. The "slave" also sends its data over its
   Ethernet port to a pool in a Unix workstation. Monitor programs running
   in that workstation read the data from the pool and fill histograms.
   The number of tape drives depends on the filtering factor achieved by
   the processors and on the maximum logging rate of the drive. The data
   rates logged by E760 are given in Table 11. Given rewind and reload
   time, two sets of three of the new Exabyte EXB-8500 tape drives are
   estimated to be sufficient. The "run control" program resides in the
   host Unix workstation. It initializes the proces29 Table 11: Trigger

   program displays the status of the Data Acquisition and any errors the
   processors may detect. The E760 filtering code will be updated and
   converted to C to be compatible with the VxWorks operating system. The
   initialization of the CAMAC crates will still be done from a Vaxstation
   3100 through two Jorway parallel branches and A-2 crate controllers. In
   all this scheme, the experiment is relying on being able to use the
   software being developed by the Online Support group in the Computing
   Divisions under the DART project. The data acquisition architecture for
   P835 is shown in Fig. 16. 7. Other measurements In this section we
   discuss measurements which require some modification of the
   experimental setup. Such modifications will present a serious
   disruption in data taking and will not be undertaken before the higher
   priority items are accomplished. OEOE final states Events with two OE
   in the final state are interesting from a variety of points of view: 1)
   study of the jc through the decay jc ! OEOE is complementary to that
   done with jc ! flfl 30 providing additional information on the
   resonance width (, 40% error with 20 pb\Gamma 1). It also yields a
   precise measurement (, 25%) of the product of the branching ratios to
   _pp and to OEOE. The detected peak cross section, of the order of 130
   pb, compares favourably with the , 30 pb of the two photon channel;
   however the signal/background ratio is estimated to be 2-3 times
   smaller, as the resonance sits over a continuum of annihilations into
   OEOE. [26] 2) As a by-product of the jc studies, several thousand non
   resonant annihilations into 2OE will be collected allowing a high
   statistic study of this OZI suppressed reaction. 3) The search for the
   decay 1P1 ! jcfl may profit from detection of the jc from its 2OE
   decay. The signal is estimated to be 9 pb, and the background is of
   instrumental origin and is estimated from Monte Carlo to be about two
   times the signal. 4) the study of the OEOEsso channel will allow a
   search for exotic OEOE states. With the P-835 apparatus as discussed,
   the OE can only be detected through its charged decay to K+K\Gamma ;
   detection of a double OE therefore implies detecting 4 charged K's in
   the final state, possibly with an extra photon or sso. The detection of
   these states is a rather formidable task from the point of view of the
   hadronic suppression both at the trigger level and in the offline
   analysis. This is based on topological filters and on a 2C kinematical
   fit, with the 4K momenta unknown and good angular resolution (, 3 mrad)
   is therefore required. Due to the low Q value of the OE decay and to
   the narrow width of the OE , the real events have very special
   configurations and the fit is highly selective against background.
   Nevertheless it has been proved by R704, with a similar apparatus and
   technique, that at Ecm ' 3 GeV a background of the same order of the
   signal survives all cuts and must be statistically subtracted [26]. At
   the jc formation energy, we have the option of using a special
   ^Cerenkov Fitch-type spherical glass counter [27] (based on total
   internal reflection) acting as a charged ss veto (see Fig. 17). This
   instrument in the version that is being built would replace the gas
   threshold Cherenkov counter. The Fitch counter can distinguish
   particles with fi ! 0:92 from particles 31 with fi ? 0:94 and is
   capable of reducing the first level trigger rate by a factor 4. It may
   also prove very valuable to reject the background surviving all the
   filters of the offline analysis and thus to improve substantially the
   signal to noise ratio. The rates quoted in section 6 do not account for
   the Fitch counter veto reduction. Charmonium-Nucleon cross sections
   Meson-nucleon cross sections constitute some of the most basic
   experimental information about hadronic interactions. However, the
   existing experimental knowledge stops at pions and kaons; essentially
   nothing reliable is known about nucleon collisions with mesons
   containing charm or beauty quarks. Theoretical understanding of
   meson-nucleon interactions is even more meager, being limited to the
   rather ad-hoc potential models. The interaction between nucleons and
   heavy mesons which do not contain up or down quarks must be mediated by
   pure gluon exchange, and experimental studies of these collisions can
   be expected to lead to new insight into the fundamental nature of the
   interaction. Measurements of charmonium-nucleon cross sections would
   provide just such data. In addition to the intrinsic importance common
   to all charmonium-nucleon cross sections, the J=-nucleon cross sections
   have recently acquired an importance all their own. This arises from
   the identification of the suppression of J= production as the unique
   signal for quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions. It has
   been proposed [28] that in the presence of a quark-gluon plasma color
   screening would prevent the binding of a produced c_c pair into a J=
   (or 0), leading to the suppression of J= production. A suppression of
   J= production has indeed been observed in oxygen and sulphur collisions
   with uranium in the CERN experiment NA-38,[29] and has been interpreted
   as evidence for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma, or at least an
   approach to it [30]. The observed suppression can be explained in more
   conventional terms of nuclear attenuation if J=-nucleon total cross
   sections are as large as ss 10mb, instead of being ss 2mb, as is
   usually assumed. The small values of J=-nucleon cross sections come
   from a Glauber type of analysis of photoproduction of J= on nuclear
   targets at 50-200 GeV. However, as Brodsky and Mueller [31] have
   pointed 32 out, these values "have little to do with J= scattering on a
   nucleon". The reason is 'color transparency'. The c_c pair produced at
   these energies exits the nucleus long before it has time to grow to the
   transverse dimension of a J= [o/formation = 1f m \Theta pfl (GeV )].
   The 'small' c_c pair has very small color dipole moment and therefore a
   very small interaction cross section with nucleons. As Brodsky and
   Mueller have pointed out, the best way to measure the true J=-nucleon
   cross section is to produce the c_c pair with such small momentum that
   the J= is formed well within the nucleus, and the color transparency
   effect is kept at a minimum level. Resonant production of J= with _p
   incident on a nucleus is therefore the ideal method. The J=-nucleon
   cross section measurement can be made easily by E760. Except for the
   broadening of the J= due to the Fermi motion of the protons bound in a
   nucleus, the kinematics of the reaction is identical to that of J=
   production on a free proton. The same trigger - J= ! e+e\Gamma can be
   used. Only the hydrogen-gas jet target needs to be replaced by a
   heavy-gas jet target. Such targets of gases as heavy as krypton are in
   routine operation in several laboratories, e.g., in the ADONE ring at
   Frascatti. We have studied the feasability of such targets at E760 and
   have concluded that targets of gases as heavy as neon can indeed be
   used with the stochastically cooled antiprotons in the FNAL antiproton
   accumulator. If the proton density in the heavy-gas jet[Zaeatomic] is
   kept the same as that in the hydrogen jet, the beam lifetime is
   expected to be the same as that for the hydrogen jet. In changing from
   hydrogen to a heavy-gas only the temperature of the gas jet needs to be
   changed. As mentioned elsewhere in the proposal, the existing jet
   source is being modified to accomodate a cryogenic refrigerator to cool
   the jet nozzle to the desired temperature. This will enable us to
   produce heavy- gas jet targets very conveniently, and to change gases
   without interfering with the circulating beam. Fermi broadening of the
   J= resonance in a nucleus is estimated to reduce the peak cross section
   over that for protons by a factor of ss 103. With an instantaneous
   luminosity of ZL = 5 \Theta 1031cm\Gamma 2sec\Gamma 1 expected in 1994,
   this gives ss 1000J= detected /day at the J= peak. This means that a
   five point scan of the Fermi broadened peak can be done in a typical 33
   beam lifetime of about 72 hours. Two or three different nuclear targets
   can be studied in about a week. Measurements with different nuclear
   targets are useful in confirming that our measurements are indeed
   uncontaminated by color transparency effects. It is worth noting that
   it is also of interest to determine the 0-nucleon cross section at
   least for one nucleus to see how different it is from the J= - nucleon
   cross section. The 0-nucleon cross section is expected to be up to four
   times larger because of the almost factor two larger radius of 0 .
   However, despite this increase, these measurements are expected to be
   slower by nearly a factor 20 because of the much lower cross section
   for the reaction on the free proton. 34 Appendix In Table 12 a
   comparison is shown between the estimates given in the previous version
   of the P835 proposal[1] for cross sections, efficiencies and the
   luminosities required for the planned experiments and the actual
   measurements subsequently made in the 1991 part of the fixed-target run
   of E760. The percent errors refer to the measurements of branching
   fractions for the corresponding channels. The ' ??' mean that no
   estimate was given. Table 12: Comparison of predicted and measured
