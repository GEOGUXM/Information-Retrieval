   The Tennessee State Quarter Home Page

   The Tennssee Quarter

   The Tennessee quarter, the first quarter of 2002 and sixteenth in the
   series, celebrates the state's contributions to our nation's musical
   heritage. The design incorporates musical instruments and a score with
   the inscription "Musical Heritage." Three stars represent Tennessee's
   three regions and the instruments symbolize each region's distinct
   musical style.

   The fiddle represents the Appalachian music of east Tennessee, the
   trumpet stands for the blues of west Tennessee for which Memphis is
   famous, and the guitar is for central Tennessee, home to Nashville, the
   capital of country music.

   On March 27, 2000, Governor Don Sundquist announced a statewide contest
   for students, artists, and citizens to submit design concepts by June
   1, 2000. The state received nearly 1,000 submissions. A seven-person
   Tennessee Coin Commission that the Governor created sent its three
   favorite concepts to the Mint on June 28, 2000. These included Musical
   Heritage, Ratification of the 19th Amendment and Sequoyah, the creator
   of the Cherokee writing system. On June 26, 2001, the Mint provided
   Governor Sundquist with five approved renditions of the concepts, from
   which he chose "Musical Heritage."
