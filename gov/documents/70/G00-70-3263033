          The Lab...

   The National Systematics Laboratory is administered by the Northeast
   Fisheries Science Center, but serves as the taxonomic research arm of
   NOAA Fisheries as a whole. The Laboratory describes and names new
   species, and revises existing descriptions and names based on new
   information, of fishes, squids, crustaceans, and corals of economic or
   ecological importance to the United States. Because some important
   species are highly migratory and many exotic species are introduced
   into U.S. waters or markets, the Laboratory's research is worldwide.
   Major products of this research are worldwide and regional taxonomic
   publications and identification guides.
