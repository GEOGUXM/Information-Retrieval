   The retirement plan for which the Public Health Service (PHS)
   Commissioned Corps officer is eligible depends upon the Date of Initial
   Entry To Military/Uniformed Services (DIEMS).  The DIEMS is the date
   that the member was first enlisted, commissioned, appointed, or
   inducted into a regular, reserve, or ROTC component of any Uniformed
   Service as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted
   member.  The DIEMS date is important because it affects the way each
   officer will have his/her retired pay calculated once he/she becomes
   qualified for retired pay.  In the spring of 2001, DCP officers were
   assigned a DIEMS, issued a personnel order and sent an information
   letter allowing them the opportunity to provide proof of a different
   DIEMS.

   CHOICE RETIREMENT: DIEMS August 1, 1986 TO PRESENT*

   HIGH 3 RETIREMENT: DIEMS September 8, 1980 TO July 31, 1986

   FINAL PAY RETIREMENT: DIEMS PRIOR TO September 7, 1980
          ________________________________________________________

   CHOICE (DIEMS August 1, 1986 to Present):

   Under this plan, active-duty officers may elect to accept a $30,000
   "Career Status Bonus (CSB)" at the completion of 15 years active-duty
   service and receive a reduced amount of pay  upon retirement. These
   officers must agree to complete 20 years of active service if the bonus
   is accepted. Failure to do so will result in recoupment of the unearned
   portions. Upon completion of 20 years, these officers may retire at 40%
   of the "HIGH 3" average base pay versus the 50% that would be received
   under the "HIGH 3" plan. Each subsequent year, the retired pay
   multiplier increases by 3.5% to a maximum of 75% at 30 years of
   service. Officers who accept this bonus will also receive annual
   retirement cost of living (COLA) adjustments reduced by 1% with a
   one-time catch-up at age 62.  If the CSB option is selected, time
   served as a civil servant will not be credited as active-duty service
   for the DIEMS determination nor does it count toward the 20 years of
   active duty required for the CSB retirement option. Further, accepting
   the CSB does not guarantee that the PHS will retain the member until
   the completion of 20 years of service nor does it infer any type of
   special career status.  Bonus payments will be made from program funds
   starting no earlier than October 2001.

   Officers who do not elect to accept this bonus will be retired under
   the "HIGH 3" plan.

   *If you believe your DIEMS should be between August 1, 1986 and
   December 31, 1986, and you have not received personnel orders
   indicating the same, please notify the Transactions and Application
   Section, DCP, at (877) INFO-DCP, select 1, dial 43544.

   HIGH 3 (DIEMS September 8, 1980 to July 31, 1986):

   Under this plan, retired pay is calculated using the average of the
   highest base pay the officer was entitled to during any 36 months of
   the officer's career. At the completion of 20 years active service, the
   officer's retired pay would be 50% of this average. Each subsequent
   year, the retired pay multiplier increases by 2.5% to a maximum of 75%
   at 30 years of service.
       _______________________________________________________________

   FINAL PAY (DIEMS Prior to September 7, 1980):

   Under this plan, retired pay is calculated based on the highest basic
   pay grade that the officer was entitled to during his/her career. This
   is usually the rate being paid on the first day the officer becomes
   entitled to retired pay.
