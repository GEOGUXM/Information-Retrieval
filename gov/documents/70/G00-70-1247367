   Results of NASA's Applied Engineering Competition

   EOS AM-1 Patch
   Four high school teams from Maryland and one team from Connecticut
   squared off on April 21 in NASA's Applied Engineering Competition. This
   year, the teams were tasked with solving two real-world problems
   involving the Earth Observing System (EOS) flagship satellite, Terra,
   launched December 18, 1999. The student participants demonstrated
   amazing creativity and analytical skills throughout the intense
   competition.

   Goddard Space Flight Center's Educational Programs Office hosted the
   annual engineering competition this year at DuVal High School in
   Greenbelt, MD. Morgan State University, The Baltimore Museum of
   Industry, and Prince George's County Public Schools partnered with
   Goddard in sponsoring and promoting the competition.

   In the competition's first round, students were given a set of rules
   and constraints under which they had to recommend a series of on-orbit
   attitude maneuvers to help the Terra satellite satisfy its sensors'
   calibration requirements. (Click to read the Round 1 Problem.) The top
   five finalist teams were selected from among the pool of first-round
   entrants.

   For the second and final round of the competition, the teams received a
   mission briefing from Flight Operations personnel within Terra Mission
   Control. Then they were given their second real-world problem to solve
   and sequestered themselves for the 90-minute "fight-to-the-finish."
   (Click to read the Round 2 Problems.) The five finalist teams analyzed,
   sorted, and crunched data using their problem-solving skills, then used
   a laptop to make a final power-point presentation to the judging panel.

   The Grand prize, a complete PC or Apple Macintosh computer system
   complete with an assortment of supporting software, was awarded to the
   two-member team of Carroll County Career and Technology
   Center/Westminister High School. That team compiled the highest number
   of points within a very thorough evaluation rubric.

   The First Runner-Up team, represented by the Applications and Research
   High School of Howard County, acquired a very impressive point total
   that placed them within five points of the Westminster HIgh School
   Team. The second place team was also awarded a PC or Apple Macintosh
   system with software.

   Perry Hall High School placed a very impressive third place as DuVal
   High School and Tourtellotte Memorial High School, of Grosvenordale,
   CT, rounded out the field of very competitive teams. Other prizes,
   shirts, and trophies were given to all team members.

   NASA congratulates all the teams for an enjoyable day of competition
   and fun.
