   Privacy and Security


   Privacy and Security Policy for GSA Websites
   Thank you for visiting the GSA Website and reviewing our privacy
   policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal
   information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to
   provide that information to us.

   How we handle the information we gather when you visit our web site

   We collect and store only the following information about you:  The
   name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., erols.com,
   if you are connecting from an Erols account, or harvard.edu if you are
   connecting from Harvard University's domain); the date and time you
   access our site; the item you requested from the server; and the
   Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our
   site. If your browser accepts cookies we may use a cookie to determine
   if you are a repeat or new visitor, or to understand how many different
   visitors come to our sites. When we examine this data, it is always
   presented in an aggregate form. Except as outlined in the Security
   section at the bottom of this document, we do not track or look at
   individuals' usage behavior.

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:

   When you send us personally-identifying information, (e.g., in an
   electronic mail message containing a question or comment), or by
   filling out a form that E-mails us this information, we use this
   information to respond to your request. We may also forward your E-mail
   to other Government employees, who are better able to answer your
   questions.

   We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying
   information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to
   provide such information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement
   investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any
   information we receive with any outside parties.

   Links to other sites:

   The documents posted on this Website may contain hypertext links or
   pointers to information created and maintained by other public and
   private organizations. These links and pointers are provided for
   visitors' convenience. GSA does not control or guarantee the accuracy,
   timeliness, or completeness of any linked information from non-GSA
   sites.

   The inclusion of links or pointers to Web sites is not intended to
   assign importance to those sites or the information contained therein,
   nor is it intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed, or
   products or services offered on these sites.

   Personalization:

   Some GSA sites allow you to personalize them, either by selecting sets
   of content to place on a web page or by clicking on an icon indicating
   a desire for a certain kind of content. In some cases, you are asked to
   "register" in order to get this personalized content. If you provide
   personally-identifying information when registering for personalized
   content, that information is only used to deliver the content to you.
   The information is never shared with any third party.

   Security:

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, GSA webservers employ industry-standard methods
   to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload
   or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts
   to upload information or change information on GSA servers are strictly
   prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud
   and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure
   Protection Act.

   In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no
   expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law
   enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual
   users or their usage habits.
