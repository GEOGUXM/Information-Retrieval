     * The Metric Program seeks to accelerate the Nation's transition to
       the metric system, the preferred system of weights and measures for
       United States trade and commerce.
     * Implementing the 1988 amendments to the Metric Conversion Act of
       1975, the Metric Program helps foster the metric transition
       activities of all Federal agencies.
     * The Program provides leadership and assistance on the adoption and
       use of the metric language of measurement by businesses, state and
       local governments, standards organizations, trade associations, and
       the educational community.
     * Under the banner Toward a Metric America, the Program conducts
       outreach among educational, professional, business, and media
       audiences to:
          + (1) accelerate adoption of the metric system in trade and
            commerce;
          + (2) encourage use of the metric system in all facets of
            education, including honing of worker skills; and
          + (3) develop positive and enjoyable programs of public
            awareness.
     * Current Metric Program initiatives focus on education and public
       awareness to gain broad-based support for national metrication from
       industry and the general public.
