   Conservancy
   Organization: Rivers and Mountains Conservancy (RMC)

   Catalog Description: The mission of the Rivers and Mountains
   Conservancy is to preserve urban open space and habitats for low-impact
   recreation and educational uses, wildlife and habitat restoration and
   protection, and watershed improvements within its jurisdiction. The San
   Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, also
   known as the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy (RMC), is an independent
   State agency within the Resources Agency of the State of California.
   State law established the Conservancy in 1999 (Chapters 788 and 789,
   Statutes of 1999). RMC jurisdiction includes the San Gabriel River and
   its tributaries, the Lower Los Angeles River and its tributaries, and
   the San Gabriel Mountains, Puente Hills, and San Jose Hills. This
   catalog documents information used by the California Resources Agency
   to prepare a Watershed and Open Space Plan for the San Gabriel and Los
   Angeles Rivers. The RMC led this cooperative planning effort involving
   the neighboring Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, consultants in
   public opinion research, geographic information systems, and urban
   planning, and several federal, state, and local agencies. The purposes
   of this plan are to articulate a vision for the future of the San
   Gabriel and Los Angeles Rivers Watersheds and to provide a framework
   for future watershed and open space planning. This vision for the
   future is to restore balance between natural and human systems in the
   watersheds.
