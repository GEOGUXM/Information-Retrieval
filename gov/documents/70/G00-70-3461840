   Io's Tvashtar Area in Infrared: Multiple Lava Flows Io's Tvashtar Area
   in Infrared: Multiple Lava Flows

   New and older lava flows clustered in the Tvashtar region of Jupiter's
   moon Io appear as hot spots in a temperature map from NASA's Galileo
   spacecraft.

   The multiple hot spots indicate continuing shifts in the location of
   Tvashtar's eruptions since the region's volcanic activity was first
   seen in December 1999.

   Io's Loki in Infrared Io's Loki in Infrared

   High temperatures observed by NASA's Galileo spacecraft along the
   western edge of the Loki volcano on Jupiter's moon Io may indicate
   freshly exposed material at the shore of a lava lake.

   Two temperature maps of the southern portion of Loki show hot (lower
   right) and hotter (upper right) features based on infrared-wavelength
   observations during an Oct. 16, 2001, flyby of Io. For context, they
   are shown beside a visible-wavelength picture (left) of the area taken
   during an earlier flyby.

   Io's Pele Glowing in Dark Io's Pele Glowing in Dark

   In a high-resolution view from NASA's Galileo spacecraft, the Pele hot
   spot on Jupiter's moon Io shows a complex pattern of areas glowing in
   the dark, including areas likely to be fresh overturning of a lava
   lake's crust.

   Slumping cliff on Io Slumping cliff on Io

   A cliff slumps outward in these high-resolution views that NASA's
   Galileo spacecraft captured of the edge of a mountain named Telegonus
   Mensa on Jupiter's moon Io.

   When Galileo flew near the south pole of Io in October 2001, scientists
   targeted this cliff to study the process of erosion. Water and wind
   cause most erosion on Earth, but Io has neither surface water nor an
   atmosphere. The cliff is slumping due to gravity.
