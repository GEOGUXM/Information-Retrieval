Section 508 Web Alternate Format
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is committed to making
   the information and resources on the Web sites that it sponsors
   accessible to the widest possible audience, including persons with
   disabilities.

   AHRQ would appreciate being notified of accessibility problems and
   non-compliant Web documents so that we can re-mediate them and better
   serve you.

   Federal agencies are required, upon request, to provide information and
   data to individuals with disabilities through an alternative means of
   access that can be used by the individuals.
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Alternative Access to Web Documents

   Contact the Department of Health and Human Services Help Desk, which is
   staffed by several individuals during business hours, and they will
   assist you.

   or

   Contact the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the
   Customer Feedback page or by E-mail to: info@ahrq.gov and request an
   alternate format of the information if you are unable to access the Web
   site version.

  Synopsis of Section 508 Accessibility Requirements

   Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure,
   maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), Federal
   employees with disabilities have comparable access to and use of
   information and data as Federal employees without disabilities, unless
   an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

   Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are
   members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal
   agency, have comparable access to and use of information and data as
   the public without disabilities, unless an undue burden would be
   imposed on the agency.

   Although Federal agencies have an explicit statutory obligation to make
   all EIT that they develop, maintain, or use compliant with Section 508,
   the current emphasis is on newly procured EIT because it is the
   category that is explicitly enforceable by legal action. Procurement
   awards made on or after June 25, 2001, are subject to Section 508.
   (Select for FAR Final Rule).

   According to the Access Board, the Section 508 requirements do not
   apply retroactively to pre-existing EIT. Specifically, the Electronic
   and Information Technology Accessibility Standards: Economic Assessment
   states that:

     "The standards are to be applied prospectively and do not require
     Federal agencies to retrofit existing electronic and information
     technology. As agencies upgrade and change their electronic and
     information technology, they must comply with the standards."

   It should be noted, however, that other Federal regulations and
   guidelines (e.g., Section 501 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
   Act) require equal access for individuals with disabilities. Therefore,
   reasonable accommodations will be made to ensure this.
