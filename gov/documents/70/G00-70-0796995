   Starting a Business> Checklist for Starting a Business
     __________________________________________________________________


   Clipboard with a checklist and pen. Most businesses start out small.
   The checklist below provides the basic steps you should follow to start
   a business. The list should not be construed as all-inclusive. Other
   steps may be appropriate for your specific type of business. Refer also
   to the Small Business Administration's Checklist for Going into
   Business (PDF).
     * Select a business structure. Consulting SBA's Small Business
       Startup Kit* may help you decide which structure works best for
       your business.
     * Select a location.
     * Determine if you need to apply for an Employer Identification
       Number (EIN).
     * Write a business plan and investigate business financing and
       marketing.
     * Investigate whether you need a business license through your state
       government's Web site.
     * Apply for a business license* in the appropriate state.
     * Start your tax year, choose your accounting method, and keep
       records. Get business tips and consultation services by contacting
       a small business expert.
     * Learn about the types of federal business taxes.
     * Consult Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization
       (PDF) if you are a nonprofit organization.
     * Learn your social security reporting instructions* before hiring
       any employees.
     * Learn about workplace requirements for small businesses with the
       Department of Labor's Small Business Handbook*, which addresses
       workplace requirements for small businesses.
     * If you have employees:
          + Prepare to meet federal employment tax requirements by reading
            IRS Publication 15, Circular E, Employers Tax Guide (PDF) and
            Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide (PDF), or
            Publication 51, Circular A, Agricultural Employers Tax Guide
            (PDF).
          + Ask employees to complete withholding certificates (Form W-4,
            Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (PDF), and Form
            W-5, Earned Income Credit Advance Payment (PDF)).
          + Comply with state and federal regulations regarding the
            protection of employees. For information on state labor laws,
            work force availability, prevailing wages, unemployment
            insurance, unionization, benefits packages, and employment
            services contact your state government.
          + Investigate the federal minimum wage, overtime, and child
            labor laws from the U.S. Department of Labor*, Wage, and Hour
            Division.
          + Review the federal health and safety standards employers must
            provide for the protection of employees as specified by the
            Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)*. Many
            states have similar standards. For a particular state's
            information, contact your state government or go to OSHA's
            list of approved state plans*.
          + Check your State Board of Workers Compensation to see if you
            need workers compensation insurance by contacting your state
            government.
          + Complete Immigration and Naturalization Service Employment
            Eligibility Verification Form I-9 for every employee, citizen
            and non-citizen alike.  If you have any questions, contact the
            U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service*.
     * Determine your estimated federal tax payments and begin making
       payments with Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals (PDF), or
       Form 1120-W, Estimated Tax for Corporations (PDF).
