   About CHSI

   The Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) Project was launched in
   response to grassroots requests from local health officials for health
   data at the local level. The Health Resources and Services
   Administration sponsored and funded the project through a collaboration
   among the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the
   National Association of County and City Health Officials, and the
   Public Health Foundation. The planning for this effort has taken place
   over a four-year period with input and testing from numerous
   organizations and individuals. From this collaborative process emerged
   the Community Health Status Report in a unique, easy-to-use format.

   What are the CHSI Reports?
   The CHSI project team created 3,082 reports of health status
   indicators, one for each county in the nation. No new data were
   collected to create these reports. Already-existing data resources were
   used  primarily from the CDC, NCHS, U.S. Bureau of the Census, EPA,
   HRSA's Area Resource File, HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care, and
   SAMHSA  although for some health indicators, calculations and
   estimations were performed using these sources. For certain health
   indicators, no county-level data were available, and state-level data
   were used instead. Please refer to Community Health Status Report: Data
   Sources, Definitions, and Notes, also referred to as the "companion
   document," for a complete description of data sources, calculations,
   and estimation methods.

   Why are the CHSI Reports Needed?
   Community health improvement begins with an assessment of needs,
   quantification of vulnerable populations, and measurement of
   preventable disease, disability, and death. In one brief document,
   local health officials can see, react, and act upon the data provided.

   Grassroots Development
   Local and State health officials provided input and advice during the
   development of the CHSI Reports through focus groups, roundtable
   discussions at national meetings, and participation on the CHSI
   Advisory Committee. The public health scientific community and federal
   advisors also were involved throughout the effort to develop the CHSI
   Reports. In addition, a number of liaisons were formed with other
   national data efforts such as Healthy People 2010 and Federal Office of
   Rural Health.

   Why CHSI is Unique
   The CHSI Reports provide a profile of each county's overall health
   status using a broad spectrum of health indicators. Counties can
   compare their health indicators to Healthy People 2010 targets, 1997
   U.S. rates, and peer counties  counties which share characteristics of
   population size, density, age distribution, and poverty. Mortality data
   age-adjusted to the new year 2000 standard also are provided. The
   Reports serve as a baseline for the next decade, supply data-based
   priorities, estimate needy populations, and provide an overview of
   public health. For health officials currently working in jurisdictions
   lacking the infrastructure to collect data, the CHSI Reports can serve
   as a tool for targeting resources and setting priorities.

   Specifically, the CHSI Reports offer data on:

     * Population Characteristics
     * Four Summary Measures of Health
     * Leading Causes of Death
     * Measures of Birth and Death
     * Vulnerable Populations
     * Environmental Health
     * Preventive Services Use
     * Risk Factors for Premature Death
     * Access to Care

   Engaging Format
   The CHSI Reports were designed to be "user-friendly." The CHSI project
   team hopes that not only public health professionals will use the
   Reports, but members of the community committed to health improvement
   will also find it a useful tool. The brief, concise format is packed
   with over 200 items that allow counties to savor their good health and
   look more closely at areas where health status has not matched up with
   peers. The CHSI Reports are the spark plug for your local health
   improvement engine.

   Most importantly, please tell us what you think.
   You can submit feedback or e-mail via this Web site or contact any of
   the members of the CHSI team listed on the back of each CHSI Report by
   mail, e-mail, fax, or phone. Future CHSI Reports will be refined and
   improved to incorporate your feedback.
