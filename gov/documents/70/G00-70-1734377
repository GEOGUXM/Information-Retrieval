     __________________________________________________________________

   The Commercial Law Development Program ("CLDP"), a Department of
   Commerce initiative funded in part by the Agency for International
   Development, is one component of the US Government effort to support
   economic and political reforms underway around the globe. CLDP provides
   training and consultative services to lawmakers, regulators, judges,
   lawyers and educators seeking assistance in the evaluation, revision
   and implementation of evolving legal systems.

   CLDP law development assistance programs typically focus on laws,
   regulations and administrative practices affecting domestic and foreign
   investment and trade, particularly international economic agreements,
   foreign investment laws, project and trade finance, export controls,
   intellectual property rights, and government ethics.

   CLDP professional skills development assistance focuses on building the
   knowledge base and practical skills needed to effectively utilize these
   evolving legal structures and to bring new participants and new ideas
   into the commercial marketplace.

   Most CLDP activities are part of comprehensive assistance programs
   addressing various aspects of one or two issues of interest to a host
   government, rather than ad hoc efforts. Programs typically include
   placing expert advisors with host government ministries for periods of
   time ranging from a week to a year, providing legal training and
   conducting skills workshops and bringing policymakers, regulators and
   educators to the US for individualized consultations or educational
   programs.

   CLDP taps experienced attorneys and economists from both the public and
   private sectors to serve as advisors. Advisors are required to have
   substantial expertise in the subject of their assignment and the
   interests of their host countries.

   In order to ensure that its programs are responsive to actual needs and
   well-coordinated with those of other assistance providers, CLDP works
   closely with consular and other host government officials, as well as
   other US Government, intergovernmental and non-governmental
   organizations.
