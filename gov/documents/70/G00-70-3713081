                          CREN ListProcessor at BNL

                   ***************************************
        The CREN ListProcessor is no longer used for new BNL mailing
         lists. ListProc has been succeeded by Mailman. Old Listproc
         web pages are retained for users of our old mailing lists.
                   ***************************************

   BNL's Computing and Communications Division (CCD) uses the CREN
   ListProcessor (also known as ListProc) mailing list management
   software. The current version is 8.1. Mailing lists created on bnl.gov
   are for use by BNL employees, guests, and research collaborators.

Learning about Existing Lists

   You can easily obtain a list and brief description of BNL's ListProc
   lists and (for most lists) a list of the subscribers. You can also view
   the currently available lists from the Web.

Establishment of New Lists

   The establishment of a new mailing list is accomplished by contacting
   the mailing list manager and supplying information about the list.

Subscribing/ Unsubscribing

   Usually, individuals should and do enter their own subscribe and
   unsubscribe requests, but list owners can perform these and other
   actions on their subscribers' behalf.

Sending Mail, and Other ListProc Functions

   Sending mail to subscribers of a mailing list is done simply by
   addressing your mail to the list. More detailed information on that and
   other list functions is available.
