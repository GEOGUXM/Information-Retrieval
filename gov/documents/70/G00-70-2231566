Introduction

   Argonne National Laboratory is a U.S. Department of Energy research and
   development laboratory that does not produce commercial products or
   services. However, the Laboratory works with manufacturers and other
   producers of such products and services, and transfers its technology
   to them through cost-shared and reimbursable research and development
   agreements, personnel exchange, and other types of working
   arrangements.

   The objectives for sensor, instrumentation, and nondestructive
   evaluation research and development at Argonne are:
     * To develop techniques for

     * Component reliability and quality control
     * Diagnostics and process control
     * Material characterization
     * Environmental monitoring

     To transfer technology to industry.

   applications, etc.

  Technical Approach

   Sensing and control are key elements of any industrial process. Argonne
   has contributed to the development of better sensors and measurement
   techniques to help manufacturers improve product quality and reduce
   waste and operating costs. The sensors developed or under development
   by Argonne can be classified according to their utility as four types:

     Physical Sensors: Physical sensors generally measure position,
     proximity, level, displacement, density, velocity, acceleration,
     force, strain, pressure flow, vibration, temperature, radiation, and
     electromagnetic field. An accurate sensor always requires
     calibration to correct effects due to vibration or other physical
     parameters and industrial application environment. Argonne's
     approach is based on (1) an understanding of sensor mechanisms
     acquired by detailed design analysis of each sensor, (2) development
     of new sensor mechanisms and sensor fusion design, (3) sensor
     miniaturization and (4) sensor intelligence.

     Chemical Sensors: Chemical sensors detect and quantify chemicals
     that may present in gas, liquid, and solid phases. Traditional
     analytical instruments such as mass spectrometer, NMR, and
     chromatography are expensive, complex, and large in size. In
     addition, most analysis requires sample preparation, so that
     on-line, real-time analysis is difficult. Solid-state chemical
     sensors have been widely used, but they also suffer from limited
     capability and problems of stability and accuracy. Argonne's
     research focuses on (1) sensor miniaturization, (2) chemical
     speciation and quantification, (3) chemical structure
     identification, (4) single-step analysis, (5) on-line or remote
     capability, (6) sensor intelligence, and (7) nondestructive
     analysis, particularly for solid species.

     Biosensors: Most biosensors have shortcomings identical to those of
     chemical sensors with respect to tagging. Current sequencing
     technology usually requires the optical detection of the sequence
     base pairs either through electrophoresis or fluorescent tagging or
     a combination of the two. Looking into biological phenomena together
     with sensing mechanisms and advanced data processing techniques, it
     will be possible to identify new biological sensors for DNA
     applications. Argonne's research focuses on (1) new biological
     sensors mechanisms, (2) biological sensors for industrial
     applications, and (3) biomaterials with self-adjustable functions
     such as built-in intelligence based on functions such as
     recognition/discrimination, standby, self-repair, self-degradation,
     prediction/notification, self-diagnosis, etc.

     Intelligent Materials: Intelligent materials may be defined as the
     materials that respond to environmental changes at optimal
     conditions and manifest their functions according to the changes.
     Argonne's research focuses on (1) materials that can have built-in
     intelligence such as self-diagnosis, self-learning, ability of
     standby, stimulus-reactiveness, and ability of
     recognition/discrimination, (2) materials with systematized
     functions--that is, functions that are systematized within the
     materials and can have systematic information transfer function as
     well as built-in intelligence, (3) materials with variable
     structures/compositions that vary in accordance with the environment
     and/or operating conditions, and have built-in intelligence based on
     the material variable properties, (and 4) other classes of materials
     that exhibit certain memory characteristics--for example, shape
     memory alloys, hybrid composites, electrohydrological fluids, share
     memory polymers, optical fiber hybrid composites, and piezoelectric
     hybrid composites.

  Accomplishments

     * Argonne has developed an on-line acoustic viscometer that currently
       is being commercially developed under a research agreement with an
       instrument manufacturer. The acoustic viscometer won a 1994 R&D 100
       Award.
     * An on-loom defect detection technology based on ultrasonic and
       millimeter wave technology also won a 1996 R&D Award.
     * Argonne's sensor, instrumentation, and nondestructive evaluation
       developments are playing an important role in the Laboratory's
       partnerships with the transportation industry, including
       partnerships with the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR,
       a collaboration of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors).
