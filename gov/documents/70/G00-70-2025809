   Open RFGPs



   Requests for Grant Proposals

   The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs maintains a list of open
   Requests For Grant Proposals (RFGPs) and accompanying solicitation
   documents on this website. Bureau RFGPs are published, normally on
   Thursdays, in the Federal Register. The following list does not replace
   the Federal Register as the most up-to-date source for Bureau RFGPs,
   but is an additional source of information about any RFGP.

   Grant proposals deemed technically eligible upon receipt by the Bureau
   undergo an internal review process, including partial panel review by
   Agency staff who represent both substantive and international
   geographical perspectives.

   Once the internal review process is complete, all approved grant
   packages undergo Congressional notification, and are then forwarded to
   the Grants Division of the Executive Office.
