                              January 29, 2002

   From February 1 through February 3, 2002, the city of Munich will host
   the annual "Conference on Security Policy." Munich officials expect a
   large turnout of demonstrators. Bavarian police authorities have
   expressed confidence that law and order will be maintained, and will
   implement additional countermeasures for public safety. Traffic
   disruptions are likely in the Munich city center, and the area for
   several blocks around the Bayerischer Hof Hotel will be restricted.
   Americans in Munich should avoid sites of demonstrations whenever
   possible, bearing in mind that demonstrations in other European cities
   have sometimes turned violent.

   U.S. citizens are advised to exercise caution and to monitor local
   media to keep themselves informed regarding developments during this
   period.

   The U.S. Consulate General in Munich is located at Koeniginstrasse 5,
   80539 Munich, telephone (49)(89)28880
