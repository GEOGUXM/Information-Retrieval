   Directions to the NRG offices within building 50B:

   Van and Sally are in room 2239. Vern and Kevin are in room 2245. Steve
   and Craig are in room 2231. Enter building 50 through the main glass
   double doors. There is a sign indicating you are entering the
   ``Building 50 Complex.'' Turn left at the first intersection (there
   will be a sign indicating you are on the 1st floor of bldg 50) and go
   down the corridor. Turn right at the next intersection and go through
   the door labeled ``4th floor 50B.'' Go down the hallway until you reach
   the elevator on your left side. Take the elevator down 2 floors. Turn
   left as you exit the elevator and walk to the end of the hallway. The
   NRG offices are at the end of the hallway on your right.

   Van's driving directions to LBL from Palo Alto:

   There are two ways to get up here. The simplest, but slowest, route is
   to take I280 to 101 to the Bay Bridge then I80 to the University av.
   exit in Berkeley then up University av. to the campus & LBL. The
   problem is that you could hit the bridge during rush hour. There's an
   alternative route that might save you 30-45 minutes during rush hour
   but it's a lot more intricate. The short description is that you take
   I280 to 92, 92 across the San Mateo bridge to I880, I880 to the I238
   connector then I238 to I580, I580 west to 13 (the Warren freeway), 13
   until it ends in Berkeley at Ashby av. (Everything so far has been
   freeway, the rest is Berkeley city streets; you'll be driving along the
   base of the hills & across the top of Campus.) Turn right off Ashby
   onto Claremont. Left on Derby when Claremont ends. Right off Derby onto
   Waring at the first stop sign then just follow Warring (which, in
   typical Berkeley fashion changes names first to Piedmont & then to
   Gayley rd.) until the light at Hearst. Turn right on Hearst & take it
   up the hill to the Lab's main gate.

   The long description is:

   The key to commuting is to get across some bridge (*the* bottleneck in
   the flow system) as early as possible. So, if you take I280 from Palo
   Alto about 10 miles to the highway 92 exit (the exit will probably also
   say "Foster City", "San Mateo" and/or "Hayward" -- Hayward is the city
   on the other side of the San Mateo bridge) then take 92 east across the
   San Mateo bridge (it's freeway all the way). About a mile after you get
   off the bridge, be in the right lane & take the exit that says "I880
   north" and "Oakland" (92 ends at I880 so the exit is on the right & the
   last before 92 turns into Jackson st. If you miss the exit & find
   yourself on Jackson, it's no big deal -- just keep going about 2 miles
   till it ends at Mission blvd then cross Mission going slightly to the
   left of straight onto Foothill blvd & take it to I580 -- at the big
   intersection with Mission where Jackson turns into Foothill I think
   there's also an I580 sign pointing down Foothill.)

   If you make the I880 north exit, take 880 for about 3 miles to the
   highway 238 exit (this will also say "to I580" and "Stockton") then go
   east on 238 about 3 miles until it hits I580. 238 turns into I580 east
   so you want to get off it at the exit that says "Oakland" and "I580
   west" (there's a lot of construction around this exit but just stay to
   the right & it's pretty obvious). Take I580 west (actually north) about
   10 miles to the highway 13 exit (this will say "Berkeley" as well as
   13). Stay on 13 about 7 miles until it ends. Be in the left lane -- the
   right lane goes off to join highway 24 & there will be a huge line of
   cars in it at a dead stop -- they're trying to get through the tunnel
   to Concord). Where 13 ends there's a stoplight. Go straight. The road
   will bear to the left & wind through the hills. You'll go past the
   Claremont hotel (on the right) & through one light. At the second light
   turn right (this is Claremont) but immediately after you turn Claremont
   makes a dogleg to the left. Follow Claremont about 4 blocks until it
   ends (this should be Derby), turn left on Derby and take it about 3
   blocks to Warring (you should go through on stoplight and Warring is
   the first stop sign.) Turn right on Warring. You'll go through one stop
   sign then about 2 blocks later the road veers slightly left & goes
   through a light. (The cross street is Dwight - this is where Warring
   turns into Piedmont.) Go through the light & just stay on Piedmont.
   After a couple more stop sighs & about 5 blocks you should find
   yourself driving across the top of campus (the stadium is on your left,
   the new business school & a lot of construction is on your right). Keep
   on Piedmont (which has now decided to name itself Galey rd.) until you
   reach the light at Hearst (once you reach the Campus there will be one
   or two stop signs but Hearst is the first light.) Turn right on Hearst
   & follow it up the hill to the Lab's main gate (about a block). If we
   have made previous arrangements for you, then the guard will give you a
   parking permit & directions to 46a if you need them.

   Most of this route is against the commute direction (the only pieces
   that go with the commute are 92 across the bridge & I880/ highway 238
   stretch until you hit 580) so the traffic should thin out as soon as
   you hit 580 west (but it will be pretty miserable until then). It might
   entertain you to know that you're taking a tour of the Bay Area's
   largest & most active earthquake faults: I280 goes straight up the San
   Andreas fault, the piece of I880 you travel & 238 are on top of the
   Calaveras fault & most of the section of I580 and all of highway 13 are
   built directly over the Hayward fault (the one that also goes under the
   Berkeley Stadium & the fault most likely to cause the next big
   earthquake here). When you hit the end of 13, you'll also be driving
   through the area that was devastated during the big Oakland fire 4
   years ago (the hills used to be covered with trees).

   Using the LBNL Shuttle from campus or the Durant Hotel:

   The LBNL shuttle runs every 10 minutes. From 6:40 AM until 4 PM, it
   runs completely around campus, stopping at every block; after 4PM it
   runs directly down the west side of the campus to the BART station and
   back, and does not go to the east side of campus. The stops are
   discretely marked by a white square with the "LBL" initials painted on
   the sidewalk. The white-and-orange shuttle says "LBL" on the front. You
   should be at one of the LBL shuttle stops and wave to the shuttle
   driver so that they will see you and stop. The bus lets everyone off at
   LBNL, across the street from building 50.

   To take the shuttle from the Durant hotel, walk down Bowditch one block
   to campus, cross Bancroft, and find the "LBL" initials painted on the
   sidewalk. In the off chance that the LBNL shuttle bus driver asks for
   your lab ID, just say that you are coming to this meeting. Get off at
   the last stop (where everyone else will get off), cross the street at
   the crosswalk, walk up several small flights of stairs, and enter the
   building marked "Entrance - 50A". Take the elevator to the fifth floor,
   turn left when you get off, and the 50A-5132 conference room will be
   right there.

   Shuttles to Berkeley from the airports:

   Most of the shuttle services from the airports to the Durant Hotel
   recommend that you call ahead and make reservations. At the San
   Francisco airport, the Bayporter Express shuttle van can take you
   either to the Durant Hotel or directly to the Lab. It departs the
   airport approximately every hour. The cost is $16, and $10 for each
   additional person coming to the Lab. Their phone is 415-467-1800. There
   are a number of other airport shuttles that operate from both the San
   Francisco and Oakland airports. The Bay Area Shuttle (415-873-7771)
   charges $10 to go to the Durant Hotel, but doesn't have door-to-door
   service and therefore won't take you directly to the lab. The Airport
   Connection (415-877-0901) goes to the Durant Hotel and also might have
   door-to-door service. My experience with door-to-door service is that
   these can be slow, and can wander about the hills dropping off several
   other people before they get to your stop, so be forewarned. More
   transit information from the bay area airports is also available.
