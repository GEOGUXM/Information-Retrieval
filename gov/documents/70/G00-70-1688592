            Atmosphere Pathfinder


   Atmosphere The thin blanket of atmosphere that surrounds the Earth
   contains all of the essential ingredients needed to sustain life on our
   planetair, water, nutrients, and heat. The atmosphere's interactions
   with the Earth's lands, oceans, and life bring about climate and
   environmental changes that can be viewed and measured by satellites.
   Will the current global warming trend continue? If so, what role do
   clouds and aerosols play?
