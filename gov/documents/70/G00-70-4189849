   The Microsoft® Exchange Server is an enterprise solution for electronic
   messaging, including email, shared calendars, shared public folders and
   more.

   Microsoft®'s Outlook 98 is our recommended supported messaging and
   collaboration client which works very well with Exchange. Outlook 2000®
   is the newest version, but is not yet supported by ITD. It will be
   distributed labwide after it has been tested and accepted as the new
   BNL standard messaging package.

   If you are interested in obtaining an account on our server, fill out
   this form, get it signed and send it to the ITD password office,
   building 515, room M1-34 as per the instructions on the form..

   We've also provided a number of resources here to help our users
   resolve problems, report bugs, and suggest improvements to this
   service.

   You may also obtain technical support by telephone at the Information
   Technology Division Help Desk (x5522) and by e-mail to Exchange Help.

   Feel free to suggest changes and/or corrections.
