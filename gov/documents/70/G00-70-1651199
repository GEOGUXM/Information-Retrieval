Airborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (AirMISR)

   AIRMISR is an airborne instrument for obtaining multi-angle imagery
   similar to that of the satellite-borne MISR instrument, which is
   designed to contribute to studies of the Earth's ecology and climate.
   AirMISR flies on the NASA-owned ER-2 aircraft. The instrument was built
   for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

48" Lidar Aerosol Research Branch (ARB)

   A ground-based 48-inch LIDAR system has been obtaining semi-regular
   measurements at the NASA Langley Research Center since May 1974. These
   high resolution vertical measurements have resulted in a valuable
   long-term record of the mid-latitude upper tropospheric and
   stratospheric aerosol. These data have been used in scientific studies
   such as in studies of volcanic eruptions and in comparisons with
   satellite data.

ARM Enhanced Shortwave Experiment (ARESE)

   radiation in the cloudy atmosphere by measuring the upwelling and
   downwelling radiative fluxes using three aircraft flying at the
   tropopause, near cloud top, and below cloud base.

Biomass Burning

   This data set represents the geographical and temporal distribution of
   total amount of biomass burned. These data may be used in general
   circulation models (GCMs) and in photochemical models of the
   atmosphere.

   improved models of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) scanner
   instruments, which operated from 1984 through 1990 on NASA's Earth
   Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and on NOAA's operational weather
   satellites NOAA-9 and NOAA-10.

Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)

   Data were collected from three satellites (ERBS, NOAA-9, NOAA-10)

   modification, latent heat flux, the water vapor component of the
   hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric transport using water vapor as a
   tracer of atmospheric motions. The simultaneous measurement of aerosol
   and cloud distributions can provide important information on
   atmospheric structure and transport, and many meteorological parameters
   can also be inferred from these data.

Lidar-in-space Technology Experiment (LITE)

   Using a laser, a telescope approximately 1 meter in diameter and a
   modular design, the system was used to study clouds, tropospheric and
   stratospheric aerosols, characteristics of the planetary boundary
   layer, stratospheric density and temperature perturbations, and to some
   degree, surface topography.

   Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data sets. This is an 8-year total and layered
   (1988 - 1995) global water vapor data set.

Nimbus-7 Earth Radiation Budget (Nimbus-7 ERB)

   The objectives of ERB are 1) to obtain accurate measurements of solar
   irradiance, monitor its variation in time, and observe the temporal
   variation of the solar spectrum: and 2) to determine the Earth
   radiation budget from simultaneous measurements of the incoming solar
   radiation and the outgoing Earth-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.
