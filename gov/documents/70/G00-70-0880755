     ROBOCRANE^Â® PROJECT
     Large Scale Manufacturing using Cable Control

     This page is always under construction!
     Please check back in the near future to find additional information
     about the NIST RoboCrane.

     The Intelligent Systems Division is actively seeking partners for
     cooperative research in large scale manufacturing technology and
     standards development. Please contact the project manager, Roger
     Bostelman, if you are interested in further information.
