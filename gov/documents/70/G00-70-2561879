   These include traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor
   licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation
   and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. In fact, no
   public policy area is excluded from the purview of the Advisory
   Neighborhood Commissions.
   In each of these areas, the intent of the ANC legislation is to ensure
   input from an advisory board that is made up of the residents of the
   neighborhoods that are directly affected by government action. In this
   sense, the ANCs are the body of government with the closest official
   ties to the people in a neighborhood.
   The ANCs present their positions and recommendations on issues to
   various District government agencies, the Executive Branch, and the
   Council. They also present testimony to independent agencies, boards
   and commissions, usually under rules of procedure specific to those
   entities. By law, the ANCs may also present their positions to Federal
   agencies.
