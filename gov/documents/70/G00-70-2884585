                                     Accu-Vote
                     HAMILTON COUNTY'S  NEW VOTING TECHNOLOGY

      After 22 years of punchcard voting, the Hamilton County Election
      Commission is introducing a new voting system called Accu-Vote. Voters
      began using the new technology with the August, 1998 elections. The
      Accu-Vote system is produced by Global Election Systems and has been
      successfully adopted by over 600 jurisdictions in the United States and
      Canada.

      The Accu-Vote system increases security, accuracy and efficiency in the
      voting process. It simplifies election-worker tasks by recording
      precinct totals instantly and enabling the transmission of precinct
      results via modem. The system also provides a complete audit trail by
      way of paper ballots, precinct totals printed by each Accu-Vote unit
      when the polls close and a memory device located in each unit that
      records all the days election data.

      The Accu-Vote system is being used for both early voting and election
      day voting. Hamilton County voters will be issued a ballot and
      instructed to fill the oval next to the names of the candidates and/or
      issues they wish to vote for. The voter will insert the ballot into the
      Accu-Vote unit. The Accu-Vote will scan the ballot, tabulate the
      results and deposit the ballot into the box below. The Accu-Vote can
      also determine if the voter has incorrectly voted their ballot and
      return the ballot to the voter so that he or she may vote a corrected
      ballot.

      If you have any questions, please call the Hamilton County Election
      Commission at (423) 209-7720 and we will be happy to help you.
      Educating voters is one of our major goals. When you go to the polls
      we want you to feel comfortable with the new voting system and as
      pleased as we are that Hamilton County now has the Accu-Vote
      technology.
