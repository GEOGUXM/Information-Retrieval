   Advanced Query Tips

   Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of the
   Sustainable Seas search engine.

   Search for Exact Phrase

   When searching for phrases such as Stellar sea lion or blue whale,
   enclose the phrase in quotation marks, i.e., "Stellar sea lion". Using
   the quotation marks tells the search engine to find those words, in
   that specific sequence.

   Use More Words

   The easiest way to narrow your search and the first thing you should
   try is to simply use more words in your query. The greater the detail
   you provide, the better the search engine is able to find precisely
   what you're looking for.

   Use + to Require Words

   Put a plus sign (+) in front of a search word to make sure that ALL of
   the documents it returns contain the word. Example search: immigrants
   +Russian.

   Use - to Exclude Words

   Put a minus sign (-) in front of a search word to make sure that NONE
   of the documents it returns contain the word. Example search: whale
   -right -blue.

   Use AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT, ( )

   This search page supports full Boolean operators and syntax. You can
   use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and parentheses ( ) for
   grouping . Example search: swimming AND (man OR woman).
