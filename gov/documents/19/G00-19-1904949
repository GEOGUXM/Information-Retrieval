              Collection of Fees

              for the Filing of Amendments

   The following text is taken from a memorandum from the Administrative
   Office of the United States Courts. It is being provided to help
   clarify when the $20 filing fee is due upon the filing of an amendment.

   "....The fee should be assessed per filing. Thus, if an amendment is
   filed which contains more than one change to the schedule of creditors
   or list of creditors, only one $20 fee should be charged. Examples of
   amendments which require a fee include: adding creditors, deleting
   creditors, changing the amount specified as being owed to a creditor,
   or changing the classification of a debt. A fee should not be charged,
   however, when the nature of the amendment is simply to change the
   address of a listed creditor. Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure
   2002(g) provides that creditors may request that notices be sent to
   them at any address they may direct. Moreover, the only document that
   would need amending in such circumstances is the mailing list or
   matrix; there is no need to amend a schedule when the only change is an
   updated address. Additionally, no fee should be charged if the
   amendment adds the name and address of an attorney for a creditor
   listed on the original schedules so that the attorney can receive
   copies of all notices. The attorney is not being added as a
   creditor...."
