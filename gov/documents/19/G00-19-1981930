                                OGC POLICIES

   Since 1994, the General Counsel has issued policies which establish
   criteria, principles and standards that govern the Regional Offices'
   processing of cases.  These policies have been incorporated in the
   Unfair Labor Practice Manual or the Representation Case Handling
   Manual.  The first Chart below summarizes the policy and provides a
   link to that part of the ULP Manual where it has been incorporated.

                                OGC GUIDANCE

   Periodically, the General Counsel issues Guidance to the Regional
   Directors on a variety of matters arising under the Statute.  The
   Guidance is made available to the public to assist Unions and Federal
   Agencies in performing their responsibilities under the Statute.  The
   second Chart below summarizes and provides a link to the Guidances.
