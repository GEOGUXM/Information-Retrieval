   OET/CORNING OFFER TUTORIAL ON OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS

   The FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology and Corning Incorporated
   are sponsoring a tutorial on optical communications. The tutorial will
   take place from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 22, 2002
   in the Commission Meeting Room (TWC-305), 445 12th Street, S.W.,
   Washington, D.C.

   Dr. B. Roe Hemenway, Manager of Optical Network Equipment Research at
   Cornings Sullivan Park Research facility, will present an overview of
   fiber optic communications technologies. Corning produced the first
   fiber optic filament, and fostered the commercial development of fiber
   optic filaments for the transmission of telecommunications services.
   Corning is the worlds largest manufacturer of optical fiber and cable.
   Corning also produces other photonic components that, with fiber optic
   filaments, comprise the optical layer of many telecommunications
   networks.

   Dr. Hemenway will describe the technological foundations that underlie
   optical fiber and different photonic components that are used in
   optical telecommunications networks. Dr. Hemenway will also discuss
   dense wavelength division multiplexing, optical amplification, highly
   scalable optical cross connects, add/drop multiplexers, and other
   optical transport technologies. Dr. Hemenway will then explain how
   todays optical layer has the unique ability to manage, in a cost
   effective manner, network capacity at data rates varying from as little
   as a few megabits per second at the edge of the network to hundreds of
   terabits per second at the core of the network.

   Members of the public are encouraged to attend this tutorial.
   Admittance, however, will be limited to the seating available in the
   Commission meeting room. Please allow sufficient time for clearance
   through Commission security before the seminar begins. The audio
   portion of this conference will be broadcast live on the Internet via
   the FCC's Internet audio broadcast page at
   http://www.fcc.gov/realaudio.

   Additional information concerning this tutorial may be obtained from
   Robert Kimball at the FCC at 202-418-2339 (e-mail: rkimball@fcc.gov),
   TTY 202-418-2989.
