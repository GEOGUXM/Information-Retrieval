   Aerogel sample in hand Aerogel is one of the most fascinating materials
   currently under study at NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center.  By using
   the unique environment of space, we hope to understand better the
   properties of this novel material, and perform research in space to
   enable unique and innovative applications on the ground. Aerogel's
   potential applications in industry, technology, and the home are
   widespread. This page is designed to provide the user with "one stop
   shopping" for information on Aerogel research that is taking place here
   at NASA/Marshall, and elsewhere throughout the world.

   Here you will find information on who is performing the research - and
   how to contact them - what steps have been taken so far, technical
   specifications on Aerogel, programmatic information, our research
   partners, other links to Aerogel research on the WWW, and much more!
