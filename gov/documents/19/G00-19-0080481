   This is the discovery image of 1996 PW, discovered with NEAT on 8/9/96.
   It is a very unusual object with perihelion between Jupiter and Mars -
   about 2.5 astronomical units - and an aphelion now estimated at 600
   astronomical units (see also M.P.E.C. 1996-P03, -Q03, IAUC 6452).

   NEAT image of 1994PC, a Near-Earth Asteroid observed on September 8,
   1996, one day before its closest approach to the Earth. The asteroid
   was moving more than 1 degree/day with an apparent magnitude of about V
   = 15. (94pc.jpg)

   NEAT image of Comet 1996/E1 = NEAT observed on September 10, 1996.
   Notice the nebulosity (the northern object in the three middle frames
   is a background star). The comet was discovered with NEAT in March
   1996, and is recovered here after perihelion. It is moving 1.3
   degrees/day and has an apparent magnitude of about V = 18. (com996.jpg)

   1996RX, a probable Hungaria asteroid discovered with NEAT on September
   10, 1996 (top image), and recovered on September 11, 1996 (bottom
   image). It is moving 0.5 degrees/day. Hungarias are a class of
   asteroids that inhabit high inclination orbits between Mars and the
   main asteroid belt. They may be an early stage for Near-Earth
   asteroids. (96rx996a.jpg and 96rx996b.jpg)

   Find the unusual asteroid! The third row contains images of 1996PW,
          recovered one month after its discovery with NEAT. This is the
          unique asteroid or extinct comet in a cometary orbit. The other
          two rows are probably main belters. NEAT image from September

   Zzzooom...Asteroid moving nearly 6 degrees/day. These are images of
   1996EN (1st, 4th, 9th panels), recovered with NEAT on September 13,
   1996. This is a 3-km in size Earth-crossing asteroid discovered with
   NEAT in March 1996. Its closest approach to the Earth during this
   apparition is on September 14, 1996 when it will be about 22 million km
   (14 million miles) away. Objects such as 1996EN are classified as
   "potentially hazardous." (96en996.jpg)

   SMORGASBORD. This NEAT frame from September 15, 1996 captured 7
   asteroids. Rows 1 - 5 contain images of probable main-belters; row 6
   contains 1996RB3, a NEAT-discovered high-inclination Hungaria-like
   object (G. Williams); and row 7 contains 1996RY[3] a Near-Earth
   Asteroid also discovered with NEAT. 1996RY[3] was moving 2.6
   degrees/day and on the basis of two nights of observations is estimated
   to have a perihelion distance of 1.03 astronomical units (D.
   Rabinowitz). (96ry3.jpg)

   CONFIRMATION: 1996SK in now confirmed as an Apollo Earth-Crossing
   asteroid. It joins the list of "potentially dangerous minor planets."

   RECOVERIES: 1996 RB[3] (upper images) and 1996 RC[4] (lower images)
   were discovered with NEAT in September 1996, and recovered with NEAT on
   10/8/96. These are both high inclination asteroids with orbits tilted
   about 30 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic (i.e. the plane of most
   of the planets). 1996 RC[4] was moving at 0.9 degrees/day. Its orbit
   takes it within 0.1 astronomical units of being classified a Near-Earth
   asteroid. Recovery observations such as these enable dynamicists to
   refine the orbital elements.

   FIRST COMET and FIRST NEA of the New Year:

   The Comet, 1997 A1, is confirmed in follow-up observations by D.
          Rabinowitz (image is a 12-minute exposure in R with the TMO 24")
          and with NEAT on 1/11/97 (IAU Circular 6532). The NEA was also
          recovered with NEAT on 1/11/97 and is now designated 1997
          AC[11], an Earth-crossing Aten asteroid. It is the first Aten
          discovered with NEAT and is one of only 24 known Atens, i.e.
          asteroids with semi-major axes less than 1 astronomical unit.
         ___________________________________________________________

          A New High-Inclination Mars-Crossing Asteroid: 1997 AB[15] was
          discovered on 1/12/97 and recovered on 1/13/97 with NEAT. Also
          recovered on 2/3/97.
            ___________________________________________________________

          CANDIDATE NEAR-EARTH ASTEROID LOST (2/6/97):

   7RXK9J discovered with NEAT on 2/3/97 moving 6.2 degrees/day joins the
          legion of lost asteroids. If objects such as this are not
          recovered on the following night they are often never recovered.
          Possible reasons for non-recovery include a changing velocity
          vector which results in a significant error in the ephemerides,
          or observing difficulties (bad weather, equipment problems). In
          this case both effects probably contributed at sites worldwide.
         ___________________________________________________________

          2/6/97

   RECOVERY OF A NEAR-EARTH ASTEROID

   1997 BR was discovered in January 1997 by observers at the Peking
          Observatory and recovered on 2/6/97 with NEAT moving 0.9
          degrees/day. It has been identified as an Earth-crossing Apollo
          asteroid. Observations in February will further refine its
          orbit.
         ___________________________________________________________

          2/6-7/97

   NEAT discovered two new high-eccentricity Mars-crossing asteroids whose
          properties are given in Minor Planet Electronic Circulars (see
          the links on their names). They are classified among 106 unusual
          objects. 1997 CZ[5] (=7TBG3L)[ ]is one of the larger ones - 5 to
          12 km (3 to 8 miles) diameter - ranking 16^th in size. It was
          discovered with NEAT on 2/7/97 moving 0.75 degrees/day and
          recovered on subsequent days by NEAT and other observers
          worldwide. 1997 CO[5] (=7T12ND) was discovered with NEAT on
          2/6/97 moving 0.6 degrees/day and recovered on subsequent days
          by NEAT and other observers worldwide. It is considerably
          smaller - 1 to 2 km (about 1 mile) diameter. Both have
          perihelions between 1.3 and 1.4 astronomical units, just beyond
          the 1.30 a.u. limit required for classification as Amor
          Near-Earth asteroids. As such they may be pre-cursors to NEAs,
          becoming NEAs after gravitational perturbations move their
          orbits slightly closer to the Earth.

   Very High Inclination Mars Approacher
   1997 GF[3] has a perihelion of 1.8 astronomical units and an
          inclination of 42.5 degrees to the plane of the solar system,
          the third largest inclination among the MPC list of unusual
          objects.

          7/5/97

   1997 NC[1] is a new Aten Earth-Crossing Asteroid discovered with NEAT
          on July 5, 1997. It was moving 2.4 degrees/day and was
          relatively bright at V = 16.4 mag. Confirming observations were
          performed at Loomberah (G. J. Garradd), Sormano (F. Manca & A.
          Testa), Camarillo (J. E. Rogers), and Rand Observatory (G. R.
          Viscome). Thanks to all! This is one of only 26 Atens known, and
          is the second discovered with NEAT. Its orbital elements are
          semi-major axis = 0.86, eccentricity = 0.21, inclination = 17,
          and perihelion = 0.6836 astronomical units (G. Williams). It is
          estimated to be 0.67 - 1.5 km (1 mile) in diameter and joins the
          list of (now) 99 larger potentially dangerous minor planets,
          although it does not pose an immediate threat to the Earth.
         ___________________________________________________________

          8/1/97

   New Amor Earth-Approaching Asteroid 1997 PN (=9M8L0J) was discovered
          with NEAT on 8/1/97 moving 1.8 degrees/day with V = 18 mag. Its
          diameter is estimated to be 260-590 m (0.16-0.37 miles). 1997 PO
          (=9M8YM5), also discovered with NEAT on 8/1/97, is an unusual
          high eccentricity (e = 0.46) and high inclination (i = 25
          degrees) object whose orbit takes it from just inside Jupiter to
          just outside Mars (G. Williams). It is estimated to be 2-4 km
          (1-2 miles) in diameter.

   10/29/97

   New Near-Earth Asteroid, 1997 UH[9 ]
   = AINYXB, an Aten, was discovered with NEAT on October 29, 1997, moving
   2 degrees/day with V = 17.6. It is 0.5-1.2 km in size and has an orbit
   which crosses the Earth's and a mean radius within that of the Earth's.
   It has high eccentricity, 0.47, and high inclination, 25 degrees (G.
   Williams, SAO). This is the third Aten discovered with NEAT and one of
   only 27 known. Follow-up observations were a world-wide effort with
   observers at Loomberah, Ondrejov, Haleakala, Camarillo, Table Mountain,
   and Stull.
     __________________________________________________________________

   11/26/97

   1997 WB[21]
   = ASNY6E was discovered with NEAT on November 26, 1997 moving 1.3
   degrees/day at magnitude V = 18.7. Remarkably, it was recovered 3
   nights later with NEAT. Follow-up observations were made at
   Haleakala-NEAT/GEODSS, Sormano, and Dominion Astrophysical Observatory.
   1997 WB[21] is 170-370 meters in diameter, with a semi-major axis of
   1.44 astronomical units, and eccentricity of 0.31 (G. Williams, SAO).
   Its orbit is inclined only 3 degrees from the ecliptic plane.
     __________________________________________________________________

   11/30/97

   1997 WU[22]
   = AU5T56 was discovered with NEAT on Nov 30,1997 moving 0.5 degrees/day
   with V = 19. 1997 WU22 is 2-5 km in diameter. K. Lawrence found a
   "pre-discovery" observation from 1990 Palomar observations (PCAS -
   Helin et al.) that led to a refinement of its orbit and size. Because
   of this and the fact that its orbit crosses the Earth's, it is
   classified as one of the Potentially Dangerous Minor Planets, although
   there is no cause for concern now. Follow-up observations were made at
   Sormano and Dominion Astrophysical Observatory.

   12/25/97

   1992 BF is an Earth-crossing Aten discovered with PCAS (Helin et al.)
   and not re-observed for several years. NEAT recovered it on 12/25/97
   and 12/27/97 leading to a refinement of its orbit.
