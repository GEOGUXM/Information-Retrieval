   D H H S Seal                  THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
   SERVICES
                                                          WASHINGTON,
   D.C.  20201
                                                                  MAY  2

   Memorandum to:    Heads of Operating and Staff Divisions

   Subject:                  Best Practices Portfolio

   I am please to provide you with a copy of the attached document,
   Best Practices: Strategies for Recruiting, Hiring, and Retaining
   Hispanic and Other Minority Populations, developed as one of the action
   steps in our Hispanic Agenda for Action (HAA).  My expectation is that
   you will use this document as one resource in meeting our goals of
   making our Department a model workplace and providing the best customer
   service to all Americans.

   Our objective is to use the "Best Practices" portfolio of recruitment
   and employment strategies for Operating and Staff Divisions to
   implement in support of the HAA.  Current practices in the Department,
   in other Federal Agencies, and in the private sector are included in
   the portfolio.  "Best practices" are defined as those human resource
   practices that are cost effective and have demonstrated noteworthy
   results with respect to the employment of Hispanic and other minorities
   and persons with disabilities.  These practices comply with the law and
   are not intended to cause or result in unfairness.

   I am asking that you make every effort to foster collaboration and
   cooperation between your Human Resources and Equal Employment
   Opportunity Offices and your managers to ensure that they use the best
   practices and other innovative strategies in the recruitment and
   retention of targeted populations.

   I also want every manager to know of my commitment which is stated in
   our policy on Equal Employment Opportunity -- "I am asking for the
   support of all managers, not just in their hiring and promotion
   decisions, but also in welcoming responsibility for nurturing and
   capitalizing on the very best that every employee has to give."  I am
   sure you will communicate your commitments as well.  As public servants
   we have a responsibility to ensure that our efforts achieve a work
   force reflective of the nation we serve.  I am asking the Deputy
   Secretary to follow-up on your progress as part of your existing
   quarterly reviews.  Please inform your employees that this document is
   also available electronically via the Internet at
   http://oeeo.psc.gov .

   Thank you.

                         Donna E. Shalala Signature

                                                     Donna E. Shalala
