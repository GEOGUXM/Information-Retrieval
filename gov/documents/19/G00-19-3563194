        The External Carriers Group consist of four teams with many functions.

        The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Team has the engineering
        oversight for the MPLM development, analytical integration for the
        first MPLM flight, and sustaining engineering of the MPLM modules built
        by the Italian Space Agency.

        The ISS Development Team supplies technical expertise to the
        International Space Station design and development teams; facilities
        for Boeing to fabricate ISS elements; structural and modal testing
        facilities; specialized materials test capability; micrometeoroid
        debris hazard analysis; and transporting of the program critical
        hardware at MSFC. The team also supports MSFC in the Sustaining
        Engineering role by acting as a hub for voice communications for
        Huntington Beach and Conaga Park's Engineering Support Rooms (ESR).
        MSFC also provides the ESR support to Boeing with voice communications.

        The Payload Carriers Team is responsible for MSFC's Payload Carriers
        which is made up of two type of carriers: the Spacelab Logistics Pallet
        (SLP) and the Multi-Purpose Equipment Support Structure (MPESS). The
        Payload Carriers "bridge the gap" in payload accommodations available
        in the Space Shuttle's Payload Bay by providing unique structural,
        power, data and thermal resources to a variety of payloads. These
        carriers are designed to transport items safely through the rigors of
        high acceleration Shuttle launch and the vacuum of space while
        providing the flexibility to allow the Shuttle to minimize the mass
        transported to earth orbit.

        The fourth team is the Systems Engineering Team, which provides system
        engineering support for the other three teams..
