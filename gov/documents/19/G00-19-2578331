   Frequently Asked Questions

   1. How can I get a copy of a police report or accident report?
   Applications for these reports can be obtained at any police district
   or City Hall, Department of Records. Police Districts will provide you
   with a district control number that is required on every application.
   This number is generated for every police report and assists in the
   search for your particular report. After your application is submitted
   along with the required fee, your report will be mailed to the address
   indicated on your application.

   2. I have a Quality of Life issue (Graffiti, Underage Drinking, etc.),
   which should be addressed.  Who should I call?
   Contact the Police District in your neighborhood. If you are not sure
   which Police District you live in, call (215) 686-1776.  Your local
   Police District will provide you with the necessary information. For
   Police Emergencies, call 911.

   3. What do I do if my auto is stolen?
   Call 911 and an officer will come to your location to take the required
   report. If possible, have your registration and insurance card
   available for the officer taking the report. It is not advisable to
   leave your registration and insurance card inside your vehicle while
   not being operated as this affords someone who takes your vehicle with
   ownership paperwork.

   4. Who do I call regarding possible police service impropriety?
   You can go to any Police District and ask to speak to a supervisor who
   will assist you or you may call 911 and ask that a supervisor be sent
