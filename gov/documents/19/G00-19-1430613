                    DISTRIBUTED SCRIPTING FOR THE PEOPLE!
   _______________________________________________________________________

   AGNI is a multi-threaded middleware for scripting distributed,
   reconfigurable, event oriented applications. AGNI allows you to script
   distributed peer to peer applications from a single point of control
   and includes mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration and extension. (If
   you insist, you may call AGNI a mobile agent system.) We have found
   AGNI to be of use in scripting distributed testing, collaborative,
   distributed monitoring and control applications.

   AGNI is a Tcl extension and runs on SOLARIS and LINUX. A version of the
   system that runs on Windows NT is available but has not been entirely
   tested.

   AGNI was paid for by Uncle Sam and his Tax Payers. AGNI is therefore in
   the public domain. Feel free to download and modify it if need be and
   incorporate it into any product or project on the right side of the
   law, for profit or for loss or just for the sheer joy of it.
