   SIGNIFICANT PROJECT RESULTS
   Each of the LCLUC Principal Investigators is asked to periodically
   generate a summary of the Significant Results from their research.
   These presentations are used at the programmatic level to promote the
   LCLUC Program.
   The Significant Results from present and past years are provided here
   in Adobe and PowerPoint formats.
