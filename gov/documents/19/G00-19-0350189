                          Personal Information and Choice

        You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line

        "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
        readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal
        information includes such things as an individual's name, address,
        and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not
        considered personal information.

        We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily
        provide it to us by sending us email or completing an on-line form.
        You may choose not to contact us by email or to provide any personal
        information using an on-line form. Your choice to not participate in
        these activities will not impair your ability to browse the DFI web
        site and read or download any information provided on the site.

        If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered
        by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may
        protect it. However, this information is a public record once you
        provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if
        not protected by federal or state law.

        If you believe that your personal/private information is being used
        for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may
        contact the DFI contact person as shown in the Contact Information
        Section of this statement.

        Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
        requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will
        be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be
        subject to public access.

                           Public Access to Information

     In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is
     open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records
     and information possessed by state government. At the same time,
     there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records
     that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.
     Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

     All of the information collected at this site becomes public records
     that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the
     public, unless an exemption in law exists. RCW 42.17. 260(1) states
     that:

     Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make
     available for public inspection and copying all public records,
     unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection
     (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or
     other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific
     information or records. To the extent required to prevent an
     unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW
     42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details
     in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it
     makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each
     case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in
     writing.

     In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the
     Public Records Act or other law governing DFIs disclosure of
     records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will
     control.

            Nondisclosure of Certain Personal/Private Information

     DFI may request or require you to provide certain personal/private
     information in order to lodge a complaint or obtain information. The
     information is requested or required in order to achieve the
     purpose. You may choose not to provide this information, but if you
     choose not to provide it we will be unable to fulfill the purpose,
     and you will have to fulfill the purpose in person, by mail, or
     otherwise.

        Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information

     You can review any personally identifiable information we collect
     about you by using the information in the Contact Information
     section at the end of this Notice. You may recommend changes to your
     personally identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by
     submitting an email or letter request that credibly shows the
     inaccuracy. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity
     before granting access or making corrections. (RCW 43.105.310)
