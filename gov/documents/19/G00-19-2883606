                         NASA Website Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site...

1. To read or download information:

     We may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For
     example, we may count the number of visitors to the different
     sections of our site to help us make them more useful to visitors.
     Similar information is gathered for anonymous ftp, remote account
     login, or for other comparable types of connections.

2. To send us an E-mail:

     By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
     personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as in an
     official FOIA request. We may store the name and address of the
     requester in order to respond to the request or to otherwise resolve
     the subject matter of your E-mail.

3. To register:

     Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information to
     fill out a registration form. For example, vendors looking for
     marketing opportunities by visiting our NASA Acquisition Internet
     Service sites may be asked to "register" to obtain email notices of
     business opportunities. Other information which may be collected at
     these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means,
     enable us to determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of
     providing better service to our customers.

   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
