      OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS

        MISSION

   The Office of Hearings and Appeals (HG) is responsible for conducting
   hearings, and issuing the initial decision of the Department with
   respect to any adjudicative proceedings which the Secretary may
   delegate, except those within the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy
   Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Board of Contract Appeals.
   Jurisdiction encompasses complaints filed under the DOE Contractor
   Employee Protection Program, Proposed Remedial Orders issued by the
   Economic Regulatory Administration, and Personnel Security Hearing
   Officer and Review functions. The Office analyzes and decides appeals
   requesting review of any determination reached by any other official
   within the Department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary,
   including initial determinations under the Freedom of Information Act,
   the Privacy Act, the payments-equal-to-taxes (PETT) provisions of
   Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, the special assessment
   provisions for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
   Decommissioning Fund under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the
   reimbursement of costs of remedial actions at active uranium or thorium
   processing sites under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the emergency
   international oil allocation provisions of the Energy Policy and
   Conservation Act, and the Standby Mandatory Crude Oil and Product
   Allocation, Refinery Yield Control and Pricing Programs. HG is
   responsible for deciding Applications for Exception from the generally
   applicable requirements of a rule, regulation or order of the
   Department. It develops and implements procedures under the Petroleum
   Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 for refunding oil
   overcharge funds obtained pursuant to Departmental consent orders,
   remedial orders, and court orders to injured parties. The Office also
   analyzes Petitions for Special Redress seeking "extraordinary relief"
   apart from or in addition to any other remedy provided in the
   Department's enabling statutes. The organization of HG also includes
   the Board of Contract Appeals (BC). However, no operational realignment
   of BC with HG is contemplated by AD at this time.

        ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS

   HG reviews orders issued by other organizations of the Department
   (other than FERC and BC), including Proposed Remedial Orders of the
   Economic Regulatory Administration, initial decisions on
   "whistleblower" complaints of the Office of Contractor Employee
   Protection, initial determinations (Department-wide) under the Freedom
   of Information and Privacy Acts, initial determinations by the Office
   of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management for payments into the
   Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommisioning Fund and payments
   out of that fund for the reimbursement of costs of remedial action at
   active uranium or thorium processing sites, and initial decisions by
   the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management under the PETT
   provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. HG also conducts Personnel
   Security Hearing Officer and Review functions for the Office of
   Security Affairs. Certain decisions and orders issued by HG are subject
   to review on appeal by FERC.

   therefore, central to the implementation of the Administration's energy
   policy. Those decisions establish precedent and legal guidance for key
   divisions of the Department and govern the manner in which these
   Offices exercise their responsibilities and affect all levels of the
   energy industry. This Office also provides legal support to the
   Director and to other offices in the Department on matters involving
   Office of Hearings and Appeals litigation and procedural regulations.

   of plans which assess the extent of injury and establish mechanisms to
   make monetary restitution for prior regulatory violations. Activities
   involve the selection and application of various methods of financial
   analysis and the use of sophisticated indices to measure the fiscal
   impact of Departmental programs on a wide variety of business and

      OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

        MISSION

   This Office is responsible for analyzing submissions and recommending

   applications, develops a full administrative record by receiving
   documentary evidence, conducting adversarial hearings involving expert
   econometric testimony, and preparing detailed written determinations.
   Submissions considered by this Office require economic analysis of the
   activities of major corporations, in order to assess the effects of
   those activities and to structure specific remedies for regulatory
   abuses. This Office performs analyses to develop appropriate economic
   structures for refunding petroleum overcharges to adversely affected
   parties. The resolution of these issues results in a substantial impact
   on various sectors of the economy, including refiners, major utilities,
   industrial and military installations, as well as on Federal, state,
   and local governmental entities in all regions of the United States.
