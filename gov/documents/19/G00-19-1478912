   Welcome to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Regulatory
   Reform Web-Site.  On June 8, 2001, HHS Secretary Thompson announced a
   Department-wide initiative to reduce regulatory burdens in health care
   and respond faster to the concerns of health care providers, state and
   local governments, and individual Americans who are affected by HHS
   rules.  As part of this initiative, the Department is establishing the
   Secretary's Advisory Committee on Regulatory Reform to provide findings
   in and recommendations regarding potential regulatory changes.  The
   committee will address four broad areas: health care delivery, health
   systems operations, biomedical and health research, and the development
   of pharmaceuticals and other products.
