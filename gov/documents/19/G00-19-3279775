                              SARSAT System Diagram
             The SARSAT system uses NOAA satellites in low-earth and
        geostationary orbits to detect and locate aviators, mariners, and
       land-based users in distress. The satellites relay distress signals
           from emergency beacons to a network of ground stations and
       ultimately to the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) in Suitland,
        Maryland. The USMCC processes the data and alerts the appropriate
             search and rescue authorities. SARSAT is a part of the
                      international Cospas-Sarsat Program.
