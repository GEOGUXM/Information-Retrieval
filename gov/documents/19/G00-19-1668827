   The U.S. Department of Energy is directly sponsoring research
   participation programs at Argonne as well as 18 other DOE facilities.
   Apply for specific research assignments through the Argonne site. The
   Division of Educational Programs (DEP) serves as the interface between
   the Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the
   academic community. Within ANL are unique capabilities which afford
   numerous opportunities for domestic and international participants
   interested in energy research and training in science and technology.
   DEP remains a full partner with scientific divisions at ANL in
   identifying and providing educational opportunities for persons at all
   educational levels. It continues to make serious investments in
   expanded opportunities, for career pursuits by all, including women,
   people of color, economically disadvantaged and those with
   disabilities. While the focus of the programs is primarily on
   individuals, DEP collaborates with several universities, colleges,
   technical institutes, informal educational centers, consortia, and the
   precollege community. In support of the educational mission of ANL, DEP
   presents this information. The intent is to promote, develop, and
   facilitate educational and research interactions among ANL and
   interested institutions, organizations and agencies. The intended
   periods of program activity are the spring semester and summer of 2002.
   Your participation in programs described is invited and encouraged.
