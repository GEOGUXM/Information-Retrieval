Introduction

   Hard Probe Collaboration is a group of physicists who are interested in
   the problem of hard processes in high-energy nuclear collisions and
   using them as probes of the dense matter that might be formed in the
   collisions. The aim of this collaboration is to provide a systematic
   survey of hard processes and their rates in nucleon-nucleon,
   nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The
   collaboration will also provide a forum for discussions of hard
   processes in high-energy nuclear collisions. The collaboration started
   in 1994. Our first survey of hard processes in hadrnic interactions was
   published in Int. J. Mod. Phys. A10, 2881-3090 (1995). We expect
   complete the study of hard processes in hadron-nucleus by early 2000.
   In the future, we also plan to organize summer schools on the topics of
   hard processes in nuclear collisions.
