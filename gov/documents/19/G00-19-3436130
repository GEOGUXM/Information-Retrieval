             The scheduled 15-day, 21-hour STS-78 Life and Microgravity
             Spacelab (LMS) mission will help set the stage for the
             International Space Station by studying the effects of
             long-duration space flight on human physiology and conducting
             the type of experiments that would fly on the orbital platform.
             Columbia will climb to a 173-statute-mile (278-kilometer)-high
             orbit with a 39-degree inclination to the Earth's equator to
             allow the seven-member flight crew to maintain the same
             sleep/wake rhythms they are accustomed to on Earth and to reduce
             vibrational and directional forces that could affect on-board
             microgravity experiments.

             Once in orbit, the crew will enter the 40-foot (13-meter)
             pressurized Spacelab module to begin the 22 LMS life science and
             microgravity experiments in the laboratory and in lockers in the
             middeck area of the orbiter's crew cabin. Thirteen of the life
             sciences experiments will be devoted to the study of the effects
             of microgravity on human physiology, while six microgravity
             experiments will be conducted to produce metallic alloys and
             protein crystals and study the behavior of fluids and materials
             processing in the near-weightless environment of space.

             The mission's experiments will build on previous Shuttle
             spacelab
             flights dedicated to life sciences and microgravity
             investigations
             (Spacelab Life Sciences 1 and 2 -- STS-40 and STS-58, and
             International
             Microgravity Laboratory 1 and 2 -- STS-42 and STS-65).

   Launch:

             Launch June 20, 1996 10:49:00.0075 a.m. EDT. Launch window was 2
             hours 30 min. The STS-78 launch countdown was conducted in
             Firing Room 3 of the Launch Control Complex (LCC) and it
             included 35 hours 49 minutes of built in holds. (For hold times,
             Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/18/1996).

             On 6/20/96, the payload crew was woken up at 5:39am EDT and the
             flight crew at 5:54am EDT. The crew had breakfast in the
             Operations and Checkout Building at 6:25am EDT. At 7:29am EDT,
             the countdown clock came out of a scheduled two hour hold and
             was at T-3 hours and counting. At 7:31am EDT, the crew departed
             the O&C building on their way to Launch Pad 39A. The crew
             entered Columbia and the hatch was closed out by 9:29am EDT. At
             10:19am EDT the countdown clock picked up the T-20 minutes and
             counting.

             On 6/19/96, workers completed closeout of the aft engine
             compartment and the Master Events Controller (MEC) #1 was
             retested and no problems were found relating to its critical
             control functions. The MEC has been cleared for flight. All late
             access stowage of experiments in the Spacelab module and middeck
             were completed. The RSS was retracted around 10:30 pm.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/19/1996).

             On 6/18/96, the mission management team decided to have the aft
             main engine compartment reopened and X-ray the Power Drive Units
             (PDU) for the orbiter's external tank doors. The units were
             suspected of having possible loose screws in the PDU terminal
             circuitry boards because of inspections on the orbiter Atlantis
             PDU's. After the X-rays were developed, it was verified that all
             suspect screws are secure and properly installed and the aft
             compartment was closed again for flight. Cryogenic reactant
             loading into the power reactant storage and distribution system
             and the extended duration orbiter (EDO) pallet was completed and
             late access stowage of experiments into the Life and
             Microgravity Spacelab (SPACELAB-LMS) payload will begin on
             6/19/96. KSC area weather forcases indicate a 60 percent
             probability of good weather on launch day. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 6/18/1996). (Reference KSC Weather History
             06/18/1996 2000). Another issue has arisen concerning the No. 1
             Master Events Controller (MEC). During routine testing,
             engineers noticed incorrect BITE (Built In Test Equipment)
             indications from the MEC. Further analysis revealed the software
             errors were not critical to this mission, but managers want to
             insure the errors are not masking other potential problems that
             might come to light later in the countdown. There are two MECs
             in the orbiter's aft engine compartment. They process signals to
             arm and safe pyrotechnics and command and fire pyrotechnics
             during SRB / external tank separation and orbiter / external
             tank separation.

             On 6/17/96, the Countdown began at the T-43 hour mark at 4:00am
             EST. A countdown status briefing was held 9:30am EST and crew
             arrived at KSC SLF at 3:30pm. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             6/17/1996).

             On 6/3/96, Columbia's crew arrived for the Terminal Countdown
             Demonstration Test. The TCDT is a countdown rehearsal for the
             crew and launch team at KSC and is conducted prior to each
             flight. The test ends on 6/4/96 with a simulated main engine
             shutdown at the pad. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/03/1996).

             On 5/29/96, the Shuttle Columbia began moving out of the Vehicle
             Assembly Building to Pad 39B at around 11:50pm. The shuttle
             arrived at the pad about 5 hours later. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 5/29/1996).
             On 4/18/96, in OPF Bay 2, the installation of the three Space
             Shuttle Main Engines (SSME's) was completed as well as the
             removal and replacement of the No. 3 TACAN unit used in landing
             navigation. In the O&C Building, closeouts of the Spacelab Life
             Sciences LMS Payload were completed. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 4/18/1996). The LMS payload moved to the Orbiter
             Processing Facility and was installed in Columbia. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 4/29/1996) and the tunnel adapter was
             installed 4/30/96. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/01/1996).

             On 3/27/96, in Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Bay 2, the drag
             chute was installed on orbiter Columbia and test were started on
             the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS). The Space Shuttle Main
             Engines (SSME's) are scheduled to be installed April 15.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 3/27/1996). The nose landing gear
             wheel and tires were installed on 3/29/96 and
             the payload bay was prepared for the Spacelab Life and
             Microgravity Science Laboratory. Also Tacan No. 1 did not pass
             functional testing and was removed. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 3/29/1996). In the OPF, Columbia's Windows No. 3 and 4
             were polished and in the VAB, stacking of the left Solid Rocket
             Booster (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP) was
             underway. A Crew Equipment Interface Test (CEIT) was also being
             conducted on Spacelab LMS experiments in the Operations and
             Checkout (O&C) building. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             4/02/1996). On 4/5/96, leak and functional checks of the LOX
             side of the MPS was completed and work was done to remove one of
             the orbiter's S-Band transponders which did not pass testing.

             Columbia was given the go for a deorbit burn on the first KSC
             Landing opportunity. The burn occured on orbit 271 at 7:37 a.m.
             EDT and the landing at KSC completed 272 revolutions of the
             planet. KSC weather at the time of landing was acceptable. Cloud
             ceilings were at 13,000 and 21,000 ft. (Reference KSC Weather
             History 07/07/1996 0800). Main Gear Touchdown at Mission Elapsed
             Time (MET) of 16 days 21 hours 47 min 45 sec. Nose Gear
