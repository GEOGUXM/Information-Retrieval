                    Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS)

     are projects that are developing an LDAS at both the North American
     (NLDAS) and global (GLDAS) scales. Both projects will lead to more
      accurate reanalysis and forecast simulations by numerical weather
      prediction (NWP) models. Specifically, the system will reduce the
      errors in the stores of soil moisture and energy which are often
   present in NWP models and which degrade the accuracy of forecasts. LDAS
     is currently running in near real-time on 1/8th-degree (NLDAS) and
     1/4th-degree grids. The systems are currently forced by terrestrial
       (NLDAS) or space based (GLDAS) precipitation data, space-based
      radiation data and numerical model output. In order to create an
   optimal scheme, the projects have involved several LSMs and sources of
    data from several institutions and may eventually include many more.
    Data from the project can be accessed on the NLDAS and GLDAS forcing
   pages, the NLDAS and GLDAS model output pages, as well as on the NLDAS
                  and GLDAS Realtime Image Generator pages.
