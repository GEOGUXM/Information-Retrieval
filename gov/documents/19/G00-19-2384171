   USAID/OFDA: Committed to Helping the People of Afghan Camp of displaced
   persons in Herat, shows barren land with mountains in the background.
   istan

   In April 2001, USAID/OFDA made history by sending a team into
   Afghanistan to provide the U.S. Government with a first-hand assessment
   of a devastating three-year drought and to determine effective
   assistance response strategies. The team members were the first U.S.
   officials to enter Afghanistan since 1998. The team consisted of a
   USAID/OFDA health officer, a USAID/OFDA nutritionist, and a refugee
   officer from the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees,
   and Migration. The team visited some of Afghanistan's worst
   drought-affected areas, including Herat and Farah provinces in the
   west, and Balkh, Samangan, and Faryab provinces in the north. The team
   witnessed villagers who had only bread mixed with wild grasses, saw
   fields that were barren, and heard stories of how the elderly were
   dying of disease as they gave up their food for the children in the
   village. Entire villages were pulling up stakes and moving to camps
   near the cities of Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif. The team's conclusion was
   that Afghanistan stood at the edge of a widespread and precipitous
   famine.

   Drought-affected village in Smangan USAID/OFDA responded by deploying a
   Disaster Assistance and Response Team (DART) to Pakistan to assist in
   managing the U.S. Government's humanitarian program. In response to
   Afghanistan's deepening crisis of drought and civil war, USAID/OFDA
   overcame obstacles, including severe constraints on humanitarian
   access, to provide $12.6 million in relief assistance to Afghans living
   in Afghanistan as well as in Pakistan during fiscal year 2001. The
   USAID/OFDA assistance was part of a three-pronged strategy designed to
   prevent further displacement by assisting people in their home
   villages; helping those who had already been forced to move to camps
   and other locations; and assisting displaced people in preparing for an
   eventual return to their homes. USAID/OFDA assistance was part of a
   $178.7 million U.S. Government humanitarian program during 2001 - the
   largest humanitarian assistance program in the world.

   As part of a longer-running series of USAID assistance efforts that
   began in 1991 following the withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces,
   USAID/OFDA has demonstrated a long-term commitment to assisting the
   people of Afghanistan. As deepening civil conflict forced the end of
   the $132 million USAID cross-border development program in 1994,
   USAID/OFDA and Food for Peace, the food assistance office within USAIDs
   Bureau for Humanitarian Response, became the only U.S. Government
   offices still able to run programs inside Afghanistan. From 1994 to
   2001, USAID/OFDA provided a total of $32 million in humanitarian aid,
   meeting a wide range of needs including emergency shelter for displaced
   people, heating assistance, support for emergency health programs, and
   relief commodities. Assistance was targeted to help Afghans survive the
   country's deadly mix of poverty, displacement, and civil conflict, and
   it increased significantly as Afghanistans three-year drought grew
   worse. In addition, USAID/OFDA responded to natural disasters including
   the two earthquakes that devas Group of people drilling for water in
   Herat tated parts of northern Afghanistan in 1998.

   Since October 1, 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $34,000,000
   in grants and in-kind contributions to humanitarian agencies that are
   still operating in Afghanistan despite the current crisis. This total
   continues to increase as USAID/OFDA funds additional relief efforts
   (for the latest details, please refer to USAID Central Asia Task Force
   reporting on the region). Now more than ever, USAID/OFDA remains
   committed to assisting the Afghan people.
