   Director's Message

      The National Cancer Institute is a remarkable enterprise that
      represents a unique confluence of history, politics, science,
      technology, and even philosophy. It is a public institution dedicated
      to reducing the burden of cancer for all our Nation's citizens and
      people around the world.

      Through basic intellectual inquiry, the generation of new knowledge and
      tools, and the application of discovery, it has the capacity to change
      the course of history by reducing the terrible toll placed on people
      and society by that group of diseases we call cancer. NCI is successful
      because we are part of an extensive network of biomedical and broad
      scientific research and technology that gives us the tools to ask
      questions, find and interpret answers, and turn those answers into
      useful ways of enhancing health and reducing disease.

      Each year, my colleagues and I prepare this plan and budget proposal,
      as prescribed by the National Cancer Act of 1971. To set forth new
      goals and objectives for the "Nation's investment in cancer research,"
      we first examine the gaps in our understanding of cancer and our
      ability to translate and apply what we know for the benefit of people.
      This analysis helps us determine the larger context in which we carry
      out our mission.

      The primary gap upon which all of our efforts are predicated is the one
   between ignorance and knowledge about this disease. Attempting to
   address the many unanswered questions about cancer is an incredibly
   challenging intellectual exercise and an essential step in successfully
   and predictably reducing its burden. Increasing our knowledge about
   cancer is difficult, complex, and often confusing. The road to
   discovery often takes us in unexpected directions and brings us to
   unexpected outcomes or insights. We must explore blind alleys, question
   and change old knowledge and beliefs, and figure out how seemingly
   unrelated pieces of information fit together. Working alone and in
   groups, we constantly draw on new talent, evolve and use new tools, and
   capitalize on creativity, intelligence, persistence - and very often,
   luck!

                                                               Top of Page

   Our second task is to close the gap between knowledge gained through
   science and the translation of that information to the actual
   experience of people at risk for, diagnosed with, or surviving cancer.
   This requires moving new knowledge directly into the setting of the
   disease. We must establish new insights into individual risks for
   developing cancer; new, more targeted approaches to early detection; a
   new molecular view of diagnosis; and entirely new approaches to the
   prevention, treatment, and control of cancer and its consequences. This
   type of translational research is our first step in the transformation
   of cancer medicine and public health to more certainty and precision.
   It is our road to transforming therapy from trial and error to rational
   design and the development of targeted interventions.

   Third, our NCI activities must address the gap between this
   translational work and actually reducing the burden of cancer - between
   what might work or looks promising and what really does work. We need
   to move research results to their application in clinical practice and
   public health by conducting extensive clinical trials that will define
   the details of how new approaches will work and determine what the
   benefits and risks of specific interventions are. This clinical
   research establishes or refutes the extent of benefit to patients of
   new approaches to reducing the risk of, preventing, detecting,
   diagnosing, and treating cancer and provides the bridge to better, less
   invasive, and longer-term solutions.

   The final gap that we strive to close is one of the most frustrating
   because it seems to be due to things that we should have the power to
   influence change. This is the discontinuity between what we have
   already established as effective in reducing the burden of cancer and
   the practice and availability of that hard-won knowledge for all people
   regardless of where they live, whether they are rich or poor, or what
   their cultural backgrounds are. Bridging this divide requires better
   understanding the unequal burden of this disease, addressing
   disparities in the quality of cancer care, and implementing the most
   effective interventions to address them.

   We must work to bridge each of these gaps through the dissemination,
   diffusion, and adoption of new insights. This means finding the most
   effective ways to share findings and encourage collaborations among
   researchers. It means applying the best communications technologies to
   facilitate translational and clinical trial activities. And it means
   arming practitioners with the information and tools they need to
   achieve a level of comfort that will allow them to successfully use new
   approaches in their work with cancer patients, people at risk, and
   survivors.

   The true measure of excellence for an enterprise is both where it can
   go and where it has been. With our future planning, we look back to the
   myriad of initiatives supported by NCI and how these have begun to
   close the gaps, and we look ahead to the many important next steps
   needed to continue. As stewards of the public trust, we have a grave
   responsibility to chart a course and develop a plan and budget that
   will allow us to maintain the superior quality of all of our research
   programs.

   In addition, we must meet the challenges that come with new approaches,
   technology, and knowledge and build on past discovery in areas of
   "extraordinary opportunity" that address all cancers as well as the
   specific needs of different types of cancer. And through all of these
   efforts, we must remain vigilant in addressing the barriers to full
   implementation of new interventions that will bring quality cancer care
   to all people.

   Our plans emerge through the insights and wisdom we gain from the
   input, questioning, feedback, and collective experience of all involved
   in the cancer research enterprise. The future plans and priorities we
   identify now set the rationale for our decisions along the way, give us
   a systematic framework for assessing progress, and provide a clear and
   credible means for reporting our performance and results to the public.

   But these plans, these strategies, these technologies provide only a
   framework. The real work begins with people, people who are at the
   heart of delivering the full promise of our plans and investments.
   These people, be they patient or health care provider, scientist or
   administrator, advocate or lawmaker are the ones we must count on to
   close the gaps between ignorance and knowledge, knowledge and
   application, and burden and access to or availability of care.

   Though the focus and methods have changed as the science has evolved,
   our goal to improve the plight of all people everywhere is unwavering.
   With the courage of our cancer research and care community and the
   continued strength of our resources, hope is stronger and more certain
   than ever, and the years to come hold promise beyond our imaginations!
