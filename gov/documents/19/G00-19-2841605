                        Robotic Autonomy Architecture

          CLARAty: Coupled Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy



   This task is developing and implementing a comprehensive control
   architecture for multiple, disparate, interacting, planetary rovers.
   The control of these systems will utilize the architecture to implement
   artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous sequence planning,
   error handling, and recovery during surface operations in an unknown
   terrain. It is an explicit objective of this task to have the resultant
   architecture exported to other NASA rover systems, providing a common
   software environment for research, development, and flight.

   Initially, CLARAty is being structured to encompass the existing
   functionality of existing NASA robotics software infrastructure. This
   is enabling immediate utilization for the implementation of Artificial
   Intelligence techniques for autonomy and surface operations
   re-sequencing, and providing a growth path by which existing systems
   may move into this new architecture. However, extensions of operations
   to more difficult scenarios, including multiple rover coordination,
   will require utilization of the full-scale architecture, and may
   require reformulation of the individual system control implementation
   as specified by it. Therefore, in future years, this task will
   demonstrate the multi-asset scenario, as a working proof of the utility
   of the newly developed formulation.
