                                  Dispatch
                                         June 1999
   _______________________________________________________________________

     As reported in previous issues of Cheesebox,  the Monitorís hull is
deteriorating at an alarming rate.  A long-range, comprehensive plan for the
 preservation of the wreck and recovery of artifacts was finalized last year
    and specifies that the Monitor be preserved through a combination of
 stabilization and selective recovery of components of the wreck, including
  the propeller, engine, guns, and the turret.  The 1998 Monitor Expedition
   completed the first phase of the recommended option and resulted in the
              successful recovery of the Monitorís propeller.
                       _______________________________

          1999 Monitor Expeditions:  Continuing the Long-range Plan

                               June Expedition

    This year NOAA, in partnership with several dedicated organizations,
   is conducting two research expeditions to gather data needed for a
   final engineering and recovery plan.  During June 14-27 we will be
   aboard the Navy salvage ship USS Grasp, heading back to the Monitor
   National Marine Sanctuary for the next step in our efforts to stabilize
   the Monitorís hull and recover selected components of the wreck.  With
   the U.S. Navy and The Marinersí Museum, we will begin the 1999 field
   season by building on information collected during last yearís highly
   successful expedition.  Navy divers will collect additional data
   critical to developing final stabilization and recovery plans.  In
   August, NOAA will conduct a second expedition.

    Goals for the Navy mission include:
     * Continue the survey and assessment of the lower hull above the
       machinery space.
     * Assess the feasibility of removing the engine.
     * Test the feasibility of using divers to install cement bags for
       hull shoring and stabilization.
     * Map the stern of the Monitor using the best available technology.
     * Continue mapping exposed objects in the stern debris field and
       attempt to locate the rudder.
     * ocument on film and video both surface and subsurface mission
       operations and activities.

   Participants in the June expedition will include:

   U.S. Navy
   The Office of the Supervisor of Salvage and Diving will provide
   engineering coordination and on-site support; will coordinate
   activities with NOAA.

   Combat Logistics Group Two, based at Little Creek, Virginia, will
   coordinate the scheduling and tasking of the USS Grasp,  the salvage
   vessel that will support the 1999 Monitor Mission.

   Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two is responsible for providing diving
   in support of mission goals under direction of the commanding officer
   of the Grasp.

   Oceaneering Technologies, Inc., a division of Oceaneering
   International, is the Navyís contractor for  salvage and will provide
   on-site engineering support and consultation.

   Marine Sanctuaries Division, NOAA
   Responsible for the overall planning and coordination of the
   archeological and engineering aspects of the mission; coordinating
   funding, interagency cooperation and all other aspects.  Sanctuary
   manager John Broadwater will serve as Chief Scientist, direct NOAA
   aspects of the mission, and represent NOAA on site to help ensure that
   goals are met without adverse effects to the Monitorís hull and
   contents.

   The Marinersí Museum
    Responsible for the conservation and curation of all recovered
   cultural material; will also participate in the documentation,
   education and public affairs aspects of the mission.

    The USS Grasp will set a massive four-point mooring system during the
   period June 14-16 to allow the ship to remain stationary over the
   Monitor during dive operations,   which will take place between June 17
   and June 27.

   This expedition will continue the survey and assessment of the
   Monitorís hull.  Efforts will be made to test the structural integrity
   of the lower hull above the machinery space, which will involve
   attempting to remove one or more hull plates.  This activity is related
   to the assessment of the feasibility of removing the engine.  No
   recovery of major components of the wreck is planned for this year.
                            _____________________

                              August Expedition

   From August 3-27, on-site research will focus on contin-ued survey and
   assessment of the engine room, artifact recovery, and excavations in
   the turret.  Specific goals will include:
     * Document, through drawings, measurements, and photography, the
       hull, stem to stern; the stern; the turret; and the lower hull and
       machinery spaces.
     * Map and recover exposed artifacts beneath the hull that may be
       damaged by planned shoring activities.
     * Excavate inside and at the base of the turret and map the excavated
       areas.
     * Inspect permanent mapping datums, replace as necessary, and measure
       between datums.
     * Document on film and video, to the extent possible, both surface
       and subsurface expedition operations and activities.
     * Obtain video and still images, with scales, of the entire midships
       bulkhead.
     * Identify and tag several key frames to be used as reference points.

   Participants in the August expedition will include:

   Marine Sanctuaries Division, NOAA
   The Marine Sanctuaries Division is responsible for overall planning and
   coordination of the archaeological and engineering aspects of the
   expedition, and for coordinating funding, interagency cooperation and
   all other aspects.  NOAA archaeologists and research personnel will be
   on site at all times to ensure that the Operations Manual goals are met
   and that the Monitorís hull and contents are not harmed.

   NOAA Diving Center
   Responsible for establishing training and operational parameters,
   approving the dive procedures portion of the operations plan,
   certifying all participating divers, providing essential equipment and
   personnel and overseeing dive operations.

   National Undersea Research Center/UNC-Wilmington
   Responsible for the operation of the recompression chamber and for gas
   mixing and filling; providing a research vessel and captain, as well as
   personnel and equipment to support the diving operation.

   The Cambrian Foundation
   Responsible for dive training and on-site dive supervision and for
   providing divers and specialized equipment.

   The Marinersí Museum
   Responsible for the conservation and curation of all recovered cultural
   material; participate in documentation, education, and public affairs.
   Artifacts recovered from both expeditions will be transported to The
   Marinersí Museum for treatment and eventual exhibition.

                              Propeller Update

    The Monitorís propeller has been in conservation for almost a year and
   looks very different from when it entered the process.  Most of the
   concretion has been removed, revealing metal that is in surprisingly
   good condition.  The propeller was cleaned and examined in April and
   the tank refilled with deionized, rather than tap, water.  See the next
   issue of Cheesebox for a more detailed article.

       Administrationís FY2000 Budget Recommends Doubling Budget for
                                 Sanctuaries

    Recognizing the importance of the National Marine Sanctuaries, the
   Administrationís Land Legacy Initiative proposes an increase of $15
   million to strengthen the nationís only system of marine protected
   areas.  NOAAís FY2000 budget requests $105 million of new funding to
   fulfill the environmental mandates outlined in the Lands Legacy
   Initiative.

   Your Congressional representatives are currently wrestling with
   difficult budget decisions and would like to hear from you concerning
   these important issues.  You can learn more about the budget and how to
   express your views to members of Congress at the
   NOAA Legislative Affairs Web Site and the Thomas Web Site.
