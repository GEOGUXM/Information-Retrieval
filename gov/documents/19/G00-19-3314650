   The Department of Veterans Affairs has outlined a national strategy for
   VHA telemedicine in SCI. The objective is to examine care of veterans
   with SCI and to support the use of technology for care and management
   of veterans with SCI. One area is VHAÂ’s desire to support the
   innovative use of telemedicine to enhance services for veterans with
   spinal cord injuries and disorders. Two requests for proposals were
   issued in November 1998 for demonstration projects on use of
   telemedicine in home care of veterans with SCI&D (IL 10-98-021) and for
   teleconsultation demonstration projects for veterans with SCI&D (IL
   10-98-022). For copies of these requests please see the Department of
   Veterans Affairs, VHA Publications, Directives Management System.

   The purpose of the tele-home care effort for SCI&D is to augment the
   continuum of care for veterans with SCI&D and reduce travel burdens for
   patients and providers. The purpose of the teleconsultation proposals
   is to develop and implement teleconsultation services between VA SCI
   centers to SCI support clinics and/or SCI primary care teams. Each of
   the RFAs required some discussion of the expected outcomes and benefits
   of these innovative programs. These outcomes may include satisfaction,
   clinical outcomes, technical quality, functional measures and cost
   savings. The funding is to be used for the development and
   implementation of the program. Funds may be used for necessary
   telemedicine equipment and to support staffing necessary to coordinate
   and implement the project. However, currently, funding is provided on a
   non-recurring one-year period to start these innovative programs.

   For the first year (FY99), a total of 11 proposals for tele-home care
   were funded, involving 13 facilities. The proposals funded were for the
   following VA facilities: Hines, Albuquerque, Augusta, Bronx, Dallas,
   West Roxbury, Seattle, San Diego, Palo Alto, Memphis, and Milwaukee. In
   addition, funding was awarded to 9 facilities for teleconsultation
   efforts. These included Milwaukee, Palo Alto, Bronx, Seattle, Dallas,
   San Diego, Cleveland, Hines, and West Roxbury VA's. The Strategic
   Healthcare Group for Telemedicine has developed a satisfaction
   questionnaire for patients and staff who use telemedicine.

   A research question related to use of telemedicine to manage and/or
   prevent pressure ulcers in SCI is included in the RFP on pressure
   ulcers.

   A related project on pressure ulcer assessment and telemedicine is
   being conducted By Julie Lowery, PhD at the Ann Arbor Veterans
   Administration Medical Center. This study is being funded by Health
   Services Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs
   through a solicitation for research on cross-cutting issues in
   telemedicine.
