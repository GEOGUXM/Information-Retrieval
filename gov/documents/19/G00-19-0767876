   COX RESPONDS TO DAVIS STATE OF THE STATE

   California Faces a Crisis of Leadership

   (SACRAMENTO) Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) tonight
   responded to Governor Gray Davis State of the State Address, saying
   Californias latest crisis is a glaring lack of leadership. Cox says the
   governor failed to address the full scope of Californias $12.4 billion
   budget deficit.

   What Governor Davis did was identify $2 billion in possible cutsthen
   called on the legislature to sort out the rest, said Cox. Just like the
   energy crisis, the governor seems more interested in letting someone
   else solve the problem. Davis today called a special session of the
   legislature to find solutions to Californias budget crisis.

   Cox also says Davis pledge not to raise taxes was carefully crafted to
   provide an escape route. The governor promised not to advocate for a
   tax increase, said Cox. We wonder if hell keep that commitment when his
   Democratic colleagues bully him around at budget time. Buckling under
   Democratic pressure last year, Davis signed a spending plan that is
   severely out-of-balance and includes a $1.2 billion sales tax hike.

   Despite Davis claims of fiscal responsibility, state expenditures have
   increased 37 percent since the governor took office three years ago.
   During the same period the states population has increased only five
   percent.

   The first step toward recovery is admitting you have a problem, said
   Cox. Once again, Governor Davis seems to be in a state of denialand
   hoping someone else will step in and lead.
