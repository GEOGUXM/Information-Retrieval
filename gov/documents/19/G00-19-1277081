Privacy Statement

   This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your
   visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you
   do when visiting our site.

   If you visit our site to read or download information, such as
   information regarding Section 508, we collect and store only the
   following information about you:

     * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
       example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
       account).
     * The date and time you access our site.
     * The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly
       to our site.

   If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail containing personal
   information:

   You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for
   example your mailing address, in an electronic mail message requesting
   that information or records be mailed to you. Information collected in
   this manner is used solely for responding to requests for information
   or records.

   For SITE MANAGEMENT, information from both categories is collected for
   statistical purposes. This Government computer system uses software
   programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes
   as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our
   site, what information is of most and least interest, determining
   technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or
   problem areas.

   For SITE SECURITY purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, this Government computer system employs
   software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
   attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
   Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   this site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act.

   COOKIES: The term "cookie" refers to a file that is placed on your
   computer's hard drive by a website to track information about your
   usage of the website. Cookies that remain on your hard drive and are
   used after you end your session on a website are called "persistent
   cookies." We do not use persistent cookies and we will not place this
   kind of file on your computer. The term "session cookies" refers to
   temporary files that are created to enhance your use of our site during
   your current session. We may use session cookies for this purpose, but
   they are not retained or used to track any personal information.

   NOTICE: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you
   when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information
   to us. If you voluntarily supply us with personal information, for
   example when you register for a class, then we will use this
   information to assist us in the organization and conduct of our
   training sessions. We may also use this information to contact you
   about related training opportunities and other Section 508 activities.
