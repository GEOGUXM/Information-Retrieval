                           AHRQ Privacy Policy Notice
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thank you for visiting the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
   (AHRQ) Web site and for reviewing our Privacy Policy.

   This Web site is maintained as a public service to provide information
   on healthcare research and quality from our Agency, a component of the
   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

   We collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web
   site unless you choose to provide that information to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Information Automatically Collected and Stored

   When you browse through any Web site, read pages, or download
   information, certain information about your visit can be collected. We
   automatically collect and temporarily store the following information
   about your visit, but this information does not identify you
   personally:
     * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
       aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or
       stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
       domain).
     * The type of browser and operating system you use to access our
       site.
     * The date and time of your visit.
     * The pages you visited.
     * The address of the Web site you came from, if you were referred
       from another site.

   We use this information for statistics on the traffic to our site, to
   find out about general user interest in various areas of our site, and
   to help us make our site more useful to visitors.

   We track the keywords that are entered into our search engine and the
   browse terms used to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not
   monitor which terms a particular user enters.

   No additional information is collected about your visit, and we do not
   record information about individual behavior or use of the site.

  Personally Provided Information

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our Web site.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself
   through an E-mail message, form, survey, etc., we use that information
   only to respond to your message or to fulfill the stated purpose of the
   communication. The information provided is handled on a confidential
   basis within the Agency.

   However, E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
   message is sensitive, you may prefer to send it by postal mail instead.

   All communications to the Web site mailbox and customer feedback form
   are archived on a monthly basis, and destroyed on an annual basis.

  Disclosure

   AHRQ does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal
   information about our visitors, unless required by law enforcement or
   statute.

  Intrusion Detection

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may
   be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the
   National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

  Systems of Records

   Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed
   according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and regulations
   and guidance from the National Archives and Records Administration, and
   in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act. If information that
   you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will
   be a Privacy Act Notice provided.

  Links to Other Sites

   Our Web site has links to other Federal agencies. We also have selected
   links to other Web resources. The privacy policy described here does
   not necessarily apply to those other sites. Once you link to another
   site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that site.

   Current as of December 1999
