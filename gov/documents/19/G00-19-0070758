Soil Data


   Soil data for the Lake Tahoe area are now available online! The footer
   image. Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) soil maps are
   available from the footer image. SSURGO database.

   The following info files regarding soil data are from the NRCS website
   ( footer image. http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov):

   Soil data are in UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection. Raw (original) data are
   in the following projections: data east of 120 degrees longitude are in
   UTM zone 11 and data west of 120 degrees longitude are in UTM zone 10.
   It is not possible to combine different projections in Geographic
   Information System (GIS), therefore, all data have been reprojected
   into one standard projection, UTM NAD27 zone 10 projection, for the
   Lake Tahoe Basin.

   The following soil data have been mosaicked together from the18
   7.5-minute quadrangles that cover the Lake Tahoe Basin. The mosaicked
   files are more convenient for looking at areas throughout the basin or
   areas on the edge of two quadrangles.

    The following SSURGO data are stored in three different file formats,
                     each contain the same information:

     soils_sdts.zip
     (SDTS format, 2 MB compressed)

     soils_e00.zip
     (ARC/INFO export format, 3 MB compressed)

     soils_shp.zip
     (Shapefile format, 4 MB compressed)

     Metadata

     Also important to the digital soil survey is a set of tables. These
       tables are included in the ARC/INFO file but are also available
    seperately in the soil feature tables (a comma delimited text file).

   The NRCS digital soil survey covers only the area within the Lake Tahoe
                  Basin as shown in the image on the left.
