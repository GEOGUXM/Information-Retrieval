     __________________________________________________________________

                         The PDL Web Client is here!

                              PDL Release 13.2

   The PDL Development Team is proud to announce the release of PDL
   Version 13.2 which implements PDL as a Web Client. This means it will
   no longer be necessary to download PDL software to your local machine.
   Instead, you will run the PDL application directly from this web site.

   Changes in the Web Client include:
     * Incorporates revisions to the Payload Data Sets Blank Book, SSP
       52000-PDS, Revision B, covered by DCN 01 and DCN 02.
     * A new Welcome Screen allows immediate selection of the Payload,
       Increment, and Flight.
     * The pull-down menus for Data Sets, Options, and Forms have been
       replaced by a PDL Navigation Tree similar to the one on the left of
       this page. The tree is a faster, more flexible way to navigate from
       a Data Set to an Option and to a data entry Form.
     * Colored icons on the PDL Navigation Tree show the control level of
       the data and whether data is Read-Only or can be updated by the
       current user. See the FAQ page for a preview of the icons.
     * The current Payload, Increment, and Flight appear on a new message
       bar across the bottom of the window. The Owner, Initial Date,
       Changed By, Last Changed Date, and Control Level will appear on a
       message bar at the top of each form.

                            To Web-Enable your PC

   In order to run the PDL Web Client on your PC, you will need to install
   the Oracle JInitiator on your computer. JInitiator requires a PC
   running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000, an 80486
   processor (at least 266 Mhz), and at least 64MB of RAM. Your browser
   should be either Internet Explorer 5 (strongly recommended) or Netscape
   4. Your PC will also need the Adobe Acrobat Reader for displaying
   reports and the Aladdin Stuff-It Expander for uncompressing drawings.
   You can download these plug-ins by clicking "Software" on the PDL menu
   on the left side of this screen and following the links for each
   plug-in.

                           To Web-Enable your Mac

   In order to run the PDL Web Client on your Macintosh, you will need to
   install the MAC OS Runtime for Java (MRJ) on your computer. MRJ
   requires a PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computer, Mac OS 8.x or later,
   and at least 64MB of RAM. Your browser should be Internet Explorer 5
   (Netscape is not supported by the MRJ plug-in). Your MAC will also need
   the Adobe Acrobat Reader for displaying reports and may need the newest
   version of the Aladdin Stuff-It Expander for uncompressing drawings.
   You can download the MRJ and the other plug-ins by clicking "Software"
   on the PDL menu on the left side of this screen and following the links
   for each plug-in.
