   Note: Adobe Acrobat is required to view all online publications. To
   download the latest version of Acrobat, please go to Adobe's web site.

   New or revised material is posted to this web page as they occur.  The
   “As Of” date indicates latest update. Shaded areas identify new or
   revised material since the last biannual (January or July) mail out
   (distributed copies).  This web version 0-2 cannot be requisitioned
   from NHQ CAP/MSAD (Mailroom).

   It is CAP's intention that all publications be written utilizing the
   concepts of gender neutrality.  Therefore, except as required due to
   gender differences (such as in descriptions of CAP uniforms), all
   references to one gender should be interpreted to apply equally to both
   genders.

   Below is a numerical index of regulations, manuals, pamphlets,
   booklets, visual aids, obsolete section, and other currently in effect
   at National Headquarters Civil Air Patrol.

   The electronic CAPF 8 (Requisition for Publications and Blank Forms) is
