   NED: National Elevation Dataset Shaded Relief Published on the
   Geography Network
   News and Announcements The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is a new
   raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey. NED is designed
   to provide National elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent
   datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections were made in
   the NED assembly process to minimize artifacts, perform edge matching,
   and fill sliver areas of missing data. NED has a resolution of one
   arc-second (approximately 30 meters) for the conterminous United
   States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and a resolution of two arc-seconds for
   Alaska. NED Shaded Relief is now available as a map service on the
   Geography Network. NED documentation is available at
   http://edcnts12.cr.usgs.gov/ned/default.htm.
