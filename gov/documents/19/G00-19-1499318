   [CTRlogo.gif] ABOUT THE PROGRAM

   Welcome to the Washington State Agency Commute Trip Reduction (CTR)
   Program.  The Legislature recognized the state's crucial leadership
   role in establishing and implementing an effective commute trip
   reduction program, and set the policy that mandates agencies to
   aggressively develop programs to reduce commute trips by state
   employees.  The Department of General Administration has the
   responsibility to oversee the State Agency CTR Program.  For more
   information please email to CTR Support.

   The Governor's Executive Order 01-03 directed the Interagency Task
   Force for Commute Trip Reduction to adopt guidelines for telework and
   flexible work hours.  The guidelines were adopted on September 27, 2001
   and affect all state agencies, boards, commissions and institutions of
   higher education whether or not they are affected by the Commute Trip
   Reduction Law, RCW 70.49.521-551.

   State agencies have until April 30, 2002 to submit adopted guidelines
   to the Department of General Administration (GA) and the Department of
   Personnel (DOP).
