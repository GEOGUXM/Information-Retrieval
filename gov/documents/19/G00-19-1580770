   Questions/Comments

   Auctions are primarily used to sell property in bulk quantities. The
   bidder must be present for the sale, as an auctioneer will orally
   solicit bids until the highest bid is received. The high bidder will be
   announced before moving on to the next item.

   The Invitation for Bid (IFB) may be viewed below by clicking on the
   Auction Sale Number. The IFB contains item descriptions, sale terms and
   conditions, and item inspection times and location.

   Scheduled Sales: NO AUCTIONS SCHEDULED AT THIS TIME.



   NOTE:   SHUTTLE LAUNCH DATES MAY AFFECT INSPECTION AND SALE DATES. FOR
