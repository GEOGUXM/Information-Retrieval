   By Foot:
          The National Courts Building is located on Madison Place between
          Pennsylvania Avenue and H Street, Northwest, on the east side of
          Lafayette Square (the President's Park), across from the White
          House, in downtown Washington, D.C. The Treasury Department, the
          Department of Veterans Affairs, and St. John's Church and Parish
          House are nearby. The Dolley Madison House, the former Cosmos
          Club, and the Tayloe House, famous landmarks fronting on the
          square adjacent to the National Courts Building, are actually
          part of the courthouse complex.

   By Subway:
          Take Metro's Blue or Orange Line to the McPherson Square
          Station. Exit following signs toward the White House. At street
          level take Vermont Avenue (bear left at the top of the
          escalator) in the direction of H Street. Crossing H Street,
          Vermont Avenue becomes Madison Place. The National Courts
          Building's main entrance is midblock on the east side of the
          street.

   By Taxi:
          Madison Place is closed to vehicular traffic. State your
          destination as "H and Vermont" or "H and Madison Place". An
          entryway to the courtyard of the National Courts Building is
          located on the south side of H Street, adjacent to the Dolley
          Madison House, 1520 H Street, NW., and it provides access to the
          main entrance to the courthouse.

   By Car:
          From the North. I-95 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway
          connect with I-495/95 (Capital Beltway). Follow
          Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which becomes New York Avenue,
          into the downtown area. MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) to 16th Street
          also provides a direct connection to the downtown area.
          From the South. I-95 connects directly with I-395 (Shirley
          Highway) for easy access to the 14th Street corridor downtown.
          From the West. I-270 connects directly with I-495 and in
          conjunction with MD 355 (Wisconsin Avenue) or the George
          Washington Parkway provides access to the downtown area. I-66
          also provides a direct connection to the downtown area, but it
          is HOV-2 (carpools and buses only) during rush hours.
          From the East. Direct access to the downtown area is provided by
          US 50 and New York Avenue.
          Automobile access to the courthouse is limited to H Street,
          which is one-way, eastbound.

   Parking:
          The National Courts Building does not have public parking. Some
          meter parking is available on H, I (Eye), 14th and 15th Streets,
          and New York Avenue. Public garages or parking lots are located
          at: 1420 and 1425 New York Avenue; 1401 New York Avenue (enter
          on H Street near 14th Street); and 815 14th Street.

   Accessibility to the disabled:
          A flight of steps leads to the courtyard level and main entrance
          of the courthouse. However, the courtyard entryway on H Street
          providing alternative access to the main entrance is at sidewalk
          level without barriers. The Clerk's Office, Library, and one of
          the courtrooms are also barrier-free.

   Deliveries:
          Couriers must use the main entrance for delivery of briefs and
          other papers and follow instructions from the court security
          officers. Delivery of bulky items may be made at the loading
          dock if arrange-ments have been made beforehand.

   Security:
          The United States Marshals Service provides security for the
          National Courts Building. Armed court security officers guard
          all entrances. Visitors must pass through metal detectors, and
          packages are x-rayed. Visitors also must sign in and out, and
          wear badges authorizing access to the floors to be visited.
