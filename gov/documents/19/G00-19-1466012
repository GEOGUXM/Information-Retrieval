   All programs developed at the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center are
   publicly available.
   All we ask is that you answer a few simple questions about yourself so
   that we know who is making use of these files. This will then allow us
   to inform you of new, improved versions of the software packages.

   DAFOSYM - Dairy Forage System Model software
   for Windows. Version 1.2
   The Dairy Forage System Model, DAFOSYM, is a simulation model of the
   dairy forage system created by Engineers and Scientists of the U.S.
   Dairy Forage Research Center and other cooperating institutions. This
   model simulates the production, harvest and feeding of crops, the
   production and handling of manure, and the costs and returns of user
   described, representative dairy farms. A farm is simulated over many
   years of weather for a selected location. The model is most useful for
   evaluating and comparing the long term performance and costs of
   alternative technologies and management strategies for the dairy farm.
   Although the model was primarily created and used as a research tool,
   we feel it can provide an effective teaching tool for illustrating the
   effects and interactions that occur when changes are made to the dairy
   farm.

   NMR Database of Lignin and Cell Wall Model Compounds
   for Macintosh and Windows. Verson 2001_04
   This NMR database has been designed to aid plant cell wall chemists in
   general and lignin chemists in particular. By compiling data from a
   series of model compounds run under strict acquisition conditions in
   three solvents, we hope to provide a compilation useful for cell wall
   NMR research. Additionally, the database (Hypercard version only)
   contains a selection (to be expanded) of literature data.

   The Dataase can now be accessed and navigated directly from your Web
   Browser.

   NMR Web Database
   Alternatively, various forms of the NMR database can be downloaded
   directly from the database page at
   http://www.dfrc.ars.usda.gov/nmrDatabase.html
     * Please note: The database works best with Internet Explorer.
       Netscape encounters problems formatting the information correctly.
       Sorry!!
