                    Introduction to the Branch Activities

   The Atmospheric Experiment Branch in the Laboratory for Atmospheres at
   NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is a research group that conducts
   experiment based research on the atmospheres of Earth and other planets
   and planetary satellites in our solar system, and on small solar system
   bodies such as comets. Experiments are performed using atmospheric
   entry probes and from orbiting satellites. Instruments are developed to
   measure atmospheric properties, such as chemical composition, pressure,
   and temperature. Branch members participate in all phases of these
   investigations, from instrument definition and development to data
   analysis, distribution, archiving, and interpretation of data received
   from the spacecraft experiments. The instruments produced are designed,
   fabricated, assembled, and tested in the Branch. Collaborations with
   many institutions, including universities and private industry, provide
   significant contributions to the development of experiments and to the
   analysis and interpretation of data received from flight missions.

   This site provides an overview of the experiments the Branch has
   contributed to various space flight missions, as well as some of the
   results obtained with these experiments. Atmospheric Experiment Branch
   instruments have been a part of the Pioneer Venus, Galileo, Cassini,
   and Planet-B missions. Related web resources, information regarding
   Branch contacts, and a site subject index are also provided.
