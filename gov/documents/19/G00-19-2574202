   The American Flag

   To the Citizens of Maricopa County:
   [HelenPurcell.jpg] We, as a nation, experienced a very devastating and
   inhuman assault on September 11, 2001; an assault that will remain in
   the minds and hearts of Americans long after the terrorists are tried
   and sentenced for their crime. That an individual or group of
   individuals could think their terrorism, on our soil, could intimidate
   Americans shows they are not the visionaries they thought could impact
   the world, let alone us Yanks. Our history, through the years, has
   proven that we are a solid and steadfast nation, a nation that will
   always rebound in the face of an adversity.
   Our patriotism has resurged and come to the forefront and I want to
   share with you the finest patriotic symbol we have - "Old Glory." Our
   American Flag has flown majestically from our rooftops and citadels, in
   our places of worship and learning, and on the battlefields and graves
   of our heroes - we wave it with pride and dignity. Please read through
   The American Flag - it can only strengthen and deepen our American
   spirit.
   Helen Purcell
