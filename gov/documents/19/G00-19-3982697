   The ATLAS experiment is being constructed by 1700 collaborators in 150
   institutes around the world. It will study proton-proton interactions
   at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Laboratory for
   Particle Physics CERN . The detector is due to begin operation in the
   year 2006. The primary purpose of the detector will be studies of the
   origin of mass at the electroweak scale, therefore the detector has
   been designed for sensitivity to the largest possible Higgs mass range.
   The detector will also be used for studies of top quark decays and
   supersymmetry searches. See the ATLAS Movie
