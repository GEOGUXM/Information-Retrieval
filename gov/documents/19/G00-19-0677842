   2002 Schedule for Introduction to Section 106 Review Course

   The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is offering 10 sessions
   of Introduction to Section 106 Review in nine locations in 2002. This
   up-to-date two-day introductory course helps participants understand
   how Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act protects
   historic properties. The Council co-sponsors the course with the
   University of Nevada-Reno, as part of the University's award-winning
   program of continuing education short courses in Heritage Resources
   Management.

   Open enrollment sessions are being held from February through August in
   Austin, TX; Denver, CO; Raleigh, NC; Portland, OR; Louisville, KY;
   Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO; Sacramento, CA; and Washington, DC.

   Courses offer step-by-step explanation of Section 106 review under
   recently revised regulations

   Because Section 106 requires special review of Federal and federally
   assisted activities that could affect historic properties, the Advisory
   Council on Historic Preservation has designed this course to help
   participants understand and anticipate historic preservation
   responsibilities under the Council's regulations at 36 CFR Part 800,
   which went into effect January 11, 2001. Introduction to Section 106
   Review teaches the basic steps of the Section 106 review process and
   how Section 106 review is implemented.

   Course objectives

   Upon completion of this course, participants will understand:
     * The roles and responsibilities of the participants in Section 106
       review
     * The steps that make up the review process
     * How to identify and evaluate historic resources
     * How to assess and resolve adverse effects of a Federal undertaking
       on historic resources

   Target audience

   Participants in the Council's introductory courses represent many
   branches of Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, as well as
   the private sector, since Section 106 review applies to so many types
   of projects and programs. These include construction of buildings,
   roads, and structures; grants for housing and urban revitalization;
   land and property management; and activities involving Federal
   licenses, permits, loans, and loan guarantees. The target audience
   includes:
     * Federal, State, local, and tribal officials who encounter
       preservation-related law in their jobs, including:
          + Coordinators of construction projects or land-use programs
          + Government architects, archeologists, building and land
            managers, and community planners
          + Federal, State, local, and tribal historic preservation staff
          + Administrators of Federal or federally delegated grant, loan,
            or permit programs;
     * Project sponsors receiving Federal grants;
     * Employees of private firms and organizations whose activities may
       be reviewed under Section 106 because of a Federal permit, license,
       loan, or other assistance;
     * Members of community groups concerned with historic preservation;
       and
     * Historic preservation contractors and others whose work in
       architecture, engineering, archeology, history, anthropology, or
       environmental issues brings them into contact with Federal
       preservation law.
