   March 5, 1999 Stone outlines Lab's `most exciting year' By MARK WHALEN
   "It's been a great year at the Laboratory," JPL Director Dr. Edward
   Stone said in the annual State of the Laboratory talk on March 2. "I've
   been working at JPL since 1972 and I can't remember a time that is more
   exciting than now. What we have now is a continuum of wonderful
   activities that are going on, and our job is to find a way to manage it
   all." While the current era of planetary exploration challenges JPL as
   never before, Stone noted that current and near-future missions will
   continue to prove exciting and ultimately rewarding. Stone praised
   employees' current achieve- ments in developing an unprecedented number
   of missions so quickly, all requiring hard work and rapid turnaround.
   Even with the anticipated delay of the launch of QuikScat to mid-May,
   JPL has a record six launches in just over six months. The Lab has
   successfully developed six very different missions, and four are

   Topography Mission (SRTM), who will fly the JPL-managed radar imaging
   antenna this September to generate the most detailed, three-
   dimensional maps of Earth's sur- face ever obtained, visited JPL last
   month for simulation training. SRTM, scheduled for launch on Sept. 16,
   will yield a wealth of high-resolution topographic data of Earth's
   varied landscape, from its highest volcanic peaks to the deepest
   canyons carved millions of years ago. The radar data, which can see
   through clouds, thick vegetation and ground cover such as sand, will
