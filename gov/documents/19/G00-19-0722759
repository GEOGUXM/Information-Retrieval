   If you wish to start a civil action in federal court, but do not have
   an attorney to represent you, you may bring your case on your own. This
   is called "proceeding pro se" which means that you are representing
   yourself in the Court, and you are called a "pro se litigant."

   A civil case, which is the only type of case you can start in federal
   court, is different from a criminal cases, which can only be started by
   government officials. In a civil case, you do not have a constitutional
   right to appointed counsel. Therefore, if you start a civil case pro
   se, you should be prepared to pursue it to completion on your own
   because the Court appoints counsel only under certain circumstances
   that may not be met by your case.

   The Court can provide you with certain types of assistance to make it a
   little easier to bring your case pro se in federal court. Read all of
   the following pages before you start your case, so that you understand
   the help the Court can provide and so that you become familiar with the
   forms the Court can make available to you and the Rules you must follow
   in the Court.
