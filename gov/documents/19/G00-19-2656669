In mid December we held an audit within OSS. THis is the
document that was used for the audit and outlines the current
state of OSS security requirements as of Dec 14, 2000.

Below I will describe my evaluation checklist and expectations. We will
surely be talking about other concerns you have and difficulties
uncovered, so please feel free to point out your concerns either
beforehand or during the walkthrough. You should be familiar with the
current version of the FNAL Policy on Computing and be sure to point
out sections that you don't understand, cannot comply, or are
concerned about. We need to be in compliance or request an
exemption/interpretation.

I've divided the list into two sections, Requirements and Best Practices,
for items that are current required policy and practices we've discussed
but not yet made policy or described. My expectation is that you will all
get 100% on the Requirements and somewhat less on the Best Practices. You
can expect to explain exceptions from the Requirements to your supervisor
and to have a dialog on intents/instructions/clarification of Best
Practices. Extra Credit is just that.

I plan on publishing the results of the walkthrough to the department
and summarizing the results to Division management and Computer
Security Team for planning purposes.

Requirements:

        All persons with priveleged access (root/Admin or equiv) on 3 or
                more machines will have registered as sysadmins.
                (FNAL Computing Policy) http://miscomp.fnal.gov/sysadmindb
        No restricted central services will be running on unregistered
                machines. (FNAL Computing Policy) Expect remotely
                accessible IMAP/POP to join this list soon.
        All systems will have a backup plan published to the users.
                (FNAL Computing Policy) This includes a list of coverage,
                frequency, restoration procedure, and policies (retention,
                etc.)
        Banners will be installed on all machines for login access.
                (FNAL Computing Policy)
        SSH shall be running on all Unix machines and used for all root
                priveleged password exchanges. (OSS policy)
        Domain Administrator logins shall not be used to read email or
                run a web browser. (OSS policy)
        TCPwrappers will be installed and operable on all Unix systems.
                (OSS policy)
        No NULL password logins (passwordless) will exist on the
                machines. (FNAL Computing Policy)

Best Practices:

        (This group will join the requirements section after this
         audit.)

        All web pages directly accessible (1 hop) from the main CD page
                will have the required "Legal Notices" at the foot of the
                page (recent Division instruction).
        All OSS Department desktop machines will have a kerberos client
                installed and membership in the FNAL Strong Authentication
                Realm. (OSS policy)

        (This group needs training/discussion/clarification before
         becoming requirement.)

        All Windows file/application servers will be at the current patch
                release. (OSS policy)
        All remote access to Windows machines as Domain Administrator will
                use strong encryption methods for password exchange.
        All Unix machines will have their list of offered services
                reviewed and unnecessary services removed.
        All 24x7 Unix machines will have tripwire installed and checkpoint
                files run within the past month. A sampling covering at
                least 3 months will be maintained.
        All electronic storage of passwords will be encrypted and access
                restricted to the appropriate priveleged persons.
        All 24x7 systems will have multiple (>=2) system disks with
                recent fallback version of the OS readily available.
        All 24x7 systems will have an online disk storage as sysadmin
                reserve >= the largest partition on the machine.
        The list of systems to which the person has priveleged access
                should be current (within 1 month). (FNAL Computing
                Policy)
        Core FUE will be installed on all OSS supported Unix systems.


Extra Credit:

        (This group we've not discussed at all generally, but I'd
         like to have.)

        All OSS supported Unix systems will be timesynced to the FNAL
                standard clock, broadcast by the routers, via xntp or
                AFS (OSS policy) (Can we do this on Window too ?)
        All Very High Availability Services will have a service level
                plan in place describing minimum service level, planned
                fault condition responses, security plans, and change
                control mechanisms.
        All 24x7 systems will have a functioning monitoring system for
                critical services that includes an alarm mechanism that
                can result in a page afterhours.
        All 24x7 systems will have a usage summary history showing a
                summary of usage of critical resources over the past
                day, week, month and year.
        All Windows machines will run a virus scanner regularly and have
                regular updates of filters.
