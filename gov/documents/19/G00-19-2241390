   About Us

   The Information Applications Group develops web enabled database
   applications for the lab community.

   Our goal is to provide our customers with innovative database web
   applications using a strong standard software tool suite that
   simplifies and automates the design, development, and administration of
   all our web applications.

   We develop in a variety of databases but our database of choice is
   Oracle because it provides our clients with a powerful, robust, and
   professionally maintained product. The group anticipates that a web
   database application design built using Oracle will have the same
   comparable cost as using other web page-creating techniques such as
   FileMaker Pro.
