   The National Institutes of Health is dedicated to helping its employees
    balance the demands of work and life. In addition to participating in
      the wide array of Federal family-friendly policies, NIH has many
   service offices that are dedicated to improving the overall quality of
                 work and quality of life of NIH employees.

   The links below provide information about the broad range of work/life
    assistance available at NIH. If you would like assistance in figuring
    out how these apply to you - and which policies and organizations can
   best serve you - you can meet one-on-one with a work/life specialist to
    discuss your options. Work/life consultations are free of charge and
   confidential, and can be arranged by calling the WFLC at 301-435-1619.
