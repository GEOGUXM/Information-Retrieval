  NOVEL Planning Team

    Charge

   The charge to the Planning Team was to: develop a plan that outlines
   the NOVEL components and how they will be implemented; establish a
   working timeline for implementation; and host a statewide forum on
   NOVEL to discuss and obtain reaction to a draft version of the
   implementation plan, including timeline, before issuing it in final
   form.

    Process

   The State Library contracted with Lou Wetherbee, a technical
   consultant/facilitator based in Dallas, Texas, to work with the
   Planning Team. Ms. Wetherbee worked with the team in developing the
   evolving NOVEL plan and time line; she played a lead role at the
   statewide forum in discussing and obtaining reaction to the plan and
   timeline in draft form; and she assisted and guided the team in
   incorporating input from the forum into the final implementation
   plan/timeline.

    Timetable

   The Planning Team met four times and hosted the statewide forum. The
   first meeting took place January 17-18, 2001; the second meeting was
   held on March 14-15; the statewide forum was held May 17; the third
   meeting took place May 18; and the final meeting was on June 12. The
   final plan and timeline, including input from the forum, was issued
   August 15, 2001.

  NOVEL Background Information

    Origins

   The Board of Regents, at their July 13, 2000, meeting, adopted the
   final report of the Regents Commission on Library Services, Meeting the
   Needs of all New Yorkers: Library Service in the New Century, as
   Regents policy. Recommendation 1 in this report is to: "Create NOVEL,
   the New York Online Virtual Electronic Library, to deliver
   high-quality, reliable digital information to all New Yorkers."

    Component Parts

   As stated in Meeting the Needs of all New Yorkers, NOVEL consists of
   four components: (1) Electronic resources purchased on a statewide
   basis to provide significant economies of scale; (2) Shared electronic
   catalogs of the holdings of all types of libraries, including the
   high-quality, specialized resources held by New York's academic and
   special libraries; (3) Opportunities for libraries to digitize their
   unique collections; (4) Enhanced opportunities for high-speed network
   access that will enable libraries to deliver all the benefits and
   features of NOVEL.

    Comprehensiveness

   NOVEL is intended to encompass all types of libraries: public, school,
   academic, and special libraries. NOVEL will enable all of New York's
   libraries to make digital information from their collections available
   to users in their homes or offices.
