   TITLE OF ITEM:      Newly Identified Schools Under Registration Review

   DATE OF SUBMISSION: January 7, 2002
   PROPOSED HANDLING:  Discussion
   RATIONALE FOR ITEM: Monitoring of Regents Policy
   STRATEGIC GOAL:     Goals 1 and 2
   AUTHORIZATION(S):


                       Richard P. Mills

   SUMMARY:

   On Tuesday, January 8, I will announce the placement of 20 schools
   under registration review (SURR) as well as the removal of 20 schools
   from registration review. I will also announce that the Department has
   reached an agreement with the New York City Board of Education to close
   two schools that are now under registration review.

   The actions I am taking are based on the performance of schools on the
   Grades 4 and 8 English language arts and mathematics assessments, the
   percent of the 1997 high school cohort meeting graduation assessment
   requirements in English language arts and mathematics, and the annual
   dropout rate. As part of our strategy to raise the floor for acceptable
   performance, the standards applied this year for consideration as a
   school under registration review were more rigorous than those from
   last year.

   Twelve of the schools being added to the SURR list are in New York
   City, compared to 18 New York City schools named last year. Eight
   upstate schools were identified for registration review this year, the
   same number as last year. Four of the 12 New York City schools
   identified are former SURR schools that had been removed from
   registration review. In three out of the four cases, these schools had
   been removed from SURR at least five years ago, when the standards for
   removal were lower. Consistent with the overall results from the State
   assessments, 14 of the 20 schools I identified this year are designated
   based on poor results on the Grade 8 assessments. Four of the schools
   identified are in Buffalo, which will make a total of 10 SURR schools
   in that district. I have directed staff from the Office of Elementary,
   Middle, Secondary and Continuing Education and the District
   Superintendent of Erie I BOCES to work with that district to develop a
   comprehensive strategy for supporting these schools, similar to the one
   that has been put in place in New York City.

   In addition to the actions I have taken, staff continue to review the
   performance of two high schools in Rochester that have been the subject
   of an audit of that districts annual dropout data. I will make a
   determination about the status of these schools once the audit results
   become final.

   The number of New York City schools removed from registration review
   this year, 19, is two more than the number removed last year. Pleasant
   Valley Elementary School in Schenectady was the only upstate school
   this year that met the criteria for removal from registration review.

   The New York City Board of Education and SED staff have agreed that MS
   52 and MS 120 in Community School District 8 are performing at a level
   that is not acceptable. As a result, these schools will be closed. The
   Board of Education will provide me with a plan for phasing out these
   schools. These schools will join the five New York City SURR schools
   that began the year operating under approved closure plans.

   Attached is the press release that will be made available on January 8
   as well as a list of the 100 current SURR schools, 77 of which are in
   New York City and 23 in the rest of the State; a list of the newly
   identified SURR schools; and a list of the schools that are being
   removed from the SURR list.

   Now the hard work of reform begins. District Superintendents are
   preparing registration review teams that will begin to visit these
   schools later this month. SED staff members have been assigned to work
   with these schools to develop improvement plans and to access funding
   and professional development opportunities. Senior Department managers
   will be working to support the gap closing efforts under way in these
   districts.

   The 20 schools that I removed from registration review bring to 143 the
   number of SURR schools that have been removed from review because of
   academic improvement or have been closed. For the first time since the
   process began in 1989, there are more former SURR schools in operation
   in our State than there are schools under registration review.
   Thousands of students are benefiting from the improvements that have
   occurred in the educational program at these schools. This represents a
   significant accomplishment and a reason for us to stay the course in
   insisting that low-performing schools can and must improve.

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, JANUARY 8, 2002

             COMMISSIONER MILLS PLACES 20 SCHOOLS ON SURR LIST,

                              REMOVES 20 OTHERS

   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills today placed 20 schools on
   the States registration review list. He also removed 20 schools from
   registration review and announced that two more schools will be closed
   by the New York City Board of Education.

   These actions bring the total number of Schools Under Registration
   Review (SURR Schools) to 100 statewide, 77 of them in New York City, 10
   in Buffalo, 3 in Rochester, 3 in Syracuse, 3 in Yonkers, 2 in
   Wyandanch, 1 in Newburgh and 1 in Roosevelt.

   Fourteen of the schools are being placed on the SURR list because of
   performance on the middle school State tests in English or math,
   indicating the need for improvement in middle school instruction.

   Of the schools placed under registration review so far this school
   year, 12 are in New York City and 8 are upstate. Nineteen of the
   schools removed are in New York City and one is in Schenectady.

   The two New York City schools that are being closed are IS 52 and IS
   120 in Community School District 8.

   "As with last year, most of the schools being placed on the SURR list
   are middle schools. This shows again that we have a tremendous amount
   of work to raise the achievement of children in the middle grades,"
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills said.

   "This marks the beginning of the improvement process for the new SURR
   schools," Commissioner Mills said. "Later this month, teams of experts
   will visit the schools identified today and provide recommendations for
   improvement. The State Education Department will work with staff from
   the local school districts to help these schools develop improvement
   plans, get additional resources, and create more opportunities for
   professional development. Ultimately, we will evaluate results and
   determine whether to remove these schools from review or seek their
   closure."

   Commissioner Mills noted that the registration review process has
   generally been successful in improving or, where necessary, closing and
   reorganizing schools. A total of 116 schools have been removed from the
   SURR list because of improvement, and 27 SURR schools have been closed.
   "I believe that, as in the past, the vast majority of these newly
   identified schools will improve student achievement so they too can be
   removed from the SURR list," Commissioner Mills said.

   Schools are placed on the SURR list if they are furthest from State
   standards in English or math or have a high dropout rate. The School
   Accountability Performance Index is used to assess performance of
   elementary and middle schools. It evaluates a school both in terms of
   students demonstrating some of the learning standards (Level 2) and
   students demonstrating all of the learning standards (Levels 3 and 4)
   in English and math.

   The Performance Index is calculated by adding the percentage of
   students at Level 2 and above and the percentage at Level 3 and above
   on English and math. A school in which all students perform at or above
   Level 3 will have a Performance Index of 200.

   The level of achievement that schools are required to demonstrate to
   avoid possible consideration for registration review was more rigorous
   than last year. In grade 4 and 8 English and grade 4 math, the
   Commissioner raised the cutpoint from a score of 75 on the School
   Accountability Index to a score of 78. He also raised the cutpoint from
   40 to 45 on grade 8 math.

   At the high school level, schools are evaluated by using the percentage
   of a cohort of students meeting State testing requirements in English
   and math. The cutpoint was raised from 50 percent of the 1996 cohort
   meeting the graduation assessment requirements in English and math to
   55 percent of the 1997 cohort meeting these standards.

   See attached for lists of schools.
