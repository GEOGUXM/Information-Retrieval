  Rear Seat Passengers at Higher Brain Injury Risk

   Reuters
   Monday, January 28, 2002

   By Jacqueline Stenson

   SAN DIEGO, Jan 28 (Reuters Health) - While people riding in the back
   seat of a car without a seat belt are less likely to sustain
   life-threatening injuries during a crash than unrestrained drivers and
   front-seat passengers, they are at greater risk for brain damage, a new
   study finds.

   The results challenge the common belief that rear seat belts aren't
   important, said study author Dr. Lewis Kaplan of the MCP/Hahnemann
   University Hospital in Philadelphia.

   "When people put people in the back seat of their cars, they have to be
   just as vigilant about belting them in as they are for front-seat
   passengers and children," Kaplan told Reuters Health.

   But that is often not the case, despite the awareness brought to the
   issue when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
   She was in the back seat and was not wearing a seat belt; neither was
   the driver or her companion, Dodi Fayed, also in the back. Only her
   bodyguard, who was buckled up in the front passenger seat and had an
   air bag, survived.

   Kaplan said that after Diana's death, he looked through the medical
   literature to see if there were studies on the risks to rear
   passengers, and found very little information. So he and his colleagues
   began collecting data on people treated for crash injuries at his
   hospital between November 1998 and November 2000.

   Of 152 cases involving both front and rear riders, 79% of rear-seat
   passengers and 63% of front-seat drivers or passengers were not wearing
   seat belts at the time of the crash, Kaplan reported here Sunday at a
   meeting of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

   When the researchers looked at injury patterns, they found--as
   expected--that unrestrained front riders were most likely to require
   lengthy stays in the intensive care unit: an average of 104 days,
   compared with a dozen or fewer for the other study groups.

   That's because the crash impact is usually much greater in the front of
   the vehicle, and drivers and front-seat passengers often sustain
   multiple severe injuries, including internal organ and spinal cord
   damage, the researchers explained.

   But, surprisingly, the study found that unrestrained rear passengers
   were the most likely to sustain brain injuries--65% did, compared with
   61% of unrestrained front-seat riders, 43% of rear restrained riders
   and 43% of front restrained riders.

   Despite the often-greater impact in the front, air bags can help
   protect against brain injury, Kaplan explained. In addition, the
   steering column frequently keeps drivers from hitting their heads on
   the windshield. But rear passengers, who are typically in tighter
   spaces, often hit their heads on the seat in front of them, the side
   post or the side window, he said.

   Another unexpected finding was that rear passengers wearing seat belts
   were most likely to sustain orthopedic injuries, such as fractures of
   the arms, ribs and collarbone. In the study, 43% of rear restrained
   passengers had orthopedic injuries--more than twice as many as the
   other groups studied. A big factor is that many cars don't come with
   shoulder restraints in addition to lap belts in the back, Kaplan said,
   particularly for the middle passenger position. As a result, the upper
   body can be propelled forward or sideways during an accident.

   Still, the risk of fracture is no reason to forgo a seat belt, Kaplan
   stressed. "You recover from orthopedic injuries pretty readily but
   brain injuries can cause lasting impairment," he said.
