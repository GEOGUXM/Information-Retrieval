   NRC's Electronic Information Exchange (EIE) allows NRC to exchange
   material related to official agency business with its customers and
   other Federal agencies across the Internet. The EIE system uses a
   public key infrastructure and digital signaturing technology to
   authenticate documents and validate the person submitting the
   information. That is, the system ensures that the exchanged material is
   secure and that the person submitting the material is, in fact, who is
   indicated.

   The NRC welcomes the EIE user community. See the following pages for
   more information about the system and how to use it. If after reviewing
   these pages you need more information, see Contact Us About EIE.
