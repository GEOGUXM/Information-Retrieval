   Drought Reconstructions
     __________________________________________________________________

   Oklahoma, 1998, Courtesy of Wind Erosion Unit, USDA/Kansas State
   University This page contains links to reconstructions of
   drought-related variables such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index,
   precipitation, streamflow, and lake levels for high-resolution records
   at scales of centuries to millennia. Many of the raw proxy data held at
   the WDC for Paleoclimatology can also be interpreted in terms of
   precipitation and drought.
   Links to Drought Related Projects at the WDC for Paleoclimatology:
   The Paleo Perspective on North American Drought examines the history
   and implications of drought in North America.

   The NOAA/NESDIS North American Drought Variability project uses
   instrumental and tree ring data to present both historical and
   reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) as maps and gridded
   time series.

   A comprehensive review of the paleoclimatic literature pertaining to
   drought.

   Paleoclimatology:
   The links for centuries-scale records are listed first, by proxy and by
   variable, and are organized by geographic area, large to small, with
   U.S. and North American records followed by those for other parts of
   the world. The millennial-length and longer records follow and are
   organized in the same way.
