   This group generates accurate position and velocity histories
   (ephemerides) for the bodies of the solar system including the planets,
   natural satellites, comets and asteroids. It also performs scientific
   research and provides science support and leaders to mission studies
   involving celestial mechanics, relativity, and other areas of dynamical
   science. Specific responsibilities of the group are to:
     * Continually update and improve the accuracy of the ephemerides
       using new data and new data types.
     * Export ephemerides to flight projects of all space faring nations
       and to an international community of scientists.
     * Maintain up-to-date orbit and physical data files for planets,
       satellites and thousands of comets and asteroids for mission design
       work.
     * Maintain data files of astrometric data for solar system bodies.
     * Assume lead role in defining fundamental coordinate systems and
       physical constants for solar system bodies.
     * Coordinate ground-based observing programs for solar system bodies
       that may become future mission targets.
     * Help plan future missions to
         1. study the comets and asteroids of the solar system and
         2. investigate fundamental gravitational theory.
     * Conduct research and plan missions to test certain areas of
       fundamental physics including the equivalence principle and
       gravitational waves.
