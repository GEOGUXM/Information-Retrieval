   Associate Research Physicist (PostDoc) for MRX - Currently Interviewing
   and Accepting Resumes

   The primary task is operation of the MRX device to carry out magnetic
   reconnection research utilizing the existing diagnostics. Another
   important task is development of the planar laser-induced fluorescence
   diagnostic for fluctuation imaging. The experimental setup has been
   constructed, the diagnostic started generating initial data. The goal
   of the experiment is to obtain images of ion density fluctuations in
   the MRX neutral sheet. A new direction for the PLIF diagnostic to
   extend it to Mhz repetition rates for turbulence visualization to be
   implemented. Also, responsibility in the MRX upgrade work, including
   the assembly of the larger capacitor bank and the design of the shaping
   coils.

   Associate Research Physicist (PostDoc) for DIII-D (San Diego, CA) -
   Currently Interviewing and Accepting Resumes

   The successful candidate will work at the DIII-D National Fusion
   Facility in San Diego and at PPPL to increase understanding of plasma
   transport phenomena by a combination of experimental and theoretical
   work. The main research focus is to understand the physics of energy
   and angular momentum transport in toroidal fusion devices, aimed at
   improved extrapolation of the physics to the burning plasma regime. The
   successful candidate will play a key role in enhancing the diagnostic
   capability for measurements of ion temperature and rotational velocity
   in DIII-D. The individual will also make use of these and other
   measurements, as well as an array of modeling codes, to improve physics
   understanding of transport properties in tokamak plasmas.

   Associate Research Physicist (PostDoc) for NSTX - Currently
   Interviewing and Accepting Resumes

   Princeton University's Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) is inviting
   applications for a research position in experimental plasma science for
   the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) located at PPPL. The
   successful candidate will work as part of a multi-institutional team of
   experimentalists and theorists both nationally and internationally,
   addressing fundamental issues of spherical torus research.

   Candidates should have a strong background in experimental plasma
   physics, modeling and analysis of data and an ability to work as part
   of team of leading researchers pursuing state of the art science using
   leading tools and facilities.
