   Providing Global Satellite Data to Earth Scientists and the Public  [
   GHRC Home ]

   The research conducted by the GHCC scientists is dependent upon the
   availability of satellite data. Routine earth satellite observations
   provide scientists with a platform that enables us to remotely view and
   sense the earth from space. Satellites continually record data about
   the earths surface and atmosphere, and send large of data volumes
   (gigabytes per day) back to data processing and archiving centers. The
   GHCCs data processing and archive center is the Global Hydrology
   Resource Center. The GHRC collects data from many different satellites,
   surface ground validation stations, as well as high altitude aircraft
   outfitted with science instruments. The GHRC serves as the operational
   data processing and archive center for two satellite-based lightning
   instruments, the Lightning Imaging Sensor and the Optical Transient
   Detector. Both the Lightning Imaging Sensor and the Optical Transient
   Detector detect lightning in day and night conditions. Using the
   lightning detection software developed by GHCC scientists, the GHRC
   produces global daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual summaries of
   lightning strikes, providing the first truly global distribution maps
   of lightning.

   In order to verify the validity of these satellite based lightning
   observations, the GHRC receives data from the National Weather Surface
   radar network and the surface lightning detection networks. These
   surface data sets are processed every fifteen minutes and provide
   scientists with both snapshot and time lapse views of storm systems
   over the continental United States.

   In early 1998, the GHRC was named a NASA Earth Science Information
   Partner (ESIP) for our innovative work in combining earth science
   research with information science technology. This ESIP status enables
   us to create new earth science data products and make them available to
   research scientists and the public through innovative information
   science techniques (e.g., advanced web applications and map projection
   transformations). The earth science focus of our ESIP is the
   development and production of a variety of atmospheric and oceanic data
   sets derived from microwave radiation naturally emitted from the
   Earths surface and atmosphere. Certain microwave frequencies are used
   to detect the presence of water vapor, clouds, relative humidity (see
   figure below - notice the dry regions in the Northern Hemispheric
   tropics during the winter), sea ice, sea surface temperature, wind
   speed, precipitation and atmospheric temperature. We are utilizing
   instrument data from multiple satellites to map the distribution and
   trends of many of these earth science parameters.
