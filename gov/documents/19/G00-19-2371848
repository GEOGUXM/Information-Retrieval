                           flood potential outlook
     Notice: The NWRFC Significant Flood Outlook graphic is intended to
     provide a general outlook for significant river flooding. It is not
   intended to depict small-scale events such as localized flooding and/or
   flash flooding, nor will it depict coastal and/or tidal flooding. This
      graphic will not depict minor river flooding as this implies only
   minimal or no property damage with possibly some public inconvenience.
      Please refer to products issued by local NWS offices for specific
                                  details.
