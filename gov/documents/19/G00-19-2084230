   Mr. Chairman, Congressman Spratt, and Members of the Committee, I am
   pleased to be here today to discuss the current outlook for the budget
   and the economy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will release its
   report on that topic, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years
   2003-2012, on January 31. My testimony today will summarize that
   report.

   The economic recession and recent laws have combined to sharply reduce
   the budget surpluses projected a year ago. In January 2001, CBO
   projected that under the laws and policies then in force, the federal
   government would run surpluses in fiscal years 2002 through 2011
   totaling $5.6 trillion.^(1) In CBO's new projections, that cumulative
   surplus has fallen to $1.6 trillion--a drop of $4 trillion (see Table
   1).

   NOTE: For purposes of comparison, this table shows projections for 2002
   through 2011 because that was the period covered by CBO's January 2001
   baseline. The current projection period extends from 2003 through 2012.
   a. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which
   was estimated at the time of enactment to reduce revenues by $1,186
   billion and increase outlays by $88 billion between 2002 and 2011.
   b. Reflects only the change in debt-service costs that results from
   legislative actions. Other effects on debt-service costs are included
   under economic and technical changes.
   c. Technical changes are revisions that are not attributable to new
   legislation or to changes in the components of CBO's economic forecast.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   About 60 percent of that decline results from legislation--the tax cuts
   enacted in June and additional discretionary spending--and from its
   effect on the cost of paying interest on the federal debt. Changes in
   the economic outlook and various technical revisions since last January
   account for the other 40 percent of that decline.

   For both 2002 and 2003, CBO now projects that, instead of surpluses,
   the total budget will show small deficits, if current policies remain
   the same and the economy follows the path that CBO is forecasting. In
   2001, by contrast, the federal government recorded a surplus of $127
   billion (see Table 2).

   _______________________________________________________________________

   The deficit projected for this year--$21 billion--represents a change
   of more than $300 billion from last January's projection. Over 70
   percent of that reduction results from the weak economy and related
   technical factors, which have considerably lowered the revenues
   expected for this year and next.

   For the current 10-year projection period, 2003 through 2012, CBO
   estimates a total surplus of nearly $2.3 trillion. However, almost half
   of that total comes from the surpluses projected for 2011 and 2012--the
   last two years of the projection period and thus the most uncertain.
   The surpluses for those years also reflect the scheduled expiration in
   December 2010 of the tax cuts enacted last June.

   In CBO's new baseline, the off-budget accounts (which reflect the
   spending and revenues of Social Security and the Postal Service) run
   surpluses throughout the projection period. In the on-budget accounts,
   by contrast, surpluses do not reemerge until 2010.

   CBO's baseline projections are intended to serve as a neutral benchmark
   against which to measure the effects of possible changes in tax and
   spending policies. They are constructed according to rules set forth in
   law and long-standing practices and are designed to project federal
   revenues and spending under the assumption that current laws and
   policies remain unchanged. Thus, these projections will almost
   certainly differ from actual budget totals: the economy may not follow
   the path that CBO projects, and lawmakers are likely to alter the
   nation's tax and spending policies. Therefore, CBO's baseline should be
   viewed not as a forecast or prediction of future budgetary outcomes but
   simply as the agency's best judgment of how the economy and other
   factors will affect federal revenues and spending under current law.

   THE BUDGET OUTLOOK

   If current policies remain in place, CBO projects, the budget will be
   in deficit for the next two years. Those deficits are expected to be
   quite small, amounting to only 0.2 percent of the nation's gross
   domestic product (GDP) in 2002 and 0.1 percent of GDP in 2003. After
   that, surpluses are projected to reemerge and gradually increase.

   For the five years from 2003 through 2007, CBO projects a cumulative
   surplus of $437 billion. That figure represents off-budget surpluses
   totaling more than $1 trillion offset by on-budget deficits that add up
   to $617 billion. For the 10-year period through 2012, the total budget
   surplus under current policies is projected to approach $2.3 trillion.
   Again, that amount is made up of surpluses in Social Security ($2.5
   trillion) offset by a cumulative on-budget deficit ($242 billion).
   Without the scheduled expiration of tax-cut provisions in 2010, the
   total 10-year budget surplus would fall to $1.6 trillion.

   The total surplus is projected to equal 1 percent of GDP by 2006 and
   grow to 3.7 percent of GDP by 2012. Estimates of large surpluses should
   be viewed cautiously, however, because future economic developments and
   estimating inaccuracies could change the outlook substantially. In
   addition, future legislative actions are almost certain to alter the
   budgetary picture.

   Changes in the Past Year

   As an illustration of how quickly the budget outlook can change, CBO's
   projection of the cumulative surplus for 2002 through 2011 has plunged
   by $4 trillion in just one year (see Table 1).^(2) Some $2.4 trillion
   of that drop can be attributed to legislative actions. The legislation
   with the largest effect was the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
   Reconciliation Act of 2001, enacted in June. That law is estimated to
   reduce surpluses by nearly $1.3 trillion over 10 years (not including
   associated debt-service costs).

   Additional discretionary spending since last January accounts for
   another $550 billion reduction in the projected surplus for the
   2002-2011 period. That amount stems from both regular and supplemental
   appropriations. CBO's January 2001 baseline assumed that discretionary
   budget authority for 2002 would total $665 billion.^(3) The actual
   amount appropriated for 2002 in the 13 regular appropriation acts
   totaled $691 billion. In addition, the Congress and the President
   enacted $20 billion in supplemental budget authority in December as
   part of their response to the terrorist attacks of September
   11--thereby generating a total of $711 billion in budget authority for
   2002, $45 billion more than CBO assumed last January.

   Under the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit
   Control Act of 1985, CBO's baseline assumes that annual appropriations
   for discretionary programs continue at their current level, increasing
   only by the rates of inflation projected for each year. As a result of
   the appropriations enacted for 2002, projections of discretionary
   spending in the current baseline begin at a level that is $45 billion
   higher than a year ago.

   Furthermore, two supplemental appropriation laws enacted in fiscal year
   2001--one for defense personnel and readiness programs and another in
   immediate response to the attacks of September 11--will generate
   outlays totaling around $25 billion in 2002 and beyond. However, budget
   authority from actions in 2001 is not carried forward into the baseline
   projections for future years because those appropriations occurred
   before the current year.

   Overall, legislated reductions in revenues, additional discretionary
   spending, and other laws with smaller budgetary effects have reduced
   projected surpluses--and thereby increased the government's borrowing
   needs--by $1,858 billion for 2002 through 2011. That increased
   borrowing is projected to result in an extra $562 billion in net
   interest costs over the 10-year period.

   Changes in the economic outlook since January 2001 account for another
   $929 billion decline in the 10-year surplus. About three-quarters of
   that total reflects lower revenue projections, mostly resulting from
   the substantially weaker economic growth expected in the near term and
   the slightly lower average growth rates projected for the following
   several years. Much of the rest of the decline attributable to the
   economic outlook represents additional debt-service costs resulting
   from the reduction in anticipated revenues.

   Technical changes--those not driven by new legislation or by changes in
   CBO's economic forecast--have reduced the projected 10-year surplus by
   a total of $660 billion since last January. As with the economic
   changes, revenues account for over 75 percent of the technical changes,
   and debt service accounts for much of the rest. The technical changes
   to revenues stem primarily from revised projections of capital gains
   realizations and adjustments for lower-than-expected tax collections in
   recent months.

   Homeland Security

   Since the attacks of September 11, federal agencies, state and local
   governments, and the private sector have perceived a heightened threat
   to the United States and a need to commit more resources to homeland
   security. On the federal level, legislation following the attacks
   increased the budget authority provided for such security from $17
   billion in 2001 to $22 billion for 2002. What level of resources to
   commit to homeland security will undoubtedly be a key issue as the
   Congress and the President make decisions about spending and other
   policies this year.

   The Outlook for Federal Debt

   In the January 2001 Budget and Economic Outlook, CBO estimated that
   federal debt held by the public would reach a level in 2006 that would
   allow the Treasury to retire all of the debt available for redemption.
   At that time, CBO also projected that the statutory ceiling on all
   federal debt (which includes debt held by government accounts) would
   not be reached until 2009. Now, CBO estimates that debt held by the
   public will not be fully redeemed within the 10-year projection period
   and that the current debt ceiling will be reached in the next few
   months. Nevertheless, if the surpluses projected in the current
   baseline materialize, debt held by the public will fall to about 15
   percent of GDP in 2010--its lowest level since 1917.

   THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

   In CBO's opinion, the most likely path for the economy is a mild
   recession that may already have reached its nadir. CBO expects the
   annual growth rate of real (inflation-adjusted) GDP to accelerate from
   -0.2 percent in 2001 (measured from the fourth quarter of calendar year
   2000 to the fourth quarter of 2001) to 2.5 percent in 2002 and to
   accelerate further to 4.3 percent in 2003.

   Some unusual features of the current recession will cause it to be
   mild, CBO believes. Chief among those features are the rapidity of
   policymakers' responses, the moderating behavior of prices, and an
   early reduction in businesses' inventories. In less than one year, the
   Federal Reserve has cut the federal funds rate 11 times--from 6.5
   percent to 1.75 percent. Also, the tax cuts enacted in June prevented
   consumption from slowing more than it might have otherwise, and
   additional federal spending in response to the terrorist attacks will
   boost GDP in 2002. Lower prices for oil and natural gas and mild price
   increases for other items are supporting consumption by boosting real
   disposable income. Furthermore, businesses began to reduce inventories
   earlier in this recession than they did in past downturns, which may
   mean that fewer cuts in inventories remain than at this stage of the
   typical recession.

   CBO projects that weak demand in the short run will translate into weak
   employment, pushing the unemployment rate higher for the next several
   quarters while restraining inflation. With growth of real GDP near zero
   early this year, the unemployment rate is expected to increase to 6.1
   percent in calendar year 2002 from 4.8 percent last year (see Table 3).
   The rate of inflation faced by consumers is forecast to fall from 2.9
   percent last year to 1.8 percent in 2002. Lower oil prices account for
   most of the projected decline in inflation, although the recession also
   plays a role. As oil prices stabilize in CBO's forecast, inflation
   bounces back to 2.5 percent in 2003.

   Looking out through 2012, CBO expects the growth of real GDP to average
   3.1 percent during the 2002-2012 period--roughly the same as it
   projected last January for the 2002-2011 period. Nonetheless, the level
   of real GDP is lower each year than in last January's projections,
   primarily because actual GDP ended up much lower in 2001 than CBO had
   expected a year ago.

   UNCERTAINTY OF THE PROJECTIONS

   CBO's baseline projections represent the midrange of possible outcomes
   based on past and current trends and the assumption that current
   policies do not change. But considerable uncertainty surrounds those
   projections for two reasons. First, future legislation is likely to
   alter the paths of federal spending and revenues. CBO does not predict
   legislation--indeed, any attempt to incorporate future legislative
   changes would undermine the usefulness of the baseline as a benchmark
   against which to measure the effects of such changes. Second, the U.S.
   economy and the federal budget are highly complex and are affected by
   many economic and technical factors that are difficult to predict. As a
   result, actual budgetary outcomes will almost certainly differ from
   CBO's baseline projections.

   In view of such uncertainty, the outlook for the budget can best be
   described as a fan of probabilities around the point estimates
   presented as CBO's baseline (see Figure 1). Not surprisingly, those
   probabilities widen as the projection period extends. As the fan chart
   makes clear, projections that are quite different from the baseline
   have a significant probability of coming to pass.

   NOTES: This figure shows the estimated likelihood of alternative
   projections of the surplus under current policies. The calculations are
   based on CBO's past track record. CBO's baseline projections fall in
   the middle of the darkest area. Under the assumption that policies do
   not change, the probability is 10 percent that actual surpluses will
   fall in the darkest area and 90 percent that they will fall within the
   whole shaded area.
   Actual surpluses will of course be affected by legislation enacted
   during the next 10 years, including decisions about discretionary
   spending. The effects of future legislation are not included in this
   figure.
   An explanation of how this probability distribution was calculated will
   appear shortly on CBO's Web site.
   _______________________________________________________________________



   THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

   Despite the sizable surpluses projected for the later years of CBO's
   10-year budget outlook, long-term pressures on spending loom just over
   the horizon. Those pressures result from the aging of the U.S.
   population (large numbers of baby boomers will start becoming eligible
   for Social Security retirement benefits in 2008 and for Medicare in
   2011), from increased life spans, and from rising costs for federal
   health care programs. According to midrange estimates, if current
   policies continue, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid
   combined will nearly double by 2030, to almost 15 percent of GDP.

   Taking action sooner rather than later to address long-term budgetary
   pressures can make a significant difference. In particular, policies
   that encourage economic growth--such as running budget surpluses to
   boost national saving and investment, enacting tax and regulatory
   policies that encourage work and saving, and focusing more government
   spending on investment rather than on current consumption--can help by
   increasing the total amount of resources available for all uses.

   and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011 (January 2001).

   2. About 45 percent of that reduction results from changes made since
   CBO issued its updated Budget and Economic Outlook in August. The drop
   since August totals $1.8 trillion and is attributed, in relatively
   equal measures, to legislative, economic, and technical changes.

   NOTES: CBO's baseline projections assume that discretionary spending
   grows at the rate of inflation after 2002, using the inflators
   specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of
   1985 (the gross domestic product deflator and the employment cost
   index).
   In CBO's projections, discretionary outlays always exceed budget
   authority because of spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the
   Airport and Airways Trust Fund, which is subject to obligation
   limitations in appropriation acts. The budget authority for such
   programs is provided in authorizing legislation and is not considered
   discretionary. Another reason outlays exceed budget authority is that
   outlays include spending from appropriations provided in previous
   years.
