                      E-mail Book Instructions/Information

   This is a prototype for Statewide Directory Services. We will implement
   a full version in the near future. At that time, we will have the
   procedure in place to include all e-mail addresses and systems that we
   are aware of and have permission to include.

   Please type first and/or last name or e-mail address. You will receive
   the list of matches for that individual along with the group name and
   e-mail address. For multiple queries, separate each name with a comma.
   A maximum of 20 entries will be displayed for any search.

   State agency e-mail administrators that would like to update their
   e-mail addresses to the directory, please send an e-mail containing
   your name, contact information and an attached text file containing
   your agency's e-mail information to Directory@teale.ca.gov.

   File format should be comma delimited and one record per line:
   LastName,FirstName,Agency,E-mail,
