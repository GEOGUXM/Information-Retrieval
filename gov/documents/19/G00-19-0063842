   The Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) is in the weather business,
   specifically dealing with the transfer of technology from the research
   community to operational field sites. The Modernization Division (MD)
   has guided the development of much of the software now in use at over
   100 National Weather Service (NWS) field sites across the country, and
   works with the NWS on a continuing basis to channel new technology into
   operational systems. For a look at what we've been up to lately, take a
   look at our piece of FSL in Review 1999.

   MD works jointly with the System Development Division (SDD) to help the
   NWS support and enhance the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing
   System (AWIPS). AWIPS is the primary computing system in modernized
   weather offices. It distributes data to and among NWS forecasting
   offices via satellite and terrestrial communications networks. It
   maintains local data repositories, provides data retrieval and display
   services, and supports both warning and forecast generation.
   Forecasters use this systen to rapidly respond to weather events, using
   integrated data display to quickly analyze weather patterns and
   forecasting tools to disseminate relevant information to the public.

  Division Highlights

     * AWIPS
       Find out about the system that supports modernized weather office
       operations for the NWS: deployed capabilities, new enhancements,
       and the current development status of new software for AWIPS.
     * Rapid Prototyping Project (RPP)
       Get the latest information on the rapid prototyping of enhanced
       forecasting tools.

  Modernization Division Branches

     * Risk Reduction
       This branch is responsible for risk reduction activities, which
       usually involve the testing and evaluation of prototype software
       and other technology upgrades prior to submission to the NWS. Of
       late, these responsibilities have also included the support and
       enhancement of the AWIPS system software, much of which was
       developed jointly by this group and groups within SDD.
       FSL is colocated with the Denver forecasting office, and has a
       special relationship with the site. New technology is often
       demonstrated there prior to general deployment. Evaluation is an
       integral part of risk reduction, providing the feedback necessary
       to keep technology directed towards the most operationally
       effective solutions. The Evaluation Team is involved in nearly all
       MD projects.
     * Advanced Development
       A technology transfer organization needs an advance scout. That's
       what this branch does. It scouts out any new technology that looks
       promising with regard to enhancement of hydrometeorological
       systems, and runs it through trials, benchmarks, or small-scale
       prototypes to see if it will work. This focus of this group is
       wide-ranging, addressing everything from network capacity to
       software engineering issues as necessary.
     * Enhanced Forecasting Tools
       Forecasters are eager to develop new and more efficient ways of
       generating forecasts, given the wealth of data available from
       AWIPS. This branch is in the thick of this exciting area of
       development, working with a number of rapid-prototype field sites
       to develop a new generation of graphical forecasting tools and
       advanced forecast products. This group is working with the
       Techniques Development Laboratory of the NWS to integrate an
       Interactive Forecast Preparation (IFP) system into AWIPS.

  Special Projects

     * Regional Radar Volume
       The Regional Radar Volume (RRV) Project is developing an initial
       Cartesian radar volume product comprised of data from three WSR-88D
       radars that scan over a small regional domain. This is an initial
       step towards a CONUS B National Radar Volume spanning all NEXRAD
       radars across the continental United States.
     * localdev
       FSL uses a flexible, production-oriented development environment
       that was developed by the Advanced Development group. It is
       implemented as a set of generic Perl scripts usable within a
       multiple-platform UNIX environment (or anywhere that Perl, GNU
       utilities, and symbolic links are supported).
