      Flags

   Due to the substantial increase in requests for the purchase of
   American flags, the supply to Capitol Hill has been exhausted. Flags
   will not be available for the remainder of the year and possibly not
   available until mid-year of 2002. If you would like to request a flag,
   flown or not flown over the Capitol, please contact my Washington
   office (202) 225-2671 for an update. I apologize for any inconvenience
   this may cause.

   Constituents residing in the 3rd Congressional District of Missouri may
   request to have a United States flag flown over the Capitol.

   Flags may be flown for a particular person, event, or organization and
   may be flown on a specific date. A certificate of recognition is
   included with each flag. There is no limit on the number of flags you
   may order.

   To obtain a flag through my office, please include the following in
   your request:

   Size and type of flag
   The name of the person, event, or organization to which you would like
   to dedicate the flag
   The date on which you would like the flag flown
   If you would like the flag flown in honor of someone or on a specific
   date, please specify that in your request.

   Here's an example of what a certificate accompanying the flag might
   say:
   "This flag is being flown for Colonel John Smith in recognition of his
   retirement from the U.S. Army on July 6, 2001."

   Below is a list of flag prices and sizes:


   Flag Type     Flown over Capitol Not Flown over Capitol
