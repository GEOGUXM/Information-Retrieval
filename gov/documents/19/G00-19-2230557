                   PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT/FURTHER INFORMATION

   The Trustees hold quarterly public briefings on the damage assessment
   and restoration planning process. Periodic public meetings and
   workshops on restoration activities are held in the evenings to permit
   public participation and input. Contact the Trustee's CB restoration
   manager if you have questions or would like to be put on a mailing list
   to receive notices of opportunities to participate.

                             SUMMARY/BACKGROUND

   The Commencement Bay Natural Resource Trustees have developed a
   Bay-wide restoration plan and are designing and building a series of
   habitat restoration projects utilizing funds, property and in-kind
   services obtained as a result of settlements of natural resource damage
   claims. The Trustees' restoration planning for Commencement Bay began
   with and built upon the Commencement Bay Cumulative Impact Study
   (May/June 1993), developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA,
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA. That study analyzed the
   impact to aquatic resources of the Bay resulting mainly from dredge and
   fill activities, and identified restoration and mitigation options.
   Contact the RCM (see above) to obtain a copy of the two-volume study
   report.

   During Phase 1 of the natural resource damage assessment process, the
   Trustees, potentially responsible parties and local environmental
   organizations who comprised the Commencement Bay NRDA Restoration Panel
   developed restoration goals and project evaluation criteria and
   identified and evaluated a series of potential restoration sites.
   Building on the work of the Restoration Panel, the Trustees prepared
   the Bay-wide Restoration Plan and Environmental Impact Statement to
   guide restoration project selection, design and development. The
   Restoration Plan was formally adopted by the Trustees on October 3,
   1997.

                        TRUSTEES' RESTORATION VISION

   Early in the restoration planning process Trustees recognized the need
   to develop a bay-wide restoration vision. The vision pulls together and
   integrates the restoration goals and concepts developed to date. The
   vision places emphasis on baywide restoration through an ecosystem or
   landscape approach rather than creating isolated fragments of habitats.

               RESTORATION PLAN/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT

   Under the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process, the Trustees
   needed to determine the best approach to restoring, replacing,
   rehabilitating, and/or acquiring the equivalent natural resources
   and/or services injured as a result of the release of hazardous
   substances or a discharge of oil to the Commencement Bay environment.
   In order to guide the restoration planning process, the Trustees
   prepared a Restoration Plan and programmatic Environmental Impact
   Statement (RP/EIS). After evaluation of the alternatives, the Trustees
   concluded that the preferred alternative was the Integrated Approach.
   This alternative best met the needs of the Trustees' restoration goals
   and principles by maximizing ecological benefits for a wide range of
   natural resources and their associated services. This approach was
   adopted by the federal agencies' Record of Decision.

                            RESTORATION PROJECTS

   As the damage assessment has progressed, the Trustees have entered into
   partial or full settlements of claims with several parties. These
   settlements have involved the creation of habitat restoration projects
   and/or the providing of funds, property or services for projects to be
   planned and built in the future. The Trustees have completed
   development of five restoration projects, are overseeing development of
   a series of five other projects, and have begun planning additional
   projects. A Monitoring Program has been established by the Trustees for
   these projects (downloadable below and at the Projects page). A map and
   project details are posted at the Commencement Bay NRDA Restoration
   Projects page.

   Sediment Cleanup Goals for Active NRDA Restoration Projects. In
   developing restoration projects for natural resources injured by
   releases of hazardous substances, the Trustees are pursuing strategies
   that include restoration and enhancement of habitats degraded by human
   activities as well as preservation of existing habitat values and
   functions. The Trustees frequently are faced with determining whether
   and to what extent existing contamination must be remediated to ensure
   an acceptable likelihood of success by the proposed restoration
   project. Toward this end, the Trustees have adopted sediment cleanup
   goals (768 KB) for active natural resource restoration projects in
   Commencement Bay. These goals are based upon the best currently
   available information on contaminant effects and may change as further
   information is developed. While the application of these goals will to
   some extent depend upon site conditions, it is the Trustees' intent
   that they will serve as the default goals for sediments at all active
   NRDA restoration projects.
