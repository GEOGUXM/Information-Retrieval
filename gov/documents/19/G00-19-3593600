                         Geographic Information Systems

   Geographic information systems (GIS) technology can be used for
   scientific investigations, resource management, and development
   planning. For example, a GIS might allow emergency planners to easily
   calculate emergency response times in the event of a natural disaster,
   or a GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection from
   pollution.

What is a GIS?

   In the strictest sense, a GIS is a computer system capable of
   assembling, storing, manipulating, and displaying geographically
   referenced information, i.e. data identified according to their
   locations. Practitioners also regard the total GIS as including
   operating personnel and the data that go into the system.

How does a GIS work?

     * Relating information from different sources
     * Data capture
     * Data integration
     * Projection and registration
     * Data structures
     * Data modeling

What's special about a GIS?

   The way maps and other data have been stored or filed as layers of
   information in a GIS makes it possible to perform complex analyses.
     * Information retrieval
     * Topological modeling
     * Networks
     * Overlay
     * Data output
