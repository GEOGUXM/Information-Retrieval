                                   Voyager

   Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were twin spacecraft launched by NASA during
   the summer of 1977 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Barring any serious
   spacecraft subsystem failures, the Voyagers may survive and relay data
   from the outer planets until the early twenty-first century.
