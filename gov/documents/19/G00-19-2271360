     Mayor John F. Street     The Accessibility Compliance Office (ACO)
   was established by the City of Philadelphia to ensure the City's
   compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing
   Act and other laws governing the City's relationship with people with
   disabilities. The ACO is responsible for coordinating barrier removal
   efforts, establishing policies on accessibility issues and responding
   to reasonable accommodation requests.
       The ACO works closely with the Mayor's Commission on People with
   Disabilities which was established to provide a forum for the
   disability community to express interest and opinions on City programs
   and services, and to provide the Mayor with a method to ascertain the
   needs and views of the disability community. The Commission is made up
   of volunteers representing individuals with disabilities who are
   appointed by the Mayor.
       Together the Accessibility Compliance Office and the Mayor's
   Commission on People with Disabilities strive to ensure that
   Philadelphia's citizens with disabilities are afforded the same rights
   as all citizens. In accordance with Title II of the Americans with
   Disabilities Act, the City does not discriminate against qualified
   individuals with disabilities in any of its programs, services or
   activities.
