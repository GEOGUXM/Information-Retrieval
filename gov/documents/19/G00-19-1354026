   Our goal is to provide a focused, coordinated and multidisciplinary a
   pproach to better understand the potential health risks of human
   exposures to ch emicals and radiation. In this regard, we have focused
   our research on exposure mechanisms and on processes of DNA repair,
   mutagenesis and carcinogenesis as wel l as reproductive and
   developmental toxicity. Much of our work encompasses the d evelopment
   and validation of biomarkers in animal models that are indicative of
   the damage caused to somatic and germinal tissues. A significant
   emphasis is als o placed on understanding the mechanisms of these
   processes so that the implicat ions derived from animal models can be
   better related to human health. Finally, we are developing new ways to
   study these processes (repair, adducts and mutatio ns) directly in
   humans so that dose-response models can be developed incorporati ng the
   genetic variability of the human population into risk characterization.

   We have put a considerable effort into understanding the mechanisms and
   varia bility of the repair of DNA damage. The genes and proteins
   responsible for singl e base excision of the damage, larger base
   excisions (nucleotide base excision r epair), and recombinational
   repair have been studied extensively. Human polymorp hisms have been
   identified (thanks to the Genome Project) in most of the pathway s and
   genes involved in this process and the role of these genetic variations
   on the enzymatic activity and ultimately the susceptibility to cancer
   and disease are being evaluated.

   Specifically, we aim to:
     * identify genes that control individual susceptibility with an
       initial focus on genes which are involved in the repair of DNA
       damage;
     * unravel mechanisms of disease processes, i.e. understand how
       proteins function/malfunction in causing disease;
     * evaluate genetic individuality in disease susceptibility by
       measuring variat ion in susceptibility genes and relating the
       variation to disease;
     * assess risk of ill-health from adverse exposure to radiation and
       chemicals d irectly through human studies or based on cellular and
       animal data;
     * use new and existing Livermore methods to assess adverse exposure,
       from ultr a-sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry to an
       integrated set of human biomarke rs;
     * exploit the high-speed computing capabilities at Livermore to solve
       importan t problems in the biosciences;
     * maintain a protein structure prediction center for the scientific
       community;
     * maintain a state-of-the-art crystallography and NMR facility for
       our own res earch and for external collaborations; and
     * develop new molecular, instrumentation, and computational methods
       that will allow the genome of any organism to be scanned and
       analyzed quickly for gene con tent and function.

   For much of this work we use state-of-the-art, structural biology
   methods suc h as NMR and x-ray crystallography, accelerator mass
   spectrometry, high speed co mputing for computational chemistry
   solutions and protein structure predictions, single molecule
   fluorescence and manipulation, RNA and protein arrays for messe nger
   profiling and proteomics.
