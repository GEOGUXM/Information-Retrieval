  Electric Field Change Meter'What is EDOT?'

       We use EDOT as shorthand for electric field change, the principle
   physical measurement we make in our ground-based lightning studies.
   The name 'EDOT' can actually be a little misleading, since it is 'fast
   E' that we measure (differential electric field on a millisecond time
   scale), rather than dE/dt as suggested by the EDOT moniker.  We measure
   E using an instrument called an electric field change meter, which
   consists of a flat plate antenna backed by a charge amplifier and line
   driver.   Our field change meters are sensitive to a bandwidth that
   extends from approximately 300 Hz to 300 kHz, just below the commercial
   AM radio band.  We digitize meter output with 12 bits at a sample rate
   of 1 Msample/sec.  This high data rate precludes our recording of all
   data for all time, so we run our digitizers in a snapshot mode,
   recording data only when the input waveform exceeds a predetermined
   bipolar trigger threshold.  When a meter triggers and records data, it
   also latches a UTC time stamp from a GPS clock, providing us with an
   absolute time tag for the recorded waveform.   By utilizing multiple
   EDOT stations configured in arrays, we can use absolute waveform time
   tags to locate lightning strokes.  We currently record both
   cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning strokes from 11 EDOT
   stations.  We operate five stations in a New Mexico/ West Texas array,
   five in a Florida array; and one in Nebraska.

  FORTE satellite'What is FORTE?'

       FORTE is a small satellite that was launched into low-Earth orbit
   on 29 August 1997 by a Pegasus booster.  FORTE, which stands for Fast
   On-orbit Recording of Transient Events, was designed to test
   technologies to remotely monitor compliance with arms control treaties.
   FORTE's instruments detect, record, and analyze transient radio
   frequency and optical signals that arise from near the Earth's surface.
   A joint project between the Department of Energy's Los Alamos and
   Sandia national laboratories, the satellite is also providing a wealth
   of data on the physics of lightning and the ionosphere.

  'Why do we need to supplement FORTE satellite data with data from the ground
  ?'

       An advantage of the FORTE satellite-based lightning recorder is
   that it provides us with a sampling of data from nearly the entire
   globe.  However, at 7 km/s, it moves along at a pretty good clip and
   can provide only 15 minutes of observation time over a single region on
   a single plass.  Also, unless FORTE records events with its optical
   imager, we do not know where recorded RF and optical photodiaode events
   originate.  Ground-based studies allow us to address these shortfalls
   to some extent, but don't provide a panacea either.  Our arrays
   (individually or used in conjunction with one another as a very large
   array) provide 24 hr/day coverage over a limited geographical region,
   in contrast to FORTE, which provides snapshot histories of regions all
   over the globe.  EDOT All From the ground we can track the development
   of a thunderstorm or thunderstorm system from its first sparks until it
   dies out (as long as this all occurs within our coverage area).  This
   ability gives us information about temporal storm development.  We are
   also able to geolocate lightning strokes within the storm (with
   accuracies as good as a few km that get worse as the storm moves
   further from the array), and can thus also monitor spatial storm
   development.  We fuse our spatiotemporal storm histories with data from
   other meteorological assests, such as weather radars, to learn more
   about thunderstorms and lightning.  Also, because we monitor low
   frequency [300 Hz to 300 kHz] electric field change from the ground (in
   contrast to FORTE, which records very high frequency [30 to 300 MHz]
   radiation), we sense different physical characteristics of lightning
   strokes and learn more about the physics of lightning.
