  § 8280. Creation

        8280. There is created in the State Government the California Law
   Revision Commission.

  § 8281. Membership

        8281. The commission consists of one Member of the Senate
   appointed by the Committee on Rules, one Member of the Assembly
   appointed by the Speaker, and seven additional members appointed by the
   Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Legislative
   Counsel shall be an ex officio member of the commission.
        The Members of the Legislature appointed to the commission shall
   serve at the pleasure of the appointing power and shall participate in
   the activities of the commission to the extent that the participation
   is not incompatible with their respective positions as Members of the
   Legislature. For the purposes of this article, those Members of the
   Legislature shall constitute a joint interim investigating committee on
   the subject of this article and as a joint interim investigating
   committee shall have the powers and duties imposed upon those
   committees by the Joint Rules of the Senate and Assembly.
        The members appointed by the Governor shall be appointed for a
   term of four years and shall hold office until the appointment and
   qualification of their successors. The terms of the members first
   appointed shall not commence earlier than October 1, 1953, and shall
   expire as follows: four on October 1, 1955, and three on October 1,
   1957. When a vacancy occurs in any office filled by appointment by the
   Governor, he or she shall appoint a person to the office, who shall
   hold office for the balance of the unexpired term of his or her
   predecessor.

     Note. The provision in the third paragraph to the effect that
     Commission members appointed by the Governor hold office until
     appointment and qualification of their successors is superseded by
     the rule in Government Code Section 1774 declaring a vacancy if
     there is no reappointment 60 days following expiration of the term
     of office. See also Gov't Code § 1774.7 (Section 1774 overrides
     contrary special rules unless specifically excepted).

  § 8282. Compensation and expenses

        8282. (a) The members of the commission shall serve without
   compensation, except that each member appointed by the Governor shall
   receive fifty dollars ($50) for each day's attendance at a meeting of
   the commission.
        (b) In addition, each member shall be allowed actual expenses
   incurred in the discharge of his or her duties, including travel
   expenses.

     Note. Government Code Section 11564.5 provides a per diem
     compensation of $100, notwithstanding any other provision of law.

  § 8283. Chairperson

        8283. The commission shall select one of its members chairperson.

        8288. No employee of the commission and no member appointed by the
