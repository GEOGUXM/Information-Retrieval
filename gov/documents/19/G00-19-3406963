   UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT Entered 8/15/00, 8:30 a.m. United States
   Bankruptcy Court NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI Northern District of
   Mississippi Joseph E. Wroten, Clerk by /signed/ P. Bachtell D.C.
   AMENDED STANDING ORDER REGARDING ATTORNEY FEES IN CHAPTER 13 CASES If
   there is no objection raised by a party in interest, in Chapter 13
   cases filed on or after September 1, 2000, the Court will generally
   approve a fee for the attorney for the debtor of up to $1,500.00. The
   fee approved by the Court is on the basis that the scope of
   representation by the attorney includes both pre-confirmation and
   post-confirmation representation of the debtor. Basically, once an
   attorney sets a fee and files a petition for the debtor, the Court
   expects the attorney to represent the debtor conscientiously until the
   debtor is granted a discharge or the case is dismissed. This fee shall
   include, but shall not be limited to, services related to motions to
   modify the Chapter 13 plan; motions to avoid liens; defending motions
   seeking relief from the automatic stay, and objections to confirmation;
   objections to claims; as well as, other routine contested proceedings.
   No additional fee is to be sought from the debtor or accepted by the
   attorney without prior Court approval. In large business cases or in
   cases involving an extraordinary amount of time, the Court will
   consider a request for a fee in excess of the aforesaid amount upon the
   filing of an appropriate itemized application. SO ORDERED this the 14th
   day of August, 2000. /signed/ DAVID W. HOUSTON, III UNITED STATES
