   Welcome to the U.S. Department of Education Information Collection
   System. Here, you will be able to access the information collection
   document sets of all OMB approved collection efforts, as well as those
   collections waiting for OMB approval (pending). The following is a list
   of information collection document sets (referred to as Collection
   Packages hereafter). The Collection Packages are grouped by whether or
   not they have been approved.

Browse Pending Collections

   Collection Packages awaiting approval by OMB may or may not have an OMB
   approval number. Assuming a Principal Office is designated a number
   1800, and the Collection Package is given a serial number of 00101. If
   the collection Package does not yet have an approval number, it will
   appear as (00101)1800-NEW. If it was assigned an OMB number but has not
   yet been approved, it will appear as (00101)1800-0100.

Browse Active Collections

   Approved Collection Packages are currently active. Assuming a Principal
   Office is designated a number 1800, the Collection Package was assigned
   a serial number of 00202, and OMB assigned a number of 0100 it would
   appear as (00202)1800-0100, exactly like an unapproved Collection
   Package that has been assigned an OMB number.
