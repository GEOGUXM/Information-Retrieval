   The Cancer Training Branch manages the institute's research training,
   career development and education programs for U.S. citizens, providing
   guidance to the extramural biomedical research community and
   administration of awards. This assures continued development of
   well-trained investigators in the basic, clinical, population and
   behavioral sciences, who are prepared to address problems in cancer
   biology, causation, prevention and control, detection and diagnosis,
   treatment and rehabilitation. Continued progress in cancer research
   depends on uninterrupted entry of new, well-trained, highly motivated
   scientists.
