   GSA's Seat Management Program provides Government organizations with a
   way to acquire managed life cycle support of their entire distributed
   computing environment (hardware, software and support services) from a
   single point of contact. The key ingredient of the GSA Seat Management
   Program is performance based service delivery at a fixed price.

   With GSA's Seat Management Program, a client agency determines the
   level of desktop computing service and support it requires, as well as
   the COTS software and hardware needed to support its mission. A GSA
   Seat Management contractor will manage and support the hardware,
   software, peripherals, networks, support services, maintenance, and
   education that the end-users need.

   This service is provided at a fixed price per month, per seat. All
   hardware and software brands are available under the Seat Management
   contracts. Technology refreshments are scheduled at the client agency's
   discretion.

   Performance based service delivery allows the contractor to utilize and
   leverage resources necessary to meet service level requirements,
   providing the Government with measurements and metrics that are more
   readily monitored and tracked than the typical labor hour support
   approach.

   Giving the contractor the flexibility to make hardware selections based
   on critical factors such as availability, manageability, and
   maintainability frees the Government from the burdensome tasks of
   technology integration, interoperability, and refreshment.
