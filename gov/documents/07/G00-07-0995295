   This Fermilab summer program focuses on giving opportunities in science
   and technology to the minorities that historically have been
   underrepresented in science in the United States of America. This
   program is for undergraduate college students currently enrolled in
   four-year colleges in the US.

   Internships are offered in physics, electrical engineering, computer
   programming and mechanical engineering. These internships offer a
   chance for approximately twenty college students to work with Fermilab
   scientists or engineers on a project within the context of laboratory
   research. We have been in operation since 1971, 2000 is our 29^th year!

   SIST is not right for you? See the Fermilab Internships Summary page,
   here.

   Society Committee on Minorities
