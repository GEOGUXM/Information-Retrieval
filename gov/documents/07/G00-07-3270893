Welcome to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Northern West Virginia.  Above is a
photograph of the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office located at 12th  Chapline
Streets in Wheeling, West Virginia. This structure was erected in 1906 and a
major addition was  completed in 1936. Set back from the street you  see an
addition to the building in matching granite which was completed in 1999.
Construction will soon begin on a  $36 million annex which will be connected
to the 1999 addition pictured above.

For you "Outsiders" we  say hello and welcome you and hope that you look
around our WEB Page. For you "Insiders" we hope that you will benefit from
the resources which have been included.
