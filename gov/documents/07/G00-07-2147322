     The NCI Human Specimen and Data Information System has been updated
         and expanded into a new database to help researchers locate
                           specimens for research.

       This database includes specimens available from the NCI Clinical
      Trials Cooperative Groups, but you must specify your requirements
     for tissue and associated data. Treatment data and either recurrence
      and/or follow-up data must be specified for the Cooperative Groups
                       to be identified in the search.

                Please vist the NCI Specimen Resource Locator
