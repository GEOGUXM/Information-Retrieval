         The U.S. Geological Survey, Cartography and Publishing Program (CAPP)
         recommends and coordinates publishing policy for water resource
         programs and provides cartographic support for reports of national
         scope. This program tests and applies emerging technologies in
         publishing and cartography. The CAPP also develops and maintains
         databases of information about USGS products and provides cartographic,
         publishing and geographic information systems project work for the USGS
         and other Federal agencies.
