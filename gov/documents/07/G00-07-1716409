   Integration Project Office

   Welcome to the IFMP Integration Project Office website. The Integration
   Project provides management and technical leadership for the
   integration of individual module projects into the overall IFM system.
   The Integration Project is responsible for defining, implementing, and
   maintaining the business, applications, and technical architectures
   that enable the accomplishment of the defined IFM business drivers.

   The Integration Project is viewed as an extension of the IFM Program
   Office at NASA Headquarters, and as such, will exist for the life of
   the Program and be responsible to:
     * Define and maintain the IFM business and applications architecture

     * Work with Agency Process Teams to define business processes and
       points of integration
     * Facilitate resolution of issues across business processes
     * Provide metadata repository for NASA processes
     * Describe the "as-is" and "go-to" applications that automate the
       business processes defined within the business architecture

     * Define and maintain the technical infrastructure on which the
       applications architecture executes

     * Work with each module project to define technical requirements
     * Acquire hardware and infrastructure software for each project
     * Deploy and operate system environments during testing and
       implementation
     * Work with Agency CIO to ensure the IFM technical architecture is
       compliant with Agency IT standards

     * Define and implement an integration backbone at all layers of the
       architecture
     * Develop and implement a long term, program wide information
       delivery architecture
     * Plan and implement transition of each module to operations
     * Position the Agency for future e-Business collaboration with
       business partners and suppliers
