      *The 2002 Summer Internship Program in Biomedical Research application
      is currently available until March 1, 2001.  If you have an interest in
      an internship in the neurosciences or brain and nervous system
      research, select THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND
      STROKE in item #9 on the on-line application.  The web address for the
      on-line application is:  www.training.nih.gov
       From the Director brain icon

      Picture of Dr. Penn It is my pleasure to welcome you to this web site
      on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke's Summer
      Program in the Neurological Sciences, a student research training
      program in brain and nervous system research. As one of  27 Institutes
      and Centers comprising the National Institutes of Health, NINDS has
      occupied a central position in the world of neuroscience for nearly 50
      years. Our mission is to perform neuroscience research in order to
      reduce the burden borne by every age group, by every segment of
      society, and by people all over the world. To this end, the Institute
      supports and conducts research on the healthy and diseased brain,
      spinal cord, muscle, and peripheral nerves.

      Hundreds of disorders afflict the nervous system. Common killers and
      disablers such as stroke, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease,
      multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, autism, and muscular dystrophy are well
      known. Other disorders we study may be known only to the patients and
      families affected, their doctors, and scientists who look to rare
      disorders for help in understanding the brain as well as treating more
      common diseases.

      This is a time of accelerating progress and increasing hope in the
      battle against brain disease. Advances in understanding the nervous
      system are beginning to pay off in the form of treatments for
      previously intractable problems including spinal cord injury, acute
      stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinsons disease. We are fortunate to
      have this first-rate research training program in the neurosciences
      which gives students the chance to learn and participate in hands-on
      clinical and basic neuroscience research with the hope that they will
      pursue careers in this burgeoning field.

      Todays students are tomorrows scientific investigators, conducting
      cutting-edge biomedical research that will lead to new ideas, theories,
      hypotheses, and treatments to help improve the health of the Nation.

      Please enjoy your visit to this web site and share the information with
      others.

   Audrey S. Penn, M.D.
   Acting Director, NINDS
   About the Program brain icon
   The Summer Program in the Neurological Sciences offers a unique
   opportunity for academically talented high-school, undergraduate,
   graduate, and medical students to receive first-rate training in
   neuroscience research. Students get hands-on experience working with
   leading scientists in the Institutes Division of Intramural Research,
   the "in-house" research component of the NINDS.
   The NINDSs purpose in awarding student internships is to provide
   students with a highly stimulating and rewarding summer research
   experience, with a view towards encouraging students to pursue advanced
   education and training in the biomedical sciences and future careers in
   scientific investigation, particularly basic and clinical research in
   the neurological sciences. Summer research training is designed to
   supplement and give practical meaning to students academic course work.
   At the same time, students will make a valuable contribution to the
   NINDSs research mission.
   At the end of the summer, students participate in the NIH Summer
   Research Program Poster Day. Poster Day gives students the opportunity
   to present their summer research before the NIH scientific community.
   Students also participate in meetings and seminars in their individual
   laboratories. In addition, students attend formal lectures and symposia
   dealing with the newest advances in health research.
