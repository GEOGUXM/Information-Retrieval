      The SAGE III mission provides accurate, long-term measurements of
      ozone, aerosols, water vapor and other key parameters of Earth's
      atmosphere. These observations are crucial for providing a better
       understanding of how natural processes and human activities may
                           influence our climate.

   7-January-2002 â€” An anomaly with the Meteor-3M spacecraft 1.7 GHz
   transmitter was reported on January 2nd and is under investigation by
   the Russian Space Agency. All checkout activities for the SAGE III
   instrument have been delayed until this issue is resolved. The SAGE III
   instrument remains in good health with power and thermal systems stable
   and within nominal limits.

   The Meteor-3M spacecraft carrying the SAGE III instrument was launched
   from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on December 10, 2001 at
   17:18:57 UTC on a Ukrainian built Zenit-2 Rocket.
