     Oklahoma Geological Survey 1908 LOGO A state agency for research and
   public service, Charles J. Mankin, Director

   The Oklahoma Geological Survey is a research and public-service agency
   located on the Norman campus of the University of Oklahoma. The OGS was
   written into the Constitution of Oklahoma in 1907, and is the only
   state geological survey to hold that distinction. The enabling
   legislation was signed into law on May 29, 1908. The Survey's mandate
   remains to study Oklahoma's geology, prepare and distribute reports,
   and promote wise use of the State's natural resources.

   The Oklahoma Geological Survey Observatory in rural Tulsa County, south
   of Leonard is a comprehensive
   geophysical observatory which records, identifies, and locates  over
   100  animated gif of the word EARTHQUAKE shaking then crumbling in
   Oklahoma each year, and also records about seven worldwide earthquakes
   per day.
