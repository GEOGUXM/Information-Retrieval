Research Highlights

   [Influenza.gif] The Influenza Sequence Database is a curated database
   of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. It is intended to provide the
   research community with easy sequence deposit and retrieval
   capabilities, together with tools tailored, in particular, to the
   analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences. [new.gif]

   [Gomodel.gif] Angel Garc√≠a, the new group leader of T-10, and
   colleagues have developed an off-lattice minimalist model to describe
   the effects of pressure on the folding kinetics of proteins (PNAS
   96:14848). The model captures the combined effects of the folding
   transition state and chain configurational diffusion on activation
   volume changes in pressure-induced protein folding and unfolding.



Notable News and Announcements

     * Four of the ten most cited LANL publications between 1995-1999,
       including the most cited article, were contributed by T-10.
     * [bell2.jpg] George Bell, former group leader of T-10 and director
       of T Division, died May 28, 2000. Bell, a Laboratory Senior Fellow,
       came to Los Alamos in 1951, joining T Division's effort to design
       and develop the world's first thermonuclear weapons. Bell later
       co-founded T-10 and was at the forefront of the human genome
       project. He is also remembered as a world-class mountaineer.
