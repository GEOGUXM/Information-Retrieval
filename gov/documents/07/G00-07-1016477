The web page for the HHS Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic
Disparities in Health is being revised. Look for a new web page in early
2002.

     In the meantime, please visit the Office of Minority Health web page
     at http://www.omhrc.gov for information from the U.S. Department of
     Health and Human Services on minority health and health disparities.
