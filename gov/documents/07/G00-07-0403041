Research Activities of MSG

   Marine Science Group carries out studies directly related to three DOE
   activities: the Ocean Margins Program (OMP); the Ocean Research Program
   (ORP); and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). The OMP
   contributes to DOE climate change research by quantifying the removal
   of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, burial and isolation in
   sediments, and export to the deep ocean. The secondary goals of the OMP
   are to quantify the mechanisms and processes by which carbon dioxide is
   assimilated, transported and transformed in the coastal ocean, in order
   to define ocean-margin sources and sinks in global biogeochemical
   cycles. Research within MSG focuses of the production, transformation,
   and transport of particulate organic carbon in the open water and
   sediments of the continental margins. These biological, chemical and
   physical investigations are required to determine the quantitative
   significance of continental shelves in sequestering atmospheric carbon
   dioxide. One objective of the ORP is to conduct a global survey of
   carbon dioxide in the ocean. MSG developed the instrumentation to make
   the measurements and also participates in survey expeditions. The ARM
   program is scheduled to establish five major sites at which to make
   measurements and to conduct experiments in order to improve the
   treatment of radiative transfer and cloud effects in climate models.
   Two of these sites are managed by MSG.
