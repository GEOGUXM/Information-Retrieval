                 Features of version 2.01 of SOLVE / RESOLVE

     * New: RESOLVE has automatic model-building!
     * New: You can give SOLVE and RESOLVE all your  MAD/SAD data and it
       will decide at what resolution the signal-to-noise is high enough
       to use for phasing.
     * SOLVE carries out all the steps of macromolecular structure
       determination from scaling data to calculation of an electron
       density map, automatically.
     * RESOLVE uses maximum-likelihood density modification to improve
       electron density maps
     *  Prime-and-switch phasing in RESOLVE removes model bias from
       model-phased maps. See some amazing prime-and-switch examples!
     *  RESOLVE automatically identifies NCS in heavy-atom sites and
       applies it for you.
     * Version 2.01 contains all of SOLVE version 1.19 and RESOLVE version
       1.05. Now you can download SOLVE and RESOLVE both at once.
       You need a new license for version 2 of SOLVE / RESOLVE (free
       upgrade for academics/non-profits)


   How do I get  version 2 of SOLVE and RESOLVE?
   Have a SOLVE version 1 license? Just fill out an upgrade license form
   (one-time, free for academics, non-profits)
   A SOLVE version 2 license? You can download SOLVE and RESOLVE upgrades
   at any time, no more forms to fill out.
   No SOLVE license? You need to fill out the license form; you can get a
   free 45-day license to try it out.
