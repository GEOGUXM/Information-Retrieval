                          John Gerlach, Branch Head

   This branch, working within the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes
   of the Earth Sciences Directorate at GSFC, conducts theoretical,
   experimental and applied research in the oceanic, atmospheric, and
   terrestrial sciences. We design, fabricate and operate both remote and
   in-situ sensing instruments for aircraft, balloons, and rockets. We
   plan and conduct laboratory and field measurements to improve the
   fundamental knowledge of earth sensing and to evaluate sensor systems
   as well as quantify and demonstrate their performance.

   OSB Activities

   Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL)
   The Airborne Oceanographic Lidar is a remote sensing instrument usually
   carried onboard a NASA P-3B or C-130 aircraft. The AOL platform
   incorporates several sensors including two active laser fluorosensors,
   several passive down and up looking spectrometers, and a thermal
   infrared temperature sensor. Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM)
   The Airborne Topographic Mapper is a scanning laser altimeter which has
   been carried onboard the NASA P-3B aircraft and on a smaller NOAA Twin
   Otter. The ATM platform incorporates the laser altimeter, GPS data, and
   inertial navigation packages.
   The Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)
   The Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX/Poseidon) is an advanced
   satellite radar altimetry system which provides global sea level
   measurements with an unprecedented accuracy. The sea level data from
   TOPEX/Poseidon is used to determine global ocean circulation and to
   increase the knowledge of the interaction of the oceans and the
   atmosphere. Air-Sea Interaction Research Facility (NASIRF)
   The primary objectives of NASIRF is to test theoretical results and to
   collect empirical data for the development of remote sensing
   techniques, in support of microwave remote sensor development and
   algorithms for air-sea interaction studies.
   Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE)
   Historic FTP Database from the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment
   (SWADE). The experiment was conducted from October 1990 through March
   1991 in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maryland and Virginia.
   Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer (ROWS)
   NASA GSFC's Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer (ROWS) is an airborne remote
   sensor used to support the development and refinement of satellite
   radars that measure the ocean surface.
   Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)
   GLAS is a laser altimeter system designed to measure ice-sheet
   topography and associated temporal changes, as well as cloud and
   atmospheric properties. GLAS is the primary instrument on the Ice,
   Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). GEOSAT Follow-On (GFO)
   The Navy's Geosat Follow-On (GFO) Mission is the latest in a series of
   altimetric satellites which include Seasat, Geosat, ERS-1, and
   TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P). Data derived from these missions has and will
   lead to vast improvements in our knowledge of ocean circulation, ice
   sheet topography, and climate change.
   Ocean Observation, Simulation and Analysis (OOSA) Groups
   A multidisciplinary group with strong collaborative ties to academic
   research groups across the U.S., OOSA projects encompass several areas
   of ocean research including development of Autonomous Drifting Ocean
   Sensors (ADOS), the creation of biogeochemical models, and
   investigations into the interactions between physics and ocean
   biogeochemical processes. Upper Air Instrumentation Research Projects
   Providing and seeking refined, improved, more accurate atmospheric and
   meteorological measurement systems and data for todays Global Change
   Research Program and Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) science needs.
   Instrument Development
   Code 972 has developed a number of airborne remote sensing instruments
   including: topographic mapping LIDARs, topographic mapping RADARs,
   fluorescence LIDAR, passive optical sensors, precision aircraft
   steering/control, and general purpose aircraft data systems. The
   Scanning Radar Altimeter
   The SRA is a raster scanning airborne down-looking pulsed narrow-beam
   radar altimeter operating at 36 gHz and producing 10 rasters per
   second. The SRA is presently being used to remotely measure hurricane
   driven ocean directional wave spectra and hurricane storm surge. The
   SRA has collected data during the 1998 and 1999 hurricane seasons.
   The Rain-Sea Interaction Facility
   The goal of the Rain-Sea Interaction Facility is to improve
   measurements of rain, wind and air-sea gas exchange over the oceans.
   Global measurement of these processes contributes to improved weather
   prediction and climate modeling. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   A number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presently exist, both
   domestically and internationally. Routine civil access to these various
   UAV assets is in an embryonic state and is only just now emerging.
   Engineering and Instruments
   Code 584 Project support includes ADAS Redesign, ROWS Pointing
   Controller, and LongEZ wavelet analysis. %nbsp;
