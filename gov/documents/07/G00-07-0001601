Overview

   This is the cdcvs0 CVS repository system. It provides CVS service for
   Fermilab and collaborators. There are web browsers for several
   repositories:
     * public -- visible to the public
     * cdcvs/osscvs/fermilinux -- visible on-site at Fermilab

Access control

   Users are allowed in via either cvs pserver access (per repository), or
   via the cvsuser account, which is accessed either by ssh with RSA keys,
   or via kerberos rsh. More details are available here.

   Within the cdcvs:/cvs/cd repository there is also a check_access
   script, which has recently been updated to allow users control over the
   permissions of their own modules. This link describes how to modify
   commit privileges for your module.

Migration

   Users who were still referring to the old cvs server as fndaub or
   fndaub.fnal.gov should fetch the fixcvsroot script, which will change
   the CVS/Root files in a checked-out cvs module to reflect the new
   hostname. This script also has a man page.

Frequently Asked Questions

   Users should review the cdcvs faq for possible answers to their
   questions.

Implementation

   The cdcvs0.fnal.gov web and cvs address is served by either
   cdcvs1.fnal.gov or cdcvs2.fnal.gov at any one time, and files are
   rsynced to the other system every 15 minutes.

   cdcvs1.fnal.gov is backed up currently via fmb on davoid.fnal.gov
   nightly.
