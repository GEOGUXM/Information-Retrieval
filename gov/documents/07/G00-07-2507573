   The Alamo FEB exists to provide closer cooperation with local civilian
      and military organizations. As a regional HUB for all government
         activity, the FEB's work is related to five mission themes:

                                     1) Communicate
                                     2) Reduce costs and improve
   efficiency
                                     3) Facilitate service delivery
                                     4) Partner with community groups
                                     5) Coordinate emergency services.
