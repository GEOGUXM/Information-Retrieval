New Economics Model Simulates U.S. Economy

   Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are developing a
   microsimulation model of the US economy that has the potential to
   significantly improve capabilities for analyzing and comparing economic
   policies.
   The new computational tool, called Aspen, capitalizes on Sandia's
   expertise in both evolutionary learning and parallel computing to
   provide several major advantages over more traditional economic models:
     * Models the economy in a single, consistent calculation.
     * Permits the impact of various legal, regulatory and policy changes
       such as monetary policy, tax law, or trade policies to be modeled
       in greater detail.
     * Allows different sectors of the economy to be analyzed
       independently and/or integrated with other sectors to develop a
       better understanding of the whole economic process.
     * Accurately simulates the behavior of basic decision-making segments
       within the economy, like households, banks, companies, and
       government.

   Aspen uses agents to represent the various decision-making segments in
   the economy. Each segment may have one or more agents representing it
   in an analysis. One of Aspen's key features is its ability to
   realistically reproduce the process used by actual economic agents to
   maximize utility or profit. Agents in Aspen not only can communicate
   with one another but also make "real-life" decisions. Through use of
   evolutionary learning techniques, the agents adapt their behavior
   according to changing economic conditions and past experience. In other
   words, they become smarter as they move through time.

Widespread applications

   The model is designed to run on Sandia's massively parallel Intel
   Teraflop computer, currently the world's fastest. Through its use,
   researchers anticipate that the entire economy can be modeled in
   sufficient detail to be realistic. This would give Aspen widespread
   application in the following areas:
     * Economic and financial market forecasting for the government,
       banks, brokerage firms, or venture capitalists.
     * Impact analysis of tax law or government policy changes.
     * Impact studies of technology shifts for industry, consumers, or
       market research firms.

Technical approach

   The most common tools currently used for economic modeling are either
   macroeconomic or computable general equilibrium (CGE). Both rely on
   regression analysis of aggregate data to develop parameters for use in
   economic forecasting. These macromodels can provide accurate forecasts,
   but problems arise when totally new economic policies are introduced
   with no past relevant data that can be used to develop modeling
   parameters. Also, modeling of shocks or discontinuities imposes certain
   limitations on the analysis. Although microsimulation could offer more
   modeling flexibility, it had been hampered by both a lack of essential
   microdata and the extensive calculation time required to micromodel
   something as large and complex as the US economy.
   Advances in massively parallel techniques for solving complex modeling
   problems, coupled with new rich sources of microlevel data, have now
   made microsimulation a viable economic analysis tool.
   Aspen microsimulates the economy using time-dependent Monte Carlo
   methods. These methods are ideal for investigating the behavior of
   complex, nonlinear stochastic systems like the economy. Agents defined
   in a problem start each time increment making decisions much like their
   real-life counterparts. Decisions on actions to take are based either
   on probabilities computed from actual mircoeconomic data or on results
   of learning models. These decisions include purchasing products, hiring
   workers, selling bonds, collecting welfare payments, conducting open
   market operations, and others. Macroeconomic variables, such as gross
   domestic product, inflation (CPI), and the unemployment rate are
   computed as aggregate results of innumerable decisions by the
   individual economic agents.

Development Status

   A prototype model of a simple market economy was completed and is
   available for general use on the web. A more detailed model is now
   under development. See the reports below for more information.

   using the prototype model. These results demonstrate Aspen's ability to
   predict business-like cycles in an economy where prices and inventories
   are allowed to vary.
