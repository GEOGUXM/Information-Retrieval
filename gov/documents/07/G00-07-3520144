                                 About CBCTR

   The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue
   Resource (CBCTR) is funded by the NCI to supply researchers with
   primary breast cancer tissues with associated clinical data. The CBCTR
   can provide formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancer
   specimens with their associated pathologic and clinical outcome
   information.

   This valuable finite collection is intended to facilitate large
   research studies that require archival tissue with clinical and outcome
   data. The Resource will document the availability of required specimens
   to support applications for research funding.

   This web site features an on-line database. Investigators can search to
   determine the number of available breast cancer samples that meet their
   research requirements. Search fields include:


           *  Stage of Disease    *        Presence of CIS
           *  Recurrence Info     * Availability of Normal Tissue
           *    Vital Status      *         Nodal Status
           * Treatment Received   *          Tumor Size
           *  Histologic Type     *        Follow-up Time
