                    2001-2002 NASA Sponsorship Selections
              _________________________________________________

   The table below lists summary information for each team selected to
   receive a NASA sponsorship for the 2002 FIRST competition. Please note
   that NASA sponsorships are contingent upon an individual team being
   registered and confirmed at the specific event for which the
   sponsorship applies. At this point several teams selected for
   sponsorship are still on the wait list for the NASA-related event, so
   in effect, the NASA sponsorship for these teams is also on hold. Under
   no circumstances are sponsorships transferrable to other teams or other
   events.

   Approximately 250 applications were submitted with sponsorship offers
   extended to about 50% of those teams who applied. Each sponsored team
   will have their registration fee paid directly by NASA for the
   sponsored event, as well as receive $1,000 for travel or other
   allowable expenses. Information on obtaining the additional $1,000 will
   be made available to each sponsored team via E-mail in the near future.
   (Please note that teams are responsible for making and paying for their
   own kickoff travel arrangements.) In addition, sponsored teams also
   have several sponsorship requirements including pre- & post- surveys,
   submitting a brief final report/project summary, etc as outlined in the
   original application. More detail on these requirements will be
   forwarded to sponsored teams.

   Our congratulations to the selected teams, as well as best wishes to
   those teams that did not receive a NASA sponsorship this year.

                            Now here's the list!
