   For the general user checking email and exchanging documents, standard
   modem access is likely to provide sufficient access to the NIH Network.
   For those on flexiplace, working extended time periods online, or
   having special system access requirements, higher speed access such as
   ISDN, Cable Modem or DSL may be warranted.

   Parachute is the current recommendation for remote access to the NIH
   network. CIT has enhanced high-speed accessmore lines and more
   band-widthfor remote users. Increased numbers of dial-up lines coming
   into Parachute support more than six hundred simultaneous calls.
   Connections are faster for users who have 56K V.90 modems or ISDN data
   connections. Cable modem and DSL access is the next step up in speed.
   The availability, affordability and supported network protocols may
   determine which high-speed solution is right for you.

Connection Methods

   56K Modems achieve faster downloads than 33.6K modems by keeping the
   signal digital on the return trip.

   ISDN is a digital phone service that connects to the NIH Network at up
   to 128 Kbps.

   Cable Modems provide high-speed data access from a broadband cable
   television network. Please note, the NIH Cable Modem program has been
   suspended.

   DSL is a digital line that uses the existing twisted pair copper
   telephone network to deliver high-speed data communications.

   VPN Virtual Private Network (VPN) uses advanced encryption to establish
   secure, end to end, private network connections over third party
   networks such as the Internet or extranets.

Comparison Matrix

   Remote Access Comparison
   Decide which connection method is right for your needs. Compare
   download speeds, upload speeds, supported network protocols,
   availability, equipment costs, average monthly costs, average first
   year costs, and recommended applications for each type of remote access
   connection type.
