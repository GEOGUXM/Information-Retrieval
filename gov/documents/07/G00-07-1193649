   The second Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2), designed and built
   by the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   (JPL) for NASA's Office of Space Science, is one of five scientific
   instruments aboard the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. This
   camera was installed during during National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration's (NASA's) space shuttle mission to service the
   telescope in December 1993. It replaced the original camera (WF/PC),
   which was launched with the Hubble in April 1990. WFPC2 contains
   corrective optics to refocus light coming from the telescope's primary
   mirror and restores performance of the telescope to original
   specifications.

   WFPC2 divides its field of view among four internal camera systems:
   three f/13 wide field cameras, and one f/28 narrow field camera. The
   wide field cameras give the telescope a panoramic view, providing the
   greatest sensitivity for faint objects. The planetary camera provides
   about 2.2 times the resolution of the other three systems, but with a
   smaller field of view. All four cameras are sensitive to light from the
   far ultraviolet to the near infrared.
