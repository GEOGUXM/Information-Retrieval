The J. Phil Campbell, Senior, Natural Resource Conservation Center (JPCSNRCC)
is part of the Agricultural Research Service, an agency of the United States
Department of Agriculture, located in the South Atlantic Area.


                               CENTER MISSION:

      The mission of the J. Phil Campbell, Senior, Natural Resource Conservation
      Center is to solve natural resource problems of broad fundamental
      significance. Studies of soil-plant-animal-atmosphere systems provide
      information for designing practical approaches to land management for
      optimum use and conservation of soil, water, and atmospheric resources.
      Research projects range in scope from those that extend understanding of
      biogeochemical processes that limit ecosystem productivity and
      sustainability to those that elucidate interactions of ecosystems within
      Southern Piedmont landscapes. Our goal is to apply state- of-the-art
      understanding to develop efficient, economical, and socially acceptable
      agroecosystems. Our mission is carried out in partnership with farmers,
      leaders of soil and water conservation districts and state and federal
      action/regulatory agencies with the goal of transferring successful
      agricultural systems to land owners and managers to protect and sustain
      the natural resource base, build accord with non-agricultural sectors, and
      support healthy rural economies.

   USDA-ARS is committed to making its web sites accessible to all USDA
   customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are undergoing
   review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed the
   requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

   Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
   standards. Furthermore, USDA-ARS continues to work on making all web
   sites accessible. Thank you very much for your patience through this
   redesign process. If you have any comments or suggestions for
   improvement, please contact the Web Master of this page.
