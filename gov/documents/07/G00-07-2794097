   The Telecommunications Electric Service Priority (TESP) restoration
   initiative promotes, on a voluntary basis, the inclusion of
   telecommunications facilities considered critical to National Security
   and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) in existing electric utility
   emergency priority restoration systems. The TESP initiative is
   administered by the Office of Priority Telecommunications (OPT) at the
   NCS, with cooperation from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), State
   governments, and utilities. For more information, please go to About
   TESP.
