                          Babies are born learning.
                          Make every moment count.

Welcome!

   Welcome to BrainNet, dedicated to improving the lives of children by
   ensuring that all persons and systems who come into contact with
   pregnant women, parents and children promote healthy, optimal brain
   development.

New Brain Research Findings

   Thanks to new technologies, scientists now have a much clearer picture
   of thebrain's inner workings - how it learns and grows. Babies' brains
   grow and develop every day. Important discoveries about how a child's
   earliest experiences and relationships affect the way his or her brain
   is organized. During the early years of life, the brain is forming
   connections that may determine a lifetime of skills and potentials.
   Quality care of young children is key.

   Some of the findings confirm what parents and caregivers already know -
   that how the child is raised has an enormous impact on his emotional
   well being, intellectual level and skills for success. Scientists are
   learning about the neurological processes that support and go beyond
   this understanding. Research is showing that experiences, coupled with
   heredity, literally sculpt the brain!

Brain Development

   A baby is born with approximately 100 billion neurons, or nerve cells,
   in her brain. Neurons communicate through tiny connections that form
   networks. These networks allow neurons to transmit information involved
   in sensing, feeling, thinking, learning and remembering.

   At birth, most of these important connections are not yet formed.
   Neural networks are established in the brain in response to
   experiences. Every experience a baby has forms a corresponding network
   in her brain. A baby's brain is truly a work in progress!

           The brain that eventually takes shape is the result of
             an intricate dance between the child's experiences
                        and her genetic inheritance.

   Experiences are like food for the brain. A rich diet of love and
   healthy stimulation causes the brain to grow and flourish. A positive
   environment nourishes the child's innate intelligence and allows her
   unique gifts to blossom.

   Conversely, an impoverished environment diminishes the brain.
   Unfortunately, many children's brains are starving due to a lack of
   attention and the right kinds of experiences. Without the opportunity
   to be used, neurons can actually wither away and die.

   Stress is often coupled with neglect - this combination can have
   serious consequences. Extreme and/or prolonged stress can actually
   destroy neurons. Stressful experiences build networks that create
   negative patterns of thinking and feeling. These patterns become part
   of the child's foundation and influence their entire life.

   Fortunately, the human brain has an amazing capacity to grow and change
   throughout life. New research suggests that it is never too late for a
   brain to grow new connections. The brain at any age can be altered, or
   helped to compensate for problems, with appropriate intensive
   intervention.

   However, for optimal development, timing is critical. There are periods
   of opportunity, "prime times" during which the brain is particularly
   efficient at specific types of learning. In the first decade of life,
   the brain's ability to grow, change and compensate is especially
   remarkable. (See chart.)

                     We can most effectively impact and
                    influence a child's brain development
                    during the first three years of life.

   During this time, networks are forming at an astonishing rate - by age
   three, the weight of a child's brain has almost tripled! The young
   brain is like a super sponge, absorbing every experience into its
   neural architecture. During these first three years the brain is
   storing information and memories that will be the foundation for a
   lifetime of skills and potential. If this foundation is flawed, it can
   affect the entire life span of the individual.

   Early care provides the experiences that have decisive and long lasting
   effects on the emotional, social, behavioral, intellectual and physical
   capabilities of the child for the rest of her life.

Everyone who comes into contact with young children including parents,
caregivers, policy makers, health professionals, the business community, and
social service providers has the opportunity to make a great impact and
positively influence a child's future.
