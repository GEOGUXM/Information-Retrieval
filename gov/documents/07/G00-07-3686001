                        National Cancer Institute
                        Intramural Research Directory

   The National Cancer Institute established an intramural scientific
   program in direct response to the American public's need for research
   that will lead to better prognosis for cancer patients, both in the
   present and for future generations, as well as to take better advantage
   of the knowledge and experience of the entire cancer research
   community. To achieve this goal, the scientific research environment at
   the NCI has been organized to enhance opportunities for talented
   scientists to be successful in both basic and applied cancer research.
   To this end, the Institute's intramural research program has been honed
   into three Divisions: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Cancer
   Epidemiology and Genetics.
   Please select an intramural division from the choices below.

             CCR - Center for Cancer Research
             DCEG - Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics
