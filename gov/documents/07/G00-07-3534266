                     A new look at old fission mysteries
     Peter Möller - When theoretical physicist Peter Möller of Nuclear
       Physics (T-16) worked on his thesis at Los Alamos in 1973, his
    calculation of the nuclear potential energy for 175 different nuclear
     shapes, or grid points, pushed the limits of existing computational
     power. Using one IBM computer punch card to define each grid point,
   Möller's total input data card deck for the calculation was about one
                              inch thick. More
