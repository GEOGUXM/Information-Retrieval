                     A MESSAGE FROM OUR CENTER DIRECTOR
                           MR. ROY D. BRIDGES, JR.
     Welcome to the KSC Home Page for the 2001 Combined Federal Campaign
      (CFC). Each year, in accordance with federal regulation, federal
   employees are given one opportunity through the CFC to campaign in the
    workplace for fundraising activities for approved worthy causes. This
    web site is designed to be informative by answering frequently asked
      questions and describing the activities of the many agencies that
                           benefit from our gifts.

     Although the CFC kick-off for 2001 does not officially occur until
   October 1, 2001, I invite each of you to visit this site for continuing
   updates of information you should find useful in deciding your upcoming
   CFC contribution. KSC has consistently demonstrated leadership through
   our generous gifts to CFC. As the October kick-off approaches, I'm sure
            I can count on you to continue to help those in need.

                        Remember... "United We Care."
