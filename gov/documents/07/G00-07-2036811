These false-color images are from the June 16, 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo,
Philippines. The gas and ash clouds were tracked by TOMS for several weeks as
   they encircled the Earth. These satellite observations demonstrate the
     enormous amounts of gas and ash emitted, as well as details such as
 differences in peak concentrations and geographic extent. TOMS also detects
 many smaller volcanic clouds - see the archive for a full list of eruptions
                              detected to date.

   QuikTOMS failed to achieve orbit on 21 September, 2001. Click here for
                                  details.

   This website documents the efforts of the TOMS SO2 and Ash Group, based
   at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, to detect, track and measure
   volcanic eruption plumes from space. We also collaborate with
   researchers and students in the Volcanic Clouds study group at Michigan
   Technological University. Our group uses satellite data from Total
   Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments to map and quantify
   sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) emitted by volcanoes. We also use the TOMS
   instruments to map volcanic ash and aerosol emissions, using an
   "aerosol index". The aerosol index locates absorbing and non-absorbing
   aerosol clouds, which include volcanic ash clouds, sulfate aerosol,
   dust, and smoke clouds; however, at present it cannot discriminate
   among the absorbing species.
   It is possible for anyone to follow volcanic clouds in near real time
   with TOMS, thanks to George Stephens and associates at NOAA. This site
   contains both sulfur dioxide and aerosol index data. For more
   information about TOMS aerosol retrievals (and ozone and other
   non-volcanic products such as UVB), as well as a description of each of
   the TOMS missions, see the TOMS project web page.
   The TOMS volcanic emissions group is supported in part by NASA's Earth
   Observation System (EOS) Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) Volcanology
   Team, a major component of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. The
   Volcanology team's investigation, "A Global Assessment of Active
   Volcanism, Volcanic Hazards, and Volcanic Inputs to the Atmosphere from
   the Earth Observing System", is headed by Principal Investigator Dr.
   Pete Mouginis-Mark (University of Hawaii).
