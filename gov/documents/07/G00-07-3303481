Flying high, flying safe

   Two Dryden research aircraft are showing they can save fuel and reduce
   drag by flying like birds do - in formation.

   Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF) missions flown by F/A-18 aircraft
   have shown in about 40 research flights substantial fuel savings of up
   to 20 percent, high accuracy during autopilot-controlled formation
   flight and excellence in identifying and mitigating risks to fly the
   missions safely.

Behind the curtain

   Behind the daunting appearance, thick clouds of smoke, flashing lights
   and thunderous voice of the Wizard of Oz was a person hidden by a
   curtain in a control room who coordinated the effects.

   And one of the people behind the "curtain" of the flight research
   control room is Mae Yook Wong, a member of Dryden's Test Information
   Engineers (TIE) Group within the Western Aeronautical Test Range
   (WATR).
