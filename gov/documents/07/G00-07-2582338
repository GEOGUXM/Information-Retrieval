                       Important Notice: Please Read!

   In accordance with the recent changes in the Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR) designating Federal Business Opportunities as the
   single point of universal electronic public access on the Internet for
   government-wide Federal procurement opportunities that exceed $25,000,
   CBDNet will cease to accept notices effective midnight, January 1,
   2002. Notices received on GPO's CBD system by midnight, January 1, and
   manuscripts received by 3:00 p.m. on January 2, will be included in the
   final GPO print version of the CBD to be issued on January 4, 2002.

   Any notices validated for inclusion in the January 4 printed issue of
   CBD will remain available in the CBDNet database of active notices for
   the required 15 days. Once they have all successfully been transferred
   into the archive database the active database will be shut down. This
   archive database will continue to be available on CBDNet as part of the
   Federal Depository Library Program Electronic Collection. As the
   manager of this collection, the Superintendent of Documents at the U.S.
   Government Printing Office has a commitment to maintaining permanent
   public access for the materials included in the collection.

   To read the full text of the Special Notice from the Department of
   Commerce, go to Federal Business Opportunities to replace the Commerce
   Business Daily.
