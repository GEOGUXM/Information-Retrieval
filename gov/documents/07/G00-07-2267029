   The TVA system of dams and reservoirs saves an estimated $194 million
   in potential flood damage annually. Recent heavy rains over a period of
   three days demonstrated just how well that system works when its
   needed. Read more here about steps taken to control flooding.

   TVA has begun a two-year study of its daily reservoir operations across
   the Valley. The study will evaluate whether changes in current policy
   will produce greater overall value for the public. An environmental
   impact review and public input will be significant aspects of the
   project. Read more here.
