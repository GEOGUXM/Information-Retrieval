   U.S. D.O.T. Waiver Website

   Introduction

   Former President Clinton's Executive Memorandum of April 21, 1998,
   encourages agencies to grant waivers to streamline internal processes
   and procedures. Accordingly, DOT employees are encouraged to find
   better ways of doing business and to bring these ideas forward. This
   DOT Waiver Website and the processes found within it, have been
   developed for the use of DOT employees only. Any expansion of this use
   to other parties would be found within a DOT's operating administration
   (OA) process found under "OA Waiver Request Sites." You are invited to
   access DOT's Waiver Website often to see what ideas we're trying in the
   pursuit of affecting positive change here at DOT.




                       How to Submit a Waiver Request
