     The central goal of this PGA is to use a comparative genomic approach
   first to identify, and then to determine the function of elements
   regulating the expression of genes affecting the cardiovascular system.

   This project is one of eleven Programs for Genomic Applications (PGAs)
   funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

   Researchers with issues relevant to heart, lung and blood disease that
   might be examined using cross-species sequence analysis should contact
   us about the possibility of having genomic sequence generated by the
   Berkeley PGA.
