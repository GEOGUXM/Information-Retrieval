   The principal objective of this program is the study of cooperative
   phenomena in complex solids by elastic and inelastic neutron
   scattering. Aspects investigated include structural and magnetic phase
   transformations, magnetic structure, and elementary excitations such as
   spin-waves and phonons. Neutron scattering provides a unique tool for
   the study of these phenomena, and experiments are carried out at
   neutron facilities in the U.S. and abroad. The ultimate motivation is
   the broad understanding of underlying physical principles. In many
   cases, complementary studies are performed in collaboration with other
   BNL groups in Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science. An effort
   to grow (at BNL) the single-crystal samples necessary for some of these
   studies has been initiated. There are also efforts, in collaboration
   with BNLÂ’s Center for Neutron Science (CNS) as well as with neutron
   scientists at other labs and universities, to design and build new
   spectrometers for the Spallation Neutron Source and the High Flux
   Isotope Reactor, both at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

   A major theme of current research concerns strongly-correlated-electron
   phenomena in transition-metal-oxide compounds; specific examples
   include high-temperature superconductivity in the layered cuprates and
   colossal magnetoresistance in manganites. Of particular interest is the
   interplay between electronic, magnetic, and structural degrees of
   freedom in these systems, as well as in the f-electron heavy-fermion
   materials. Other systems of current interest include S=1 linear chain
   antiferromagnets with quantum-disordered ground states, S=1/2 coupled
   chain (ladder) systems, spin glasses, and shape-memory alloys
   exhibiting Martensitic phase transformations.

   Nd[2]BaNiO[5], a quasi-1-D mixed-spin quantum antiferromagnet with S=1
   Ni-chains linked by magnetic rare-earth ions. This model system is
   ideal for studying the behavior of Haldane spin chains in applied
   staggered magnetic fields. Figure Right: Longitudinal dispersion of
   Haldane gap modes measured in Nd[2]BaNiO[5] at T=35K, below the Neel
   temperature T[N]=48K.
