                             The Plasma Universe

   Plasmas, the "4th state of matter", (no, we are not talking about
   blood), are the dominant form of matter in the universe. As material is
   heated from solid, to liquid, to gas phase, and then even hotter, it
   begins to become ionized .... that is, one or more of the electrons on
   an atom become liberated. A plasma can be  described as a collection of
   ionized particles, which interact collectively by long-range
   electromagnetic forces associated with their charges and motion. When
   the inter-particle binding energy is small compared to the average
   kinetic energy of the particles, then a plasma exhibits its most
   complex collective behaviors.

   Fortunately for human beings and other living things, plasmas are not
   routinely encountered on the surface of the Earth. However, we do see
   natural plasmas in the form of lightning and auroras, and man-made ones
   most commonly in the form of fluorescent light bulbs.  A little farther
   away from home, the Earth's magnetosphere contains a plasma which is
   populated by particles of the solar wind interacting with ones from the
   Earth's upper atmosphere. The solar corona is a good example of a hot
   plasma. Each planet with a magnetic field tends to have its own plasma,
   such as around Jupiter, or even the moon Io. As comets come into the
   inner solar system, a plasma tail often develops (in addition to
   non-charged dusty tail), and was easily visible on the recent Hyakutake
   and Hale-Bopp comets, for example. Beyond the solar system, in
   interstellar space, ions and electrons (at very low densities) are
   found everywhere. Beautiful plasma nebula can be photographed from
   earth, excited by light from nearby stars. Generally, every energetic
   object in the universe has a plasma associated with it. We can detect
   plasmas by observing their electromagnetic radiation (light, x-rays,
   radio waves, etc), or in some cases, by observing the interaction of
   their ions and electrons with other objects.

     Comet Hyakutake with bluish plasma tail Lightning produces a plasma
                                    too!

   At Los Alamos, we study plasmas of all kinds, and seek to harness them
   for controlled thermonuclear energy production, for use in the
   processing of materials, for environmental restoration and
   decontamination, to understand the physics of high energy density
   states of matter, and in various astrophysical contexts.
