Our Mission

     The California Water Code entrusts the regulatory Dam Safety Program
     to the Department of Water Resources.  The principal goal of this
     program is to avoid dam failure and thus prevent loss of life and
     destruction of property.  Dams under State jurisdiction are an
     essential element of the California infrastructure that provides
     constant water supply integrity.
