       Land and Right of Way
       The Division of Land and Right of Way serves the real estate needs
       of the California Department of Water Resources and the State
       Reclamation Board. It is headquartered in Sacramento and performs
       all right of way functions for the State Water Project statewide,
       and for most flood control projects in the Central Valley and the
       Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
       Our mission is to acquire real property and property rights
       required for various projects of the SWP and The Reclamation Board;
       provide mapping and surveying services for those projects; and,
       effectively manage the real property and property rights acquired
       for the State Water Project and The Reclamation Board.  The
       Division strives to intelligently manage DWR's and the Board's real
       estate assets, maximizing the return on SWP end-user and taxpayer
       dollars for the benefit of the public-at-large.
       The work of Land and Right of Way spans many functional areas, and
       the information accumulated covers the past 30± years for the SWP
       and 75± years for the Reclamation Board.  These web pages were
       first posted to the Department's web servers in June, 1999.  With
       such a wealth of information available, it will take time to
       identify and make available the most usable portions for your
       perusal.
