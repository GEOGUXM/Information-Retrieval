   Specialized Programs of Research Excellence

   In 1992, the NCI established the Specialized Programs of Research
   Excellence (SPOREs) to promote interdisciplinary research and to speed
   the bidirectional exchange between basic and clinical science to move
   basic research finding from the laboratory to applied settings
   involving patients and populations. The goal of the SPORE program is to
   bring to clinical care settings novel ideas that have the potential to
   reduce cancer incidence and mortality, improve survival, and to improve
   the quality of life. Laboratory and clinical scientists work
   collaboratively to plan, design and implement research programs that
   impact on cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and
   control. To facilitate this research, each SPORE develops and maintains
   specialized resources that benefit all scientists working on the
   specific cancer site, as well as SPORE scientists. An additional SPORE
   element is a career development program that recruits scientists both
   within and outside the SPORE institution to enlarge the cadre of
   laboratory and clinical scientists dedicated to translational research
   on human cancer. SPOREs meet annually to share data, assess research
   progress, identify new research opportunities and establish priorities
   for research most likely to reduce incidence and mortality and to
   increase survival. In 2000, NCI funded SPOREs on breast, prostate,
   lung, gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers. In the upcoming years, NCI
   may increase the use of the SPORE mechanism to include funding for
   other major cancer sites. SPOREs are funded through specialized center
   grants (P50s).
