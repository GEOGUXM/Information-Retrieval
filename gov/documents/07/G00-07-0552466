                     NOTICE from the PACER Administrator
   The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana is
   currently a site providing federal court case information on the
   Internet. If you experience trouble accessing this site, traditional
   dial-up PACER is still available. Whether you access PACER on the
   Internet or use the dial-up service, you will be required to use a
   login and password issued by the PACER Service Center. If you do not
   already have a PACER account, call (800) 676-6856 or (210) 301-6440 to
   obtain a registration form. It takes about a week to receive a login
   and password from the PACER Service Center.
   There is a $.07 per page charge for downloading case information on
   this system.
   The Judiciary is always open for suggestions from our electronic public
   access users for improvements. Please include the name of the specific
   court you are referring to in your email.
