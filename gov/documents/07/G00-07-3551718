                                     IMP 8

   Interplanetary Monitoring Platform 8 (aka IMP-J, Explorer 50) was
   launched on 26 October 1973, and continues to operate as of this
   writing (January 1999). On board is a LANL experiment, the Solar Plasma
   Electrostatic Analyzer.

   Results from the experiment can be viewed at this site, either as
     * plots (daily or 32-day summaries)

   or as
     * ASCII moments suitable for reading into your own plotting/analysis
       package.

   Also available are PDF moment and stack plots for selected times, but
   regretfully the interface for obtaining those is somewhat crude.
