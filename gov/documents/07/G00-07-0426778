                          PROPOSAL PROCESSING SITE


   When working with this web site, you will be working interactively with
   and storing information in an Office of Space Science database.

     PLEASE READ the following instructions carefully before beginning.

   1. You will be given a password at the end of your submission . Keep
   note of this password, so you can return and edit your submission.
   Revisions will only be allowed until the due date of the particular
   program.

   2. Your connection will automatically time out after 30 minutes if you
   have not interacted with the database. This means that if you have not
   submitted (by pressing buttons on the forms) any information to the
   server for 30 minutes you will be logged off and your information will
   be lost. If you wish to continue working you will need to start over.

   3. Do not use the "Front" or "Back" buttons in your browser. Always use
   the navigation buttons provided for you on the forms.

   4. You must click the "Done" button at the end of your submission to
   complete you entry.

   5. We advise you to prepare any lengthy text in a word-processing
   program and then cut and paste the information into the web form, so as
   not to time out of the system.

   6. This web site will be accepting hundreds of NOI's, proposals, and
   reviews throughout the year. Please submit your materials as soon as
   possible, so that any difficulties you might experience can be handled
   in a timely manner. Start early - you always have an edit function in
   case changes are required closer to the deadline.

   This web site is designed for use with Netscape and Internet Explorer.

   If you are having trouble please contact Deb Tripp at
