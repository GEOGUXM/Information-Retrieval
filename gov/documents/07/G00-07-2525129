   NASA Aviation Safety Program Goal

   Develop and demonstrate technologies that contribute to a reduction in
   the aviation
   fatal accident rate by a factor of 5 by year 2007 and by a factor of 10
   by year 2022.

                                AvSP Cockpit

   Our society is highly dependent on air transportation. Great strides
   have been made over the last 40 years to make flying the safest of all
   the major modes of transportation. If air traffic triples as predicted
   within the next 20 years, even today's low rate of less than two
   accidents per million flights will be unacceptable. Dramatic steps,
   through joint FAA and NASA research, will assure unquestioned safety
   for the traveling public.
