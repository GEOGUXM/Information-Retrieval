   [seawifsworld.jpg] Global change research investigates the underlying
   processes of change and their manifestation, the impacts and the
   prediction of change. Monitoring these changes provides an important
   underpinning to both global change research and resource management.
   Monitoring of land cover and land use is an important element of the
   NASA Earth Science Enterprise. Moderate resolution remote sensing
   provides a means for quantifying land surface characteristics such as
   land cover type and extent, snow cover extent, surface temperature,
   leaf area index, fire occurrence. Satellite measurements of leaf area,
   leaf duration and net primary productivity provide important inputs to
   parameterize or validate ecosystem process models.  High quality,
   consistent and well-calibrated satellite measurements are needed if we
   are to detect and monitor changes and trends in these variables.
   Developing the next-generation data sets for global change research is
   the challenge given to the MODIS Science Team.

   [Instrument.jpg] The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer) instrument, which was launched on the Terra platform
   December 18th, 1999, is uniquely designed (wide spectral range,
   moderate spatial resolution (250m â€“1km), and near daily global
   coverage) to observe and monitor the surface of the Earth. This
   instrument will provide a new and improved capability for terrestrial
   satellite remote sensing aimed at meeting the needs of global change
   research.

   In addition to advising on the instrument specifications and design,
   the MODIS Land Group (MODLAND) is tasked with developing algorithms and
   generating and validating a series of priority data products. These
   higher order data products have been designed to remove the burden of
   certain common types of data processing from the user community and
   meet the more general needs of global-to-regional monitoring, modeling,
   and assessment. The products are divided into three categories: surface
   radiation measurements, ecosystem process variables and land cover
   characteristics.
