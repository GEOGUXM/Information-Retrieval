                            Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve

                      This Web site has been established to provide the public with
   information on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem
   Reserve and ongoing activities related to its management.

The Executive Orders

   On December 4, 2000, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef
   Ecosystem Reserve (Reserve) was created by Executive Order 13178. The
   Reserve encompasses an area of the marine waters and submerged lands of
   the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands extending approximately 1200 nautical
   miles long and 100 nautical miles wide. As part of the establishment of
   the Reserve, Executive Order 13178 contains conservation measures that
   restrict some activities throughout the Reserve, and establishes
   Reserve Preservation Areas around certain islands, atolls and banks
   where all consumptive or extractive uses are prohibited.

   A 30 day public comment period was initiated to receive comments
   regarding whether to make permanent the Reserve Preservation Areas.
   Comments were also requested on the conservation measures for the
   Reserve.

   On January 18, 2001, after consideration of the comments received, the
   process and establishment of the Reserve was finalized by issuance of
   Executive Order 13196. This Executive Order modified Executive Order
   13178 by revising certain conservation measures and making permanent
   the Reserve Preservation Areas with modifications. With this action,
   the establishment of the Reserve, including the conservation measures
   and permanent Reserve Preservation Areas, is complete.

   Summary of changes to E.O. 13178

   Next Steps: The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) is working
   to develop the Reserve Operations Plan. In developing the Plan, the
   ONMS will seek the recommendations of the Reserve Advisory Council and
   will consult with the State of Hawaii and the Department of the
   Interior. Once a draft Plan is finalized, a public comment period will
   provide an opportunity for comments. After consideration of the public
   comments, the Reserve Operations Plan will be finalized.

   In addition, the ONMS will begin the sanctuary designation process.
   Initial steps involve working with the Reserve Advisory Council to
   develop a vision, goals, and objectives for the sanctuary, holding
   public scoping meetings to elicit comments, and developing assessments
   of the area in consideration.

   ONMS is currently seeking applications for alternates on the Reserve
   Advisory Council through June 4, 2001. Please see the Reserve Council
   page for additional information, including application material.
