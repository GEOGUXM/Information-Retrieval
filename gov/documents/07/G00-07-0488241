   Article III of the Constitution calls for a Supreme Court and whatever
   other federal courts Congress thinks are necessary. For the most part,
   federal courts only hear cases in which the United States is a party,
   cases involving violations of the Constitution or federal laws, and in
   some special kinds of cases, such as bankruptcy cases and cases
   concerning incidents at sea. In addition, federal courts hear cases
   based on state laws that involve parties from different states.

   The federal courts play a significant role in shaping this country's
   future by resolving disputes and protecting the rights of its citizens.

   Explore tomorrow by looking at the future of the federal court. It
   doesn't just belong to yesterday, but it is a vital part of the next
   century.
