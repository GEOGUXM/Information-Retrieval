                                 What's New

   The Space Science Division at NASA Ames Research Center is dedicated to
   research in astrophysics, exobiology, advanced life support
   technologies, and planetary science. These research programs are
   structured around Astrobiology (the study of life in the universe and
   the chemical and physical forces and adaptions that influence life's
   origin, evolution, and destiny), and address some of the most
   fundamental questions pursued by science.
   These questions examine the origin of life and our place in the
   universe. Ames is recognized as a world leader in Astrobiology. In
   pursuing our mission in Astrobiology, Space Science Division scientists
   perform pioneering basic research and technology development.
   For more information about the Space Science Division, download our
   Annual Report.
