   The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) pilot program awards
   contracts to small business concerns for cooperative research and
   development with a Research Institution through a uniform, three-phase
   process. STTR, though modeled after the SBIR program, is a separate
   activity and is separately funded.

   The STTR program is authorized until 2001. The funding set aside is not
   less than 0.15 percent of the extramural R&D budget, one-tenth of the
   amount for SBIR. The technical scope is also limited.

   Small businesses team with Research Institutions and conduct joint
   research. Research Institutions are non-profit research organizations,
   federally funded laboratories, or universities. The goal of Congress in
   establishing the STTR program is to transfer technology developed by
   the Research Institution into the private marketplace through the
   entrepreneurship of a small business. The small business and its
   partnering institution are required to sign an agreement on how
   intellectual property will be shared between them.

   Phase I STTR projects receive up to $100,000 for a one-year effort;
   Phase II is limited to $500,000 for two years.
