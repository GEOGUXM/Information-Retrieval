            IMPORTANT: If you are submitting an IAR you will be prompted for a
   username/password. The username/password was emailed to all
   investigators on 1/16/2002. Please check your mailbox for an attachment

   Note to Visitors to this Website
   __________________________________________________________________

   Access to all Department of the Interior Internet sites except for US
   Geological Survey sites has been blocked by a court order. You may
   access this site because it is served by the US Geological Survey, but
   the National Park Service (NPS) is prevented from accessing this site.
     You are able to use this site to:
       __________________________________________________________________

       * Search and review annual research accomplishment reports ( the
         Investigator's Annual Report database)
       * learn about the NPS guidance and process for applying for
         scientific research and collecting permits
       * learn about park needs for research and who in parks coordinates
         the processing of applications for scientific research and
         collecting permits
       * prepare and submit electronic applications or prepare paper
         applications for scientific research and collecting permits, or
       * prepare and submit electronic responses or prepare paper responses
         to the call from NPS for you to submit your Investigator's Annual
         Report (IAR) for Calendar Year 2001.

     Because NPS is temporarily unable to access this website, the permit
     applications and Investigator's Annual Reports that you file during the
     period of the court order will be downloaded under USGS supervision and
     the USGS will transfer the downloaded electronic or paper application
     and IAR files to an NPS central office. The NPS central office then
     will distribute the electronic or paper files to the appropriate parks
     for processing. Having to process your application or annual report
     submissions in this manner likely will create significant delays in a
     park's ability to provide responses to you. If you are seeking a new or
     renewal permit for a scientific research or collecting project that you
     would like to initiate in a park within the next two to three months,
     NPS encourages you to submit your electronic or paper application now
     and then telephone the park's research coordinator in two weeks to
     inform the coordinator of your need for rapid consideration of your
     application. You can find the park research coordinator's name and
     phone number in the park's research coordinator information page
     available in this website. Because the park research coordinator does
     not currently have access to the Internet, do not attempt to
     communicate with the coordinator by email.
