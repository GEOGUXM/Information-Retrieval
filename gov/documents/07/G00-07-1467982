   Over the past decade, Molecular Profiling (MP) has emerged as a dynamic
   new discipline, capable of generating a global view of mRNA, protein
   patterns, and DNA alterations in various cell types and disease
   processes.

   Biomedical research in general is in the midst of an informational and
   technological revolution. MP integrates the expanding genetic databases
   from the Human Genome Project with newly developed expression analysis
   technologies and holds great promise to help us:
     * Understand the molecular anatomy of normal cells and cells in
       various stages of disease.
     * Develop new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for clinical
       intervention.
     * Explain the relationship between genotype and phenotype in humans,
       which is still largely unknown.

   At the NCI, the Prostate Molecular Profiling Group has concentrated on
   a tissue microdissection-based approach to Molecular Profiling. Here,
   we offer general insights into MP, protocols that were developed or
   adapted for use at the NCI, explanations of the specific approach we
   are following in the prostate, and examples of our prostate cancer
   research studies.

   This site is divided into three sections, each with a linked,
   color-coded header:

     * For clinicians, scientists, and bioinformaticians interested in
       gaining a general understanding of MP.
     * Discusses critical issues in four areas of MP.

   [protocolsnew.gif]

     * For scientists working at the bench.
     * Provides detailed laboratory protocols for tissue acquisition
       through to molecular analysis, with emphasis on microdissection
       methods, plus related information.

     * For researchers who want to see MP in practice.
     * Provides a practical example of MP using prostate tissue. Includes
       prostate MP issues, results, 3D model, and microreviews.
