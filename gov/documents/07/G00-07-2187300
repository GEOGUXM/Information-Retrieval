         Welcome to the Washington Horse Racing Commission Website!
       Fans of horse racing, both experienced and newcomers, are often
       surprised when they learn of the variety of duties and activities
       performed by the members and staff of the Washington Horse Racing
       Commission (the WHRC). The goal of our website is to bring these
       activities into focus and increase awareness of the many services
       in place for the fans and participants in the sport.
       Here you can access the Rules of Racing, download license
       applications, and learn about the members of the WHRC. The WHRC
       staff of racing officials has also put together a whirlwind "Behind
       the Scenes" tour of a day at the races with the WHRC employees. A
       useful page of horse racing-related links has also been compiled
       where you can get much more information about any aspect of the
       horse racing and breeding industries.
       Between races, we will also be putting together new pages for the
       site. We hope you will contact us with your suggestions, and any
       questions you may have.
       Enjoy!
