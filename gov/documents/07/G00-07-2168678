   OOSA is a multidisciplinary group with strong collaborative ties to
   academic research groups across the U.S., OOSA projects encompass
   several areas of ocean research including development of Autonomous
   Drifting Ocean Sensors, the creation of biogeochemical models, and
   investigations into the interactions between physics and ocean
   biogeochemical processes.
