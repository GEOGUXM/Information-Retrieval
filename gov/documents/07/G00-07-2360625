   The Biological Biochemical Image Database is a searchable database of
   images of putative biological pathways, macromolecular structures, gene
   families, and cellular relationships. It is of use to those who are
   working with large sets of genes or proteins using cDNA arrays,
   functional genomics, or proteomics.

   Enter multiple keywords such as: gene names ( NFkB, IL2, CTLA4, etc.),
   pathways ( cell cycle, apoptosis, etc.)
   cell/tissue type ( heart, liver, T-cell, brain, etc.)
   disease names ( multiple sclerosis, asthma, etc.)
   biological level ( organ, intracellular, cell membrane,
   cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, endosome,
   transcription, structural)
   Separate words by a space.
   To get a complete list of
   images do a blank search. Keyword
