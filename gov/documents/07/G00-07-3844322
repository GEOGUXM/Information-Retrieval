   So what is a SHEIK anyway?

   The SHEIKS are a group of professors, staff scientists, and graduate
   students doing basic research on the nuclear and chemical properties of
   the heaviest elements. Our work is done at Lawrence Berkeley National
   Laboratory (LBNL) and the University of California, Berkeley and
   supported by the U.S. Department of Energy.

   You can use the links at left to get a closer look at our research, our
   members, and our collaborators around the world.

News

   A pre-print of our retraction of the discovery of element 118 is now
   available.

   Attention! We are currently looking for new graduate students for our
   group. If you are interested in becoming one of a handful of people in
   the world who study the elements at the limit of the periodic table
   then e-mail Heino Nitsche. You must be enrolled at the University of
   California, Berkeley, although we may be able to make arrangements
   under certain other circumstances.

   More news briefs are available.
