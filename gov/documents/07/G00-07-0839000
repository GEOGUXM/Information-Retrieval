   Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education,
   Remembrance, and Research In the spring of 1998 the Task Force for
   International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and
   Research was initiated by Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson. The
   working group consists of personal representatives of heads of state
   and government. Ten countries are currently represented on the Task
   Force: Austria, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands,
   Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
   Professor Yehuda Bauer, head of the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem,
   is the Task Force’s independent advisor.
   I come from a people who gave the ten commandments to the world. Time
   has come to strengthen them by three additional ones... thous shall not
   be a perpetrator; thou shall not be a victim; and thou shall never, but
   never, be a bystander. Quote by Professor Yehuda Bauer, January 26,
   2000
