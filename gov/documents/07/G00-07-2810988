   Privacy Policy/Notice

     The Washington State Legislature passed the Growth Management Act
     (GMA)  in 1990 to encourage wise land use and planning.  In 1991, it
     created growth management hearings boards to resolve land use
     disputes quickly  -  rather than a single state-wide board, three
     independent boards were established in order to reflect regional
     diversity.  The jurisdictional regions for the three boards are as
     follows:

     Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board (CPSGMHB):
     includes King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap Counties and the cities
     within those counties (aqua, below)

     Eastern Washington Growth Management Hearings Board (EWGMHB):
     includes all counties and cities east of the crest of the Cascade
     Mountains which are required to plan or choose to plan under the Act
     (beige, below).

     Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board (WWGMHB):
     includes all counties and cities west of the crest of the Cascade
     Mountains which are required to plan or choose to plan under the
     Act, but are not within the Central Puget Sound Boards
     jurisdictional boundaries (green, below).

     (Purple counties must plan for Critical Areas and Natural Resources
     Lands only.)  For implementation of the GMA, see the Growth
     Management website of the Department of Community, Trade, and
     Economic Development (DCTED) and the DCTED map:
