   Welcome to the Kennedy Space Center Surplus Property Sales Website.
   Each year the National Aeronautics and Space Administration generates
   millions of dollars worth of surplus personal property that is no
   longer needed by the U.S. Government.

   This property is sold competitively to the public through various types
   of sales, such as a sealed bid, spot bid, auction, or fixed price sale.
   Recyclable property is generally sold on a one year sealed bid term
   contract. Examples of recyclable materials are scrap metal and
   aluminum, used tires, used batteries, copper wire, wood pallets, etc.

   You may access information concerning our upcoming sales by clicking on
   the viewing options above. Sales information is also available by
   calling 321-867-7605.

   Sales are held at the Reutilization, Recycling and Marketing Facility
   (RRMF) on Ransom Road, off State Road 3 at Kennedy Space Center, Fl.
   Sealed Bid openings are held at Bldg. M6-1723 on State Road 3, Kennedy
   Space Center, FL.
