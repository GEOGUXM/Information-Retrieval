                  Instrument Incubator Program The Program
       The Instrument Incubator fosters the development of innovative
   remote-sensing concepts and the assessment of these concepts in ground,
      aircraft, or engineering model demonstrations. Because the Earth
      Science Enterprise is an evolving program, periodic NASA Research
      Announcements will solicit a wide range of instrument development
     activity that offers proposers flexibility in advancing instrument
                                development.
                                The Objective
   New and innovative technologies will lead to future flight instruments
     that are smaller, less resource intensive, less costly, and require
     less build time. Furthermore, by investing early in the development
     life cycle of an instrument and demonstrating performance in ground
    based or aircraft instrumentation, flight builds will also encounter
   less development risk and therefore less cost and schedule uncertainty.
                                The Strategy
    As promising new technologies emerge from core technology programs in
        government, private industry, university, or other non-profit
     organizations, proposers are encouraged to incorporate this latest
   technology into their instrument concepts. NRAs are expected to solicit
   some combination of feasibility studies; requirements analysis; design;
    construction of breadboards, prototypes, and engineering models; and
      laboratory and field demonstrations. Individual NRAs may focus on
      specific science questions or may address the whole Earth science
   program. The Program provides a continuing source of mature instrument
       designs merging state-of-the-art technologies with measurement
    objectives available for use in the next generation of Earth science
                                  missions.

Program Content Determined via NASA Research Announcements (NRA)

        A key element of the Instrument Incubator Program's strategy to
   infuse new and innovative technology into future remote-sensing
   instruments is the advanced studies and ground-based demonstration
   phase. NRA s are conducted regularly to ensure that a steady stream of
   instrument technologies is available for future Earth Science
   Enterprise measurement needs. This activity will be conducted by
   government, academic, and private industry research teams knowledgeable
   in remote-sensing and in situ measurement techniques that measure
   global variables of the Earth system that are selected via a peer
   reviewed process. The program encourages the use of the latest remote
   sensing technologies resulting from NASA's technology development
   programs as well as other government agencies and academic and private
   industry investments and combines them into new instrument systems and
   subsystems.

   entirety at the NASA Research Announcements website that is linked to
   the NASA Headquarters homepage.

FY98 NRA Projects

   The first IIP solicitation was a broad call which covered all five
   themes in the Mission to Planet Earth Science Research Plan. The NASA
   Research Announcement was released on April 20, 1998 and 27 awards were
   announced on October 1, 1998. Most of these IIP projects represent
   efforts to reduce cost, size, mass, and resource use of current
   measurement approaches. Several will enable or improve measurements
   which cannot be made satisfactorily today.

   There are projects addressing airborne in situ measurements of SO[2],
   NO[x], and other trace gases using laser-induced fluorescence and gas
   chromatography / mass spectrometry. Several approaches to altimetry are
   represented including a wide-swath interferometric radar, a delay
   Doppler phase radar, a microlaser, and a hybrid radiofrequency / laser
   approach. There is a project applying Global Positioning System (GPS)
   reflections to the measurement of altitude and ocean surface winds. Two
   lidar projects are looking at instrument technology to measure
   terrestrial laser-induced fluorescence and water vapor and aerosols.
   Limb sounding approaches from the ultraviolet to millimeter wave are
   represented, both active and passive, for measurement of ozone, water
   vapor, and other species. Infrared and microwave nadir sounders are
   included. There are a precipitation radar and microwave radiometers
   which cover various frequencies between 1 and 643 GHz. Finally, there
   are several imaging spectroradiometers covering various wavelengths
   from the visible to thermal infrared for measurement of atmospheric and
   surface properties.

   The first set of projects has start dates ranging from the December
   1998 to April 1999. The projects range in length from 1 to 3 years and
   will end between March 2000 and February 2002.

FY01 NRA Projects

   The second IIP solicitation was a call which covered all research areas
   in the Earth Science Enterprise Science Research Plan. The NASA
   Research Announcement was released on March 9, 2001 and 11 awards were
   announced on August 23, 2001. The selected proposals focus on near term
   investment to support high-priority measurements in the areas of:
   Atmospheric Chemistry: Troposhperic Profiles of O[3], CO, NO[x], Solid
   Earth: Topography and the Deformation of Land and Ice, Global Carbon
   Cycle: CO[2] Column Abundance and Profile, Global Water and Energy
   Cycle: Precipitation Rate, Tropospheric Winds, and Sea Surface Salinity
   / Soil Moisture and Climate Variability and Prediction: GPS Altimetry
   and Ocean Surface Winds.

   A project leveraging a selection from the first round of IIP will seek
   to develop an inflatable antenna structure and large beam scan
   capability for future precipitation radars. Microwave radiometry
   projects include the development of a synthetic aperture 10 GHz
   radiometer to be combined with 37 and 85 GHz radiometer using a 28 cm
   mechanically scanned offset reflector for rainfall detection and a
   project to develop a new receiver architecture for L-band microwave
   radiometers that performs digital processing prior to detection.
   Another project will develop ultra-stable radiometers for future sea
   surface salinity missions and develop a comprehensive mathematical
   model for optimizing radiometric stability.

   Radar technologies will be advanced by a project to develop a synthetic
   aperture radar operating at 420 MHz (UHF, P-band) and 118 MHz (VHF) for
   vegetation monitoring and deep soil penetration.
   An active approach to measuring carbon dioxide is represented in a
   project to develop heterodyne lasers that are line-locked on and off
   resonance of a line-of-site ground return. A Fabry-Perot Interferometer
   could achieve total column measurements of carbon dioxide by measuring
   spectral absorption of sunlight reflected by CO[2] in two channels.

   A project to develop a high spectral resolution Fabry-Perot
   interferometer designed for geosynchronous orbit has the potential for
   measuring tropospheric ozone and other trace gases, while a project to
   develop a suite of in situ spectroscopic instruments could provide
   collaborative tropospheric chemistry measurements for the Aura mission.
   Another project will investigate technologies for the measurement of
   far-infrared thermal radiation, an emerging science area not previously
   explored, with the potential to better understand the Earths radiation
   balance. Finally, a project to develop a compact, lightweight, precise
   magnetometer could potentially enable a means to study the structure
   and dynamics of the Earths interior, leading to better utilization of
   natural resources including water and land use and the mitigation of
   natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, flooding, sea level
   change, and severe storms.

Future IIP Emphasis

   Future Incubator solicitations will focus on specific areas of science
   or measurement technology, taking into account the ongoing set of IIP
   projects, the current science priorities, as reflected in the latest
   draft of the ESE Science Research Plan, the current set of future
   mission scenarios, and existing and planned technology partnerships.

   During calendar year 2003, the third Incubator solicitation will be
   released. This third solicitation will focus on the next generation of
   systematic and exploratory instruments to be launched in the 2008 to
   2010 timeframe. By mid-2002 the first set of Incubator projects will be
   complete, the second set will be underway, and the post-2002 mission
   composition will be much better defined. Gaps between measurement and
   technology needs and current and forecast capabilities will be analyzed
   to determine specific technology focus areas.
