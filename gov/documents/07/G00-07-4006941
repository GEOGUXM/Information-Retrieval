   It appears that you have JavaScript disabled (or not working) on your
   browser. Much of the user input validation (dates, etc) is done with
   JavaScript in the WebPacer application. This may or may not be a
   problem. If you want, you can enable JavaScript on Netscape's browsers
   by clicking on Edit, Preferences, Advanced and clicking ON the the
   "Enable JavaScript" checkbox. You should check with your administrator
   to be sure this is allowed by your organization.

   Please let us know if you encounter specific problems.

   Thess links will get you to the non-JavaScript login pages, but we can
   not ensure the further pages will work correctly due to the need for
   JavaScript.
