        Fire kills more Americans than all natural disasters combined. Every
        year more than 5,000 people die in fires, over 25,000 are injured, and
        direct property loss is estimated at over $9 billion. To help reduce
        the burden on US citizens, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory
        (BFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
        the United States Fire Administration are working together to improve
        the safety of our citizens from fire.

        NIST and USFA have teamed up to produce an on-line newsletter at
        FIRE.GOV that contains easy to read articles describing ongoing
        research activities around the world.  The newsletter contains contact
        information and links to the specific researchers and organizations
        involved in the research.
