                            Experimental Vaccines
            _____________________________________________________

   Development, and analysis of experimental vaccines form another ongoing
   significant research effort at SEPRL. Cooperative research agreements
   with commercial companies and universities to produce and evaluate
   effectiveness of experimental vaccines, including killed oil-emulsion
   and recombinant-virus vectored vaccines, and testing anti-viral mucosal
   immunity using orally delivered immunogens are some of the more recent
   research directions. Successful in ovo vaccination strategies with
   Newcastle disease preparations have yielded very promising results
   which should be readily extended to other pathogens and to commercial
   applications.
