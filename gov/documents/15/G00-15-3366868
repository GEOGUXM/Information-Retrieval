          Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program (SHARP):

    SHARP is an intensive 8-week science and engineering apprenticeship
    program for high school students. Students are assigned to work with a
    NASA mentor in a specific area of science or technology. Students are
    selected on the basis of having shown the aptitude and interest in
    science and engineering careers. Please click on the above link for
    more information (this website is outside of the NASA domain).

                                  SHARP Plus:

    The NASA Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program (SHARP)
    Plus is a research-based mentorship program that was initiated in 1993.
    It is conducted by the QEM Network for NASA and is the residential
    analogue of the NASA SHARP Program, a commuting program that takes
    place at NASA field centers. NASA SHARP Plus apprentices participate in
    an intensive eight-week research program and live on a college campus.
    In contrast to SHARP, the SHARP Plus research experiences occur in
    industry or in laboratories at universities that host SHARP Plus
    apprentices on their campuses. SHARP Plus sites are institutions with a
    demonstrated commitment to high quality mathematics, science, and
    engineering (MSE) education for all students. For more information,
    please e-mail the SHARP Plus program.

                   NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP):

    The NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP) is a national program of
    investigations and design challenges. NSIP links students directly with
    NASA's diverse and exciting missions of research, exploration, and
    discovery. By participating in these competitions and learning
    activities, students design space missions, investigate Earth from
    space, explore Earth systems in their neighborhood, and learn about the
    latest developments in aeronautics, and Earth and space exploration.

                                                                           *

                                  MATHCOUNTS:

    MATHCOUNTS is an annual mathematics competition for 7th and 8th graders
    that promotes strategic problem solving, and challenges students to
    sharpen their analytical abilities. Teams and individuals participate
    in a series of written and oral competitions at the chapter, state, and
    national levels.

                                                                           *

    Offered through the Virginia Department of Education, the Virginia
    Governor's School program, hosted by NASA Langley, encourages high
    school students to explore their interest in aerospace through a five
    week mentorship program. Students are exposed to research in the areas
    of aeronautics, atmospheric, space and computer science with emphasis
    on physics and mathematical problem-solving.

                                                                           *

    Hampton CHROME: Cooperating Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities
                                in Engineering

    CHROME is a partnership of business/industry, government agencies,
    institutions of higher education, school systems, and civic and
    professional associations. The mission of CHROME is to increase
    opportunities for underrepresented minority and female students to
    enter science, mathematics, engineering and related technical fields.
    CHROME serves the greater Hampton Roads area as a planning,
    coordinating, and advocacy organization designed to complement the
    educational programs of school systems. For more information, please
    visit the CHROME web site (this link is outside the NASA domain).

          Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars Program (LARSS):

    The Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars Program was established
    in 1986 by Dr. Samuel E. Massenberg for the benefit of undergraduate
    juniors and seniors and first-year graduate students who are pursuing
    degrees in aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical
    engineering, materials science, computer science, atmospheric science,
    astrophysics, physics, chemistry, or selected space disciplines of
    interest to Langley Research Center. Approximately 100 students will be
    selected each year for a 10-week period of research under the
    supervision of a NASA mentor. Each student will be awarded a
    scholarship of $4,500 for their summer experience.

                                                                           *

                 Graduate Student Researchers Program (GSRP):

    In 1980, NASA initiated the Graduate Student Researchers Program (GSRP)
    to cultivate additional research ties to the academic community and to
    support a culturally diverse group of students pursuing advanced
    degrees in science and engineering. Fellowships of up to $22,000 are
    awarded for one year and are renewable for a total of three years.
    Fellowship funding consists of a $16,000 student stipend, a $3,000
    Student allowance (used for student travel expenses to and from the
    Center), and a $3,000 University allowance (used for Faculty Advisor
    travel expenses to and from the Center). Approximately 400 graduate
    students are supported by this program each year. Please click on the
    link above to go to the GSRP website. If you would like more
    information about GSRP opportunities at NASA Langley, contact Mr. Lloyd
    Evans.
