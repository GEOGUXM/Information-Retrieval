  Prior Announcement

   During the past year the NSO activity has focused on the design of a
   compact high field tokamak as a potential next step in the U.S.
   Magnetic Fusion program. Discussions held at Snowmass and at a series
   of talks throughout the community have helped to identify the mission
   and issues that a next step experiment should be designed to address.
   The present design concept is the Fusion Ignition Research Experiment
   (FIRE). Background material on the FIRE Physics Program and Engineering
   Design, burning plasma experiments and fusion can be found at the FIRE
   home page.

   A number of physics issues have been identified that have high impact
   on the FIRE design and are generic to Next Step Options. These include:
   power and particle handling in the divertor, disruption
   characterization and amelioration, incorporation of AT modes, H-mode
   power threshold scaling, sustainment of high performance, and others to
   be developed during the workshop. The goal of the FIRE Physics Workshop
   is to understand and assess physics issues driving the FIRE design, and
   to develop a near term plan to address these issues. A general layout
   of the FIRE schedule for the next two years is aimed at being ready to
   start Conceptual Design of a Next Step Option at the beginning of FY
   2002. We anticipate the formation of a FIRE Program Advisory Committee
   with a first meeting in July 2000 to lead into finalization of the the
   FIRE Preconceptual Engineering Design and Cost estimate in July. This
   to be followed by peer reviews of the engineering and costing. Note
   that a FESAC review of Next Step Options is also being planned for this
   fiscal year.

  Agenda for the FIRE Physics Workshop

   If you have any questions or comments about the agenda and technical
   discussions, please send email to Steve Jardin or Dale Meade. We will
   update the agenda and add a section on this page with additional
   background information for the workshop prior to the meeting. We will
   also post the presentations and conclusions of the workshop after the
   meeting.

  Background Technical Information for the FIRE Physics Workshop

   We are posting background technical information for people to study
   prior to the workshop. This will be rapidly evolving. Please send
   suggestions for information or you contribution for posting as an email
   attachment to Dale Meade.

  Remote Participation

   The FIRE Physics Workshop audio and video of the conference room will
   be broadcast using RealPlayer technology. This video lets you see only
   the general layout of the conference room. It does not allow you to
   read the VGs. The address for the RealPlayer broadcast will be fire.rm
   We recommend RealPlayer (version 6 or higher) and that you check it out
   this week. If you have difficulties and need help, call 609-243-2275 or
   email help@pppl.gov.

   The vu-graphs will be broadcast on the B318 showstation: With a
   browser, connect to Fire Show Station The name is fire and the password
   will be fire. All lower case.

   We have established an ethernet connection to simulate a real time Chat
   Room in the conference room. You can email comments and VGs for
   presentation to fire@pppl.gov. The mail will be checked every minute
   and relayed to the session chair or discussion leader for presentation.

   A limited number of call in lines are available by which remote
   participants can ask questions directly. When you want to ask a
   question please dial 609-243-2822, wait for the beep, then enter the
   four digit pass code. This takes about 20 seconds, you can then ask
   your question, and enter the discussion. When not actively involved in
   the discussion, please hang up so others can call in and ask their
   question. This will work if people don't hang on the line. Note, this
   is not an 800 number. If you want to use one of the rotating call-in
   lines send an email to fire@pppl.gov and we will email you the pass
   code by early Monday morning.

   If you want to send a CHIT (question or comment) to a particular
   speaker or individual, send an email to fire@pppl.gov. All chits will
   be recorded and you will be sent a response.

  Location

   The Workshop will be held at PPPL in room LSB-318 (old TFTR conference
   room) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday May 1-3, 2000. Please contact
   Autumn Percival at 609-243-2653 (FAX: 609-243-3315) or email Autumn
   Percival if you are planning to attend.

  Lodging

   A block of rooms has been reserved at the Princeton Residence Inn (3.5
   miles North of PPPL on US-1) for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights
   (April 30 and May 1-2, 2000). The rate is $99.00. Please call the hotel
   (609-683-0001) to reserve and guarantee your room. The block of rooms
   is reserved in the name of FIRE Workshop.
