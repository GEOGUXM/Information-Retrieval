   [dgreen.gif] Environmental Applications
   Numerical modeling of subsurface contaminant transport in both vapor
   and liquid phases.
   [dgreen.gif] Inverse Problems in the Earth Sciences
   Create simulations to help study the flow of fluids (air, water and
   contaminants) through porous media.
   [dgreen.gif] GIS
   The GIS team's primary role is to provide information management,
   analysis and display capabilities in support of LANL's Environmental
   Restoration Program.
   [dgreen.gif] Magmatic and Planetary Dynamics
   Computational and field studies related to mantle processes and
   magmatism.
   [dgreen.gif] Gas & Oil
   Projects range from pore-scale (micro-scale) analyses to field-scale
   (macro-scale) analyses.
   [dgreen.gif] Pore Scale Processes
   Studies focus on the effects of surfactants on the surface tention, and
   wettability agents
   [dgreen.gif] Geodynamics
   Develops computer codes and material models for dynamic problems
   involving geo-materials.
   [dgreen.gif] Porous Media Flow Code Development
   Development, modification, and support of sophisticated numerical
   simulation codes for subsurface transport processes.
   [dgreen.gif] Yucca Mountain Project
   Site-Scale Unsaturated Zone Transport Model.
   [dgreen.gif] Busted Butte
   UnSaturated Zone Transport Test (UZTT)
