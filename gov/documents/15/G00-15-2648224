                SPECIAL NOTE: Please be advised that SunOS 4.1.3 platforms
                are running GCG 7.3 and hence are using very old version
                of databanks.

        GDE Version 2.2a dated November 28, 1993:
                The Genetic Data Environment is part of a growing set of
                programs for manipulating and analyzing "genetic" data. It
                differs in design from other analysis programs in that it
                is intended to be an expandable and customizable system,
                while still being easy to use. GDE provides an X Windows
                based GUI to a large number of publicly available programs
                for sequence analysis. The software used SUN's XVIEW,
                efforts are underway to port the software to MOTIF.

                Sequence analysis functions included with this package:

               o ClustalV (cluster multiple sequence alignment)
               o MFOLD (RNA secondary prediction)
               o Blast (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
               o FastA (Similarity Search)
               o Assemble Contigs (CAP Contig Assembly Program)
               o Lsadt (Least squares additive tree analysis)
               o Count (distance matrix calculator)
               o Treetool (Tree drawing/manipulation)
               o Readseq (format conversion program)

                GDE itself was developed by Steve Smith, currently with
                Millipore Imaging Systems. Numerous others provided or
                contributed to the individual analysis programs included
                with GDE.

                GDE 2.2 manual is available both in text and postscript
                format. Also, Lachlan Bell of Daresbury Laboratory,
                Warrington in U.K. maintains a HTML document for GDE.

                The following paper (to appear in CABIOS), contains
                information describing GDE and it's development.

    2. Genetic Mapping Tools/Utilities

        CRI-MAP Version 2.4 dated March 17, 1994:
                The main purpose of CRI-MAP is to allow rapid, largely
                automated construction of multilocus linkage maps (and
                facilitate the attendant tasks of assessing support
                relative to alternative locus orders, generating LOD
                tables, and detecting data errors).

                Crimap is developed by Phil Green of Dept. of Genetics,
                Washington University School of Medicine.

                CRI-MAP 2.4 documentation is available in text, HTML and

    3. BIMAS Genetic Linkage Analysis Tools
    4. Primer Selection Tools

        OSP dated November 11, 1991:
                Oligo Selection Program (OSP) is a computer program
                developed to aid in selecting oligonucleotide primers for
                DNA sequencing and for the polymerase chain reaction. OSP
                allows the user to specify (or use default) constraints
                for primer and amplified product lengths, %G+C contents,
                and (absolute or relative) melting temperatures; for
                primer 3' nucleotides; and for the maximum allowable
                primer-self, primer-primer, and primer-product annealing
                propensities. Candidate primer sequences are screened
                against a user-supplied data set of other sequences (e.g.
                repetitive element or vector sequences) to help minimize
                the possibility of non-specific priming. Primers meeting
                all constraints are ranked and displayed in order of
                increasing overall `score', which is a user-definable
                weighted sum of the above parameter values.

                osp is a text-only version and ospX is having an
                interactive X windows graphic interface. These programs
                are developed by LaDeana Hillier and Phil Green at
                Washington University Medical School, St. Louis.

                Additional information of osp can be found in:

        Primer Version 0.5 dated April 27, 1992:
                PRIMER is a computer program for automatically selecting
                PCR primers. PRIMER tests oligos for annealing
                temperature, complementarity to genomic repeat sequences
                (e.g. Alu), ability to form primer-dimer, and other
                criteria. Importantly, PRIMER's annealing temperature
                calculation is based on thermodynamic parameters (with the
                base stacking term dominant), and is far more accurate
                than calculations based on GC/AT ratios.

                PRIMER was developed and produced by Steve Lincoln, Mark
                Daly, and Eric Lander of MIT center for Genome Research
                and Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.

                PRIMER manual can be read on-line. More information about
                Primer software can be obtained from MIT Genome Center.

    5. Sequence Similarity, DB Search Tools

        Blast Output Browser dated August 22, 1994:
                Blast Output Browser, BoB, is an an X window application
                to browse through blast output results from either NCBI
                Blast server, DNA workbench server or the BLITZ email
                server in an environment where a lot of BLAST processing
                is done (for example in cDNA projects). One or two blast
                output results can be browsed simultaneously. While
                browsing through results, you can immediately view
                alignments, blast results file, and also the actual
                database entry.

                BoB program is developed by John Powell and Rao Parasa of
                CIT at NIH and is available in the public domain by
                anonymous ftp from ftp-bimas.dcrt.nih.gov.

                User's guide and man page are available for BoB.

                Availability: SunOS 4.1.3 platforms and helix.

        CLUSTAL W version 1.4 dated September 23, 1994:
                Clustal W is a general purpose multiple alignment program
                for DNA or proteins.

                Multiple alignments are carried out in 3 stages:

              1. All pairs of sequences are aligned separately (pairwise
                 alignments) in order to calculate a distance matrix
                 giving the divergence of each pair of sequences;
              2. A guide tree (like a phylogenetic tree) is constructed
                 from the distance matrix;
              3. The sequences are progressively aligned according to the
                 branch order in the guide tree.

                Clustalw program is a major update and rewrite of clustalv
                program, distributed with GDE (Genetic Data Environment)
                package. Clustalw is produced by Julie D. Thompson, Toby
                Gibson of European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany
                and Desmond Higgins of European Bioinformatics Institute,
                Cambridge, UK. Algorithmic improvements over clustalv:

              1. Individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a
                 partial alignment in order to downweight near-duplicate
                 sequences and upweight the most divergent ones.
              2. Amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different
                 alignment stages according to the divergence of the
                 sequences to be aligned.
              3. Residue specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap
                 penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in
                 potential loop regions rather than regular secondary
                 structure.
              4. Positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened
                 receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the
                 opening up of new gaps at these positions.

        Local BLAST dated March 03, 1994:
                BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is the heuristic
                search algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn,
                blastx, tblastn, tblastx and blast3.

                NOTE: To differentiate the local BLAST programs from their
                network counterpart, an 'l' is prepended to the name of
                each local blast program.

                The programs are used for the following purposes:

               o lblastp - to compare an amino acid query sequence vs. a
                 protein sequence database.
               o lblastn - to compare a nucleotide query sequence vs. a
                 nucleotide sequence database.
               o lblastx - to compare a nucleotide query sequence
                 translated in all reading frames vs. a protein sequence
                 database.
               o ltblastn - to compare a protein query sequence vs. a
                 nucleotide sequence database dynamically translated in
                 all reading frames.
               o ltblastx - to compare a nucleotide query sequence
                 translated in all reading frames vs. a nucleotide
                 sequence database translated in all reading frames.
               o lblast3 - protein database search for three-way
                 alignments, using the BLAST pairwise search algorithm.

                Databases to be searched by local blast programs must
                first be processed either by the program setdb for protein
                sequence databases (re: blastp and blastx) or the program
                pressdb for nucleotide sequence databases (re: blastn,
                tblastn and tblastx). The input database format is
                FASTA/Pearson.

                Point accepted mutation (PAM) matrices of various
                generations can be produced automatically with the pam
                program. The output can be saved in a file whose name is
                then specified in the M=filename option of a blastp,
                blastx, or tblastn query. Also various BLOSUM matrices are
                supplied.

                BLAST programs are developed at the NCBI, NIH. Complete
                information about BLAST is available from BLAST notebook

                NOTE: NO LOCAL DATABASES ARE PROVIDED. Network BLAST (or
                BLAST2) is the recommended BLAST for searches against the
                public databases.

        BLAST2 dated July 26, 1996:
                BLAST2 programs, successor of Network BlAST programs, are
                rapid sequence database search programs using the BLAST
                algorithm. The network blast provides a client set of
                programs which access the NCBI BLAST server, which in
                turn, performs the actual search of the databases. BLAST2
                utilizes a general service discovery and request facility
                called Dispatcher (from network entrez concept). Network
                BLAST is the recommended BLAST for searches against the
                public databases.

                BLAST2 programs are developed at the National Center for
                Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the
                National Library of Medicine (NLM).

        SIM dated May 05, 1992:
                SIM is a program for finding local similarities using
                dynamic programming techniques. This program finds
                non-intersecting alignments between two sequences or
                within one sequence. The alignments are reported in order
                of similarity score, with the highest scoring alignment
                first.

    6. Sequence Database Access Tools

        GDB Interface
                GDB/OMIM is front-end software for Human Genome Database
                hosted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,
                Baltimore. GDB (Genome Database) is a consensus database
                to support mapping effort through international
                collaboration and is updated continuously. Data is taken
                from:

               o Literature and other databases
               o Human Genome Mapping Workshops
               o Chromosome-specific Workshops
               o Genome Centers and National Laboratories
               o GDB Editors
               o Direct Author Submission

                GDB uses the SYBASE database management system licensed
                from Sybase, Inc., Emeryville, California and requires
                OpenClient Library License for the front-end.

                OMIM is the continuously updated online version of Dr.
                Victor A. McKusick's catalog MENDELIAN INHERITANCE IN MAN
                (MIM). Because this knowledge-base is updated daily, the
                entries may differ from the most recently published
                version of the book. MIM catalog contains Autosomal
                Dominant, Autosomal Recessive, X-Linked, Y-Linked, and
                Mitochondrial Phenotype modes of inheritance. OMIM comes
                with an IRx Information Retrieval System that is currently
                being developed by the Information Technology Branch of
                the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical
                Communications at the National Library of Medicine.

                More information about GDB and OMIM can be read from GDB
                Homepage at Johns Hopkins University. Also, there is an
                on-line course about GDB and OMIM by David Featherston.

        Network Entrez 5.002 dated July 26, 1996:
                Entrez is a molecular sequence retrival system devloped at
                NCBI, a division of the National Library of Medicine
                (NLM). Entrez porvides an integrated approach for gaining
                access to nucleotide and protein sequence information, to
                the MEDLINE citations in which the sequences were
                published, and to a sequence-associated subset of MEDLINE.
                The sequence records are derived from a variety of
                database sources, including GenBank, EMBL, DDJB, PIR,
                SWISS-PROT, PRF and PDB.

                Network Entrez is a client program, which requires a
                network server to access the databases. The Network Entrez
                installed on ALW workstations uses the NCBI network
                servers for accessing the databases.

                More information about Entrez Browser is available from
                NCBI.

    7. Sequence Analysis Tools

        Signal Scan Version 4.05 dated March 15, 1996:
                Signal scan is a program developed to facilitate the
                analysis of DNA sequences for known eukaryotic signals. It
                incorporates the data from Dr. David Ghosh's
                Transcriptional Factor Database. What SIGNAL SCAN does is
                to find homologies of published signal sequences in your
                sequence, most of these being transcriptional elements. It
                cannot, at this time, predict what it finds has any
                meaning. The interpretation of those results are up to
                you. Most signal elements found probably will not have any
                meaning, as the elements are in the wrong milieu, wrong
                cell type, or wrong organism. Consequently, there will be
                many more erroneous signals found by SIGNAL SCAN than
                significant ones.

                Sigscan program is developed and produced by Dan S.
                Prestridge of University of Minnesota at St. Paul
                (danp@molbio.umn.edu). Although it is free, it is

                xgrail is a client-server implementation of a group of
                analysis tools for sequence exploration and gene
                discovery. This package allows the user to find protein
                coding regions in anonymous DNA sequences, to assemble
                gene models, translate part or all of these models, and
                search these translations against various databases. It
                also provides information about GC content, functional
                site identification (splice junctions, poly A sites, Pol
                II promoters, and CpG Islands) and the location of a
                variety of repetitive DNA sequences.
