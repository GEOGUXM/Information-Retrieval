                 Search Page - Catalog of Infrared Observations

     * There are three ways to interactively access the data in the
       on-line Catalog:
         1. Browse the Catalog (scroll through the Catalog listings)
         2. Access the Catalog data by source name
         3. Search the Catalog listings by specifying
            position/wavelength/flux

     * You can access the database of bibliographic references for each
       Catalog data entry:

1. Browse the Catalog Listings:

   Use this option to browse through the main Catalog listings, as if
   reading a book. This is by far the simplest way to access the infrared
   database without complicated search procedures. To open the Catalog,
   click a green button below. The Catalog listings for that hour of RA
   will be displayed. You can scroll up and down through the listings
   using the mouse or the up/down arrow keys.

   Select an hour of RA as a starting point:

   [00] [01] [02] [03] [04] [05] [06] [07] [08] [09] [10] [11]
   [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [no pos.]

2. Access the Catalog Data by Source Name:

   It can be difficult to locate a source in the Catalog simply by typing
   its name, because source names and spellings are not standardized, and
   names are often abbreviated in the database. However, all of the object
   names contained in the database are listed alphabetically in an Atlas
   of Infrared Sources, which is a supporting tool built into the Catalog.
   Two effective ways of finding an object in the Catalog by name using
   the Atlas are provided here:

   a) "Open" the Catalog to the page containing the source name of
   interest: Click on the red button to find the source name in the Atlas.
   The Atlas name listed is a link to the source location in the Catalog.
   Click on the link to display the Catalog page containing the source,
   then you can scroll up and down to identify all records for that
   source. This option provides an efficient way to find the source in the
   Catalog.

   [Locate Source]



   b) Create a summary of Catalog data for the source name of interest:
   You can restrict the search results to those records falling within 2
   arcminutes of the source of interest and create a shorter list of
   records for sources within that search area, by using the green button
   below. Choose a source name to generate a summary of the observations
   within a small region of sky around that source. This option returns
   Catalog listings for all sources within 2 arcminutes of RA and Dec,
   including observations of other sources in the region.

3. Search the Catalog Listings by Specifying Position/Wavelength/Flux:

   This search option creates a summary of all Catalog database records
   meeting the search criteria you establish below.

   Any one (or any combination) of the search fields below can be used to
   limit your search. It is not necessary to specify all fields. For
   example, if the Right Ascension, Declination and R.A./DEC range are not
   specified, the entire sky will be searched. This will result in a
   longer search time, but will result in a complete survey based on the
   specified parameters. Click on SEARCH PARAMETER HELP or the individual
   links below for an explanation of the format of each search parameter.

              Right Ascension (hh mm ss, or hh mm, or
   hh):
   __________ Search Clear Form

   R.A. Search Range:
   ± 1___ [sec (R.A.)]
   You may change the value by typing any range.

   Declination (±dd mm ss, or ±dd mm, or ±dd):
   _________
   Dec. Search Range:
   ± 10__ [arcsec_]
   You may change the value by typing any range.

   [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] THE EQUINOX OPTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
   Equinox: 1950

   At the present time the Catalog uses equinox 1950 coordinates. An
   option to enter positions based on a different equinox and return the
   search results in the equinox specified will be implemented in the
   future.**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

   Wavelength:

   Enter the range limits of the wavelength search in the two boxes below.
   To restrict the search to a single wavelength, enter it in the From
   box. To search over a range of wavelenghts, enter beginning and ending
   values in the FROM and TO boxes. A search over a range of wavelengths
   is *NON-INCLUSIVE*. For examples and options, click on Wavelength Help.

   From: _______ µm
     To: _______ µm

   Flux:

   Enter the range limits of the flux search in the two boxes below. To
   restrict the search to a single flux, enter it in the From box. To
   search over a range of fluxes, enter beginning and ending values in the
   FROM and TO boxes. A search over a range of fluxes is *NON-INCLUSIVE*.
   For examples and options, click on Flux Help.

   From: _____ (Units of flux can be specified below.) Search Clear Form
      To: _____

   Units of Flux:

   NOTE: A search can be made for data in specific UNITS without
   specifying the FLUX (above).

   The vast majority of units listed in the Catalog are either Magnitudes
   or Janskys. If you don't specify the UNITS OF FLUX the search will
   return all listings, however, most will be either Magnitudes or Janskys
   with only a few of the less commonly used units. The less commonly used
   units are identified below, and explained further in Units Help.

   Relative Intensity (Magnitudes):
   [ ] M = Magnitudes
   [Other less commonly used units:__]         Brightness:
                                               [ ] B = 10^-19 W m^-2 Hz^-1 Sr^-1
                                               [Other less commonly used units:]
   Flux Density (Janskys, etc.):
   [ ] J = 1 Jansky = 10^-26 W m^-2 Hz^-1
   [ ] F = 10^-16 W cm^-2 µm^-1
   [Other less commonly used units:__________] Flux:
                                               [ ] X = 10^-18 W cm^-2
                                               [Other less commonly used units:]
   Miscellaneous:
   [Other types of observations:]

4. Search the Bibliography:

   a. Search by First Author:
   You can view the collection of journal articles from which the Catalog
   data were obtained, arranged alphabetically by first author. Select the
   button corresponding to the first author's last name:

   [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L] [M]
   [N] [O] [P] [Q] [R] [S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X] [Y] [Z]

   b. Search by Bibliographic Reference Number:
   You can find a complete bibliographic reference (author, title,
   journal, etc.) for any bibliographic reference number, such as one
   found while browsing the Catalog (Search Option 1 above). Type in the
   6-digit bibliographic reference number which identifies the journal
   article.

   Enter 6-digit "BIBLIO" Reference Number from Catalog listings: ______
   Search Clear

   For an explanation of the bibliographic reference number, click on
   Bibliographic Reference Number Help.
