   RFP for SIM Grid Star Verification Program NEW
   SIM requires a grid of about 1300 stable reference stars in order to
   meet its astrometric performance goals. The establishment of this grid
   requires ground-based precision radial velocity measurements (to about
   20 m/s) to characterize the candidate stars. These observations must be
   started well before SIM launch, and continued for several years.

   The SIM Project plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for this
   work in the spring of 2002. A draft (dated December 21, 2001) is
   available for comment by anyone interested in proposing. For further
   information on the RFP, please contact Michael Shao, SIM Project
   Scientist, or Stephen Unwin, SIM Deputy Project Scientist.

   SIM Preparatory Science Program (NRA 99-OSS-04)
   A second NRA NRA 99-OSS-04 under the SIM Preparatory Science Program
   was released in 1999, and awards were made in March 2000. This NRA was
   funded jointly with the National Science Foundation. NASA is
   considering further NRAs under this program. The following proposals
   were selected to receive awards.
