   Welcome to the USGS-BRD Kid's Corner! USGS BRD Features

   Hey Kids! Thanks for dropping by. There's all kinds of fun stuff to do
   here for preschoolers on up. We have games, coloring pages, stories,
   and lots of information about living things (which is what biology is
   all about). Have fun and don't forget to check out the Learning Room
   too!

                       quizzes coloring pages stories
                    fun projects games other kid's links

   By the way, we'd like to add more fun stuff to this site, but we need
   your help! Send us an email and tell us your animal or plant jokes,
   poems, projects, links, or other things you'd like to see here. We'd
   also love to see GIF or JPEG images of your artwork. Please ask your
   parents to email your stuff to the biologywebteam@usgs.gov and you
   might see your submissions appear here! Sorry, but we can't accept
   submissions without your parents knowledge and permission, so please
   ask them to send your stuff for you.

   We are also interested in your comments on this site. Please let us
   know what you think by emailing your comments to the
   biologywebteam@usgs.gov.
