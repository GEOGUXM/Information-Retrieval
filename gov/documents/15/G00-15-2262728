                          Helping people find work

        In addition to helping workers and their families, the
   Unemployment Insurance programs play a key role in helping businesses,
   communities, and the nation's economy. It was created in 1935 in
   response to the Great Depression, when millions of people lost jobs.
   They couldn't buy goods and services, which contributed to more
   layoffs.
        Now, as then, the program helps cushion the impact of economic
   downturns and brings economic stability to communities, states, and the
   nation by providing temporary income support for laid off workers.
