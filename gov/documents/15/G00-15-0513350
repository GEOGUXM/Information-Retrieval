   ARTICLE C.1 BACKGROUND

   Stimulating electrodes that are in close contact with peripheral nerves
   as well as epimysial and intramuscular electrodes that stimulate nearby
   nerve branches are being used singly or in combination in a variety of
   clinical applications of functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS)
   including feasibility studies of hand grasp, standing and walking,
   bladder and bowel evacuation, and breathing. Although limited
   restoration of function is achieved with currently available
   electrodes, electrode performance continues to limit the utility of FNS
   systems and this prevents their more widespread application in
   neurologically disabled individuals. Each electrode has limitations
   that make safe, stable, selective, graded, length-independent
   activation of specific muscles difficult to achieve in FNS.

   The objective of this research is to develop stimulating electrodes
   suitable for chronic FNS in humans that permit safe, reliable, graded
   activation of selected muscles. In order to encourage the broadest
   competition, the particular type of electrode and the muscles to be
   activated are not specified. The offeror will define this focus in
   association with a collaborating clinical research group. The research
   will concentrate on developing electrodes that are capable of
   selectively activating specific functional muscle groups required by
   the collaborating clinical group. Offerors are encouraged to consider
   innovative approaches to the design of electrodes with a focus on
   obtaining reliable, selective, controlled, graded stimulation. Human
   studies are not a part of this proposed research but it is expected
   that the research effort will conclude at a point where human studies
   will be the next logical step.

   This contract represents a competitive renewal of an ongoing NINDS
   contract (NS3-2300). A current bibliography listing publications
   resulting from NPP studies on FNS and related studies is available free
   of charge from the Neural Prosthesis Program, NIH, Federal Building,
   Room 916, Bethesda, MD 20892-9170.

   ARTICLE C.2. STATEMENT OF WORK

   I. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to design, fabricate, and test, in an
   animal model, electrodes for use in functional neuromuscular
   stimulation (FNS) systems. This work shall be done in collaboration
   with a group actively involved in a clinical FNS investigation but this
   contract will not support the clinical program. Chimpanzees shall be
   excluded as a potential research animal.

   Specifically the contractor shall:

   A. Identify a collaborating clinical group, determine with them the
   limitations of currently available electrodes for their FNS
   application, and propose approaches to overcome these limitations.

   B. Design and fabricate new electrodes and leads to functionally
   activate muscles identified in (A). Any electrode design must consider
   the safety and reliability requirements implicit in the development of
   an electrode for rehabilitation use in humans. Special consideration
   shall be given to:

   1. the selectivity of muscle activation with a goal of full activation
   of the target muscle with minimal spillover of stimulation to other
   anatomical muscles or afferent nerves

   2. the stability of the activation response over the full range of
   motion of the muscle and the stability of the activation response over
   time

   3. the dynamic force range of muscle activation with the goal of
   producing a range of forces comparable to the normal physiological
   range.

   C. Evaluate the electrodes developed in (B) in a suitable animal model
   of the proposed application(s) and determine how they function relative
   to the performance goals specified in (B).

   D. Based on the results of (C) design improved electrodes as needed.

   E. By the end of the contract period, in collaboration with the
   clinical group, determine whether the electrodes developed are ready
   for human feasibility testing. If they are not ready, outline further
   development, testing and/or performance characteristics that must be
   achieved. If they are ready, outline a plan for human feasibility
   testing.

   F. Cooperate with other Neural Prosthesis Program investigators by
   fabricating and delivering at least 15 of the most promising electrodes
   to other investigators for evaluation by the end of the third year of
   the contract.
