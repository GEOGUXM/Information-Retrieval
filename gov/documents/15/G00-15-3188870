   Human Participant Protections Education for Research Teams.

   The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to improve
   human health through biomedical and behavioral research.  Conducting
   research involving human participants^* is a necessary and important
   part of that mission.  Therefore, the NIH is committed to assuring that
   all of its research activities involving human participants are
   conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare.

   This tutorial is intended for use by those involved in the design and
   conduct of research involving human participants, including:
     * Biomedical and behavioral researchers,
     * Nurses and data managers who are part of the research team.

   This tutorial presents common concepts, principles, and issues related
   to protection of human participants.  The information presented is
   neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and is intended to act as a
   companion piece to your institutional policy, as well as local, state,
   and federal regulations applicable to human research.  The tutorial
   will help you and your team identify research activities that involve
   human participants, and help you understand how to protect the rights
   and welfare of all human participants involved in research.
