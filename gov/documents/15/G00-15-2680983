           HRSA Supports Newborn Screening Expansion in California

   A new state law in California expands newborn screening for three
   additional groups of disorders through a HRSA-supported pilot program.
   The program relies on new technology capable of screening for dozens of
   potential health problems.

   Screening detects disorders in newborns that, left untreated, can cause
   death, disability, mental retardation and other serious illnesses.  The
   new technology -- called tandem mass spectrometry -- will expand
   testing to screen for up to 30 fatty acid, amino acid and organic acid
   disorders.  These disorders involve, for example, newborns inability to
   convert fat to blood sugar and the production of toxic substances when
   they digest proteins.

   Previously, California only screened for four genetic and metabolic
   disorders controllable by diet management, those affecting growth and
   development, and blood disorders that involve the improper makeup of
   hemoglobin, the respiratory pigment in red blood cells containing iron.

   HRSA and Californias public health department jointly fund the Tandem
   Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) Evaluation Project.  It teaches parents about
   enhanced testing and allows them to enroll their babies in supplemental
   screenings at no extra cost.  MS/MS analysis is based on the blood-spot
   test already taken routinely at birth.  The pilot program will continue
   for a year to a year and a half, with local health care providers and
   hospitals participating.

   HRSAs Maternal and Child Health Bureau supports newborn screening
   activities in California and nationwide. For more information on
