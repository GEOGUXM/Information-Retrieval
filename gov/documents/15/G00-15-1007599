      The Regulatory Support Division, AFS-600, is a Federal Aviation
      Administration (FAA), Washington D.C. Headquarters Office located at
      the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      The Division is composed of five branches who promote safety by
      providing the aviation community with the highest level of services and
      systems. We educate, advise, enlighten, and empower users to save lives
      through the development, implementation, analysis and dissemination of
      technical information. This encompasses airmen testing, designee
      standardization, aircraft certification and maintenance, aviation
      safety data systems, and management of the information technology
      infrastructure.

      Our customers include Flight Standards Service, Aircraft Certification
      Service, private industry, as well as the public. The division actively
      participates in The National Examiner Board (NEB), which screens and
      rates applications of persons who wish to be Designated Pilot Examiners
      (DPEs), Designated Mechanic Examiners (DMEs), Designated Parachute
      Rigger Examiners (DPREs), and ultimately provides the local Flight
      Standards District Offices (FSDO) with lists of qualified candidates
      for selection as examiners.
