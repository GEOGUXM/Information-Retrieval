                        Welcome to the BeppoSAX Mission
                                  Home Page

     The X-ray astronomy satellite BeppoSAX (Satellite per Astronomia X,
     "Beppo" in honor of Giuseppe Occhialini), is a project of the
     Italian Space Agency (ASI) with participation of the Netherlands
     Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR). The main scientific
     characteristic of the BeppoSAX mission is the wide spectral
     coverage, ranging from 0.1 to over 200 keV. BeppoSAX has been
     developed with the support of a consortium of institutes in Italy
     and in The Netherlands and of the Space Science Department of ESA
     (SSD). A collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for
     Extraterrestrial Physics also exists for X-ray mirror testing and
     the calibration of the concentrator/spectrometer system. Prime
     contractors for space and ground segments are Alenia Spazio and
     Telespazio respectively.

     As of January 2002 about 1400 BeppoSAX scientific publications have
     appeared in the literature. A comparison of the BeppoSAX publication
     rate with that of other astronomy satellites is available here
