   The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982   established the Office of
   Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) within the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE) to develop and manage a Federal system for
   disposing of all spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors
   and high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomic energy defense
   activities.  The statute provides detailed direction for the
   scientific, technical, and institutional development of the system, and
   it requires that waste management facilities be licensed by the U.S.
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

   The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 directed  DOE to
   characterize only Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine its suitability
   as a repository site for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and
   high-level radioactive waste.
