                Sentencing Changes for Certain Sex Offenders
                 Third Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6151
          AN ACT Relating to the Management of Sex Offenders in the
                Civil Commitment and Criminal Justice Systems


   During the 2001 Second Special Session, the Washington State
   Legislature enacted 3ESSB 6151 The Management of Sex Offenders in the
   Civil Commitment and Criminal Justice Systems.  Essentially, any
   offender, who is not a persistent offender, who is sentenced for any
   one of the offenses enumerated in RCW 9.94A.712(1)(a)(i) or (ii), or an
   attempt to commit any of those offenses, or is convicted of any sex
   offense, except failure to register, and has a prior conviction for a
   two-strike offense under RCW 9.94A.030(32)(b), is to receive an
   indeterminate sentence.  The only exception is for offenders seventeen
   years old or younger at the time of the offense who are sentenced for
   rape of a child in the first degree, rape of a child in the second
   degree or child molestation in the first degree.

   The minimum term of the sentence is to be set in the standard range,
   according to the seriousness level of the offense and the offender
   score.  The minimum term may also constitute an exceptional sentence as
   provided by RCW 9.94A.535.  The maximum term is the statutory maximum
   sentence for the offense.  Offenders sentenced to an indeterminate
   sentence are eligible for earned release pursuant to RCW 9.94A.728,
   have the opportunity for sex offender treatment while incarcerated and
   are eligible for the Special Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative as
   provided in RCW 9.94A.670.  Additionally, all sentences under this
   scheme are to be served in prison, regardless of the length of the
   sentence.

   Offenders sentenced under the indeterminate scheme fall under the
   purview of the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board through the maximum
   term of the sentence.  Those released from prison will be supervised by
   the Department of Corrections and will remain on community custody
   through the maximum term of the sentence.

   The bill also creates the offense of sexually violent predator escape,
   ranking it at Seriousness Level X on the adult felony sentencing grid
   and establishing a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months.  Sexually
   violent predator escape is also subject to the indeterminate sentencing
   provisions established by the bill.

   Additionally, the bill expands the definitions of sexual misconduct of
   a minor in the first and second degree, reclassifies several offenses
   as Class A felonies and classifies attempts to commit any of a list of
   enumerated offenses as Class A felonies.
