   PCP regularly organizes conferences or meetings. Until now there have
   been :

   Symposium on "Cybernetics and Human Values"
          at the 8th World Congress of Systems and Cybernetics (New York,
          June 1990). Check the [externallink.GIF] Abstracts of papers
          that were presented.

   1st Workshop of the Principia Cybernetica Project
          (Free University of Brussels, July 1991). Check the "Workbook"
          containing papers and abstracts.

   Symposium on "The Principia Cybernetica Project"
          at the 13th Int. Congress on Cybernetics (Namur, August 1992).
          Check for a [externallink.GIF] report or for the
          [externallink.GIF] Abstracts of papers that were presented.

   Symposium on "Cybernetic Principles of Knowledge Development
          (chaired by F. Heylighen and Stuart Umpleby) at the 12th
          European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research (Vienna,
          April 1994). Check the [externallink.GIF] Call for Papers.

   Symposium on "The Evolution of Complexity
          at the "Einstein meets Magritte" conference ( Free University of
          Brussels, May/June 1995).

   Symposium on "Theories and Metaphors of Cyberspace"
          (chaired by F. Heylighen and Stuart Umpleby) at the 13th
          European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research (Vienna,
          April 1996).

   Symposium on "Memetics"
          (chaired by F. Heylighen and Mario Vaneechoutte) at the 15th
          Int. Congress on Cybernetics (Namur, August 1998).

   Special Session on " [externallink.GIF] Semiotics of Autonomous
          Information Systems"
          (chaired by Cliff Joslyn and Luis Rocha) at the 1998 Conference
          on Intelligent Systems and Semiotics (ISAS98) (Gaithersburg,
          Maryland, September 1998)

   Workshop "From Intelligent Networks to the Global Brain"
          (Free University of Brussels, July 2001).

   The meetings allow researchers potentially interested in contributing
   the Project to meet in a relaxed atmosphere. The emphasis is on
   discussion, rather than on formal presentation. Contributors are
   encouraged to read some of the available texts on the PCP in order to
   get acquainted with the main issues.
