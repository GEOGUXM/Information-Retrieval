      We are currently upgrading the listserv software we use to send
    Fishnews. We expect this project to be completed shortly. Once the
       upgrade is complete, we will once again be able to accept new
   subscribers. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns,
   send an e-mail to Kate.Naughten@noaa.gov. We apologize in advance for
                            the inconvenience.


   How to View Federal Register Documents

   The Federal Register is the official daily publication for Rules,
   Proposed Rules, and Notices of Federal agencies and organizations, as
   well as Executive Orders and other Presidential Documents. You can find
   NOAA Fisheries latest (published) regulatory activities online by
   accessing the Federal Register Online at:
   www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/aces140.html. We suggest you click on
   the link, "Browse back issues of the Federal Register Table of
   Contents." This will give you the most current list as well as lists
   from past years.
