   The Computing Division, in conjunction with the experiments, has
   decided to make use of the Open Inventor graphics/object library for
   graphical representation and manipulation of 3D shapes.

   CD has purchased a large block of licenses for the Open Inventor and 3D
   MasterSuite software products from Template Graphics Systems. Our
   agreement provides a supply of licenses for collaborators on all
   Fermilab experiments, and includes provisions to maintain versions of
   the Open Inventor software for the KAI compiler (KCC).

   CD will also be providing support of the products, including
   maintaining ups packages for all versions.

   We also support and distribute HEPVis, a library of HEP-specific
   subclasses of the Open Inventor classes.
