   [veneman2.jpg] "International trade is critical to the profitability of
   U.S. agriculture.  Agricultural exports account for 25 percent of
   farmers' gross sales.  With fundamental reform, tariffs on U.S.
   agricultural goods, currently averaging 60 percent, can be reduced,
   helping our farmers and giving them increased export opportunities
   around the world."
