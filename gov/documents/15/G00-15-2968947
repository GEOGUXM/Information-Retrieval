                          Research and Observations


   Space based sensors can provide us with literally several times more
   data than ground based sensors. Most ground based and airborne sensors
   are only capable of detecting cloud to ground lightning, which is known
   to make up only about 25% of total lighting activity. This is further
   limited by the facts that ground sensors can only detect activity over
   land, and airborne sensors have a limited observation time. Thus, with
   these sensors alone, we are incapable of studying lightning activity
   over the two-thirds of the earth that is covered by ocean.

   A space based sensor can detect lightning activity over land and sea,
   24 hours a day, and can detect all forms of lightning. Thus, such
   sensors will allow the development of the first global database of
   lightning activity. Such information can be used for severe storm
   detection and analysis, and lightning-atmosphere interaction studies.

   The LMS program is intended to place a sensor, capable of continuously
   mapping lightning discharges during both day and night, into a
   geostationary orbit.
