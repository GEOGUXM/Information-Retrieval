   Detailed descriptions of each session are available here.

   Clicking on a session brings up the detailed program for that session;
   clicking on an individual paper brings up the abstract for that paper.

   Technical Program

   Oral sessions will occupy each morning, and the first parts of Monday
   and Tuesday afternoon. All Oral sessions (except for the Focus Session
   at Chabot described below) are held in the Jewett Ballroom on the first
   floor of the Oakland Marriott City Center.

   Poster sessions occur on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The
   Poster Sessions will be held in the East Hall of the Marriott
   Convention Center, adjacent to the Jewett Ballroom.

   A special Focus Session on Space Propulsion will be held at Chabot
   Space & Science Center on Thursday afternoon, just prior to the
   Conference Reception. Buses will provide transportation to Chabot
   leaving the Oakland Marriott City Center at 4:00 pm.

   The conference will conclude at noon on Friday.

   Special Instructions for Oral Presenters

   One overhead projector, and an LCD projector will be available for
   presentations. We discourage presentation formats that require other
   types of audio-visual equipment. If your presentation absolutely
   requires other types of audio-visual equipment, you must let us know
   immediately, we will determine whether your request can be honored.

   If you plan to use the LCD projector, please let us know right away. Be
   aware, as well, of the very strict guidelines for preparation of the
   electronic files. Click here for these instructions. Following these
   guidelines is mandatory to ensure smooth flow of the oral program.

   Special Instructions for Poster Presenters

   Poster boards are 8 feet wide by 4 feet high (2.4 meter x 1.2 meter).
   Either velcro or push-pins can be used for mounting posters. A supply
   of push pins will be available at the Staff desk in the Jewett Ballroom
   Atrium. If you wish to use velcro, you must provide your own materials.
   The poster boards are not suitable for tape mounting.

   Setup of posters must be complete by the starting time of their
   assigned Session,. The East Hall will be available for poster setup
   from 8:00 am. Posters must remain displayed for the entire length of
   the Session, and must be taken down by 30 minutes following the end of
   the Session.

   Authors should make every effort to ensure their poster is attended:
   either by themselves, co-authors, or knowledgeable colleagues. Should
   this be impossible, and a poster must be left unattended, a note should
   be affixed indicating the time the author will return.

   Poster Police. As in other conferences, a posse of Poster Police will
   be roaming the floor of the Poster Session, ensuring posters are in
   fact displayed, that they meet minimum standards (PLEASE NOTE: An
   enlarged copy of the paper manuscript is NOT considered meeting minimum
   standards!), and that they are not left unattended for undue periods of
   time. The penalty for incurring the displeasure of the Poster Police
   could be as severe as prevention of publication of the paper in the
   Conference Proceedings.

   Social Program:

   Sunday, 5:00 7:00 pm: Registration Reception will be held at the A.J.
   Topper Room on the 21^st floor of the Oakland Marriott City Center

   is $50 per person. For spouses or participants not attending the Space
   Propulsion Session, transportation will be provided from the Oakland
