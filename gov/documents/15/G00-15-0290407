   THE DEPARTMENT OF
   FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (DFI)

      Acting Director
      Mark Thomson

   DFI provides regulatory oversight for our states financial service
   providers. The department was created by combining pre-existing units
   from two state agencies in October, 1993. Although relatively new, the
   agency's beginnings date back to the early 1900s, with the organization
   of the Division of Banking on June 12, 1907, and the Division of
   Securities in the 1930s.

   ( DFI was created by Ch. 43.320 RCW)

   The department's four divisions regulate a wide range of financial
   enterprises and individuals, such as banks, credit unions, mortgage
   brokers, consumer loan companies, and securities issuers and
   salespeople. The department is self-supporting, in that none of its
   operating revenues come from the state's general tax funds. Its
   operating revenues are paid by the organizations and individuals it
   regulates. The Banks Division regulates commercial banks, trust
   companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations, foreign banks,
   and SBA (7a) lenders incorporated in Washington.  It protects the
   interests of depositors, borrowers, shareholders, and consumers through
   its examination and supervisory responsibilities.

   The Consumer Services Division licenses and regulates business
   activities of consumer loan companies, mortgage brokers, escrow agents
   and designated escrow officers, as well as check cashers and check
   sellers (sometimes known as payday lenders). The division reviews the
   books and records of these businesses checking for compliance with
   applicable state and federal laws, handles consumer complaints against
   them, and may require that refunds be made or that other appropriate
   actions be taken.

                                ...go to the Division of Consumer Services

   The Credit Unions Division regulates state-chartered credit unions
   licensed to operate in Washington, while the National Credit Union
   Administration (NCUA), is the federal insurer of shares and deposits in
   our credit unions.  NCUA also has authority to enforce most of the
   consumer protection statutes that deal with credit unions.  The
   division enforces some of these statutes in examinations of
   state-chartered credit unions, and also processes consumer complaints
   for credit union customers.

                                    ...go to the Division of Credit Unions

   The Securities Division regulates securities investments, franchises,
   business opportunities, and off-exchange commodities sold in
   Washington, as well as the firms and individuals that sell these
   products or provide investment advice. The Division handles complaints,
   conducts investigations, and takes appropriate enforcement actions to
   protect investors and combat fraud.
