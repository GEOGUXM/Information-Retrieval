   Portrait of Lynne V. Cheney. White House photo by David Bohrer. Lynne
   V. Cheney, wife of Vice President Richard B. Cheney, has loved history
   for as long as she can remember, and she has spent much of her
   professional life writing and speaking about the importance of knowing
   history and teaching it well.

   As chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to
   1993, she published American Memory, a report that warned about the
   failure of schools to transmit knowledge of the past to upcoming
   generations. "A system of education that fails to nurture memory of the
   past denies its students a great deal," Mrs. Cheney wrote: "the
   satisfactions of mature thought, an attachment to abiding concerns, a
   perspective on human existence." Today, as a senior fellow at the
   American Enterprise Institute, she particularly emphasizes the value of
   knowing our nation's history. "One of the important lessons we can
   learn is that freedom isn't inevitable," she says. "This realization
   should make the liberty we enjoy all the more important to us, all the
   more worth defending."

   Mrs. Cheney has written articles about history for numerous
   publications on topics ranging from woman suffrage in the West and the
   way Americans celebrated the country's centennial to more
   tongue-in-cheek assessments, such as the impact of technological
   advances like air conditioning, the xerox machine, and the paper
   shredder on life in Washington, D. C. She was a member of the
   Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution and, more recently,
   served on Texas Governor George W. Bush's education team. She was part
   of a group that revised Texas standards for the study of history.

   She is author or co-author of five books, including Kings of the Hill
   (second edition, 1996), a book about figures from Henry Clay to Sam
   Rayburn who played powerful roles in the House of Representatives. She
   wrote this book with her husband, who was a Congressman from Wyoming
   from 1979 to 1989. Mrs. Cheney's most recent book, Telling the Truth
   (Simon & Schuster, paperback, 1996), analyzed the effect of
   postmodernism on study in the humanities.

   Mrs. Cheney is currently completing America: A Patriotic Primer, an
   alphabet book intended for elementary school children and their
   families. The book, scheduled for publication in the spring of 2002,
   celebrates the ideas and ideals that are the foundations of our
   country. Mrs. Cheney's net proceeds from America will be donated to
   charity.

   Mrs. Cheney currently serves as a director of the Reader's Digest
   Association and American Express Funds.

   Mrs. Cheney earned her Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors from
   Colorado College, her Master of Arts from the University of Colorado,
   and her Ph.D. with a specialization in 19^th century British literature
   from the University of Wisconsin. She is the recipient of awards and
   honorary degrees from numerous colleges and universities.

   Vice President and Mrs. Cheney were married in 1964. They have two
   grown daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, and three grandchildren, Kate,
   Elizabeth, and Grace.
