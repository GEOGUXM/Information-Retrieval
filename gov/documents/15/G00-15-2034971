       OSB's Down-Looking Scatterometer (DLS) on NOAA' LongEZ Aircraft
   [lezside_crop_half.gif] [dls_photo_quartersz.gif] A compact, low-power
   CW radar has been built in-house to fly aboard NOAA's LongEZ research
   aircraft. The radar will be used to study changes in small-scale ocean
   wave roughness and how they relate to changes in oceanic and
   atmospheric conditions. The research supports NASA Earth Science
   Enterprise efforts to globally monitor oceanic winds from space using
   altimeters and scatterometers such as TOPEX/Poseidon, JASON-1, NSCAT,
   QuickSCAT, and SeaWinds. The efforts are also part of the Office of
   Naval Research's Shoaling Wave DRI SHOWEX.

   This millimeter-wave (36 GHz) radar is specifically designed to fly
   aboard NOAA's LongEZ which gathers measurements of atmospheric
   conditions near the bottom (< 30 m) of the marine boundary layer. The
   DLS radar measures the intensity of radar power that reflects from the
   roughened ocean back to the radar receiver. The radar illuminates a
   very small footprint on the sea surface that is less than 1 m in
   diameter while the LongEZ flys at or below 30 m altitude. The LongEZ is
   also equipped with three precise laser range finders that measure the
   surface wave elevation at points located around the radar's surface
   footprint. The lasers provide high fidelity information on surface long
   wave slopes. For further LongEZ information see the LongEZ (N3R)
   NOAA/ARL/FRD site.

   This page is the repository for activities related to DLS project. The
   project is run by D. Vandemark here at the Observational Science
   Branch. See the ROWS home page for contact information. The NOAA
   aircraft is operated by Tim Crawford at NOAA ARL's Field Research
   Division in Idaho Falls, ID. These activities are part of larger
   research efforts under NASA and the Office of Naval Research. The ONR
   Shoaling Waves Experiment had field programs taking place off the coast
   of NC in 1997 and 1999. The ONR CBLAST-Low field experiments will take
   place off of Martha's Vineyard in 2001 and 2002. NASA's Wave Profile
   Experiment (WAPEX) headed by D. Vandemark occurred in Nov. 1998.
