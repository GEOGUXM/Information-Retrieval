   LEGISLATION

   2000 Legislation
   Assembly Bill (AB) 2491, authored by Assembly Member Jackson, AB 2683,
   authored by Assembly Member Bock, and Senate Bill (SB) 1802, authored
   by Senator Chesbro, were passed and signed by Governor Gray Davis. The
   following are the changes to the statutes affecting the Victims of
   Crime Program (VOCP) for crimes that occurred on or after January 1,
   2001:
   Effective January 1, 2001, AB 2491 modifies the VOCP in the following
   areas:
    1. Name Change
          + The State Board of Control's name has been changed to: the
            California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board.
    2. Increase Limit for Reimbursable Expenses
          + The total amount payable to a victim or derivative victim is
            increased to $70,000 from $46,000 for one crime.
          + The increased limit applies to claims for crimes committed
            on/after January 1, 2001.
    3. Extension of Time Period for Receiving Benefits
          + The time period for which a victim may receive wage loss or a
            derivative victim may receive support loss benefits is
            increased to five years from three years.
          + Any time limits for wage loss benefits for victims who become
            permanently disabled as a result of a crime is eliminated. For
            purposes of this section, permanent disability is defined in
            42 USC 416(i) which is the definition of disability as it
            applies to Social Security.
          + This extension will apply to claim for crimes committed on or
            after January 1, 2001.
    4. Additional benefits for Parents of a Child Victim
          + The Board may reimburse wages lost for a period of 30 days for
            parents or guardians of a child who is hospitalized or billed
            as a result of a crime committed on or after January 1, 2001.
          + The policy for the implementation of this new benefit will be
            taken to the Board in January 2001 and when it is approved a
            program memo will be issued.
    5. Lost Wages
          + For purposes of restitution orders, a victim's lost wages may
            include any income commission as well as base wages.
    6. Emergency Awards
          + Victims applying for emergency financial assistance are no
            longer required to certify that no additional claims will be
            made.
    7. Child Life Specialist Pilot Program
          + The qualifications for certified child life specialists who
            may be reimbursed under the VOC Program have been clarified.
    8. Victim Recovery Center
          + $1 million is appropriated from the Restitution Fund for the
            Board to enter into an interagency agreement with the
            University of California at San Francisco to establish a
            victims' recovery center at San Francisco General Hospital.
    9. Technical Changes to the Penal Code and the Welfare and
       Institutions Code
          + AB 2491 also makes technical changes to the section of the
            Penal and Welfare and Institutions Code regarding the
            imposition of restitution fines and orders against adult and
            juvenile offenders.

   AB 2683 modifies the VOCP in the following areas:
    1. Authorizes the Board to grant an additional extension of time for
       victims and derivative victims to submit claims who are called to
       testify after January 1, 2001 for a crime that could have occurred
       at anytime. This extension applies under the following
       circumstances:
          + For an individual who is called to testify in a proceeding
            against a defendant as a victim of prior acts of the defendant
            in a trial for sex crimes or domestic violence, as specified.
    2. Prohibits reimbursement of any expense that is submitted more than
       three years after it is incurred by the victim or derivative
       victim.

   Effective January 1, 2001 SB 1802 modifies the VOCP in the following
   areas:
    1. Provides a specific exemption to the California Public Records Act
       (CPRA) for the VOCP.
    2. Provides that a victim does not waive his or her medical
       provider/patient privilege by submitting bills and treatment
       records to the VOCP in order to qualify for payments.
    3. Creates a presumption that payments made by the VOCP shall be
       included in the amount of restitution ordered against a defendant
       by the court.

   Assembly Bill (AB) 606, authored by Assembly Member Jackson, was passed

   occurred on or after January 1, 2000:
     * Category of Eligible Providers
       Requires the Board, until January 1, 2004, to conduct a pilot
       program to provide reimbursement for grief, mourning and
       bereavement services that are provided by an individual who is

       Legislature by January 31, 2003, on this pilot program.
     * Domestic Violence Victims
       Authorizes a cash payment or reimbursement to an adult victim of
       domestic violence for specified expenses incurred in relocating,

       enforcement to be necessary for the personal safety of the victim,
       or by a mental health provider, as necessary for the emotional well
       being of the victim. These expenses may include, but need not be
       limited to, all of the following:
          + Deposits for utilities and telephone service;

          + Temporary lodging and food expenses, not to exceed $1,000.
       The cash payment or reimbursement shall only be awarded once to any
       victim, except that the Board may award a second cash payment or
       reimbursement to the same victim if both of the following
       conditions are met:
          + The crime or series of crimes occurs more than three years
            from the date of the crime giving rise to the initial
            relocation payment or reimbursement;
          + When a relocation payment or reimbursement is provided to a
            victim of domestic violence, the victim must agree not to
            inform the offender of the location of the victim's new
            residence, not allow the offender on the premises at any time,
            or must seek a restraining order against the offender.
       Victims of crimes other than domestic violence may also receive
       relocation expenses.
     * Payment for Residential Security
       If the crime occurred in the victim's residence, a cash payment of
       up to $1,000 for the expense of installing or increasing
       residential security may be authorized.
       Reimbursement shall be made upon verification by law enforcement to
       be necessary for the personal safety of the victim, or by a mental
       health treatment provider to be necessary for the emotional well
       being of the victim. Installing or increasing residential security
       may include, but need not be limited to, both of the following:
          + Home security device or system;
          + Replacing or increasing the number of locks.
     * Renovation of Residence and/or Vehicle
       Authorizes payment to a victim who is permanently disabled, whether
       the disability is partial or total, as a result of the crime, for
       the expense of renovating or retrofitting his or her residence or
       vehicle. Any payments shall be subject to the following condition:
          + The expense is verified to be medically necessary.
     * Emergency Awards
       Allows the Board to delegate authority to grant and disburse
       specific Emergency Awards.
     * Restitution
       Adds the newly created benefits and mental health to the list of
       expenses for which restitution may be ordered, pursuant to Section
       1202.4 of the Penal Code.

   1998 Legislation
   Several major bills were passed and signed by the Governor that refined
   statutes governing the VOCP. Bills were authored by Assembly Members

   Senate Member Haynes (SB2202). Bill AB 535 became effective on
   September 22, 1998. All other bills went into effect on January 1,

       in a qualifying crime, and the district attorney recommends
       approval based on cooperation;

   Awards will increase from $2,000 to $5,000 for funeral/burial expenses

       considered in determining a minor's eligibility regarding
       involvement in events leading to the crime and cooperation with law
       enforcement.
     * Allows approval of a claim for a minor derivative victim in cases
       of domestic violence where the direct victim is ineligible due to
       involvement in events leading to the crime.

     * A victims participation in events leading to the crime may not be
       considered;
