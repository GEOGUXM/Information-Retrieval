       The mission of the Haverhill Community Based Outpatient Clinic is to
    provide compassionate healthcare services in primary care to eligible
      veterans residing in the greater Haverhill area. The staff of the
   Primary Care Clinic offers medical care and treatment, gives referrals
     to various specialty clinics and, as needed arranges admissions to
                       services at VA Medical Centers.

    The Haverhill Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) is one of four
     satellite clinics of the VA Bedford Medical Center. The VA Bedford
     Medical Center, Community Based Outpatient Clinic offers access for
     initial and ongoing healthcare services to veterans of the Greater
      Haverhill area. The goal of the Clinic is to provide services for
       veterans whose needs are primarily conducted through outpatient
   services and provide necessary treatment. The clinic will be staffed by
    a physician, two nurse practitioners, a registered nurse, a licensed
              practical nurse, and a patient service assistant.

       It is our hope that veterans in need of services will take the
                opportunity to use this new community clinic.
