dot Office of Public Affairs

   The Office of Public Affairs staff work closely with other sections of
   the American Mission and with many Australian organizations to foster
   bilateral understanding.

   From time to time, the Office of Public Affairs sponsors seminars,
   exhibits, speakers, and other programs where Australians and Americans
   can exchange ideas and information on economic issues, shared
   environmental concerns, American government and history, education,
   security, and a wide variety of other topics. The Office of Public
   Affairs has offices in Canberra and Sydney.

dot U.S. Information Research Centers

     In Australia, both Public Affairs offices maintain sophisticated
     research centers, which use professional journals, data base
     resources, and the Internet to provide current information to
     Australian government officials, university researchers, and other
     specialists. These centers do not stock books or magazines for
     recreational reading.

dot Study in the U.S.

     The Office of Public Affairs also provides or facilitates
     educational counseling for Australian students interested in
     university study in the United States through the
