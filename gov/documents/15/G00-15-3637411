   The Prevention First Biennial Symposium (PF2K2) dates have been set for
   September 10 and 11, 2002. Like last time, the Symposium will be held
   at the Westin Hotel in Long Beach, CA. Though the agenda is not yet
   complete for the coming Symposium, past agendas have included such
   topics as: Accidents and Mishaps caused by Human Factors including the
   effects of sleep deprivation on human behavior, Ballast Water
   Management Strategies and Equipment, Marine Terminal Engineering
   Standards, Our award winning Safety Assessment of Management Systems
   (SAMS), Risk Analysis and Application to an Inspection Program, and
   Offshore Platform Safety Audits. We will provide you with a similar
   agenda of safety and pollution prevention related topics at PF2K2. And,
   as in the past, we will once again integrate an Exhibition with the
   forthcoming Symposium. We anticipate providing you with a cross-section
   of state-of- the-art pollution prevention equipment, information and
   materials at the Exhibition. Combine the Symposium proper with door
   prizes, catered food service, and comfortable accommodations at the
   Westin, and we know you will benefit by attending this informative,
   cost effective event. If you're interested in being an Exhibition
   participant, please contact Mr. Roy Mathur, or Mr. Ken Leverich at our
   Northern California Field Office, Telephone No. 510-741-4950.
