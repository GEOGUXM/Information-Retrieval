   works) is now part of the Egov.gov website. You can still come directly

   Smart Card Standards and Interoperability

   To make best use of smart card technology in the Federal government,
   GSA provides policy guidance (see for example, Smart Card Policy and
   Administrative Guidelines) [Download Adobe Acrobat Reader], and assists
   the Federal community by hosting the Smart Card Project Managers Group
   and this web site. Smartcard.gov keeps track of the latest smart card
   developments affecting electronic government (What's New?), provides a
   multi-media tutorial on smart cards ( Smart Card Tutorial), and
   maintains a database of Government smart card projects (Smart Data).
   GSA also participates in Federal, U.S., and global standard-making
   efforts, through the Government Interoperability Advisory Board, Smart
   Card Alliance, Global Platform, and a joint program with NIST on
   conformance testing and development of FIPS publications.
