   certainty of purpose, and determination to defend freedom, DeLay said.
    President Bush demonstrated tonight that hes committed to reviving our
     economy, strengthening the American homeland, and hunting down the
   terror network wherever it hides in the world.  For that, Americans can
                                  be proud.
    The only man big enough to fill George W. Bushs boots is George Bush.
     Tonight, he may have even matched his September performance when he
             spoke to the American people following the tragedy.
   In September, President Bush comforted our hearts, wiped our tears and
    lifted our souls.  Now, hes leading us to defeat terrorism, defend of
                    our homeland and revive our economy.
