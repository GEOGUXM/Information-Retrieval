   [blanc.gif]
   WCPCANs community-based family support and child abuse prevention
   programs serve a diverse variety of families including teen parents,
   Hispanic/Latino families, Native American families, Russian families,
   fathers, refugee families, families with low-income, and families who
   are homeless.  Parents and children learned new problem solving and
   communication skills; parents and caregivers learned about child
   development and positive discipline, improved their support network,
   and decreased their stress.  Additionally, families improved their
   ability to be self-sufficient.

   Successful first year programs are eligible for second and third year
   funding, through decreasing levels. WCPCANs goal is to develop strong
   programs that are capable of sustaining themselves by the fourth year
   of operation.

    Program Anecdotes

   Experiences of Community Program Utilizing Home Visits to Strengthen
   Families in Washington State 1998-99

   Family Support Services, Womens Resource Center of North Central
   Washington
   Legislative District: 12
   Comments from parents:
     * A new male parent: "Boy, asking for help around here is like
       getting water from a fire hydrantit just keeps coming and coming
       and coming."
     * "Found out we could have fun clean and sober."  "So, this is what
       an extended family can be like, its great!"
     * On program evaluation form: "This place is great cause it helps me
       find friends and support."

   Family Life Skills Program, Port Gamble SKlallam Tribe
   Legislative District: 23
   "One five-year-old boy who attended the family campout nearly ten
   months ago said, I remember you.  You did the family campout.  I had a
   lot of fun and want to go again this year.  The family campout was a
   huge success and two have been planned for this summer."

   Responses from the focus groups of parents participating in parent
   education classes and home visits include:
     * "It helped me with my family and spouse; taking time-outs and
       thinking and not having to resort to anger and violence; being able
       to talk and let your problems out instead of holding them and
       getting feedback from other people in the class; it was a safe
       place to discuss our problems."
     * "I learned to praise my children for the little things they do."
     * "I remember that my children like the attention I give them."
     * "I remember that your children trust you to do whats right."

   Multi-Ethnic Families Project, Lutheran Social Services of Washington
   and Idaho
   Legislative District: 38
   "A satisfaction-outcome survey was mailed to 55 families currently
   involved in home visits and/ or support groups.  Eighteen families
   (about 1/3) responded.
     * 94% of parents reported that the group has helped them to feel less
       isolated and less frustrated with their situation and with family
       life.
     * 89% of parents report the program has helped them to find resources
       and information they need.
     * 72% of parents responded that they can share their experiences with
       others, and they have learned that other parents have similar
       problems, which helps them to solve their own problems.  Ten out of
       11 respondents (that participated in the support group) agreed that
       they can trust others in the group."

   Nooksack Valley Family Services, Nooksack Valley School District
   Legislative District: 42
   "A young mom, pregnant with her first child, found herself alone and
   without money when her boyfriend (the babys father) was arrested on a
   parole violation and sent back to San Diego.  Two weeks from delivery,
   she immediately called program staff for emotional support and help
   finding resources.  Through our Family Services Program and her First
   Steps home visitor, she was able to locate the resources she needed.
   More importantly, three other families in our program came to her aid
   and one offered temporary shelter until she had a place to go.  All
   three women from our program offered to accompany her to the hospital,
   along with one of our staff.  The baby was born; mom and baby are
   staying with another family in our program.  Home visits are going well
   and the baby is thriving!"

   San Juan Island Family Resource Center, San Juan Department of Health
   and Community Services
   Legislative District: 40
   Comments from parents:
   "The home visits are helping me to be a better mother.  I am fearful of
   becoming a mother at 17 and my mother is so far from me (in Mexico).
   The home visitor is really helping me understand what being a mother is
   going to be like and I have less fear now."

   "I dont know what I would do if this program were not there.  This is a
   really scary situation for our family.  We did not know where else to
   turn for help."  (Alleged sexual molestation of a 4-year-old child.)

   Brigid Collins House, Bellingham
   Legislative District: 42
   "In a remote part of Whatcom County, a 19-year-old mother with three
   very young children lives in a strained situation with her in-laws.
   Her partner is not invested in the family.  Visits from the Healthy
   Families home visitor offer a break in her isolation and an opportunity
   to discuss child development information.  The young woman, from
   Russia, states that without contact from her home visitor, she would
   see no one except her in-laws, partner and children."

   "A young Hispanic mother and her partner have been seeing their home
   visitor for some time.  They have participated in activities that have
   laid the foundation for a positive and loving relationship.  They have
   begun to access services independently in many areas.  Recently, with
   the support of the Healthy Families worker, the family enrolled their
   child in Migrant Head Start.  This was a big step for the family who
   only allowed relatives to watch the children prior to this time."
