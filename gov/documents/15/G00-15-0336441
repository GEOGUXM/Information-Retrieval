     __________________________________________________________________

       Mauna Loa Observatory is located on the Island of Hawaii at an
    elevation of 3397 m on the northern flank of Mauna Loa volcano at 200
    north. Established in 1957, Mauna Lao Observatory has grown to become
    the premier long-term atmospheric monitoring facility on earth and is
   the site where the ever-increasing concentrations of global atmospheric
       carbon dioxide were determined. The observatory consists of 10
     buildings from which up to 250 different atmospheric parameters are
    measured by a complement of 12 NOAA/CMDL and other agency scientists
                               and engineers.
