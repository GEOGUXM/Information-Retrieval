   Research Where Science Comes to Life The Office of Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Research (OAR) or "NOAA Research" works in partnership with
   NOAA's National Weather Service, National Ocean Service, National
   Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service and National
   Marine Fisheries Service as the research and development organization
   of the agency. It is through NOAA Research that our work results in
   better weather forecasts, longer warnings for natural disasters, and an
   overall greater understanding of our oceans, climate, and atmosphere.
   Our responsibility is to address better management and understanding of
   the environment through research. NOAA Research explores the facets and
   trends of our environment that influence our future. Our research plays
   a key role in facing the new challenges of a rapidly changing society
   and our natural surroundings. A decade ago, it would have been
   difficult to conceive of the advances that have been made by NOAA
   Research. But today, we are brokers of independent scientific knowledge
   completing the NOAA circle of research, prediction, and environmental
   stewardship. The keys to successful NOAA research are our talented and
   dedicated workforce, and our partnerships with academia, other federal
   institutions and constituent groups. Who We Are and What We Do As the
   primary research and development organization within NOAA, NOAA
   Research explores the Earth and atmosphere from the surface of the sun
   to the depths of the ocean. Our role within NOAA is to provide products
   and services that describe and predict changes in the environment. NOAA
   Research results allow decision makers to make effective judgments in
   order to prevent the loss of human life and conserve and manage natural
   resources while maintaining a strong economy. We conduct research in
   three major areas: climate, weather and air quality, and ocean,
   coastal, and Great Lakes resources. OAR conducts a portion of its
   business through partnerships with state and local governments, non-
   governmental organizations, other Federal agencies, and private
   corporations. Some Federal agencies and non-Federal organizations have
   complementary missions or require information or services from OAR
   Program Offices or Laboratories in order to fulfill their own unique
   missions. Interagency and other special agreements may be used to
   formally agree to share information, provide needed services, or
   coordinate programs to optimize the benefits from each party's efforts.
   These agreements establish the terms of the relationship so that the
   greatest return is realized from similar or complementary programs.
   Written agreements that clearly stipulate the responsibilities of each
   party can contribute to more efficient and effective results and be
   useful in avoiding future misunderstandings between the parties. 1 PART
   1. - OVERVIEW Section A. General Information A.01. Purpose and Scope.
   This User Manual establishes internal OAR policy and procedures and
   assigns responsibilities for the drafting, review, clearance and
   approval, and monitoring of interagency and other special agreements
   entered into by OAR organizational units. The guidance contained herein
   applies to all OAR organizational units1 involved in reimbursable work
   and unfunded relationships with other entities as set forth in the
   Policy section (Section A.02 ) and performed under the authority of the
   Economy Act of 1932, the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, the
   Department's Joint Project Authority, the Federal Technology Transfer
   Act of 1986, or other appropriate legal authority. This document
   prescribes guidelines for the review and clearance of Memoranda of
   Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A) and Interagency Agreements (IA) between
   the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), National Oceanic
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC), and
   other entities. It also provides sample formats for Joint Project
   Agreements and Other Agreements, sample "acceptance of sponsored work"
   summary sheets for all agreement types, a checklist to be used when
   preparing MOU/As and Interagency Agreements, a project code request
   form, transmittal memoranda, waiver request memoranda, and
   "Standardized Labor Distribution Worksheet Procedures." This document
   does not apply to Federal contracts or other procurements or for the
   review and clearance of any contract, grant, or cooperative agreements
   (to include OAR's Joint Institutes) wherein OAR is securing goods
   and/or services from other entities, since those agreements are
   governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Federal Grant
   and Cooperative Agreement Act, Department of Commerce Administrative
   Order (DAO) 203-26, the DOC Grants and Cooperative Agreements Manual,
   and other laws, regulations, directives, and DOC policies. It also does
   not apply to (1) (e.g., credit card micro-purchases and mandatory
   sources of supply such as the General Services Administration (GSA),
   Government Printing Office (GPO)), which are governed by the FAR,
   except for Economy Act Agreements, which are covered under FAR Subpart
   17.5, "Interagency Acquisitions";(3) Interagency/Inter-governmental
   Personnel Agreements, which are addressed in Personnel Regulations; (4)
   Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), which are
   governed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   Administrative Order 201-103, dated November 13, 1989; (5)
   International Agreements, which are covered in DAO 218-4, "Treaties and
   Other International Agreements," issued on January 23, 1992; and (6)
   Customer Service Agreements (CSAs) entered into in accordance with the
   Commerce Information Technology Solutions (COMMITS) Program. The
   COMMITS Program is the preferred source for fulfilling the agency
   Information Technology (IT) requirements. 1/ OAR Headquarters; OAR
   Research Laboratories; Office of Sea Grant; Office of Global Programs
   (OGP); National Undersea Research Program (NURP); Office of Research
   and Technology Applications (ORTA) 2 Although CRADAs and International
   Agreements are not covered in this Instruction, OAR Laboratories,
   Program or Staff Office Directors should submit CRADAs and
   International Agreements to OAR's Office of Management and Information
   for tracking purposes. A.02. Policy. In furthering its programs, OAR
   becomes involved with other entities, including international
   organizations; foreign, Federal, State, tribal, and local governments;
   institutions of higher education; and other public and private
   organizations. This cooperation is consistent with the need to carry
   out effectively and efficiently OAR's authorized programs and the
   general policies of the Federal Government. Interagency and other
   special agreements are some of the methods used by Parties entering
   into a relationship to formally agree to share information, provide
   needed services, or coordinate their programs to optimize the benefits
   from each party's efforts. Agreements are the mechanisms to establish
   the terms of the relationship so that the greatest return is realized
   from similar or complementary programs. Written agreements should be
   properly developed, reviewed, and approved in order to formalize
   relationships with other parties. Informal arrangements should be
   avoided at all costs. Prior to performing work for or requesting work
   from sponsors outside an OAR operating unit, a formal relationship
   between the parties must be properly established. In order to create a
   formal relationship between the Parties, the relationship must be
   documented in an appropriate type of agreement subject to review and
   clearance set forth in Part IV of this User Manual. Reviews ensure that
   the agreements are in the proper format, reflect the appropriate legal
   and programmatic authorities for the specific agreement, are consistent
   with DOC and NOAA/OAR policies, and do not violate any laws. In
   accordance with OMB Circular A-25, as implemented by DAO 203-5,
   reimbursable work will be accepted only if it can be performed without
   adversely affecting regular OAR programs. Work not related to the
   normal functions of OAR may be accepted if the following additional
   conditions are met: 1. The task cannot be performed economically by the
   requesting agency with its own facilities or by government-wide service
   agencies and would not result in the diversion of resources to the
   detriment of the basic programs of the operating unit. 2. The
   performance of the task by OAR is in the best interest of the Federal
   Government, will serve the public interest, and is consistent with
   Department programs. 3. It can be performed by OAR more effectively
   than by the private sector because of OAR's unique expertise and
   activities and performance of the service would not be considered to be
   in competition with private enterprise. 4. The results of the service
   will not result in controversy that will have an adverse effect on the
   Department's reputation for impartiality and objectivity. 5. No
   exclusive proprietary interest will accrue to the other party. It is
   OAR's policy to ratify unauthorized agreements entered into by OAR's
   Program or Staff Office personnel. An unauthorized agreement is an
   arrangement or relationship that is entered into by an unauthorized OAR
   personnel and is signed by that individual without benefit of OAR 3
   management and NOAA-OGC and DOC-OGC clearance review. Procedures for
   ratifying an unauthorized agreement are found in Part 5., Section D,
   "Ratifying Unauthorized Agreements." A.03. Applicability. This User
   Manual applies to all OAR Program/Staff Offices, and field operating
   units in their review, approval, and administration of interagency and
   other special agreements. It is for internal use only by OAR personnel
   and does not create any rights or liabilities with respect to the
   public or any third party. This User Manual supplements DOC/NOAA
   guidance, administrative orders, or directives. Should disagreements or
   inconsistencies arise on the interpretations of this Manual and the
   DOC/NOAA guidance or directives, the DOC or NOAA guidance will prevail.
   This Manual addresses unique programmatic requirements and implements
   statutory requirements and regulations unique to NOAA/OAR. Substantive
   changes or revisions (e.g., corrections or updates) to the Manual may
   be developed and issued by OAR Headquarters. Amendments or revisions to
   this Manual will be coordinated with the Office of Inspector General,
   (OIG), the NOAA Office of General Counsel (NOAA-OGC), the DOC Office of
   General Counsel (DOC-OGC), and the Office of Executive Assistance
   Management (OEAM) for review and comment. Any request for waivers
   and/or deviations from the requirements of this Manual must be
   submitted in writing to the Assistant Administrator, OAR through the
   Director OMI, by the OAR Program/Staff Office and Laboratory Directors
   in accordance with Part 5., Section C, "General Requirements for
   Requesting Waivers," of this Manual. The waiver or deviation request
   must include a full explanation for the request and justification for
   the deviation or waiver. A.04. References. Appendix A lists published
   Government-wide documents relating to interagency and other special
   agreements. A.05. Definitions. Appendix B defines terminologies which

   AGREEMENTS Section A. Advance Planning Advance Planning is critical to
   a well-written Agreement that clearly stipulates the responsibilities
   of each Party and can contribute to more effective and efficient
   results and eliminate future misunderstandings between the Parties. The
   process for developing an agreement may vary as each Program/Staff
   Office may have its own organizational structure and local work around
   procedures. The following advance planning steps are recommended before
   entering into an agreement. A.01. Be Familiar with the OAR User Manual
   on Interagency and Other Special Agreements. The OAR Manual can be
   downloaded from the OAR website: A.02. Conduct Market Research. Market
   research is a process used to collect, organize, analyze, present, and
   maintain data for the purpose of maximizing the capabilities,
   technology, and competitive forces of the marketplace to meet an
   organization's needs for supplies and services. OAR Program/Staff
   Offices are encouraged to conduct market research before entering into
   an interagency or other special agreements with outside Parties to
   ensure that they are not circumventing competition requirements as well
   as ensuring the best deal for the agency when negotiating an agreement.
   OAR should regard market research as a continuing type of market
   surveillance, providing the organization with valuable information
   concerning the current and projected availabilities of products and
   services, and reliable sources or partners; the extent of competition
   in the market; the range of product performance characteristics; market
   acceptability; price trends and current market prices; and the types of
   available distribution systems and support services. OAR Program/Staff
   Offices should conduct market research before developing and
   documenting new requirements or entering into agreements. This research
   should be initiated as early as possible in the planning cycle, to
   determine whether entering into an interagency or other special
   agreement is the best vehicle or mechanism for acquiring its specific
   needs versus awarding a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement.
   Three market research activities benefit an organization: a. Ongoing
   research not limited to specific acquisitions. This type of research
   assists management in its strategic planning by providing knowledge of
   current changes, advances, and trends in technology and products and
   services of interest to OAR. It provides valuable information or data
   to support determinations regarding industry capability,
   product/service availability, competitive market forces, and
   alternative sources. b. Initial market research related to a specific
   acquisition. This is helpful in 13 defining an organization's
   requirements by determining whether sources of commercial items are
   available to satisfy them. c. Subsequent market research. This type of
   market research is conducted before developing an agreement. It will
   assist the organization in estimating prices or project cost and in
   developing a draft agreement that includes customary terms and
   conditions that encourages responses from the most reliable sources.
   A.03. Conduct Preliminary Discussions with Other OAR Elements. Before
   undertaking serious discussions with a partner or agency, the OAR
   Project Officer should meet with those individuals or officials who
   will be involved in the development, preparation, review, clearance and
   approval of the proposed agreement to identify any performance, policy,
   budget, legal or other outstanding issues before finalizing the
   agreement. Generally, those individuals include the Approving Official,
   NOAA Legal Counsel, the Administrative Officer, Office Program
   Administrative Staff person, Laboratory Budget Office staff Finance
   Officer, the Contracting Officer, and other appropriate officials.
   Preliminary discussions will ensure that each of those individuals
   clearly understands their specific responsibilities under the proposed
   agreement and agreed-upon milestones for specific tasks to ensure the
   timely processing of the agreement. For example, the OAR Liaison should
   be responsible for conducting a preliminary review of the draft
   agreement and supporting documentation to ensure compliance with
   documentation and clearance requirements. assure that proper
   documentation is received to certify the reservation of funds. The
   Finance Office should be responsible for establishing an account into
   which monies can be transferred from each Party to the Agreement, as
   appropriate. The NOAA Legal Counsel should be responsible in providing
   guidance to Program/Staff Offices on what relevant legal and
   programmatic authorities should be cited under which OAR and its
   Program/Staff Offices can enter into an agreement. A.04. Coordinate
   with Each Party to the Agreement. The OAR Project Officer should meet,
   as necessary, with an authorized representative of each Party to the
   agreement to discuss the draft instrument and resolve any outstanding
   issues. Normally, after going through the aforementioned steps A.01.
   through A.03, the Project Officer should have a clear idea on which
   type of relationship or agreement will be involved. From that point on,
   the Project Officer should go to the first meeting with a copy of the
   model agreement (using one of the appropriate sample format included in
   this User Manual). Giving the other Party an accepted format in the
   beginning will facilitate the review and clearance processes at both
   ends. To avoid confusion and uncertainty, it is important to establish
   a single point of contact for each Party to the agreement for
   coordination purposes and resolution of issues. Section B.
   Understanding and Choosing the Right Type of Agreement 14 B.01. Apply
   the Principle Purpose Test. The following are helpful hints to assist
   in selecting the appropriate instrument for entering into an agreement
   with an outside entity. a. Contract. If the principal purpose of the
   transaction is for the DOC to acquire goods or services for the benefit
   of the United States, then a procurement contract is the most
   appropriate mechanism to establish the relationship. The FAR provides
   Government-wide procedures for contracts. NOAA contracting officers can
   provide guidance and support in the use of contracts. b. Cooperative
   Agreement. A Cooperative Agreement is a legal instrument reflecting a
   relationship between OAR and a recipient whenever: (1) the principal
   purpose of the relationship is to provide financial assistance to the
   recipient and (2) substantial involvement is anticipated between OAR
   and the recipient during performance of the contemplated activity. It
   is a type of Government financial assistance, similar to a grant. [See
   sub-paragraph d. below for a definition of grants.] c. Gifts. Gifts are
   not Agreements but they are another legal mechanism to work with
   external Parties. The DOC Secretary can accept and use gifts to aid or
   facilitate the work of the Department. The DAO 203-9, "Gifts and
   Bequests," sets forth the policies and procedures for the acceptance
   and use of gifts by the Department. Under section 4.01 of the DAO, the
   Under Secretary reserves the right to accept gifts valued over $25,000.
   In addition, the DAO requires the approval of the CFO and Assistant
   Secretary for Administration before the DOC accepts any gifts which
   involves unusual or substantial conditions or requirements. Gifts are
   not "negotiated" the way agreements may be negotiated. Gifts cannot be
   accepted if the donor expects services or favors in return. d.
   Financial Assistance. Financial Assistance applies to agreements that
   have as their principal purpose the transfer of a thing of value
   (money, property, services, etc.) to a private party in order to
   support or stimulate a public purpose authorized by law. Financial
   Assistance can only be awarded where there is express authority by law.
   The two most common types of Financial Assistance are Cooperative
   Agreements and Grants: - Cooperative Agreement - Cooperative Agreement
   is a legal instrument reflecting a relationship between NOAA and a
   recipient (individual or entity) when the principal purpose of the
   relationship is to provide financial assistance to the recipient and
   substantial involvement is anticipated between NOAA and the recipient
   during performance of the contemplated activity. - Grant. a Grant is
   similar to a Cooperative Agreement , is a legal instrument reflecting a
   relationship between OAR and a recipient whenever (a) the principal
   purpose of the relationship is to provide financial assistance to a
   recipient and (b) no substantial involvement is anticipated between OAR
   and the recipient during the performance of the contemplated activity.
   When none of the above mechanisms is appropriate, then entering into an
   agreement with one or 15 more Parties would be the appropriate
   instrument when funding is accepted by OAR for work to be conducted by
   OAR employees, contractors, or grantees. Also, OAR may transfer funds
   to other agencies when legal authority exists to do so and the other
   agency is uniquely qualified to conduct the work or provide the
   services to OAR In these cases, an agreement between OAR and the other
   agency must be executed to support the transfer of funds. There are two
   generic types of agreements which may be further categorized with
   sub-types, and each type is discussed below. B.02. Understand the
   Generic Types of Agreements. There are basically two types of generic
   agreements: a. Agreements with No Funding Arrangements or General
   Collaborative Agreements. These agreements simply refer to those
   relationships between OAR and another Party (e.g., Federal, State or
   local governments, universities or foreign entities) that do not
   involve any financial arrangements or do not involve any transfer of or
   acceptance of funds between the Parties to the Agreement. NOAA Line
   Offices, including OAR, used to refer to these relationships as
   MOAs/MOUs within NOAA. The term, MOA/U, is now defined by DOC as a
   generic term that simply refers to an arrangement with the Department
   that is not a contract, a grant or a cooperative agreement but rather a
   non specific description that is commonly used to refer in general, to
   any one of the agreements covered by this User Manual. Therefore, NOAA
   coined the term "General Collaborative Agreements" to describe those
   types of relationships between OAR and other agencies that do not
   involve any financial arrangements. Many individuals still refer to
   those types of relationships as "Unfunded Agreements;" however, that
   term is a misnomer and is inappropriate to use because any agreement
   where NOAA/OAR promises to do something involves "funds" in the sense
   of employee salaries, time, office expenses, and other program or OAR
   time and expenses. A General Collaborative Agreement is nothing more
   than a commitment between the Parties to cooperate on some broad-based
   issues of mutual interest, which may be subject to specific funding
   arrangements at a later date when specific projects or activities are
   developed and definitized by the Parties. When this phase occurs, the
   Parties develop and execute a more specific and definitive agreement.
   b. Agreements with Funding Arrangements. These agreements either
   involve incoming funds, otherwise know as reimbursable or "receivable
   agreements,"wherein OAR accepts funds for specific services rendered to
   the other Party, or outgoing funds, commonly referred to as "payable
   agreements," wherein OAR transfers funds to an outside agency or
   reimburses the servicing organization or agency in return for specific
   goods or services rendered. 1. Reimbursable/Receivable Agreements.
   These are Agreements under which payments for services rendered are
   made on a cost-reimbursable basis; therefore, the agreement must have a
   statutory authority to commit funds. It is DOC policy to provide
   special services on a cost reimbursable basis to Federal agencies and
   other governmental instrumentalities (including NOAA/OAR operating
   units), private persons, commercial organizations and non-profit
   organizations only when the following conditions apply. 16 (a) The
   services would not be considered to be in competition with private
   enterprise. In the case of research activities and special studies,
   these would be projects that cannot be done at all or done as
   effectively by a private research agency because basic data, knowledge,
   or facilities needed to accomplish the project are available only in
   NOAA/OAR. (b) The end results of the project will serve the public
   interest and are consistent with NOAA/OAR programs. (c) Undertaking the
   project will not result in the diversion of OAR resources to the
   detriment of the basic programs of the operating unit. (d) Undertaking
   the project will not result in controversy which will have an adverse
   effect upon the reputation of NOAA/OAR for impartiality and
   objectivity. (e) A written agreement is entered into covering the
   service(s) to be performed and such agreement shall provide, unless
   determined otherwise for good reason shown and documented, that no
   exclusive proprietary interest shall accrue to the individual or group.
   For Special Studies, the Agreement shall also provide that the results
   of special studies are the joint property of the individual group and
   of NOAA/OAR, and that NOAA/OAR may publish or make use of the results
   of studies without any obligation to the sponsor.) (f) The Agreement is
   authorized by law. Examples of specific reimbursable agreements
   authorized by statutes are Economy Act Agreements, wherein OAR is the
   servicing agency and is providing specific goods and services to
   another Federal agency; Special Studies Agreements; Intergovernmental
   Cooperation Act Agreements; Government- Wide General User-Fee
   Agreements; and Operating Unit Special Agreement. (See paragraph
   B.03.b. below for further discussion of the most common types of
   Receivable Agreements authorized by law or statute.) Agreements which
   involve incoming funds are generally referred to as reimbursable
   agreements within NOAA/OAR and are assigned their respective 2.
   Agreements Involving Outgoing Funds/Payable Agreements ). These
   agreements are also authorized by specific statutes and involve the
   transfer of NOAA/OAR funds to another Federal agency, and/or to a
   non-Federal agencies as reimbursement for specific goods or services
   received by NOAA/OAR. These are agreements, otherwise referred to as
   "payable agreements." Payable agreements are tracked by OAR but not
   assigned RTP numbers by the Budget Office. As with reimbursable
   agreements (i.e., receivable agreements), it is DOC/NOAA policy to
   transfer funds to other Federal agencies and other government
   instrumentalities (including NOAA/OAR operating units), private
   persons, commercial organizations, and non-profit organizations only
   when the following conditions apply. 17 (a) The work would not be
   considered to be in competition with private enterprise because of the
   other agency's unique expertise. (b) The results of the work will not
   result in controversy that will have an adverse effect on the
   Department's reputation for impartiality and objectivity. (c) No
   exclusive proprietary interest would accrue to the other Party. (d) The
   transfer of NOAA/OAR funds is in the best interest of the Federal
   Government. [Note: If the funds are to support a contract, cooperative
   agreement or grant, the transfer should include the contract, grant or
   cooperative agreement number, if known.] (e) Specific legal authority
   exists to justify the transfer of funds as an appropriate undertaking.
   Examples of statutes that authorizes NOAA/OAR to transfer funds are the
   Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535), and other statutes unique to NOAA/OAR
   as a result of specific legislation. When in doubt as to what legal
   authority should be invoked in your respective agreements, the Project
   Officer should consult with the appropriate NOAA or DOC Legal Counsel
   Office. (See paragraph B.03.a. below for further discussion of the most
   common types of Payable Agreements authorized by law or statute. ) As
   discussed in the foregoing paragraph B.02. "Understand the Generic
   Types of Agreements," OAR Program/Staff Offices enter into specific
   types of agreements when there are legal and programmatic authorities
   to do so and those agreements may involve incoming or outgoing funds
   depending on the nature of the project or effort. As OAR Program/Staff
   Offices have numerous special authorities, it is not practicable to
   cover all those agreements in this Manual because they are either
   covered in another DAO, NOAA Administrative Order (NAO), or are unique
   to specific OAR Program Offices. Therefore, OAR Project Officers should
   first consult with the OAR Liaison or servicing NOAA legal counsel to
   discuss the particulars of those special agreements not covered by this
   Manual but are authorized by special legislation. For example, Official
   Sponsorship Agreements and Agreements to Authorize Use of the Logo are
   types of special Agreements that are unique to some offices. CRADAs,
   governed by NAO 201-103, are also unique NOAA laboratories. In light of
   the above, only the most common types of agreements authorized by
   special legislation are further discussed in Part 3., "Unique
   Requirements of Specific Agreements." B.03. Choose the Right Type of
   Agreement Authorized by Statute. Crucial to negotiating an agreement
   with an outside Party is knowing from the beginning the type of
   agreement that should be used and the correct legal authority. Each
   type of agreement has different restrictions which must be considered
   before negotiating an Agreement. For example, if OAR intends to enter
   into an agreement with another Government agency under the Economy Act
   of 1932, as amended, (31 U.S.C. § 1535), it is important to know that
   agreements under this authority must achieve full cost recovery;
   therefore, a waiver of the full cost recovery requirement is not
   permitted. It is critical to know agreement types and the restrictions
   that 18 pertain to each type so that OAR does not enter into and
   negotiate an illegal relationship. Choosing the right type of Agreement
   can be a complicated issue. Therefore, it is advisable to obtain
   guidance from legal counsel or other resources early, particularly if
   one is considering entering into a relationship with an outside Party,
   and is unsure about the type of agreement that should be used or is
   unsure about restrictions that apply. Most "agreements" fall into one
   of 3 major categories: (a) OAR Purchases from Other Parties (i.e., OAR
   enters into a payable agreement involving outgoing funds); (b) Other
   Parties Purchase from OAR (i.e., OAR enters into a receivable agreement
   involving incoming funds); and (c) OAR enters into collaborative
   activities, such as "joint projects." The following is general guidance
   designed to help in choosing the right type of agreement and the
   correct legal authority. a. OAR Purchases From Other Parties (Payable
   Agreements). There are various ways or vehicles through which NOAA/OAR
   may purchase goods or services. In addition to purchases from the GSA
   or through the procurement process from the private sector, laws exist
   that may permit OAR to make purchases from other Federal Government
   agencies or major organizational units of the Department. The nature of
   the goods or services to be purchased will dictate the particular
   vehicle that may be used. The most common way to purchase goods or
   services from another Federal Government agency or Federal Government
   organizational unit is via an agreement under the Economy Act of 1932,
   as amended, (31 U.S.C. § 1535). However, a purchase from another agency
   is permitted under the Economy Act only if a more specific statutory
   authority for the purchase does not exist and if the following
   conditions are met: (1) amounts for the purchase are actually
   available, (2) the purchase is in the best interest of the Government;
   (3) the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by contract from a
   commercial enterprise ( i.e., the private sector), as conveniently or
   economically; and (4) the agency or unit to fill the order is able to
   provide or acquire by contract the ordered goods or services. For
   additional guidance for entering into an Economy Act agreement for the
   purchase of goods or services from another Federal agency, see Part 3.,
   Section A, "Economy Act Agreements --Outgoing Funds." As stated in
   paragraph 2.(e) above, there are other special authorities that allow
   OAR to transfer funds to another Party. OAR can purchase research data
   from the National Science Foundation (NSF) by invoking the NSF Act of
   1950, 42 U.S.C. § 1873f, which authorizes other Federal agencies to
   transfer funds to NSF for the purpose of scientific and engineering
   research. b. Other Parties Purchase From OAR (Receivable Agreements).
   Several authorities permit other Parties to purchase goods or services
   from OAR. These authorities include the Economy Act (31. U.S.C. §
   1535), the Department-wide "Special Studies" statute (15 U.S.C. § 1525
   (first paragraph),and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (33 U.S.C.
   § 6505), and other special authorities. (See Appendix C.,"Statutes that
   Authorize NOAA/OAR to Enter into Agreements, Transfer, and/or Accept
   Funds."] 19 The type of agreement you choose when others are purchasing
   goods or services from OAR depends on (1) the type of good or service
   being requested and (2) the nature of the Party that is proposing the
   purchase, i.e., a Federal Government agency, a State or local
   government agency, a private sector entity, etc. For example, if the
   purchase request is from another Federal agency, provided a more
   specific authority does not exist, the agreement might be appropriate
   under the Economy Act. For guidance on entering into an Economy Act
   when another Federal Government agency is purchasing goods or services
   from OAR, see Part 3., Section B, "Economy Act Agreements - Incoming
   Funds." However, if a more specific legal authority exists pursuant to
   which the agencies may enter the agreement, that authority must be
   used. NEED A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT EXAMPLE , see Part 3., Section F,
   "Operating Unit Special Agreements Authorized by 33 U.S.C. 883e." If
   the agreement is with a State or local government, the correct type
   might be an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act Agreement pursuant to 31
   U.S.C. § 6505, which permits those State and local governments to
   purchase certain goods and services from the Federal Government. For
   additional guidance for entering into an Intergovernmental Cooperation
   Act Agreement, see Part 3., Section E, "Intergovernmental Cooperation
   Act Agreements." If another Party is requesting to purchase a study,
   the subject matter of which is within the authority of OAR, then the
   agreement type that should be used is an agreement pursuant to the
   Department's "Special Studies" authority, 15 U.S.C. § 1525 (first
   paragraph). This authority permits anyone to purchase from DOC (1)
   special studies on matters within the authority of the DOC, including
   preparing from its records special compilations, lists, bulletins, or
   reports, and (2) transcripts or copies of its studies, compilations,
   and other records. For additional guidance for entering into agreements
   under the "Special Studies" authority, 15 U.S.C. § 1525 (first
   paragraph), see Part 3., Section D, "Special Studies Agreements."
   Conveyance of special benefits to recipients, beyond those occurring to
   the general public, require the collection of user fees. User fees are
   to be collected in advance of, or simultaneously with the rendering of
   services, unless appropriations and authority are provided in advance
   to allow reimbursable services. Absent statutory authority to the
   contrary, user fees collected by OAR must be deposited into the
   Treasury. Detailed coverage for User Fees, can be found in Chapter 9,
   of the NOAA Finance Handbook, as amended by NOAA CFO/CAO memorandum on
   "Changes in NOAA's User Fee Policies and Procedures," dated August 7,
   2000, and OMB Circular A-25. "User Charges," and OMB Circular A-123,
   "Internal Control Standards for the Federal Government (Revised)." In
   accordance with the August 7. 2000, Pricing Policy memorandum which
   includes user fees, OAR Headquarter Staff will annually submit to the
   NOAA Finance Office through Management and Budget a listing of all
   special products and/or services showing the approved unit price, unit
   price review date, actual fee collections, and number of transactions.
   The Director OMI will sign an annual statement which certifies the
   accuracy and completeness of the information for all special product
   and/or services within the OAR Program/Staff Offices and Laboratories.
   20 c. OAR Collaborates with Other Parties. The third most common type
   of special agreement is one where the Parties collaborate on an
   activity or project. With regard to choosing the right type of
   agreement for collaborative activities, this can be a particularly
   difficult area, and it is often very prudent to obtain legal advice
   early to avoid "pitfalls." The most common type of special agreement
   for collaborative work at DOC is one authorized under the Department's
   "Joint Project" Authority (JPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1525 (second paragraph).
   The "Joint Project" authority permits DOC operating units to enter into
   projects with another Party if (1) the other Party is a nonprofit,
   research or public organization (such as a State and local government);
   (2) the project is of mutual interest to the Parties; and (3) the costs
   of the project are apportioned equitably. For further guidance for
   entering into agreements under the "Joint Project" authority, see Part
   3., Section C, "Joint Project Agreements." It is important to
   distinguish agreements under authorities such as the "Joint Project"
   authority from agreements that are for "financial assistance," as
   defined in the Federal Program Information Act, 31 U.S.C. § 6101(3).
   Financial assistance is the transfer of something of value (usually
   funds) to a recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of
   support or stimulation which is authorized by law. The most common
   types of financial assistance are "grants" and "cooperative
   agreements." These terms are discussed in Part 2., Section B,
   subsection B.01., "Apply the Principal Purpose Test." Confusion between
   "Joint Projects" and "Financial Assistance" is common, and
   unfortunately, results in outside criticism of programs and delays in
   implementing the intended goal. The purpose of a "Joint Project"
   Agreement differs significantly from an award of financial assistance,
   and cannot be used to award financial assistance to an outside Party,
   nor may the "Joint Project" authority be used to circumvent the
   statutory and regulatory prerequisites, which must be met in order to
   award financial assistance or to circumvent procurement laws and
   regulations. A key indicator that a proposed transaction or agreement
   is really "financial assistance" is if the share of costs for a project
   are predominately being borne by OAR. Another key indicator is when the
   primary activity that OAR is undertaking is merely transferring funds
   to the other Party. [An Agreement that sets forth as OAR's main
   responsibility the transfer of funds to the other Party to the
   agreement is not a type of agreement which the "Joint Project"
   authority authorizes.] For guidance concerning "Joint Projects," the
   Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Administration (AGC/Admin),
   General Law Division, should be contacted. For guidance concerning
   "Financial Assistance," the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for
   Finance and Litigation, Federal Assistance Law Division (FALD), should
   be contacted. Other legal authorities may be the basis of agreements
   for collaborative activities, such as the Federal Technology Transfer
   Act (15 USC § 3710a), which authorizes NOAA and OAR Laboratories to
   enter into CRADAs to collaborate with one or more non-Federal Parties
   under 21 which the NOAA Laboratory provides personnel, services,
   facilities, equipment, or other resources with or without reimbursement
   (but not funds) and the non-Federal Parties provide funds, personnel,
   services, facilities, equipment or other resources toward the conduct
   of specified research and development efforts consistent with the NOAA
   mission. [As explained in Part 1 of this User Manual, detailed guidance
   on CRADA's is not included in this Manual because adequate coverage is
   found in NAO 201-103.] 22 Section C. Drafting the Terms and Conditions
   of an Agreement To assist in developing the draft agreement, sample
   formats for the most common type of agreements can be found as Exhibits
   under the specific Agreement types described in Part 3., "Unique
   Requirements of Specific Agreements," of this User Manual. The format
   and construction of agreements may be dependent upon several factors --
   the type of agreement and internal operating procedures. In addition,
   the other Parties to the agreement may require specified formats (e.g.,
   EPA Form 1610.1, "Interagency Agreements," and DoD Form 1155, "Military
   Interdepartmental Purchase Request") that are not identical to OAR
   recommended formats. For these reasons, flexibility with respect to
   actual format is sometimes necessary so long as the essential
   provisions are included in the agreement. (Formats may vary depending
   upon the specific or unique requirements of each Party to the
   agreement.] C.01. Minimum Required Information for all Agreements. The
   following general information is required in all agreements entered
   into by OAR Program Offices, regardless of the type of agreement. a.
   Identification of all the Parties to the Agreement. Include the name
   and address of each organization, the respective Project Officers, as
   well as a single point of contact from each Party to the agreement for
   coordination purposes and resolution of issues. It is important to
   include their respective names, titles and telephone numbers and/or
   email addresses to facilitate communication and coordination. b.
   Agreement or Project Title. Include a title which briefly summarizes or
   describes the work to be performed under the agreement. c. Legal
   Authority. Cite the relevant statute that authorizes NOAA/OAR to either
   accept or transfer funds between the Parties entering into a specific
   type of agreement. (See Appendix C, "Statutes that Authorize NOAA/OAR
   to Enter into Agreements, Transfer, and/or Accept Funds.") d.
   Programmatic Authority. Cite the appropriate statute or law which
   authorizes the objectives of the agreement (e.g., applicable Public
   Law, United States Code (U.S.C.) citations, Executive Order(s), General
   Accounting Office (GAO) directive(s).) Also, cite any other pertinent
   references, such as DOC or operating unit directives, previous
   agreements, correspondence, or policy memoranda. (See Appendix C., "Key
   NOAA/OAR Programmatic Authorities and References.") e. Purpose, Scope,
   and Objectives of the Agreement. Describe the purpose, scope, and
   objectives of the agreement. The agreement must provide a comprehensive
   description of the terms of the agreement. Also include general
   introductory information about the functions of the Parties involved.
   This section should make clear in all cases the basis for mutual
   interest between the Parties to the agreement. The relevance to
   NOAA/OAR program interests should be included. 23 f. Responsibilities
   of Each Party to the Agreement. Define the division of responsibilities
   and commitments of each Party as precisely as possible, with separate
   paragraphs for each Party. Joint responsibilities should also be
   defined, as applicable. g. Funding Data/Information. Clearly identify
   if funds are to be committed under the agreement. The financial
   arrangements for all Parties to the agreement must be clearly
   stipulated. This includes a citation for an appropriation code
   particularly for Economy Act Agreements, as well as payment terms, and
   method of payment. If no funds are committed through the agreement, a
   statement should be included which makes it clear that the agreement is
   not an instrument which commits funds to any Party to the agreement. h.
   Period of Performance/Duration of Agreement. Specify a start date and
   end date. However, this requirement may be waived by the Approving
   Official when appropriate. If the requirement is waived, the official
   agreement file must contain a suitable justification and explanation of
   the reason why the agreement should not specify a period for the
   agreement. Also, if the term of the agreement will run for over five
   years, a proviso for periodic review of the agreement at least once
   every three years should be included "to determine whether the
   Agreement needs to be revised, renewed, or canceled." i. Provisions for
   Future Amendments/Modifications, or Termination. Include provisions for
   amending or terminating the terms of the agreement through mutual
   written consent of the Parties. An existing agreement may only be
   amended or modified by either Party unilaterally or bilaterally if the
   amendment is within the original Statement or Scope of Work (SOW)
   contemplated in the underlying agreement. An agreement may also be
   amended to extend the period of performance to allow the completion of
   the project or activities set forth in the agreement. An agreement may
   not be amended to add "new work" that is outside the scope of the
   original SOW. [See Part 5., Section B.01, "Processing
   Amendments/Modifications."] Either Party may also initiate termination
   action of an existing agreement by providing 30 or 60 days' written
   notice to the other Party. The authorized official for termination and
   cancellation purposes should generally be at least one level above the
   Approving Official. ] j. Method for Settlement of Disputes. Include
   provisions for resolution of disagreements between the Parties.
   [Suggested language is included in each of the sample Agreement formats
   found in this User Manual.] l. Appropriate Approving Signature Blocks.
   Include the signature line, name, title, address, and date of signature
   for each approving official. In order to be valid, all OAR interagency
   or other special agreements must include an original signature of the
   approving officials authorized to bind the Parties to the Agreement.
   C.02. Optional Provisions. Each agreement may include applicable terms
   and conditions. The following items should be considered for possible
   inclusion, as applicable in agreements. As not all items are
   appropriate for all situations, discretion must be used when 24
   preparing an agreement. The following provisions or information may be
   included in agreements, depending upon the nature of the agreement. a.
   Delegations of Authority, Channels, and Protocols for Working
   Relationships, and Liaisons, as Applicable. b. Administrative
   Regulations, Policies, and Procedures Applicable to the Work to be
   Conducted under the Agreement (e.g., travel or property management
   requirements, the Paperwork Reduction Act, or the Freedom of
   Information Act, etc.). c. Guidelines for the Release of Technical and
   Public Information Regarding the Project, Including Rights for Data
   Access and Use. d. Liability Issues. Liability may apply to projects
   involving flight of foreign-provided hardware on aircraft, balloons,
   rockets, satellites, and operation of U.S. equipment abroad. In
   addition, an agreement that involves the use of publications, business
   or technical information may also include indemnification language to
   protect NOAA/OAR and the Department from lawsuits alleging copyright
   violations, patent infringements, and the use or release of trade
   secrets. Agreement clauses may be added to provide that if such suits
   are brought against OAR or DOC, the other Party to the agreement will
   assist and cooperate in the OAR or DOC defense. OAR will not indemnify
   any outside Party unless specifically agreed upon by DOC-OGC.
   [Suggested Language (may be used as appropriate)]: "The Parties agree
   that, with respect to injury or damage to persons or property involved
   in the operations undertaken pursuant to this Agreement, neither Party
   will make claim with respect to injury or death of its own, its agents,
   its contractors', or its subcontractors' employees or damage to its own
   or its contractors' or its subcontractors' property arising out of or
   connected with this project, whether such injury, death, or damage
   arises through negligence or otherwise." e. Specific or General Budget
   Information. When appropriate, the total estimated costs and budget
   summaries for each Party may be required. f. Any Additional or Special
   Conditions Pertinent to the Agreement. PART III - UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS
   OF SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS Section A. Economy Act Agreements for Purchasing
   Goods or Services - Outgoing Funds 25 A.0.1. Description and
   Requirements a. Statutory Requirements. The Economy Act of 1932, as
   amended, 31 U.S.C. § 1535, permits Federal Government agencies to
   purchase goods or services from other Federal Government agencies or
   other major organizational units within the same agency. An Economy Act
   purchase is permitted only if: (1) amounts for the purchase are
   actually available, (2) the purchase is in the best interest of the
   Government, (3) the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by
   contract from a commercial enterprise, i.e., the private sector, as
   conveniently or cheaply as could be by the Government, and (4) the
   agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract
   the ordered goods or services. An Economy Act Agreement is similar to a
   contract in that it involves the purchase of goods and/or services by
   one Federal Agency from another. NOAA/OAR may be the requesting or
   ordering agency, which involves funds outgoing from OAR. (See Exhibit
   A-1, "Model Economy Act Agreement - Outgoing OAR Funds.") The Economy
   Act also permits OAR to be the servicing agency through an agreement
   involving funds incoming to OAR. If OAR is the servicing agency, see
   Section B, "Economy Act Agreements for Providing Goods or
   Services--Funds Incoming to OAR." b. Regulatory Requirements. The FAR,
   48 CFR 17.5 provides implementing guidance for Interagency Acquisitions
   pursuant to the Economy Act. The FAR provides that an order cannot be
   placed under the Economy Act when more specific statutory authority
   exist for the purchase from another Government agency. Purchases
   pursuant to the Economy Act are not exempt from the requirements of 48
   CFR 7.3, "Contractor Versus Government Performance." Thus, OMB Circular
   A-76 applies to Economy Act Agreements, and must be reviewed to ensure
   compliance with OMB Circular A-76. An Economy Act Agreement may not be
   used by an Agency to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on
   the use of funds; funds transferred under this Act remain subject to
   their original fiscal year availability. The performing agency must
   identify the actual cost of providing the goods or services.
   Undercharging or overcharging for the goods or services being provided
   is a circumvention of the appropriation process, and, in the case of
   undercharging, unfair and improper competition with the private sector
   may result. 1. Economy Act Orders. FAR 17.504, "Ordering
   procedures,"states that Economy Act orders should include: (a) a
   description of the supplies or services required; (b) delivery
   requirements; (c) a funds citation; (d) a payment provision; and (6)
   acquisition authority as may be appropriate. The agreement also must
   include a citation to the programmatic authority pursuant to which the
   requesting agency is engaging in the transaction. 2. Determination and
   Finding Requirements. Each Economy Act order shall be supported by a
   D&F and must be prepared and approved in accordance with the FAR
   17.503. The D&F shall state that: (a) use of an interagency acquisition
   is in the best interest of the Government; and (b) the supplies or
   services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by
   contracting directly with a private source. 26 If the Economy Act order
   requires contracting action by the servicing agency, the D&F shall also
   include a statement that at least one of the following circumstances is
   applicable. (a) The acquisition will appropriately be made under an
   existing contract of the servicing agency, entered into before
   placement of the order, to meet the requirements of the servicing
   agency for the same or similar supplies or services; (b) the servicing
   agency has capabilities or expertise to enter into a contract for such
   supplies or services which is not available within the requesting
   agency; or (c) The servicing agency is specifically authorized by law
   or regulation to purchase such supplies or services on behalf of other
   agencies. The Project Officer shall assist the contracting officer in
   preparing the required D&F. The D&F must be approved and signed by a
   contracting officer of the requesting agency with authority to contract
   for the supplies or services to be ordered, or by another official
   designated by the agency head, except that, if the servicing agency is
   not covered by the FAR, approval of the D&F may not be delegated below
   the Senior Procurement Executive of the requesting agency. [See Exhibit
   A-2, "Sample Economy Act Determination and Findings."] 3. Payment. An
   Economy Act Agreement must achieve full cost recovery; a waiver of this
   full cost recovery requirement is not permitted under any circumstance.
   Full cost recovery includes direct and indirect costs. Further, the
   Economy Act does not allow a Federal agency or unit to receive a profit
   when providing goods or services. Payment may be in advance or upon
   providing the goods or services ordered and shall be for any part of
   the estimated or actual cost as determined by the agency or unit
   filling the order. A bill submitted or a request for payment is not
   subject to audit or certification in advance of payment. Proper
   adjustments of amounts paid in advance shall be made as agreed to by
   the Heads of the Agencies or operating units on the basis of the actual
   cost of goods or services provided. Funds transferred under this act
   remain subject to their original fiscal year availability. An order
   placed or agreement made under the Economy Act obligates an
   appropriation of the ordering agency or operating unit. The amount
   obligated is deobligated to the extent that the agency or unit filling
   the order has not incurred obligations before the end of the period of
   availability of the appropriation, in: (i) providing goods or services,
   or (ii) making an authorized contract with another person to provide
   the requested goods or services. NOTE: An agency cannot transfer funds
   to OAR to do something that the first agency cannot legally do for
   itself. 4. OMB Circular A-76 Coordination. (NOTE: this is proposed
   coverage pending further instructions from DOC or NOAA HQ persons
   responsible for OMB Cir. A-76 issues.) The OMB Circular A-76,
   Performance of Commercial Activities (Revised August 4, 1983)
   establishes Federal policy regarding the performance of commercial
   activities. In recognition of the fundamental importance of private
   enterprise and individual initiative, OMB-A-76 specifies that the
   general policy of the U.S. Government is to rely on the private sector
   to supply the products and services it requires. The revised Circular
   was promulgated to ensure enhanced efficiency in providing these goods
   and services and to establish techniques to 27 apply the Circular to
   all Federal agencies. Its reach encompasses scientific and technical
   research and development activities including those conducted by one
   Federal agency for another on transferred funds. For purposes of this
   Circular, a commercial activity is one which is operated by a Federal
   executive agency and which provides a product or service which could be
   obtained from a commercial source. A commercial activity is not a
   Government function. A commercial activity also may be part of an
   organization or a type of work that is separable from other functions
   or activities and is suitable for performance by contract. The
   Supplement to the Circular sets forth procedures for determining
   whether commercial activities should be performed under contract with
   commercial sources on in-house using Government facilities and
   personnel. For purposes of the A-76 coordination on Economy Act
   Agreements involving outgoing funds, the OAR Program/Staff Office will
   coordinate compliance with the Circular and its Supplement with the
   cognizant contracting officer servicing the initiating OAR
   Program/Staff Office. The contracting officers from NOAA Procurement or
   Administrative Support Center (ASC) (e.g., EASC, WASC, CASC etc.), in
   conjunction with the NOAA A-76 or OAR's A-76 coordinator, [it is not
   known whether this function will be delegated to NOAA Line Offices]
   will be responsible for determining compliance with the OMB Circular
   and its Supplement before signing the Economy Act D&F. As the Economy
   Act D&F has to support and warrant that the ordered goods and services
   are in the best interest of the Government and that the requesting
   agency (meaning the DOC operating unit) cannot obtain the supplies or
   services as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a
   commercial or private enterprise, ensuring compliance with the A-76
   requirements should also be considered. From the NOAA program offices
   perspective, many of their respective missions are mandated by statutes
   and such functions and responsibilities are unique to NOAA/OAR. As
   such, the Circular and its Supplement may not be applicable to many
   proposed agreements. A.0.2. Review and Clearance Procedures a.
   Submitting the Proposed Agreement for Review and Approval. [Follow the
   review and clearance procedures set forth in Part 4., "REVIEW AND
   CLEARANCE PROCEDURES."] b. Using the Economy Act Agreement Checklist.
   To ensure the completeness and accuracy of the agreement file, the
   Project Officer should review the draft agreement using Exhibit A-3,
   "Economy Act Agreement Checklist," before submitting the proposed
   Economy Act Agreement file to the Office of the Director OMI for review
   and clearance. c. Preparing the Transmittal Memorandum. All new Economy
   Act Agreements, amendments or modifications thereto, must be forwarded
   to Management & Organizational Development team, via a transmittal
   memorandum. The transmittal memorandum for the Economy Act Agreement
   should be addressed and sent to the Director OMI by the OAR 28 Program/
   Staff/ Laboratory Director initiating the agreement. The Director OMI,
   is responsible for obtaining legal clearance of all Economy Act
   Agreements, amendments, and renewals thereto. 1. Executive Summary. The
   transmittal memorandum serves as an Executive Summary and should
   include the following statements: (a) the services/tasks to be provided
   by the servicing Federal agency cannot be performed economically by OAR
   with its own facilities or by Government-wide service agencies (e.g.,
   Government Printing Office or the General Services Administration; (b)
   the performance of the tasks by the servicing agency is in the best
   interest of the Government; (c) the services/tasks to be provided by
   the servicing agency would not be considered in competition with the
   private sector; (d) the undertaking will not divert resources to the
   detriment of NOAA/OAR programs; (e) the services/tasks to be provided
   will not result in controversy that will adversely impact the
   Department; and (f) exclusive proprietary interests will not accrue to
   the other Party. 2. Additional Information to Aid in the Clearance
   Process. The transmittal memorandum should also include the following
   additional information: (a) OAR's Funding Program Office; (b) an OAR
   Organization Code; (c) Amount of Outgoing Funds; (d) OAR's Legal
   Authority; (e) OAR's Programmatic Authority; (f) Servicing Federal
   Agency; (g) Servicing Federal Agency's Programmatic Authority; (h)
   Subject/Key Word; (i) New/Existing Agreement; (j) Amendment No. and the
   OAR Agreement Code and/or Effective Date of date Underlying Agreement,
   if applicable; (k) Period of Performance; (l) Technical Point of
   Contact and Telephone Number, and (m) Administrative Point of Contact
   and Telephone Number. [See Exhibit A-4, "Sample Economy Act Agreement
   Transmittal Memorandum - Outgoing Funds." A.0.3. Approval and Signature
   Authority. [Follow the approval and signature authority set forth in
   Part 4., Section C.01., "Approval/Signature Authorities for Agreements
   Involving Outgoing Funds (Payable Agreements)."] 29 EXHIBIT A-1 MODEL

   you are purchasing] FROM [Name of servicing Federal agency] OAR
   Agreement Code: (Number) [Note: This format is for use only to order
   goods or services from another Federal agency.] 30 I. PARTIES AND
   PURPOSE This Interagency Agreement is between the [name of OAR
   Program/Staff Office], U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and [name of
   servicing Federal agency] through which [name of OAR Program/Staff
   Office] will pay [name of servicing Federal agency] for [provide a
   general description of the good/service for which OAR is paying]. II.
   BACKGROUND [Provide relevant background information which addresses why
   OAR (i.e., your organization) is requesting the goods/services.] III.
   AUTHORITIES A. The legal and programmatic authorities for NOAA/OAR are
   the Economy Act of 1932, as amended, (31 U.S.C. § 1535) and the [Set
   forth OAR's authority under which it is making the purchase for
   goods/or services, i.e., the programmatic authority to which the
   purchase is related.]. B. [Set forth the servicing Federal agency's
   programmatic authority for engaging in the types of activities
   contemplated under this Agreement.] IV. ECONOMY ACT FINDINGS As set
   forth in the attached D&F pursuant to 48 CFR 17.503," [name of OAR
   Program/Staff Office/Laboratory ] warrants that sufficient funding
   amounts are available, that this Agreement is in the best interest of
   the United States Government, and that the services requested cannot be
   provided by contract as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial
   enterprise. [Pursuant to 48 CFR 17.503, if the Economy Act order
   requires contracting action by the servicing agency, there also must be
   a determination that at least one of the following circumstances is
   applicable: (1) The acquisition will appropriately be made under an
   existing contract of the servicing agency, entered into before
   placement of the order, to meet the requirements of the servicing
   agency for the same or similar supplies or services; (2) the servicing
   agency has capabilities or expertise to enter into a contract for such
   supplies or services which is not available within the requesting
   agency; or (3) the servicing agency is specifically authorized by law
   or regulation to purchase such supplies or services on behalf of other
   agencies. Accordingly, if the order requires such contract action, the
   agreement also must include a 31 statement such as: "[Name of OAR
   Program/Staff Office] warrants [choose one of the above 3 situations
   which applies]."] [Name of other agency] warrants that it is able to
   provide or get by contract the requested services. [If the Agreement
   requires contracting action by the servicing agency, it must also
   include the following sentence: " [Name of servicing Federal agency]
   warrants that it has adequate statutory authority for the contractual
   action and will comply fully with the competition requirements of Part
   6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation as well as all other legal or
   regulatory requirements applicable to the contract."]2 V. TERMS AND
   CONDITIONS [State the terms and conditions of the Agreement, i.e., what
   it is specifically that you are purchasing, delivery requirements, and
   the amount that the other Federal Agency will receive as payment. The
   goods/services ordered must further the mission of the Department.
   Orders that would divide the costs of goods or services among agencies
   participating in events such as conferences, etc., on a basis other
   than each agency paying only for what it receives are not appropriate.
   You should discuss such an arrangement with the General Law Division,
   AGC/Admin (202-482-5391) prior to drafting an Agreement. You may
   reference an attached Statement of work under this Section]. VI.
   PAYMENTS/TRANSFER OF FUNDS [Explain the details of how OAR will pay for
   the goods/services, e.g., whether payments will be monthly, quarterly,
   etc. or in advance if required by the servicing agency.] Suggested
   Language: The total maximum cost liability to OAR for this Agreement is
   $ (specify dollar amount). Transfer of OAR funds to (name of servicing
   Federal agency) will be through the On Line Payment and collection
   System (OPAC) billing on a quarterly/monthly basis. The Agency Location
   Code (ALC) for NOAA is 13-14-0001. The appropriation out of which [name
