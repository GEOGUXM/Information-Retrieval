                  ARC Employees "Pole, Peddle, and Paddle!"

   Bend Oregon has had a "pole, peddle, paddle" competition for the past
   25 years. For the past 14 years the competition has included "The
   Albany Flames," now "The Flames," with some team members from the
   Albany Research Center. These guys used to have hair, dark hair even.
   But those days are over. This year the average age of the team was 65.
   They completed the race (a downhill ski leg from the top of Mount
   Bachelor, a 6 mile cross country ski leg, a 22 mile bicycle leg, a 4
   mile run, a 1.5 mile canoe leg, and a 200 yard sprint) in 2 hours and
   29 minutes, to finish second in their age group. The Flame burns on!!!

   ARC employees are Chuck Daellenbach (retired) on the right and Steve
   Cramer third from right.

   Congratulations!
