  ABSTRACT

   The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Environmental and
   Natural Resources Management Office of the U.S. Army Signal Center and
   Fort Gordon, Ga., documented the ecological condition of selected
   water-bodies on the Fort Gordon military installation from June 1999 to
   May 2000. This study includes stream-habitat assessments, aquatic
   invertebrate and fish-community surveys in selected stream reaches, and
   analyses of mercury and lead concentrations in largemouth bass
   (Micropterous salmoides) muscle tissue from three impoundments.

   Assessment surveys indicate lower habitat value scores in some streams
   draining the more developed areas on Fort Gordon. A small tributary to
   Butler Creek--which drains parking lots associated with military motor
   pools and other impervious surfaces--is characterized by moderate
   levels of bank erosion and excess sediment in the stream channel
   compared to reference sites. Four other stream reaches are more similar
   to reference streams in respect to habitat conditions. Invertebrate
   communities in streams draining these urbanized watersheds are
   inhabited by 13 to 16 taxa per reach; whereas, 23 and 33 taxa were
   collected from the two reference stream reaches. Measures of
   invertebrate abundance, taxa richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and
   Tricoptera Index are lower in streams draining urbanized watersheds.
   Measures of community similarity also indicate differences between
   streams draining urbanized areas and reference streams. Streams
   draining developed areas on Fort Gordon are inhabited by 3 to 10 fish
   species and included more species regarded as tolerant of degraded
   water-quality conditions; whereas, the two reference stream reaches
   support 4 and 10 species, respectively, including one species
   considered intolerant of degraded water-quality conditions.

   Mercury was detected in all largemouth bass collected from three
   impoundments on Fort Gordon. Wet-weight mercury concentrations in fish
   tissue analyzed from all sites range from 0.08 micrograms per gram to
   1.33 micrograms per gram. Median mercury concentrations in fish tissue
   are 0.83 micrograms per gram at Soil Erosion Lake, 0.72 micrograms per
   gram at Lower Leitner Lake, and 0.22 micrograms per gram at Gordon
   Lake. Median mercury concentrations in fish tissue analyzed from Soil
   Erosion Lake and Lower Leitner Lake are more than two times higher than
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommendation of 0.3 micrograms
   per gram for fish consumption. Lead concentrations are below the
   minimum reporting limit for all specimens analyzed from reservoirs
   sampled at Fort Gordon.
