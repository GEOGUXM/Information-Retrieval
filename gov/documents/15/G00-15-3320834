Location and Directions to the Lab

   The Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics is located at Goddard Space
   Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

LHEA
Code 660
NASA's GSFC
Greenbelt, MD 20771

By Metro

   Goddard Space Flight Center is located northeast of Washington DC. Via
   the Washington Metro, GSFC lies between the New Carrollton (Orange
   line) and Greenbelt (Green line) stations. Taxis or buses are available
   from both stations. Metro Map

By car

   Goddard Space Flight Center is located northeast of Washington DC and
   lies near the intersection of two major highways: the Washington
   Beltway (I-95/495) and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (MD 295). Area
   Map

   From Northbound I-95: Take Exit 22 NORTH (B/W Parkway) and stay to the
   right to go East-bound on MD 193. Five or six stoplights (two or so
   miles) later, you will see the main entrance to GSFC on your left. Turn
   in and pull into the parking lot. Get a visitor badge from the security
   office building. GSFC Map

   From Southbound I-95: Take Exit 22 NORTH (B/W Parkway) and exit at MD
   193 (first exit after the interchange). Turn LEFT at the light onto
   East-bound 193. Four or five stoplights (two or so miles) later, you
   will see the main entrance to GSFC on your left. Turn in and pull into
   the parking lot. Get a visitor badge from the security office building.
   GSFC Map

   From Northbound MD 295: Just outside the Beltway, exit at MD 193 Turn
   LEFT at the light onto East-bound 193. Four or five stoplights (two or
   so miles) later, you will see the main entrance to GSFC on your left.
   Turn in and pull into the parking lot. Get a visitor badge from the
   security office building. GSFC Map

   From Southbound MD 295: Exit at MD 193 (just after employee entrance to
   GSFC) and turn left at the end of the ramp onto Southway. Turn left
   again onto MD 193 East-bound. Five or six stoplights (two or so miles)
   later, you will see the main entrance to GSFC on your left. Turn in and
   pull into the parking lot. Get a visitor badge from the security office
   building. GSFC Map

From Airports

   BWI
   If you're renting a car, the easiest drive is from BWI. Taxi or drive
   south from the Airport on MD 295 - follow signs for Washington. After
   about 15 miles, use instructions above for Southbound 295. Airport Map

   Dulles
   Take the Dulles access road East toward Washington and exit at the
   Beltway (Northbound I-495). Stay on I-495 (keep right at the split with
   I-270) which will take you around the top of DC where the Beltway turns
   into I-95 South (keep left to remain on the Beltway). A few miles
   later, use the instructions above for Southbound I-95. Airport Map

   National
   Take the Metro. But if you must drive, there are several ways to get
   from National Airport to GSFC. One is easy and safe but long; several
   are shorter but only recommended for those who know a bit about
   Washington D.C. as the signs are poor or nonexistent. The short routes
   work best if the driver is not also the navigator. Airport Map
   Easy/long:Exit the airport, following the signs for the George
       Washington Memorial Parkway North. Once on the G W Memorial
       Parkway, stay on it (keep right when the road forks) for about 12
       miles until you get to the Captial Beltway (also known as I-495).
       Take the Captial Beltway (Inner Loop) North. Stay on I-495 which
       will take you around the top of DC where the Beltway turns into
       I-95 South. A few miles later, use the instructions above for
       Southbound I-95.
       Hard/short I: Follow the airport exit road North and merge onto the
       George Washington Memorial Parkway (going North) After
       approximately one mile, take the slip road to I-395 North
       (signposted for Downtown DC) Cross the Potomac using the Arland D
       Williams Jr Bridge (more usually known as the 14th Street Bridge)
       keeping in one of the righthand lanes (but not the rightmost lane).
       Bear right (staying on I-395) at the end of the bridge when
       lefthand lanes shoot off. You wish to exit the highway at South
       Capitol Street (South). This is approximately one mile from the
       14th Street Bridge. It is from the righthand lane, and is indicated
       by an overhead sign just after an exit for I-395 North. DO NOT GET
       IN THE RIGHTHAND LANE TOO EARLY or you will find yourself exiting
       prematurely. Keep on South Capitol Street across the Frederick
       Douglass Memorial Bridge. Just after you cross the Anacostia
       Freeway and the Anacostia River, take the unmarked left turn that
       will put you on the Anacostia Freeway going north. This will become
       the Baltimore Washington Parkway (MD 295). Follow instructions
       above for Northbound 295.
       Hard/short II: MapQuest lists alternate directions which aren't for
       the faint-of-heart, but work for those who are familiar with the
       roads.
1: Take the airport exit towards GW PARKWAY NORTH.
0.3 miles

2: Merge onto GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL PKWY.
0.8 miles

3: Take the I-395 NORTH/US-1 NORTH exit towards WASHINGTON.
