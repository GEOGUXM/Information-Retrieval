   The Department of General Administration operates Consolidated Mail
   Services (CMS), a full-service mail operation providing state, federal,
   county and local government with safe, secure, reliable and efficient
   processing of outgoing, incoming and campus mail.

   [mailman.jpg] CMS picks up and delivers on a daily schedule (Monday
   through Friday) to 66 cities in 11 Western Washington counties. We
   receive incoming U.S. mail and distribute it to agencies located in the
   Thurston County area. CMS can presort and bar code First Class mail to
   meet automation requirements for the U.S. Postal Service. We also
   process and maintain manifests on parcels up to 70 pounds and provide
   late-day shipping of expedited (overnight) mail. Our insert section can
   burst, trim, fold, insert, and label standard mail and help design and
   process self-mailer pieces. The current state mail contract is
   available for viewing in Microsoft Word 97 format.

   [bullet.gif] New Information!
   Important information concerning US Postal Service regulations that may
   affect your agency.

   Under advice from the GovernorÂ’s Commission on Efficiency and
   Accountability in Government, Consolidated Mail Services (CMS) was
   created in 1991 to centralize mail service for Washington State
   government. The Commission found that effective implementation of a
   centralized mail service would save state government mailers in excess
   of 20 million dollars over a five year period.
