                             The IMDC Mission is to:
     * Develop, define and design mission system concepts to support
       pre-formulation and formulation phase activities
     * Leverage engineering expertise to provide an integrated data
       product in a timely and cost effective manner

         The IMDC provides specific engineering analysis and services for
    mission design, and provides end-to-end mission design products with
                         capabilities that include:
     * Mission Studies, including System/Subsystem Concepts, Requirements,
       and Trades
     * New Technologies & Risk Assessments
     * Technical Reviews & Focused Studies
