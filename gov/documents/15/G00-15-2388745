About the Department of Ecology

   Ecology is Washington's principal environmental management agency. Our
   mission is to protect, preserve and enhance Washington's environment,
   and promote the wise management of our air, land and water for the
   benefit of current and future generations. Our goals are to prevent
   pollution, clean up pollution, and support sustainable communities and
   natural resources. Our values include environmental stewardship,
   environmental justice, environmental education, community spirit,
   professional conduct and expertise, accountability, and our employees.

   The best starting point to learn about Ecology is our 2001-2003 Agency

   are provided below to the major elements of this Overview along with
   links to the home pages of the agency's ten major environmental
   management programs.
