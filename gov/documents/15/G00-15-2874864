   Research Facilities

   Center for Gravitational Biology Research

      The Center for Gravitational Biology Research facilities are operated
      by the Life Sciences Division Facility Utilization Office (FUO). Each
      facility is under the direction of a Principal Investigator/Science
      Director supported by a team of dedicated engineers and laboratory
      technicians. The FUO staff is available to assist visiting
      investigators with experiment planning and implementation. These NASA
      facilities are a National Resource available to qualified researchers
      throughout the world. The FUO encourages investigators to send detailed
      proposals explaining how they would exploit the unique capabilities of
      the hardware.

   Space Shuttle Hardware

      The Life Sciences Laboratory Equipment (LSLE) catalog provides an
      inventory of equipment that has been utilized on flights integrated
      into the middeck, Spacelab, and Spacehab facilities aboard the Shuttle
      Transporation System (STS), or the Bion biosatellite. The equipment
      described was developed under the management of the Payloads and
      Facilities Engineering Branch, Life Sciences Division, Ames Research
      Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Moffett Field,
      CA 94035.

   Space Station Biological Research Project

      Features of the Space Station Facilities will include multiple habitats
      to support a variety of organisms, a centrifuge with a selectable
      rotation rate to house specimen habitats at a variety of gravity
      levels, a holding rack to house specimens at microgravity, and a fully
      equipped workstation/glovebox. The laboratory will also provide
      microscopes, freezers, and other research equipment to conduct
      experimental procedures.
