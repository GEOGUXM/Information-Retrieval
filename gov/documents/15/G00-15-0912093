   Dust Studies in Southern Nevada and California Deserts

   [dustFish_icon.JPG] The arid regions of the southwestern United States
   are as well known for their sudden dust storms on windy days as for
   their limitless vistas on quiet days. Dust storms are produced by the
   interaction of strong winds (which can be as small as little funnels or
   as large as fast-moving regional air masses), fine-grained surface
   material, and scanty vegetation, conditions which are widespread in the
   desert Southwest but that vary greatly from year to year.

   [dustOwens_icon.JPG] These photographs show a large dust storm in Owens
   Valley, California (below), and in Fish Lake Valley, Nevada (above).
   Dust storms are extremely common in Owens Valley because the former
   Owens Lake dried up due to water diversions by the City of Los Angeles
   during the 1920's (as glamorized [swloc_icon.JPG] in the movie
   Chinatown), and the sediments are easily deflated (eroded by wind) from
   the dry lake bed. [Click on a photo to see the full image.] These dust
   storms took place in valleys shown in the box on the shaded relief map.

   Although most people are aware of the obvious effects of dust storms
   such as vehicle crashes on highways, erosion of topsoil, and dust in
   electronic equipment, many of the less obvious but very important
   effects of dust storms are not well known. For example, dust that is
   deposited on the ground surface can be carried downward into the soil
   by rain to provide important nutrients for desert plants. In fact,
   soils in the southwestern U.S. and in many wetter places to the east
   contain large amounts of material that originated as dust. The U.S.
   Geological Survey began a dust-sampling and soils project in southern
   Nevada and California in 1984 to investigate the conditions and the
   kinds of sources that presently produce dust (including disturbance due
   to human activity), and to relate modern dust composition to the dust
   contained in desert soils.

   [greenval_icon.JPG] This photograph [view full image] illustrates some
   of the many links between dust storms, floods, and human disturbance in
   the desert. Storms caused flash floods and debris flows throughout the
   Mojave Desert in the summer of 1984, and some of these resulted in the
   destruction of new homes that had been built on alluvial-fan surfaces
   that were thought to be inactive. Floods pick up and deposit loose
   sediment that, when dry, is very susceptible to remobilization in dust
   storms. The dust-trap data shows that dustfall rates were higher in
   1984 and 1985 throughout the Mojave Desert than in other years due to
   the 1984 storms. In addition, data from dust traps near urban areas
   like Las Vegas shows that the spread of housing and other human
   construction across the desert directly causes increases in dust storms
   by destabilizing the surface and the vegetation.
