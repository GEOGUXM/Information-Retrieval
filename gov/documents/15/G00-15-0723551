   The Computational Methods and Algorithms Group (CMAG) designs and
   develops high performance application software, computational tools,
   scientific databases, and scientific computing systems for the modeling
   and simulation of biological systems, analysis and visualization of
   biomedical data, and the archive and management of biomedical images.
   CMAG provides expertise in bioinformatics, high performance parallel
   computing, hardware and software engineering, computational science,
   signal processing and pattern recognition, and database and information
   technology to solve complex biomedical problems.  CMAG deploys modern
   and non-traditional computer architectures in Parallel Processing,
   Client/Server, and Web-based Computing environments for NIH intramural
   researchers.

   Scientific Resources: CMAG supports various application software and
   computational tools for  the analysis and visualization of microarray
   gene expression data and human genetic linkage.  Visit CMAG's Genetic
   Analysis Software webpage to learn about application software and
   computational tools that are available on CIT's high performance
   computer systems.
