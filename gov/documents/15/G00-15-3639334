      FELCOM - Join FELLOW-L

         The FELLOW-L list was created to promote fellowship between
         postdoctoral staff and to provide a forum for educational, scientific
         and employment issues. The number of subscribers has grown to over 1000
         and geographically extends from Bethesda to Baltimore, North Carolina,
         and Montana. The list is among the largest serving bench scientists at
         the NIH.

         To subscribe to FELLOW-L, send e-mail to listserv@list.nih.gov with the
         body of the message saying: subscribe fellow-l

         FELLOW-L is moderated -- posts should be sent to fellow-l@list.nih.gov.
         If appropriate, they will be forwarded to the list by the FELLOW-L
         volunteer staff. Resumes, commercial advertising, or nonscientific
         solicitations are not appropriate. For more information, see the FELCOM
         web and FELLOW-L guidelines.
