   Explanation: Is the Moon larger when near the horizon? No -- as shown
   above, the Moon appears to be very nearly the same size no matter its
   location on the sky. Oddly, the cause or causes for the common Moon
   Illusion are still being debated. Two leading explanations both hinge
   on the illusion that foreground objects make a horizon Moon seem
   farther in the distance. The historically most popular explanation then
   holds that the mind interprets more distant objects as wider, while a
   more recent explanation adds that the distance illusion may actually
   make the eye focus differently. Either way, the angular diameter of the
   Moon is always about 0.5 degrees. In the above time-lapse sequence
   taken near the end of last year, the Moon was briefly re-imaged every
   2.5 minutes, with the last exposure of longer duration to bring up a
   magnificent panorama of the city of Seattle.
