     Welcome to Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) Website

   ESA en Espa√±ol [II.gif] [internship.gif]

   The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) is the bureau within
   the U.S. Department of Commerce where economic and social change is
   chronicled, understood, and explained. Many political and business
   decisions are based upon the economic and demographic information
   produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Census Bureau, and
   STAT-USA. ESA has three primary missions: 1) maintain the highest
   possible quality Federal statistical system and make improvements where
   warranted and feasible, 2) communicate a vision of the key forces at
   work in the economy and of the opportunities they create for improving
   the well-being of all Americans, and 3) support the information and
   analytical needs of the Department and the Executive Branch.
