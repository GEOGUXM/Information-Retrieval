     Have you tried PERSonal Access?

     PERSonal Access is your self-service area. If you have a PIN number,
     you can view your latest Annual Member Statement and do a
     "personalized" retirement benefit estimate. The new calculator
     automatically uses information from your Annual Member Statement to
     give you a more accurate retirement estimate.

     Don't have a PIN? You can request your PIN by selecting "Register
     Now" from the main PERSonal Access menu. Then, just follow the
     instructions and your PIN number will be mailed to you within 5
     business days. If you don't have a PIN, you can still use the
     retirement planning calculator by entering your own data.

              Click here to experience CalPERS PERSonal Access.
