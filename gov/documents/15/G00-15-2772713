     __________________________________________________________________

   Where can I register for the USFA NFIRS Software?
   Registration is offered through the NFIRS 5.0 web site. Users are
   granted access only if their state has agreed to be a participant in
   the NFIRS program. To find out if your state is participating, please
   contact your State NFIRS Program Manager.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is the USFA NFIRS 5.0 software free?
   The USFA will make the software available at no cost to the state level
   agencies responsible for incident reporting on their request. If those
   agencies so choose, they may use and support it in their state.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Can I use vendor software to send Fire Department and incident data to
   the National Database?
   Files from vendor software will be recognized by the National Database
   if the vendor has registered their software after development and
   testing in accordance with USFA specifications. The USFA maintains a
   list of vendors with Active status. Contact your State Program Manager
   for more information before using vendor software.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is the use of NFIRS 5.0 mandatory?
   NFIRS 5.0 is offered to all US States and territories in partnership to
   develop a more usable database of fire statistics. Each State-level
   Fire Administrator has been invited to participate in NFIRS 5.0,
   although participation is not mandatory by Federal statutes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   System Requirements:

   Is Internet access required?
   NFIRS 5.0 was designed to use the Internet to exchange and share data
   in a consolidated National database. Local, Metro, and State members of
   the fire community will file their reports into NFIRS National database
   over the Internet. Each time a user logs onto the National database, a
   check is made to ensure the user has the latest software version which
   includes bug fixes and enhancements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What are the System Requirements in order to use NFIRS?

   System Requirement Minimums:

   CPU        200 MHZ Pentium Class
   Memory     64 MB of RAM
   Hard Drive 20 MB available disk space
   Monitor    800x600 Resolution
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is Microsoft Access 97 (or Access 2000, FoxPro 6.0, MS SQL
   Server)?
   These are database programs. The NFIRS 5.0 application can use one of
   these programs as the database engine to manage and store the data
   entered in the Off-Line mode. If the user wishes to work in the
   Off-Line mode, one of the programs must be installed on the PC. Access
   97 or Access 2000 are used most often as the Off-line database engine.

   The database program must be installed prior to installing NFIRS 5.0
   application. The Data Entry Validation Tool Guide and the Readme.txt
   provide complete details.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I do not have Access 97, Access 2000, FoxPro 6.0 or MS SQL Server 7.0
   on my computer.
   During the installation of the NFIRS 5.0 software, the user must
   specify Custom Install. Refer to slides 24 and 25 of Chapter 1 in the
   Tutorial. http://www.nfirs.fema.gov/tutorial.htm

     __________________________________________________________________

   What do I do if I forget my password?
   Contact your State Administrator.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How often do I have to change my password?
   The User will be prompted to change their password every ninety days.

   Passwords can be changed prior to the 90 days. Select Change Password
   under the Advanced tab in the Data Entry Tool.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How long does it take to download the NFIRS 5.0 software?
   Download time depends on the user's connection to the interent and the
   amount of traffic on the internet.

   Users have the option of downloading the NFIRS software from 1 large
   file or download 4 smaller files. Downloading the 4 smaller files may
   increase a successful download and avoid interruption of their Internet
   connection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How do I know if I am using the most current version of the USFA NFIRS
   5.0 software?
   Contact the NFIRS Support Center who can assist in identiying if the
   version of the USFA software on the PC is the most current.

   The 5.0 in NFIRS 5.0 is a system number, which is followed by the
   Software Version number, for example: Version 5.0. Updates to the
   Software Version can be identified by specific file dates in the NFIRS
   root directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is the difference between Off-Line and On-Line?
   Off-Line means the user is entering their incidents data into a
   Microsoft Access 97 database.

   On-Line means the user enters the incident data directly into the
   National database while connected to the internet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How do I change from Off-line to On-line?
   Open the Configuration Tool and click on the Advanced Tab. Check the
   box for On-Line database. Click Save...OK...Exit. See Configuration
   Tool User's Guide for more information.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I cannot login Off-Line. I keep receiving User Not Found...Please
   Reenter message.
   The user must complete a User Injection and Remote Synchronization
   before being able to login Off-Line. Refer to Section 4.2.1 of the Data
   Entry Validation Tool Guide for instructions, or to Section 3, Off-line
   Database Setup, for complete details.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am a registered user with an active password. After successfully
   downloading and installing NFIRS, I was denied access to the Data Entry
   Tool On-Line.
   The Configuration defaults to Off-Line Access when the software is

     __________________________________________________________________

   When I enter the Data Entry Tool, my FDID Number is correct but it says
   FDID not found.

   displayed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Can I enter my incidents Off-Line and then send them periodically to
   the National Database?
   Yes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How do I send my incidents to the National database?
   The User uses the Import/Export Tool which is located under the Tools
   tab in the Data Entry Tool. See Section 5.1 of the Data
   Entry/Validation Tool Guide for full details.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How can I tell if the incidents were sent successfully?
   Users may verify their incident data was sent successfully by logging
   in On-Line to the National database. Click on Incident from the Menu
   bar and then Open Incident. The Incident Search window will be
   displayed. Click on Search to search all incidents or narrow the search
   criteria by entering specific search requirements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is the Data Entry/Validation Tool case sensitive?
   The Data Entry/Validation Tool is not case sensitive.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What do the yellow fields represent?
   These are fields defined as National required fields. These fields must
   be completed in order for the incident to pass validation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is the System Administration Tool limited to the State and Federal
   levels, or is this something used at the Department level?
   The State NFIRS Program Managers from each state may assign if they
   choose System Administration privileges to a person(s) who would help
   in administration within the state or a group. The installation of the
   software is the same for both System Administrators and Department
   users. System Administration rights are given by permissions which are
   accessed by the System Administration Tool.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a Local department, do I send data through the state or should it be
   sent directly to the National server?
   You will need to contact your State NFIRS Program Manager to determine
   where your data should be sent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How far back should we go when reporting changes and deletes?
   Check with your State Program Manager for your state's policy on
   reporting changes and deletes. The USFA does not impose a limit, but
   some states do.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If a call is cancelled en route, what Incident Type should I enter?
   Incident Type 611, "Dispatched and cancelled en route." An Actions
   Taken code of 93, cancelled en route, is available.

   If you have questions about an individual incident and which codes to
   use to accurately report it, contact the NFIRS Support Center or your
   State Program Manager.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Can I print a copy of an incident?
   Yes, a Forms Based Incident Report (FBIR) can be generated and printed,
   one incident at a time, in either the On-line or Off-line mode. Refer
   to Section 4.2.5 of the Data Entry Tool Users' Guide for the complete
   instructions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Can a Forms Based Incident Report be generated if the incident is
   Invalid (I) or No Activity (N) status?
   Yes, an FBIR can be generated if the incident is Invalid or No Activity
   status. An FBIR cannot be generated, however, if an invalid code exists
   in the incident. If an invalid code exists in the incident, it will be
   noted in the Validation Errors and Warnings message window upon saving
   the incident.
     __________________________________________________________________

   About Vendors:

   How can I tell if a Vendor's software is certified with the USFA?
   The USFA no longer certifies vendor software. Vendors develop their
   product according to the specifications to be compatible with the
   national NFIRS 5.0 standard. Vendors notify the USFA when their product
   development has completed. The USFA then places the vendor on the
   Active Vendors List.
