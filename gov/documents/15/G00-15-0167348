   The Human Genome Project (HGP) is an international 13-year effort
   formally begun in October 1990 to discover all the estimated
   30,000-40,000 human genes and make them accessible for further
   biological study. Another project goal is to determine the complete
   sequence of the 3 billion DNA subunits (bases in the human genome). As
   part of the HGP, parallel studies are being carried out on selected
   model organisms such as the bacterium E. coli to help develop the
   technology and interpret human gene function. The DOE Human Genome
   Program and the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
   together make up the U.S. Human Genome Project.
