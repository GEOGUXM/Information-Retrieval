   Locate a Bus Stop
   There are over 900 bus stops within MTD's service area. All stops are
   marked with an easy-to-identify MTD sign, usually located at the top of
   a pole. Some bus stops have extra amenities such as benches, trash
   receptacles, and shelters.
   To locate the bus stop nearest you select a line number from the box
   below. A list of bus stops for that route will be produced, with all
   accessible stops clearly marked.

   Bus Stops of the Future
   MTD is improving its bus stops. Bus stop signs, benches, and trash
   receptacles are being redesigned or replaced. System maps, electronic
   kiosks and signs, and direct telephone information lines will be
   utilized to provide current schedule information. More shelters and
   lighting will be utilized for waiting passengers. Ultimately, the
   objective is to provide a pleasant transit experience for riders
   through greater comfort, increased safety, and improved information.
   Stay tuned to this web page as the Bus Stop Program progresses.
