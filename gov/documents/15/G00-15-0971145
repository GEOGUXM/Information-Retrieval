                        NASA/Orbital Sciences Government Civil Launch

                         Primary Mission Objectives

    Explore how particles are accelerated and energy is released in solar
                                   flares.

                            Primary Observations

   Simultaneous, high quality images and spectra of solar flares in X rays
                               and gamma rays.

                     Orbit/Point/Field of View/Lifetime

       Cicular, 600-km altitude, 38 degrees inclination to the equator
   To the center of the sun within 0.2 degrees, spinning at 15 revolutions
                                     per
                      Greater than full sun (1 degree)
                               Three (3) years

                              Imaging Technique

    Images are constructed using mathematical models, taking into account
       the spinning of the spacecraft and the special geometry of the
                                 instrument.
