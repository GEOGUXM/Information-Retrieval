   Introduction:

   Human Factors Engineering is the discipline of applying what is known
   about human capabilities and limitations to the design of products,
   processes, systems, and work environments. It can be applied to the
   design of all systems having a human interface, including hardware and
   software. Its application to system design improves ease of use, system
   performance and reliability, and user satisfaction, while reducing
   operational errors, operator stress, training requirements, user
   fatigue, and product liability. Select from the topics below for more
   detailed information:
       Design for Maintainability
       When human factors engineering is applied to minimize the time and
       effort required to perform preventive and unscheduled maintenance,
       it is referred to as designing for system maintainability. Hardware
       accessibility is optimized for the most frequent maintenance tasks,
       removable components are designed for human lifting, and field
       service manuals are designed for ease of use. Field observation
       techniques can also be developed to ascertain the level of effort
       required to maintain existing systems and to identify opportunities
       for system improvement.
       Hardware and Software Design
       Knowledge of human perceptual systems aids in designing or
       selecting display techniques or technologies in system interfaces.
       Human factors engineering applies what is known about human
       cognitive and motor output characteristics to the design and
       selection of required responses and control technologies used in
       human-machine systems. In preventing mismatches, this approach
       improves the communication between the human and the system.
       Usability Testing
       Usability testing is a technique used to quantitatively evaluate a
       given prototype design. It can range in rigor from conducting
       interviews and focus groups to detailed simulations using
       representative human subjects and system-related tasks. The metrics
       recorded during testing can be used to evaluate performance or to
       make comparisons among several candidate designs.
       Human Reliability Analysis
       Estimates of the likelihood that a human error will occur in a
       human-machine system scenario are useful in both quantifying system
       reliability and in identifying better designs that reduce the
       potential for human errors. The CSR has experts in several human
       reliability analysis techniques on staff.
