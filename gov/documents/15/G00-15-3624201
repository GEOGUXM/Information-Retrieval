   Public Health issues 2000-2001 Youth Health Services Report
   Student enrollment in program increases; services praised by students

   KING COUNTY, WA - Today, Public Health - Seattle & King County released
   the 2000-2001 Annual Report on Youth Health Services, a program
   partially funded by the Seattle Families and Education Levy. The report
   cites very high student enthusiasm and satisfaction with health center
   services.

   The complete Youth Health Services 2000-2001 Report can be viewed at
   www.metrokc.gov/health/yhs/yhs-2000-2001-report.pdf

   "We're on our way to improving the health of adolescents because it has
   become much easier for teens to access health care. Services are
   sensitive to adolescent needs and conveniently located in their schools
   and communities," said King County Executive Ron Sims.

   "Good health is a building block for academic success and better
   learning," said Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels. "Youth Health Services is a
   model program that is successful thanks to the broad support of the
   community."

   Public Health's Youth Health Services collaborates with local health
   care providers and public schools to administer 11 school-based and two
   school-linked health centers in Seattle and King County. These
   comprehensive primary care centers provide medical and mental health
   screening and treatment.

   Youth Health Services enrolled over 9,500 adolescents in Seattle and
   King County in order to provide them with comprehensive health services
   during the 2000-2001 school year. Enrollment increased by 19% from the
   1999-2000 school year.

   The Youth Health Services 2000-2001 report includes:
     * an overview of the program and its services
     * evaluation data from a user study of the school-based health
       centers
     * visit data from the school-based/linked health centers
     * comments and stories from students and staff

   "In the past, adolescents have been the group least likely to seek
   medical care, but this report shows that teens will access
   teen-friendly services," said Dr. Alonzo Plough, Director of Public
   Health - Seattle & King County.

   At eight Seattle Public High Schools (Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield,
   Nathan Hale, Rainier Beach, Roosevelt, Sealth, and West Seattle) with
   school-based health centers:
     * over 5,000 students were enrolled, 6% more than in 1999-2000
     * 35% of students in these schools were health center users
     * health center users made over 15,000 visits
     * 42% were illness-related visits; 25% were health maintenance
       visits; 23% were mental health visits; and 10% were other/unknown

   In 2000-2001, services continued at two Seattle Public Middle Schools
   (Denny and Washington). Services were expanded to Madison Middle
   school. At the middle school level:
     * over 1,000 students were enrolled, 44% more than in 1999-2000
     * 20% of students in these schools were health center users
     * health center users made over 2,400 visits
     * 55% were mental health visits; 26% were illness-related visits; 11
       % were health maintenance visits; and 8% were other/unknown

   At the two school-linked health centers in Renton and Highline:
     * over 3,300 youth were enrolled, 43% more than in 1999-2000
     * health center users made over 5,900 visits
     * 44% were health maintenance visits; 23% were other/unknown; 22%
       were illness-related visits; and 11% were mental health visits

   User study of the school-based health centers

   The report also includes main findings from a survey of school-based
   health center users completed in November 2001. The survey found:
     * health centers are the primary source of care for many of the
       students who are users.
     * 90% of student users report that being able to get health care at
       school helped them to be more attentive in class.
     * a large majority of student users report that they obtained care at
       the school-based health centers that they otherwise would not have
       received.

   Youth Health Services also provides administrative oversight for the
   Teenage and Pregnancy and Parenting Program (TAPP) and the SafeNet
   program. TAPP provides support, advocacy, and referral services to
   pregnant teens. SafeNet targets students struggling in their transition
   from elementary school to middle or junior high school, and then links
   them with agencies and needed services.
