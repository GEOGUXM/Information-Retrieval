                                     UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
                                     EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
                                      OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF COURT

   NOTICE TO ALL USERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. COURT’S
     PACER, WEBPACER, AND VCIS SYSTEMS INSTALLED IN THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY
                COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT effective June 6, 2000, the U.S. Bankruptcy
   Court for the Eastern District of California will be forced to cease
   participation in the Administrative Office of the U.S. Court’s PACER,
   WebPACER, and VCIS systems. This action will become necessary due to a
   cutoff of funding and support for these systems by the Administrative
   Office of the U.S. Courts.
   Alternative systems for providing access to the court’s electronic
   records have been developed. These new systems, known as e-CalPACER,
   e-CalWebPACER, and e-CalVCIS, should be operational in time for the
   anticipated cutoff, but initially may not fully replicate the
   functionality of the former Administrative Office systems. In
   particular, the toll-free (1-800) numbers for PACER and VCIS will no
   longer be provided, as local funds are not available to support their
   continuance. As a result, calls made to e-CalPACER and e-CalVCIS will
   incur toll or long-distance charges. You will, however, be able to use
   your currently assigned login and password codes to access e-CalPACER
   and e-CalWebPACER.
   By order of the Court, until further notice, the fee established
   pursuant to item 23 of the Bankruptcy Court Miscellaneous Fee Schedule
   (adopted pursuant to 28 USC §1930 (b)) for electronic access to court
   data via e-CalPACER and e-CalWebPACER is waived. Except for toll or
   long-distance charges incurred in connection with accessing e-CalPACER,
   there will be no charge for accessing public dockets. Access to
   electronic case documents on the court’s Electronic Case Files (ECF)
   system via e-CalWebPACER will continue to be provided free of charge
   and may be obtained by logging on to the court’s web site at
   www.caeb.uscourts.gov. Please be advised, however, that in the future,
   fees may be required for access to public dockets and electronic case
   records via e-CalPACER and e-CalWebPACER.
   General court information, including news updates on this and other
   subjects, local rules, calendars, and forms will continue to be
   available free of charge from the court’s web site.
   We regret any inconvenience this may cause you.

   Dated: June 5, 2000 Richard G. Heltzel
                       Clerk, United States Bankruptcy Court
