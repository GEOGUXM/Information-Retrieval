   Smith, Walden Introduce Legislation to Rehabilitate Wallowa Lake Dam, Improve
Water Management in Wallowa Valley

   Bill authorizes funds for dam rehabilitation, water management program

   WASHINGTON, D.C.Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Congressman Greg Walden
   (R-OR) today introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House
   of Representatives that would authorize $32 million in funds to be used
   by the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) for the rehabilitation of the
   Wallowa Lake Dam and the improvement of water management in the Wallowa
   River Basin.  The legislation entitled the Wallowa Lake Dam
   Rehabilitation and Water Management Act of 2001, will help implement
   the goals of the Wallowa Valley Water Management Plan.

   This bill is a balanced proposal to make improvements both to Wallowa
   Lake Dam and water management in the Wallowa River Basin, said Walden.
   It will benefit local agriculture, salmon recovery efforts, flood
   control, fish and wildlife habitat, and hydropower generation.  A
   federal investment in this project is vitally needed to repair
   structural deficiencies in the Wallowa Lake Dam, which prevent the lake
   from being filled to capacity.  The hard-working people of Wallowa
   County need and deserve these improvements, and I look forward to
   working with Senator Smith in getting this bill passed and signed into
   law.

   The Smith-Walden legislation is supported by a broad coalition of
   affected parties, including the Associated Ditch Company, the Grande
   Ronde Model Watershed Program and the Nez Perce Tribe.  The legislation
   also stipulates that the Nez Perce Tribe can construct a trap and haul
   facility that will be owned and operated by the tribe.

   Its always a satisfying feeling to work on legislation that benefits
   everyone involved, said Smith.  These improvements are desperately
   needed, and the community has much to gain with rehabilitation.  Im
   confident that Greg and I can get this legislation passed in a timely
   fashion so that work can begin as soon as possible.

   Congressman Walden represents the Second Congressional District of
   Oregon, which includes the 20 counties of southern, central and eastern
   Oregon. Rep. Walden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce
   Committee and The House Committee on Resources
