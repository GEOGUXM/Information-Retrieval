   The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent
   federal body established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L.
   105-33) to advise the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the Medicare
   program. The Commission's statutory mandate is quite broad: In addition
   to advising the Congress on payments to health plans participating in
   the Medicare + Choice and providers in Medicare's traditional
   fee-for-service program, MedPAC is also tasked with analyzing access to
   care, quaility of care, and other issues affecting Medicare.

   The Commissions 17 members bring diverse expertise in the financing and
   delivery of health care services. Commissioners are appointed to
   three-year terms (subject to renewal) by the Comptroller General and
   serve part time. Appointments are staggered; the terms of five or six
   Commissioners expire each year. The Commission is supported by an
   executive director and a staff of analysts, who typically have
   backgrounds in economics, health policy, public health, or medicine.

   MedPAC meets publicly to discuss policy issues and formulate its
   recommendations to the Congress. In the course of these meetings,
   Commissioners consider the results of staff research, presentations by
   policy experts, and comments from interested parties. (Meeting
   transcripts are available on this website.) Commission members and
   staff also seek input on Medicare issues through frequent meetings with
   individuals interested in the program, including staff from
   congressional committees and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
   Services (CMS), formerly known as the Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA), health care researchers, health care providers,
   and beneficiary advocates.

   Two reports - issued in March and June each year - are the primary
   outlet for Commission recommendations. In 2002, the Commissions March
   report will address a variety of payment policy issues. The June report
   will be devoted to the subject of modernizing Medicare benefits. In
   addition to these reports and others on subjects requested by the
   Congress, MedPAC advises the Congress through other avenues, including
   comments on reports and proposed regulations issued by the Secretary of
   the Department of Health and Human Services, testimony, and briefings
   for congressional staff.
