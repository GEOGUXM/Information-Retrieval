   profile by using the most recent data available from open sources. The
   data presented are as accurate as the sources from which they were
   drawn. The information contained in this profile should not be used to
   rank or compare States or jurisdictions, due to differences in data
   collection and reporting methods. Washington The following profile
   contains information on demographics, political figures, programs,
   crime, drug use, drug trafficking, and enforcement statistics.

   Programs/Initiatives Ø High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)3
   Designated in 1997, the Northwest HIDTA is responsible for the
   following Washington counties: King, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish,
   Thurston, Whatcom, and Yakima. Drug threats in this area include
   heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine. "Nazi" type
   methamphetamine labs are proliferating throughout the region. The
   importation of Mexican black tar heroin supplies by drug trafficking
   organizations remains at high levels, and the prices remain low. Ø
   Executive Office for Weed and Seed4 · Tacoma: The target area for the
   City of Tacoma Weed and Seed site is Central Tacoma (known as Hilltop),
   the downtown area, and the lower eastside of the city. The primary goal
   of this Weed and Seed site is to measurably reduce the prevalence of
   violent crime, drug trafficking, auto theft, and gang activity. · There
   are additional Weed and Seed sites located in Lakewood, Seattle
   (Central), SE Seattle, and Toppenish. Ø The Governor's Council on
   Substance Abuse5 This initiative was established by an executive order
   in 1994 in response to the significant human, social and economic costs
   substance abuse inflicts on individuals, families and communities in
   Washington State. Council members include private industries, local and
   tribal governments, treatment providers, community groups, educators
   and law enforcement. State government is represented on the Council by
   the directors of the seven state agencies providing substance abuse
   programs and one legislator for each Caucus of the House and Senate.
   This Council is responsible for working with State and local agencies
   and communities to develop common ONDCP Clearinghouse 2 substance abuse
   reduction goals and advising the Governor on substance abuse issues by
   providing recommendations for policy, program and research strategies.

   Drug data from Pulse Check sources:13 · Cocaine  The availability of
   powder and crack cocaine in Seattle increased from Fall 2000 to Spring
   2001. While adolescents are the predominant crack sellers in Seattle,
   young adults (ages 18-30) and older adults (over age 30) are the
   predominant users. · Heroin  According to law enforcement sources,
   heroin is widely available in Seattle with heroin use spreading to the
   suburbs. Some heroin users use additional substances such as
   benzodiazepines, marijuana, and cocaine. Heroin and powder cocaine are
   sometimes injected simultaneously, and heroin and crack are sometimes
   smoked sequentially. · Marijuana  Sources indicate that marijuana is
   sometimes laced with or dipped in embalming fluid. · Methamphetamine
   Young adults (ages 18-30) are the most likely age group to use
   methamphetamine in Seattle. Ø Meth labs are no longer just an urban
   problem in Washington State. The meth problem is spreading to rural
   areas, like Benton County, where 38 labs were discovered in 1999 and 19
   labs were discovered in the first quarter of 2000. The price of meth
   has remained stable in the region over recent years with large
   quantities selling for $560 to $860 per ounce, depending upon quality,
   and smaller 1/4 grams selling for $25-$35, and $80- $120 per gram
   (35-90% purity).14 Juveniles Ø In Seattle during 1999, almost half
   (48.6%) of high school students surveyed had tried marijuana at least
   one time in their lifetime. Percent High School Students Using Selected

   Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) provides preventive,
   rehabilitative, residential and transition programs for juvenile
   offenders. The goals are to hold these juveniles accountable for their
   crimes, protect the public and reduce recidivism. Approximately 82% of
   youth committed to JRA are drug involved.15 Ø There were a total of
   5,739 juveniles arrested for drug abuse violations in Washington during
   2000. This is an increase of 3,007 from 1999. ONDCP Clearinghouse 5

   Smuggling at the U.S./Canadian border is on the increase. Potent
   Canadian-grown marijuana is in demand throughout the U.S. creating
   cross-border smuggling events. Ø Shipments of Asian heroin often
   transit through Puget Sound's commercial port facilities with ultimate
   distribution in U.S. cities on the eastern seaboard. Ø More than 300
   small islands provide Washington with 3,026 miles of internal shoreline
   increasing the maritime smuggling potential. Maritime drug seizures in
   these waters are on the rise. Ø The FY 2000 Northwest HIDTA Threat
   Assessment identified 60 drug trafficking organizations posing a
   criminal threat in the seven HIDTA counties.16 Ø During 2000, there
   were 26,851 marijuana plants eradicated under the Drug Enforcement
   Administration's Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program.17

   made and 222 weapons seized as a result of the DEA's Domestic Cannabis
   Eradication/Suppression Program. $2,997,627 in assets was also seized
   under this program in 2000.18 Ø The Washington Department of Ecology
   tracks all responses to meth labs statewide. This department's data
   shows a steadily increasing number of illegal drug labs statewide from
   1990 when just 38 illegal labs were reported, to 1999 when 789 illegal
   ONDCP Clearinghouse 6 drug labs were reported. More than 40% (318) of
   the meth labs reported in 1999 were in the urban area of Pierce County.
   Pierce County's Executive has estimated the county budget is $1 million
   per year for fighting meth problems in Pierce County. Not even the more
   populous King County, with 107 meth labs reported in 1999, comes close
   to the level of meth labs reported for Pierce County. From January 1 to
   March 31, 2000, the Department of Ecology received reports of 362
   illegal labs across the State.19 Enforcement Ø The Northwest HIDTA's
   initiatives blend a variety of law enforcement and demand reduction
   initiatives into a unitized approach to countering the drug threat in
   the Pacific Northwest. Some Northwest HIDTA initiatives include:20 ·
   Northwest HIDTA Border Task Force: This is a multi-agency collocated
   task force responding to increases in drug smuggling on the
   U.S./Canadian border. Integrated Border Enforcement Teams were
   developed and deployed in partnership with Canadian authorities. The
   initiative also funds a State Prosecutor to handle border arrests
   requiring State prosecution. · Community Coalition Support Initiative:
   This initiative provides resources to substance abuse prevention
   coalitions in each Northwest HIDTA county in order to develop a
   region-wide demand reduction strategy in collaboration with law
   enforcement agencies and others. · Drug Court Development: This
   initiative provides resources to drug court programs in each Northwest
   HIDTA county. It coordinates and leverages resources in order to
   enhance the capacity of such programs to provide individualized
   treatment and services to chronic, career drug offenders who are to be
   adjudicated for drug-related crimes. · Investigative Support Center:
   This is a collocated intelligence initiative that brings members from
   several agencies together in office space provided by DEA. The
   program's components include full intelligence analyst support on
   investigations, information research, strategic research on general
   threat topics or specialized situations, post seizure analysis and
   document exploitation, critical event deconfliction and the loan of
   specialized electronic evidence gathering equipment. Ø In the seven
   county area served by the Northwest HIDTA, there are eight Byrne
   Grant-funded, multi-jurisdictional narcotics task forces. There are
   also four DEA task forces, and one city/county task force.21 Ø As of
   October 31, 2000, there were 13,670 full-time law enforcement employees
   in Washington. Most (9,580) were sworn officers and the rest (4,090)
   were civilian employees.22 Courts Ø As of August 8, 2001 there were 37
   drug courts in Washington that have already been implemented or are
   being planned. Of these, 16 have been operating for over two years, 4
   have recently been implemented, and 17 are being planned.23 Ø During FY
   2000, 26.4% of Federally sentenced offenders in Washington were drug
   offenders. The majority of offenses involved marijuana (31.4%) followed
   by powder ONDCP Clearinghouse 7 cocaine (26.4%), methamphetamine
   (23.8%), heroin (10.0%), crack cocaine (5.7%), and substances that
   don't fall under these categories (2.7%).24 Corrections Ø As of October
   31, 2001, the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) population was
   15,359.25 Ø At the end of 2000 (December 31), there were 160,977 adults
   on probation and 160 adults on parole in Washington.26 Consequences of
