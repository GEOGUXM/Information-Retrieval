   Blueball Objective:
          This webpage was developed to help improve cooperation and
          collaboration between the United States Department of
          Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Geological Survey
          (USGS) on Animal Feeding Operation (AFO) studies and
          investigations, including identifying common interest, research
          needs, and available data.

          information including: the proposed CAFO Rule and PNPs (Permit
          Nutrient Plan) versus CNMPs (Comprehensive Nutrient Management
          Plans).
          Redball USDA - CSREES - Animal Waste Management: An Initative
          for the Cooperative Extension System. The national extension and
          research system in partnership with other federal, state and
          local agencies, will provide education and information to
          agricultural producers, agricultural businesses and federal, and
          state and local officials to maintain animal production and meet
          environmental standards.
          Redball USDA - EPA - Draft, Unified National Strategy for Animal
          Feeding Operations (September 11, 1998): In February of this
          year, President Clinton released the Clean Water Action Plan
          (CWAP), which provides a blueprint for restoring and protecting
          water quality across the Nation. The CWAP describes over 100
          specific actions to expand and strengthen existing efforts to
          protect water quality. It also identifies polluted runoff as the
          most important remaining source of water pollution and provides
          for a coordinated effort to reduce polluted runoff from a
          variety of sources. As part of this effort, the CWAP calls for
          the development of this USDA-EPA unified national strategy to
          minimize the water quality and public health impacts of AFOs.
          Redball USDA - NRCS - Animal Feeding Operations: Site contains
          links to AFO related information.
          Redball USDA - NRCS - Manure Nutrients Relative to the Capacity
          of Cropland and Pastureland to Assimilate Nutrients: Spatial and
          Temporal Trends for the United States: Data from the Census of
          Agriculture were used to estimate livestock populations,
          quantities of manure produced, and land available for manure
          application for 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. Livestock include
          beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and poultry.
          Redball USDA - NRCS - Technical Tools - Animal Waste Management
          Software: This tool is used to size animal waste management
          system components such as waste stroage facilities and waste
          treatment lagoons. It is a Windows program and is a complete
          revision of an earlier DOS program of the same name. The
          complete installation package along with precipitation data and
          a User's Guide are available for download.
          Redball USDA - NRCS - Technical Tools - Manure Master Decision
          Support System: Designed as an interactive web tool, the use of
          a browser the equivalent of MS Explorer 3.xx or Netscape
          Navigator 3.xx is required. This tool is used to compare the
          nutrient content in the animal manure produced with the amount
          of nutrients removed from fields where manure was applied. The
          tool also permits the user to view the latest NRCS animal manure
          and plant data bases in table format.
          Redball USGS - Effects of Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) on
          Hydrologic Resources and the Environment: The purpose and scope
          of this Web site is a work in progress. For the short term
          (10/99-10/2000) this Web site is being maintained primarily as
          the venue for follow-up products and communications from the AFO
          '99 - Ft. Collins conference. This Web site also will serve to
          inform AFO stakeholders of current USGS activities related to
          AFO environmental and human health issues.
          Redball USGS - Toxic Substances Hydrology Program - National
          Reconnaissance of Emerging Contaminants in the Nation's Water
          Resources: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), through the Toxic
          Substances Hydrology Program, has implemented a national
          reconnaissance to provide baseline information on the
          environmental occurrence of emerging contaminants in water
          resources. During 1999 and 2000, 142 streams, 55 wells, and 7
          effluent samples were collected across 36 states as part of this
          national reconnaissance effort. A majority of the stream and
          ground-water sites sampled were expected to be susceptible to
          emerging contaminants from either animal or human wastewaters. A
          select number of sites were located in settings where the
          occurrence of emerging contaminants was thought to be unlikely.
