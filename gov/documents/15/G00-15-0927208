   1.    Purpose. This chapter assigns the responsibility for the
   preparation and amendment of all International Aviation Area Forecasts.
   It also briefly describes the various area forecast products that are
   provided.

   2.    General. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) is the meteorological authority for the United States as
   designated by the U.S. to the International Civil Aviation Organization
   (ICAO). Within ICAO the U.S. has agreed to provide international area
   forecasts (IAF's) covering selected areas (see exhibit D-35-1) for
   international flight departures from civil airports within the U.S. and
   its territories. Additionally these IAF's are used to serve long
   over-water routes between U.S. airports (e.g., San Francisco and
   Honolulu). Some of the IAF's provided by the U.S. (those within the
   areas outlined on exhibit D-35-1) are part of the ICAO Area Forecast
   System (AFS). The IAF program is composed of four centers, three U.S.
   [National Meteorological Center (NMC); National Hurricane Center (NHC),
   Miami; Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO), &n Juan] and one
   Canadian [Central Analysis Office at Montreal]. The forecasts are
   provided both in chart form and teletypewritten form, but some low
   level forecasts are made in teletypewritten form only. Although it
   isn't part of the formal IAF program, the U.S. does make area forecast
   wind and temperature bulletins which are transmitted direct to flight
   planning computers in digital form. These forecasts are described in
   Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter D-32, Aviation Digital
   Forecasts. As a supplement to IAF service, WSFO's, Honolulu and San
   Francisco provide route forecasts as described in section 12 of this
   chapter.

   3.    Area Forecast System. The ICAO AFS is unique in that in mast
   cases it provides overlapping areas of responsibility. For example, the
   area forecast centers (AFC's) at Washington, London, and Casablanca all
   have responsibility for much the same portion of the North Atlantic.
   However, the distribution of each center's forecast products is not
   extended to overlapping areas; thus, a flight from Madrid to San Juan
   receives its area forecasts from London while a flight from San Juan to
   Madrid receives its area forecasts from Washington. The AFS is not
   complete on a worldwide basis yet. In areas where there is no AFC yet,
   en route forecasts are normally provided by the meteorological office
   at the departure aerodrome.

   4.    Description ofArea Forecast Products. All IAF charts are
   described in detail by Weather Service Forecasters Handbook No. 1 -
   Facsimile Products. The IAF teleprinter forecasts are described in WSOM
   Chapter D-36, International Aviation Service Arrangements. The wind and
   temperature charts are prepared for 500 mb, 400 mb, 300 mb, and 200 mb.
   Not all IAF areas have charts for all levels. Most significant weather
   (SIGWX) charts are for the layer between 400 and 150 mb9.
   Tropopause-Vertical Wind Shear charts are also produced. In
   combination, these charts allow for a 3-dimensional interpretation of
   forecast winds and temperatures from 500 mbs up to 150 mbs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [ed351.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/ed351.gif
     __________________________________________________________________

   All facsimile charts are valid at fixed times. The teleprinter
   forecasts are a mixture of fixed valid time forecasts and valid period
   forecasts. Most of the facsimile and teleprinter forecasts are prepared
   twice daily for 18- and 24-hour periods. However, most SIGWX forecasts
   are prepared 4 times daily The forecasts are generally valid at 0000,
   0600, 1200, and 1800Z, or - in the case of those that cover a period of
   time generally, for a 12-hour period followed by a 12-hour outlook.

   5.    Selection of Map Areas. The map areas selected by the National
   Weather Service (NWS) to cover the U.S. area of responsibility were
   based on the following factors:

       a.     The desire to have one map area cover the whole length of
   frequently traveled air routes within its area.

       b.     The size restrictions placed on the charts by the facsimile
   equipment.

       c.     The size restrictions placed on the charts by the map scale.
   The base maps Used for operational purposes (defined as those for
   flight planning and for flight documentation) are polar stereographic,
   true at 6^oN with a scale of 1:20 million and Mercator projections,
   true at 22.5^oN and S, also, with a scale of 1:20 million,

       d.     The size constraints that are the result of the output
   capabilities of the formatting computer.

       e.     Consultation with the various aviation user groups.

   The areas for which IAF charts are presently prepared are given in
   exhibits D-35-2 and D-35-3. .These exhibits also include the area label
   of the charts as they appear on the National and Aviation
   Meteorological Facsimile Service Network (NAMFAX). The kinds of charts
   transmitted are shown within each of the areas in larger type.
   Additionally, satellite charts are transmitted to meet requirements not
   otherwise satisfied for data from sparse data areas.

   6.    Use of Approved Contractions. Forecasters should keep in mind not
   all users of the IAF charts and teleprinter forecasts (FACA, FAPA,
   FANT) have English as a native language. Therefore, it is mandatory
   that all contractions and/or abbreviations  used in these forecasts
   prepared for international use be taken from the PANS (Procedures for
   Air Navigation services) - ICAO Abbreviations and Codes, Doc. 8400. All
   other words in the forecast should be SPELLED OUT.

   7.    Computer Chart Backup. Numerical forecasts for periods beyond the
   usual requirements are routinely computed and stored by NMC for use as
   backup. This is in case of a significant malfunction in a subsequent
     __________________________________________________________________

   computer run. Backup is also provided by the Air Weather Service of the
   of U.S. Air Force and the Naval Weather Service Command of the U.S.
   Navy in case of extended outages.

   8. Transmission Schedule and Related Communications Information. The
   TAF charts are transmitted by landline facsimile or equal quality
   communications to all 50 states and San Juan. Charts transmitted to
   Honolulu are retransmitted by radio facsimile to West-Central Pacific
   locations. A radio facsimile (CARFAX) broadcast of selected IAF charts
   18 made to the Caribbean.. Specific communications information,
   including a description of the NAMFAX communications network,
   transmission schedules, the issuance of general notices (GENOT's),
   etc., is published in the WSOM, Part G.

   9. Responsibility. NMC; NHC, Miami; and WSFO, San Juan have the areas
   of forecast responsibility shown in exhibit D-35-4. NHC, Miami; and
   WSFO, San Juan have responsibility for low-level significant weather
   only. All three centers also have amendment responsibility for all of
   the IAF products they issue. NHC, Miami; and WSFO, San Juan are
   responsible for issuing amendments to forecasts of winds and
   temperatures for 500 mb and below prepared by NMC for their areas of
   responsibility.

   10. Amendment Criteria. The amendment criteria for IAF's are as
   follows:

   a.    Upper Winds. Change in direction of 30 degrees or more, provided
   the wind speed is 30 knots or more before or after the change; change
   in speed of 20 knots or more.

   b.   Upper Air Temperatures. Change of more than 5^oC.

   c.    Aircraft Icing. New expectation, intensity increasing, intensity
   decreasing from severe to light, or from moderate to nil.

   d.    Turbulence. Intensity increasing to moderate or to severe,
   intensity decreasing from severe to light,or from moderate to nil.

   e.    Hail. Thunderstorm. Squalls, Tornado, or Tropical Revolving
   Storm. New expectation, no longer expected.

   f.   Sandstorm or Duststorm. New expectation, intensity increasing from
   conditions-of rising sand (or dust) to sandstorm (or duststorm),
   intensity decreasing from sandstorm (or duststorm) to condition of  no
   rising sand (or dust).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [ed354a.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/ed354a.gif
     __________________________________________________________________

   g.    Cloud Conditions. Change in cloud cover from no ceiling to
   ceiling.

   h.    Significant Front. New expectation, no longer expected, marked
   difference in position.

   11.    Amendment Procedures.

       a.     NMC Forecast Division. After the IAF forecasts are issued
   the Aviation Weather Branch of the Forecast Division (FD) at MMC
   continues to monitor new incoming data and issues amendments as
   required. See exhibit D-35-5.

       b.     NHC, Miami; WSFO, San Juan. These offices monitor all new
   incoming data and prepare amendments based on the criteria given in
   paragraph 10. Amendments are given the same distribution as the
   original forecast.

       c.     Reanalyses (REAN's) by WSFO's, San Francisco, Anchorage, and
   Honolulu. The amendment procedures described before may be supplemented
   or abridged for eastbound, direct, trans-Pacific flights with
   destinations in the conterminous U.S. This is accomplished by providing
   wind reanalyses to such flights on request. The offices responsible for
   making these reanalyses are WSFO's, San Francisco, Anchorage, and
   Honolulu. Arrangements for servicing such requests are as follows:

       (1)     Wind reanalyses are limited to the area east of 17^oE.

       (2)     For flights which do not pass, when east of 17^oE., at any
   time north of 55^oN., reanalyses are normally provided by the San
   Francisco office.

       (3)     For flights which pass, when east of 170^oE., at any time
   north of 55^oN., reanalyses are normally provided by the Anchorage
   office.

       (4)     Requests for reanalyses are normally directed according to
   the preceding. Notwithstanding these arrangements, any of the three
   offices contacted WILL HONOR any request received.

       (5)     These wind reanalysis arrangements are not intended to
   apply to flights with Hawaii destinations; reanalyses for flights with
   Hawaii destinations are provided by the Honolulu office.

   12.    International Aviation Route Forecasts. In lieu of IAF
   documentation in chart form WSFO's, Honolulu and San Francisco provide
   both scheduled and non-scheduled flights to and from the Southern
   Hemisphere with route forecasts in PRORO or PROFI code forms (WMO Code
   FM57D or FM58D). These forecasts include significant cloud and weather
   conditions as well as upper level temperatures and winds derived from
   prognostic charts prepared by NMC.

   The NMC Aviation Weather Branch monitors all new incoming data and
   issues amendments, when required, to NMC wind and temperature forecasts
   for levels from 400 to 200 mb, inclusive, and, when required, to all
   NMC significant weather forecasts. The Aviation Weather Branch follows
   the criteria given by Section 10.

   Significant weather amendments are issued in plain language bulletins,
   are distributed on Service "O" and other circuits (e.g., NMC-Honolulu)
   as needed to meet requirements, and are stored at the Weather Message
   Switching Center for request/reply retrieval. Bulletins (all 400 to 150
   mb) are as follows:

       Amends Charts  Amends

   Wind and temperature amendments - only the Northern Hemisphere, north
   of about 5^oN. - are also issued in plain language bulletins and are
   distributed and stored in the same manner as the significant weather
   bulletins. Bulletins are as follows:

   are also distributed on the NAMFAX circuit.

   Exhibit D-35-5: NMC Significant Weather and Wind and Temperature
   Amendment Bulletins

   a.    WSFO, San Francisco routinely prepares route forecasts for low
   level flights between the west coast and Hawaii and Northern Hemisphere
   route forecasts for high level flights between Los Angeles and Tahiti.

   b.    WSFO, Honolulu routinely prepares Northern Hemisphere (to 5^oS.)
   route forecasts for high level flights between Honolulu and Auckland,
   Brisbane, Nandi, Noumea, Samoa, Sydney, and Tahiti; between Tokyo and
   Samoa, Sydney, and Tahiti; and between Nauru and Guam and Majuro.

   c.    WSFO's San Francisco and Honolulu shall monitor incoming data and
   prepare amendments - winds, temperatures, and significant weather - as
   necessary according to the amendment criteria given in section 10.
   Amendments should be distributed the same as the original forecasts.

   13.   Information for Users of NAMFAX Charts. The prognostic charts,
   described in detail in Weather Service Forecasters Handbook No. 1,
   furnish the necessary data for flight planning, briefing and
   international flight documentation for all flights from about 18,000
   feet to 45,000 feet, and to as low as 10,000 feet in some areas. Since
   the contour configuration of any standard level of the higher altitudes
   (500-150 mb) closely approximates the contour configuration of the one
   next to it, the deviation of minimal flight paths computed from either
   chart is very slight and, in all probability, negligible. An
   approximate minimal flight path can, therefore, be determined from the
   chart nearest to the flight level, and then the wind along the flight
   path can be evaluated. The geostrophic assumption is made that the
   direction of the wind can be determined by the orientation of the
   height contours on the polar sterographic charts. The Mercator charts
   contain stream function lines instead of height contours and by
   definition the forecast winds are parallel to the stream function
   lines. Statistical studies have shown that, in the layer between 300
   and 150 mb, winds in excess of 60 knots do not deviate more than 10^o
   in 83 percent of the cases and for winds in excess of 100 knots the
   percentage increases to 92 percent. It is only in the case of
   relatively light winds that the deviation is greater; these would not
   be critical in this type of operation. The assumption is, therefore,
   made that the wind direction is constant in the layer from 300 mb to
   150 mb, except occasionally in the tropics.

   13.1    Wind Determination. The appropriate method to be used in
   evaluating wind information from NAMFAX charts depends on the height of
   the flight level in relation to the tropopause and to the 300 mb
   surface. Seven distinct flight planning situations as they relate to
   flight altitudes and the use of NAMFAX charts need special
   exemplification. These are listed in exhibit D-35-6 and discussed in
   the following paragraphs. The term tropopause as applied to these
   situations signifies also the level of maximum wind.  Exhibit D-35-6,
   in addition to listing the seven distinct flight planning situations,
   also provides a table showing the heights of constant pressure surfaces
   for a standard atmosphere. Note: Winds south of 20^oN are only
   analyses, they are not forecasts.

     __________________________________________________________________

   a. Situation A - Below tropopause when tropopause is below 300 mb
   surface. The direction and speed of the wind at a point between the 500
   mb surface and the tropopause when the tropopause is below the 300 mb
   surface are evaluated from the 500 mb, 300 mb, and TVWS charts. The
   direction at the tropopause is assumed to be the same as at the 300 mb
   surface. The direction at the desired point is obtained by linear
   interpolation between the 500 mb surface and the tropopause. To
   evaluate the speed at the desired point, first determine the speed at
   the tropopause by adding the total shear between the 300 mb surface and
   the tropopause to the speed at the 300 mb surface then interpolate
   between the 500 mb surface and the tropopause.

   b.    SituationB - Above tropopause and below 300 mb surface. The wind
   at a point below 300 mb but above the tropopause is determined by using
   the 300 mb and the TVWS charts. The direction is assumed to be that of
   the 300 mb surface. The speed is determined by adding the total shear
   between the point in question and the 300 mb surface to the wind speed
   at the 300 mb surface.

   c.    SituationC - Above 300 mb surface when tropopause is below 300 mb
   surface. The wind at a point above the 300 mb surface when the
   tropopause is below the 300 mb surface is obtained by subtracting the
   total wind shear from the wind speed at the 300 mb surface and assuming
   the direction to be the same as at the 300 mb surface.

   d.    SituationD - Below 300 mb surface when tropopause is above 300 mb
   surface. The direction and speed of the wind at a point below the 300
   mb surface (or between the 700 mb and 500 mb surfaces) when the
   tropopause is above the 300 mb surface are determined by linear
   interpolation of wind values on the charts immediately above and below
   the point in question. If 500 mb chart is not available, subtract shear
   between flight level and 300 mb from 300 mb wind speed and assume
   direction is same as at 300 mb.

   e.    SituationE - Below 4ropopause and above 300 mb surface. The wind
   at a point above the 300 mb surface and below the tropopause is step by
   step the same as for Point B. (Note: Both Points B and E are between
   the 300 mb surface and the tropopause.)

   f.    SituationF - Above tropopause when tropopause is above 300 mb
   surface. The wind at a point above the tropopause when the tropopause
   is above the 300 mb surface is determined by adding the total shear
   between the 300 mb surface and the tropopause then subtracting the
   total shear between the tropopause and the point in question.

   g.    SituationG - Any height in areas where the 200 mb chart is
   prepared in lieu of the tropopause vertical wind shear chart.
   Determination of wind values for any height, in areas where the 200 mb
   chart is prepared, is accomplished by linear interpolation between the
   levels directly above and below the desired height.

   13.2    Temperature Determination. The temperature at any flight level
   is determined by linear interpolation between adjacent available
   levels. In areas for which the TVWS chart is prepared, temperatures are
   available at 500 mb, 300 mb, the tropopause, and 150 mb. In the areas
   where the 200 mb chart replaces the TVWS charts, temperatures are
   available at 500 mb, 300 mb, 200 mb, and the tropopause when it is
   below 150 mb.

   13.3    Significant Weather. Significant weather and cloud types are
   indicated by symbols and abbreviations as described in Weather Service
   Forecasters Handbook No. 1 - Facsimile Products.
