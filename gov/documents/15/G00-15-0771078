   TVA FY 2001 Financial Results
   [moneypic.jpg] TVA is financially sound today and we are taking action
   to help ensure that TVA continues to remain financially healthy and
   competitive as the electric power industry is restructured.
     * In FY 2001, TVA revenues were almost $7 billion, an increase of 3.5
       percent over last year.
     * TVAs cash flow from operations (after interest charges) was $1.9
       billion, a 135% improvement since 1995.
     * TVAs annual interest expense has been reduced by about $100
       million since last year, and is down nearly $370 million from its
       high point in 1997.

   TVA is taking steps to remain financially sound in the future by
   developing an integrated strategy to ensure a successful transition to
   competition.

   One element of that strategy was a request by the TVA Board to CFO
   David N. Smith to conduct an assessment of TVAs financial status,
   including a determination of the carrying value of TVAs assets in
   light of the anticipated competitive marketplace of the future.

   As a result, the CFO has determined that the book value of some of
   TVAs assets should be adjusted. Specifically, TVA will reduce the
   carrying value of certain assets by $3.4 billion by recognizing a loss
   on impairment of assets for FY 2001. This loss will be charged against
   TVAs $3.7 billion in retained earnings.

   While this action will result in a net loss for FY 2001, it will have a
   positive impact on net income for years to come, and it will have no
   impact on TVAs bond ratings, no impact on principal and interest
   payments, no impact on cash flows, and no impact on electricity rates.

   This action is a deliberate step within a broader strategy to ensure
   that TVA remains financially sound and competitive as the electric
   utility industry is restructured.
