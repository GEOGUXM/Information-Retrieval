      This table shows the distribution of various vulnerability
      characteristics. The raw number in each cell is the number of
      vulnerabilities that meet that particular characteristic for that year.
      The percentage to the right of each raw number is the percentage of
      vulnerabilities having that particular characteristic for that year.

      Consensus Intrusion Database Graph
   [cid_source_count_log.png]
   The lines on the graph measure the number of packets to the top 10
   probed ports over time (as measured at Storm Center Partner locations).
   Values on the Y axis (left side) is the number of denied packets. Up to
   the first line is under 5,000 probes. This graph can be used to
   identify newly emerging worms and exploit scripts. Values on the X axis
   (bottom) is time measured in days. Each tick represents 1 day (6 weeks
   and 2 days total). (Graph and text from www.incidents.org)
