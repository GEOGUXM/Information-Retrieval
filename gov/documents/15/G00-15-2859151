   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   Question:
   How do I get copies of documents from a bankruptcy file?

   Answer:
   You can get copies of documents from a bankruptcy file in several ways:
   By mail: The court can mail you copies of documents. However, we
   require payment in advance. We charge 50 cents per page for copies. If
   you know the number of pages of which you need copies, you can send us
   a request for the copies and a check or money order in payment. If you
   do not know the number of pages, call (808) 522-8100 Ext.128. We can
   give you the information you need. When you send us a request for
   copies, please state the name of the debtor, the case number, and the
   exact title of the documents which you need.
   Through the Internet: You can access and print images of documents
   which have been filed in bankruptcy files and adversary proceedings
   since January 1, 1998, through WebRacer. In order to use this system
   you must be registered with the Pacer Service Center. Registration is
   not immediate and you may wait in excess of a week before you will get
   a login and password. There is no fee for registration, but there is a
   fee of 7 cents per page to view documents in a case file. There is no
   additional charge for downloading or printing these documents. Click
   here for more information.
   In person: Copies of documents in pending files and in recently closed
   files can be obtained by coming to the Bankruptcy Court at 1132 Bishop
   Street in Honolulu (map). You can print copies of documents from RACER,
   our online electronic images query program. The cost of each page is
   ten cents. The Clerk's Office is open from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm, Monday
   through Friday (except federal holidays).
   Certified and Exemplified Copies: In certain circumstances you will
   need a certified copy of a bankruptcy document, such as a copy of your
   discharge to give to a bank or title company. In other instances you
   may need an exemplified copy, such as a copy of your discharge to file
   with the clerk of a state court. The Bankruptcy Court charges $7.00 for
   certification (plus 50 cents per page for the copies) and $14.00 for
   exemplification (plus 50 cents per page for the copies).
   Copies from archived files: If you need copies of documents from a case
   which is now closed, contact the court (808) 522-8100 Ext. 128, to find
   out whether the files have already been sent for storage in the
   archives in San Bruno, California. If so, you may either get copies
   directly from the National Archives and Records Administration, or you
   may need to request that the file be returned to the court in Honolulu
   so that copies can be made here. Note that the National Archives will
   only provide copies from files of individual consumer cases -- not
   business cases. To order copies from the Records Center, call the court
   at the number listed above to get specific location information about
   the files before you mail or fax your request. You may download the
   Request Form by clicking on the link below. The least expensive option
   will always be to order the copies directly from the archives. However,
   if you need a file returned from the Records Center to this court,
   please mail us a letter requesting that we retrieve the case file as
   well as a check for $35.00 made out to "Clerk, U.S. Bankruptcy Court."
   The letter should state:

   1. Name of the debtor(s)
       2. Case number (if you know the number) or year the case was filed
       3. Your name, address, and telephone number

   It may take several weeks before the file is delivered to the court.
   When the file arrives, we will contact you and you may then visit the
   court or order the copies. The cost of the copies is 50 cents per page.
