   about things to see and do. If you're planning a visit, you might want

   related to special exhibitions and the permanent collections. Some
   upcoming events include:
   [cinderella-th.jpg] Children's Film Program: Cinderella Ages five and
   up, Saturday, February 2, 10:30 a.m. In this celebrated Walt Disney
   classic, Cinderella shares her dreams of a better life with the lovable
   mice, Gus and Jaq. When Cinderella's cruel stepmother prevents her from
   attending the royal ball, the Fairy Godmother appears. With a wave of
   her magic wand and a "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," the Fairy Godmother
   transforms a simple pumpkin into a coach and Cinderella's rags into a
   beautiful gown. At the ball, Cinderella falls in love with Prince
   Charming, but must flee before the stroke of midnight breaks the spell.
   (USA, 76 mins., Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske,
   dirs.).

   help exploring the galleries? If so, borrow one of the National
   Gallery's new Postcard Tours at the East Building and main floor West
   Building art information desks. You can study contemporary works of art
   from the perspective of the artists who made them, or search for
   surprises in the American paintings galleries. Current Postcard Tour
   sets include "Prewar to Postmodern," a sampling of the
   twentieth-century collection for adults (East Building); "American Art
   Search," a family tour of American art (West Building); and "Things
   that Walk, Talk, and Squawk," a family tour of twentieth-century art
   (East Building).
   Many of the activities on this site are based on the National Gallery
   of Art Activity Book: 25 Adventures with Art by Maura A. Clarkin,
   published by Harry N. Abrams, Inc., in association with the National
   Gallery of Art. If you like doing projects like these, you may enjoy
   reading this book, which can be found in libraries, bookstores, and the
   museum shop.
