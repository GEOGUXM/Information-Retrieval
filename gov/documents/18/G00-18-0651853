                                    Director of Science and Technology Base Programs (DSTBP)

   The DSTBP office consists of the Program Director, Allen Hartford and
   his staff. STB is responsible for both major institutional and
   programmatic functions. Institutionally, STB leads the Laboratory-wide
   effort to conduct an annual science and technology assessment that is
   required by the UC/DOE contract for management of Los Alamos; provides
   oversight for the Undergraduate Student, Graduate Research Assistant,
   and Postdoctoral programs; produces Los Alamos Science, a publication
   that highlights the Laboratory's forefront research and programmatic
   activities; manages the Laboratory's discretionary research funds, both
   Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) and University of
   California Research and Development (UCDRD); and facilitates a broad
   range of cross-cutting activities including coordinating Laboratory
   responses to calls for nominees for major national and international
   awards, supporting the efforts of the Science and Engineering Council,
   and managing and approving all programmatically related foreign travel
   for the Laboratory. The Planning Team works throughout the Laboratory
   to support a variety of institutional planning activities. The Office's
   major programmatic responsibilities include providing the primary
   interface with the DOE Office of Energy Research (OER), the DOE Defense
   Programs (DP) funded science education programs, the National
   Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
   STB also manages the Los Alamos Center for Human Genome Studies, one of
   three such centers which compose the DOE Joint Genome Institute.

   STB's vision: To be the Laboratory's catalyst for a healthy
   programmatic future based on science and engineering excellence.

Education Program Office (STB/EPO)

   The Education Program Office sponsors initiatives directly targeted to
   meet the Laboratory mission. These initiatives include all levels of
   education from elementary through university and postdoctoral
   appointments. These programs, conducted by divisions all across the
   Laboratory, are of many different types and are for both students and
   teachers. The programs are grouped into the following categories:
   Teacher Programs, Student Programs, Educational Technology, Curriculum
   Development, and Public Understanding of Science. In addition, STB/EPO
   oversees the Laboratory's Postdoctoral Program which is administered
   through the Staffing Group in the Human Resources Division.

Energy Research Programs (STB/ER)

   The programs funded by the DOE's Office of Energy Research (OER)
   generally fall in the area of science and technology, and they make
   significant contributions to national security, industrial
   competitiveness, and energy resources. Energy Research (ER) activities
   contribute to a wide spectrum of fundamental and strategic research in
   areas such as materials science, neutron scattering, high-performance
   computing, and biosciences. We consider ER activities to be an
   extremely important component of the Laboratory's basic research
   program. The ER programs often involve partnerships with universities
   and industry, a healthy interaction between experiment and theory, and
   use of techniques and ideas from different fields in solving
   significant, focused scientific problems.

LA Science (STB/LA Sci)

   Los Alamos Science is a science journal distributed world-wide that
   presents the most exciting research at LANL. Articles are designed to
   communicate technical insights to a broad audience. Issues are
   published once or twice a year and often emphasize single themes.
   Recent themes include radiation and the human radiation experiments,
   the human genome, high-performance computing, and collaborations
   between Russian and American nuclear institutes.

Laboratory Directed Research and Development (STB/LDRD)

   Laboratory-Directed Research and Development is a Congressionally
   authorized program at each of the DOE Laboratories, whereby up to six
   percent of incoming programmatic dollars may be directed by Laboratory
   management to fund employee-initiated, internally-competed,
   highly-innovative research that will extend the science and technology
   capabilities that underpin the Laboratory mission.

Laboratory Planning Team (STB/LP)

   The Laboratory Planning team works throughout the Laboratory to support
   a variety of institutional planning activities. The team provides
   consultation to Laboratory organizations in their formulation of
   strategy, help assess and evaluate current and future business
   enviornments, help create action plans, and monitor progress. The team
   is a Laboratory repository for planning, including "best-in-class"
   approaches to planning. The team also provides guidance, advice, and
   support to the Science and Engineering Advisory Council (SEAC).
     __________________________________________________________________

Foreign Travel Team (STB/FT)

   The Foreign Travel team is responsible for a challenging set of
   institutional functions. The team provides oversight of foreign travel
   on behalf of the Laboratory Director, including reviewing and
   approving/disapproving all Laboratory foreign travel requests.
     __________________________________________________________________

University of California Coordination (STB/UC)

   UC Coordination team seeks to foster enhanced collaborations with the
   faculty and staff of nine UC campuses and the other two UC-managed
   laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence
   Livermore National Laboratory.) Activities include management of
   collaborative research programs supported by UC Directed Research and
   Development funds.
     __________________________________________________________________

Research Library (STB/RL)

   The Research Library's mission is to bring research information to the
   desktop and to provide support and services to help researchers use
   scitech research literature more efficiently. The vision is to create a
   knowledge systems network that facilittes scientific communication and
   collaboration. Products are being developed to provide personalized
   tools to enhance researchers' abilities to search for information.
