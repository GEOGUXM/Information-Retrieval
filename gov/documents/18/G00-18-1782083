   The Marine Protected Areas of the United States Web site is jointly
   managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of
   the Interior. Direct administration of the computer systems is handled
   by the National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. Information presented on these pages is considered
   public information and may be distributed or copied. Use of appropriate
   photo and image credits is requested.

   All Web servers need to collect technical information in order to share
   their contents with visitors. The technical information (see example
   below) identifies what part of the Web site a visiting computer wishes
   to reach, and where to send the requested information once it is found.
   For site management, this technical information is also used for
   statistical analysis. Summary statistics are used for such purposes as
   assessing what information is of most and least interest, identifying
   usage trends over time, determining technical design specifications,
   and identifying system performance or problem areas. These aggregate
   statistical summaries are posted on a Web site for use by Department of
   Commerce and Department of the Interior personnel, and are available to
   the public.

   Electronic mail sent to addresses listed on this Web site is treated no
   differently than any other electronic mail. All electronic mail
   transactions are handled by electronic mail servers, and do not pass
   through this Web site, nor are they monitored or recorded by this site
   in any way.

   This Web site does not use Web "cookies."

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, this government computer system employs
   hardware and software to monitor network traffic and to identify
   unauthorized attempts to add or alter information, or otherwise cause
   damage or interfere with information delivery. Except for authorized
   law enforcement investigations, no attempt is made to identify
   individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs may be stored
   indefinitely for use in statistical analysis or to protect the security
   and integrity of the computer system.

   Unauthorized attempts to add information or alter information on this
   service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information
   Infrastructure Protection Act.

   Please note that other Department of Commerce and Department of
   Interior Web sites may have different information collection practices.
   If interested, please consult their site-specific privacy statements
   for details on such policies.

   If you have any questions or comments about the information presented
   here, please forward them to mpaweb@noaa.gov.

              Example of information collected by this Web site

   Web servers keep a record of their activity in a log file. Every time a
   visiting computer requests a file from the Web server, a log entry is
   recorded. A typical log file entry for the Marine Protected Areas of
   the United States Web site looks like this:

   10/04/00 13:19:18 OK 200 somemachine.somenetwork.com Mozilla/4.75
   (Macintosh; U; PPC) http://othermachine.othernetwork.com/neatsites.html
   "mpa.gov" :welcome.html 15208

   What this entry means:
     * 10/04/00 13:19:18 -- Date and time of the request (24-hour clock).
     * OK 200 -- Status code of the request. "OK" and a status code of
       "200" are equivalent; they mean the requested file was successfully
       found and delivered to the requesting (visitor's) computer.
     * somemachine.somenetwork.com -- Internet address (or IP address, in
       the form of 123.123.123.123) of the requesting computer. The last
       part of the address, .com, indicates the requesting computer is on
       a commercial network. Other commonly seen addresses end in .mil
       (U.S. military), .net (a different category of commercial network),
       .org (non-profit organization), .gov (U.S. government agencies,
       state and Federal), etc. Depending on how the requesting computer
       is connected to the Internet, this may not identify a specific
       computer.
     * Mozilla/4.75 (Macintosh; U; PPC) -- Type of browser used by the
       requesting computer.
     * http://othermachine.othernetwork.com/neatsites.html -- The Internet
       address of the last site visited by the requesting computer, useful
       in discovering how visitors found this Web site.
     * "mpa.gov" -- The Internet address of this Web site. As it is
       possible to operate several Web sites on a single computer, the Web
       server uses this information to determine which Web site should
       handle the request.
     * :welcome.html -- The name of the file requested by the visiting
       computer.
     * 15208 -- Size of the requested file, in bytes.
