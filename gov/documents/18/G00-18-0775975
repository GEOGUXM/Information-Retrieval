                    The X8-C Participating Research Team

   X8-C is operated by a Participating Research Team (PRT) that includes
   the Integrated Structural Biology Resource (ISBR) of Los Alamos
   National Laboratory, the DOE Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA , the
   Biotechnology Research Institute/Institut de recherche en
   biotechnologie of the National Research Council Canada/Conseil National
   de Recherche Canada, the Biology Department of Brookhaven National
   Laboratory , and the Pharmaceuticals Division of Hoffmann-La Roche.

   25% of beam time at X8-C is available for general user proposals in
   protein crystallography. The combination of high flux and low bandwidth
   makes X8-C especially suitable for MAD experiments
