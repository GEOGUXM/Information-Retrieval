   Medical Errors & Patient Safety

   The very critical issues of medical errors and patient safety have
   received a great deal of attention. In November 1999, the Institute of
   Medicine (IOM) released a report estimating that as many as 98,000
   patients die as the result of medical errors in hospitals each year.

   A major Federal initiative has been launched to reduce medical errors
   and improve patient safety in federally funded health care programs,
   and by example and partnership, in the private sector.
