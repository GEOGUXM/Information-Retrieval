 is an organization charged by the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography
Association (IMCA) to design, build, and operate an experimental facility at
the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.

   IMCA-CAT is located at sector 17 of the APS ring and in the Laboratory
   and Office Module, Building 435A, at the Advanced Photon Source at
   Argonne National Laboratory.

   IMCA is an association of pharmaceutical companies committed to the use
   of macromolecular crystallography as a tool in drug discovery and
   product development.

   IMCA has contracted with the Center for Synchrotron Radiation Research
   and Instrumentation (CSRRI) at the Illinois Institute of Technology
   (IIT) to construct and operate the beamlines, biochemistry laboratory,
   offices, and resources that comprise the facility.

   All IMCA-CAT members work closely with other CSRRI staff and with the
   members of IMCA to ensure the highest quality in the development and
   operation of the beamlines and associated experimental equipment.
