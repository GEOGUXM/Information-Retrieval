About the AEFS

   The Ames Electronic Forms System is a suite of tools for filling out,
   signing, submitting, archiving, and tracking electronic forms... all
   using your desktop computer. The AEFS uses a commercial software
   application from Shana Corporation called Informed Filler ^TM to
   provide Ames users with electronic forms capabilities. More information
   about the AEFS is available. All Ames forms and the most popular NASA
   and Standard forms are available through the AEFS Form List. To use the
   forms on this list you must install the AEFS software.
