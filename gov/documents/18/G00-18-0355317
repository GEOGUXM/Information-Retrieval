Privacy Notice

   Thank you for visiting the Centers for Education & Research on

   We collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web
   site unless you choose to provide that information to us.


   Information Automatically Collected and Stored

   When you browse through any Web site, read pages, or download
   information, certain information about your visit can be collected. We
   automatically collect and temporarily store the following information
   about your visit, but this information does not identify you
   personally:
     * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
       aol.com, if you are using an America Online account, or
       stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
       domain).
     * The type of browser and operating system you use to access our
       site.
     * The date and time of your visit.
     * The pages you visited.
     * The address of the Web site you came from, if you were referred
       from another site.

   We use this information for statistics on the traffic to our site, to
   find out about general user interest in various areas of our site, and
   to help us make our site more useful to visitors.

   No additional information is collected about your visit, and we do not
   record information about individual behavior or use of the site.

   Personally Provided Information

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our Web site.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself

   Disclosure

   CERTs does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal
   information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or
   by statute.

   Intrusion Detection

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may
   be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the
   National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

   Systems of Records

   Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed
   according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and regulations
   and guidance from the National Archives and Records Administration, and
   in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act. If information that
   you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will
   be a Privacy Act Notice provided.

   Our Web site has links to Federal agencies and participating
   institutions in CERTs. The privacy policy described here does not
   necessarily apply to those other sites. Once you link to another site,
   you are subject to the privacy policy of that site.
