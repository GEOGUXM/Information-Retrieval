HISTORY

   Black Creek in Jack Gore unit

   The Big Thicket National Preserve (96,669 acres) has a highly
   fragmented land base of nine units connected by four riparian corridor
   units. The U.S. Congress recently authorized two additional riparian
   corridor units and one land-based unit that are expected to become part
   of the the Preserve in the near future. The two units form a narrow
   buffer zone around Village Creek, considered one of the best canoeing
   streams in southeast Texas.

   Although the region around the preserve is largely forested, a trend of
   increased urbanization and industrialization is emerging. Over the past
   10 years, there has been a regional decline in dissolved oxygen levels
   in streams of southeastern Texas. As cities within the region expand,
   point-source pollutants from increases in sewage treatment plant
   effluents could further reduce dissolved oxygen levels.

   Industrial point-source pollutants also are an issue in the preserve.
   In 1986 - 87, as part of the National Bioaccumulation Study, the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency documented toxic levels of dioxin in
   fish tissue samples from the lower Neches River Corridor Unit in the
   Big Thicket National Preserve. The Texas Department of Health (TDH)
   issued a fish-consumption advisory for this reach on the lower Neches
   River, which remained in effect until 1996. The TDH continues to
   monitor the situation.

   Historically, the most important point-source impacts on stream in the
   preserve have been from oil and gas operations. In 1981, for example,
   an oil spill adjacent to the Turkey Creek unit flowed into a nearby
   tributary and eventually into the preserve. Although the spill was
   quickly contained, it nearly extirpated the benthic marcoinvertebrate
   community along the entire stream reach. More recently, innovations in
   three-dimensional seismic surveying technology have spawned an
   unprecedented wave of oil and gas prospecting throughout the preserve.
   The preserve resource managers are concerned about the potential
   impacts to aquatic resources from these operations.

                   Biological Crossroads of North America

          Once vast, this land of virgin pine and cypress forest, hardwood
                    forest, meadow, and blackwater swamp is but a remnant.

     * Provide a baseline assessment of the status of instream biological
       resources and riparian zone woody vegetation throughout the Big
       Thicket National Preserve
     * Establish a network of permanent biomonitoring benchmark stations
       to compliment historical and planned basic water-quality monitoring
       stations and provide the data to develop a predictive tool for
       assessing the status of instream biological resources
     * Provide the Big Thicket Preserve with watershed delineation, basin
       characteristics and land-use characteristics for all subwatersheds
       and permanent benchmark monitoring stations

   The baseline assessment of the biological resources in the preserve
   will be conducted and will include assessment of (1) channel habitat;
   (2) fish; (3) benthic invertebrates; (4) riparian woody vegetation. The
   information from this synoptic assessment will be used to (1) compile
   an inventory of these resources for the preserve; (2) establish
   permanent monitoring stations to include reference condition, and, for
   the more degraded stations, document biological impairment and
   watershed land use in the preserve; and (3) to provide site-specific
   biological resource data, physical basin characteristics and land-use
   information in the drainage upstream of each site.

WHAT'S TO BE GAINED

   Combined with past water-quality monitoring efforts, this study should
   provide a baseline of water-quality information from which to detect
   future change. A synoptic biomonitoring study will benefit management
   of the preserve in several significant ways. First, the study will
   provide the preserve with a comprehensive and current inventory of
   aquatic fauna for the existing units and the first-ever inventory of
   aquatic fauna for the new units. The last fish inventory for the
   existing units was done 20 years ago, and no comprehensive inventory of
   aquatic fauna has ever been done. The biomonitoring effort, however,
   will yield more than just an updated inventory. It will be the first
   step in developing a predictive tool for assessing how changes in land
   use in the surrounding watersheds can potentially impact the running
   waters of the preserve. Instead of reacting to degraded waters, the
   preserve managers eventually will be able to manage proactively by
   knowing beforehand how land use changes will affect aquatic biota. This
   information is critical for resource managers to work effectively with
   stakeholders within the watersheds and reduce impact to aquatic
   resources. The methods and knowledge gained from this study also will
   be readily transferable to other National Park Service units with
   similar issues.
