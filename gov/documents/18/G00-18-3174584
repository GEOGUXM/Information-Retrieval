I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Distributors

   [blue_green_line.gif]

   I.M.A.G.E. clones and associated products may be obtained from any of
   our authorized distributors. On-line ordering through the WWW (or by
   email) is encouraged. To aid us in tracking I.M.A.G.E. resource use,
   distributors periodically inform the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium of the
   number of clones sent to each user; however the specific clones (i.e.
   CloneIDs) ordered are considered a confidential matter between each
   distributor and their customers.

   Within the United States, the distributors are:
     * American Type Culture Collection
     * Research Genetics

   In Europe, I.M.A.G.E. distributors are:
     * UK HGMP, Hinxton, England
     * Resource Center of the German Human Genome Project, Berlin Germany

   A Good Faith Agreement governs the usage of I.M.A.G.E. clones and
   associated products. The wording of the original document was revised
   in 9/00; the current agreement is now available and covers all
   I.M.A.G.E. clones and products retroactive to the beginning of the
   project.

   I.M.A.G.E. downloads and parses GenBank records to find entries
   regarding I.M.A.G.E. clones. Groups sequencing I.M.A.G.E. clones can
   help up us with this task by trying to conform to a few standards with
   respect to the format they use when submitting seqeunces. A Genbank
   Suggested Format document gives further details.
