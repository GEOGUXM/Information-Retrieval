                                     Genetics
       DNA The Molecular Ecology Laboratory at the Alaska Biological Science
      Center (ABSC) uses mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite DNA markers
       in a variety of fish, bird, mammal, and plant species. These markers
      are valuable tools for a better understanding of breeding and wintering
          population subdivision, individual behavior, gene flow, species
                            systematics, and evolution.

         The Molecular Ecology Laboratory has developed a series of avian
      microsatellite, mitochondrial and numt-specific DNA markers, as well as
       protocols for non-invasive sampling of wild bird populations. Studies
          currently underway include population analyses of ducks, geese,
                       shorebirds, seabirds and passerines.

        Current mammal projects involve characterizing genetic variation of
           wolf (Canis lupus), polar and brown bear (Ursus arctos and U.
      maritimus), Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and sea otter (Enhydra
        lutris) populations in Alaska, Canada, and Russia. These population
         level data subsequently for the basis for more specific questions
        regarding evolutionary relationships among bear species, levels of
            inbreeding within wolf populations, genetic consequences of
           translocation efforts, and the sex of sea otter harvested for
           subsistence. The laboratory is also developing protocols for
        non-invasive sampling of brown bears to aid in populations surveys.

      The Laboratory is currently developing and using genetic techniques for
        characterization of wild fish populations during various stages of
       their life cycles. Microsatellite markers have been developed by the
            lab for use in questions regarding chinook, sockeye, chum,
      steelhead/rainbow trout and coho salmon. Other microsatellite markers,
      as well as growth hormone, and restriction fragment length polymorphism
        techniques are also being used. Genetic research supports fisheries
       projects characterizing the genetic makeup of fish populations within
         established and newly created glacial drainages and lake basins.
      Genetic analysis of coho salmon populations in the Glacier bay area of
      Southeast Alaska is being conducted to help understand 1) the degree of
      population differentiation 2) the process by which new populations are
         founded, and 3) the smallest viable population size. Glacier Bay
      provides an ideal experimental location because the rapid recession of
       the glaciers has exposed relatively new habitats for colonization. By
        comparing the genetic profiles of coho populations among streams of
       varying ages, more can be learned about the processes of colonization
                and what the minimum effective population size is.

       native hunter The banking of environmental specimens under cryogenic
       conditions for future retrospective analysis has been recognized for
       many years as an important part of environmental monitoring programs.
       Since 1987, the Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Project (AMMTAP)
      has been collecting tissue samples from marine mammals for archival in
          the National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (NBSB) at the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
          USA.The project is a joint effort by the U.S. Geological Survey
       Biological Resources Division (USGS\BRD) /www.nbs.gov>, the National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries
      Service (NOAA Fisheries) /www.nmfs.gov>, and the National Institute of
         Standards and Technology (NIST) /www.nist.gov> to collect tissue
      samples from Alaska marine mammals and to store these samples under the
          best conditions so that they can be analyzed in the future for
        environmental contaminants. The AMMTAP is conducted as part of the
                Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program
      /www.nmfs.gov/tmcintyr/overview.html>. A substantial part of the sample
         collection is from Arctic species and, since most of the animals
         sampled are from Alaska Native subsistence harvests, the project
        requires cooperation and collaboration with numerous Alaska Native
                  organizations and local governmental agencies.

       float plane Based on aerial surveys on wintering grounds, populations
        of Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) have fluctuated
      around the minimum population level, while numbers in nesting colonies
       on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) have declined severely during the
      1980s. To meet population recovery goals it is important to monitor the
       reproductive status of these colonies. Annual surveys by ground crews
      are impractical because of the large areas involved and ocular surveys
        from aircraft are not possible because of high densities of nests.
       Photography has been widely used to estimate numbers of other species
         of waterfowl, but is impractical because of the large areas, poor
           weather conditions, and cryptic coloration of brant. However,
        high-quality video imagery can minimize or overcome these problems.
        This study assesses various photographic techniques and analytical
       methods for enumerating brant and evaluating habitat conditions. This
        technique also has application in assessing changes in land cover.
