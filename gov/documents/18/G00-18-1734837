      Background:
      This "400-level" course provides management-level knowledge for
      integrating the investigation and analysis of accidents and emergency
      events into emergency management programs. The purpose is to provide an
      understanding of the accident investigation process and in-depth
      understanding of methodology for incorporating event-related analysis,
      causes, and corrective actions into the site/facility emergency
      management program. Course content is based on requirements and
      guidance in DOE O 151.1 and O 225.1 and DOE G 151.1-1 and 225.1-1.

      Audience:
      The primary intended audience includes DOE and DOE-contractor
      facility/site managers, decision makers, supervisors, and key technical
      staff with emergency management responsibilities. The target audience
      also includes those responsible for emergency management training and
      oversight, as well as DOE Headquarters response staff.

      Description:
      This course will be presented in a one-day interactive classroom
      session. The training method involves two primary instructors who will
      present information via lecture and demonstration, seminar-type
      discussions, case studies, and student problem-solving and role-playing
      sessions to illustrate and practice techniques and skills.

      Course outcomes:
      Students will demonstrate the integration of emergency event
      investigation, cause analysis, and corrective actions with emergency
      management programs. Upon successful completion, students will be able
      to do the following:

       1. Identify the DOE requirements and guidance that are relevant to
          accident investigation.
       2. Demonstrate the process and standard practices for investigation of
          emergency events.
       3. Apply a method for event investigation and analysis related to
          emergency management and response.
       4. From event analysis, derive conclusions related to emergency
          management and response.
       5. Demonstrate integration of emergency management and response issues
          with accident investigation reporting and corrective actions.

      Prerequisites: None (see recommendation below )

      RECOMMENDATION: Students should have a working knowledge of DOE
      emergency management requirements and have emergency response
      experience.
