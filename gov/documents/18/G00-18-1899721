                        Indeterminate Sentence Review Board

   Summary

      The Office of Crime Victims Advocacy (OCVA), through an agreement with
      the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board (ISRB), provides information to
      victims in cases under the Board's jurisdiction regarding parole
      eligibility reviews. Victims in these cases have a right under the
      state constitution to be heard by the ISRB when the offenders are
      considered for parole. An OCVA staff member assists victims who choose
      to participate in this process.

   Detail

      The Indeterminate Sentence Review Board (ISRB), formerly known as the
      Board of Prison Terms and Paroles, has jurisdiction over the release of
      prisoners still serving sentences for crimes committed prior to July 1,
      1984.

      One of the ISRB's responsibilities is to determine whether inmates who
      have served the minimum term previously established either by the ISRB
      or by the sentencing court shall be released on parole. If the ISRB
      finds that an inmate's rehabilitation is complete and that he or she is
      a fit subject for release, it directs that a parole plan be developed
      for its review and approval. The ISRB may impose specific conditions of
      release on a paroled inmate. Failure to abide by those conditions may
      result in the revocation of parole or other sanctions imposed by the
      ISRB.

      If the ISRB finds that the inmate's rehabilitation is not complete, or
      that he or she is not a fit subject for release, it extends the
      inmate's minimum term by a specific amount of time. The inmate's
      eligibility for parole is then reviewed again when that additional time
      has been served.

      When inmates are scheduled for parole eligibility reviews, an OCVA
      staff member reviews files to identify victims and locate any available
      contact information. If contact information is found, OCVA staff
      attempt to inform victims regarding upcoming reviews and their rights
      to participate. Assistance is provided to those who choose to
      participate.

      Approximately 25 cases per month are scheduled for parole eligibility
      reviews. In approximately twenty percent of these cases, victims are
      contacted and choose to participate in the review process.
