   Site Help

   NWTRB makes wide use of MS Office 2000 and PDF documents in its day to
   day operations. Consequently, many documents on this web site are made
   available these formats.

   Help with Adobe PDF Documents:

   Many documents on the NWTRB web site are published using Adobe's®
   Portable Document Format (PDF) version 5.0 and may be displayed or
   printed exactly as we created them. To display or print the document,
   you must download the free Acrobat® Reader 5.0 from the Adobe web site.
   The Acrobat® Reader allows anyone to view, navigate, and print PDF
   documents. Follow the easy instructions included with the Acrobat
   Reader software to install Acrobat® Reader on your computer. Then click
   any PDF file to view, navigate, or print it.

   If you have questions related to the NWTRB website, please contact
   webmaster@nwtrb.gov

   Help with Microsoft Word Documents:

   A common solution for viewers without Microsoft Office 2000 software is
   to acquire and use a Word Viewer. The viewer is a freeware product that
   allows you to view and print Microsoft Word documents. You may download
   the latest verions of the viewer here: http://hotfiles.zdnet.com/. The
   latest version can also open documents created with all previous
   versions of Word for Windows and version 4.x and above of Microsoft
   Word for Macintosh®. You cannot edit an open document in Word Viewer.
   However, you can copy text to the Clipboard to paste it in other
   applications. Microsoft encourages distribution of this Word Viewer
   with Word documents to people who do not have Microsoft Word. For more
   help with MS Word, you can visit the Microsoft Office Support Page.
