     One of the greatest challenges for sustainable development is
     bridging the gaps of information and coordination between the many
     stakeholders that influence the nature and extent of development
     impacts through their investment, consumption, and regulatory
     decisions. The Office of Sustainable Development works actively to
     build effective partnerships with a wide range of organizations in
     other federal agencies, with state and local governments, and with
     non-profit and civic organizations. We measure our success by
     bringing new constituencies and new perspectives to the task of
     integrating social, economic, and environmental activities to build
     stronger communities and a stronger society.
