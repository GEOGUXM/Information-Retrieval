The U.S. Geological Survey Ocean Bottom Seismometer Facility

   The Ocean Bottom Seismometer is a self contained data-acquisition
   system which free falls to the ocean floor and records seismic data
   generated by airguns and earthquakes. The Ocean Bottom Seismometer
   facility provides technical support for a variety of scientific
   investigations ranging from deep crustal structure to gas hydrate and
   surface sediments. The facility serves the entire U.S. Geological
   Survey as well as academic institutions. We currently operate 12 Ocean
   Bottom Seismometers. The Ocean Bottom Seismometers are portable, self
   contained, inexpensive to operate, and can be deployed and retrieved
   off almost any size boat (including a Zodiac). They are therefore,
   uniquely suitable to record wide-angle reflection and refraction shots
   in remote areas or under primitive conditions and to be deployed on
   short notice to record earthquake aftershocks.

   Technical aspects: Sensors - three 4.5 hertz geophones plus a
   hydrophone; Continuous recording at 100 samples per second for 45 days
   (4 channels); Clock accuracy - 10 ^-8 or ~ 1 millisecond per day drift;
   Dynamic range - 72dB plus a 30dB step gain range; Maximum depth - 5,000
   meters; Powered by standard alkaline batteries; Total Bottom deployment
   time - 45 days.
