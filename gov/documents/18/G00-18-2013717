   We are currently prototyping the first of a new generation of miniature
   tunable laser mid-IR spectrometers operating at room temperature for in
   situ measurement of atmospheric and evolved planetary gases. The
   all-solid-state spectrometer will be based on newly-available
   room-temperature quantum-cascade (QC) laser sources

   in the 3-12 m m wavelength region. The QC laser spectrometer would have
   immediate applications to Mars, Titan, Venus and Europa missions, could
   be operated on a descending or penetrating probe, lander, rover, or
   aerobot, would consume only a few watts of power, and weigh less than
   one kilogram. Because it directly accesses the wavelength region of
   strong vibration-rotation spectral lines, the QC laser spectrometer has
   wide-ranging and immediate application to measuring concentrations of
   several planetary gases such as H[2]O, CH[4], CO, CO[2 ], C[2]H[2],
   HCN, C[2]H[6], C[2]N[2], HC[3]N, O[3], OCS, H[2]S, and SO[2], and
   numerous stable isotopes. Such measurements could be made to study
   atmospheric photochemistry and transport, mineralogical and biological
   experiments (e.g. quantification of evolved gases and their isotopic
   fractionation from thermal decomposition of minerals or ice), and
   respiratory or hazardous gas monitoring for human exploration of the
   solar system.

       A huge leap in laser technology has been made in the last year or
   so that has produced room-temperature tunable laser sources in the
   mid-IR from a revolutionary new approach to laser fabrication, that of
   quantum engineering of electronic energy levels to produce
   quantum-cascade (QC) lasers (3-12 m m). These lasers are fundamentally
   different from diode lasers in that the wavelength is essentially
   determined by quantum confinement, i.e. by the thickness of active
   layers rather than the energy bandgap of the material. These new
   devices produce single-mode laser light tunable over 10-20 cm^-1, of
   output power of fractions of a watt. The technological breakthrough
   provided by the invention of the QC laser offers a ten-fold increase in
   our current ability to address science objectives for planetary
   missions.
