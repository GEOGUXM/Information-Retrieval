                          Icing Research Aircraft:
                              DHC-6 Twin Otter

   NASA 607, based at Glenn Research Center, is a DHC-6 Twin Otter and
   serves as NASA's Icing Research Aircraft (IRA). It is considered a
   national asset for icing research.
   Twin Otter and Logo
   This aircraft has been modified to become a flying physics laboratory
   and research aircraft for the following areas of investigation:

    Icing Cloud Characterization
    Natural Icing Physics Studies
    Source of Validation Data
    Full scale iced aircraft aerodynamics
    Ice protection development
