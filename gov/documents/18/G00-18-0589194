      Privacy Policy

      Thank you for visiting the National Endowment for the Arts Website and
      reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will
      collect no personal information about you when you visit our website
      unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Cookies

      Our public web site does not use "cookies." We consider "cookies" to be
      computer files that a web site places on your computer system without
      your knowledge or permission.

   E-mails and Web Forms

      Personally identifying information that you provide by e-mails or web
      forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point
      of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information
      or products to you, or to respond to your questions or comments. If you
      provide contact information, NEA staff or its contractors may contact
      you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level
      of customer satisfaction with our services. We do not sell any personal
      information to third parties.

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically

      If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site,
      read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
      information about your visit automatically. This information does not
      identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
      following information about your visit:
       1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
          private Internet access account, or "your school.edu" if you
          connect from a university) and IP address (an IP address is a
          number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
          are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site;
       2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
       3. The date and time you access our site;
       4. The pages you visit and how long you visited each page; and
       5. If you linked to the NEA web site from another web site, the
          address of that web site.

      We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
      visitors and to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
      types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record
      information about individuals and their visits.

   Links to Other Sites

      Our policy discloses the privacy practices for the NEA web site. But
      NEA provides links to other web sites. When you leave the NEA web site
      (www.arts.gov), you will go to sites outside our control. These
      external sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or
      solicit personal information. The privacy policies and procedures
      described here for NEA do not apply to any external links. We encourage
      you to read the privacy policies of any site you link to from ours,
      especially if you share any personal information. Be informed. You are
      the person best qualified to protect your own privacy.

   Security

      For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
      available to all users, the National Endowment for the Arts uses
      software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized
      attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage.

      Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
      this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
      Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 and 1030.
      Information also may be used for authorized law enforcement
      investigations. Except for the above purposes, no other attempts are
      made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
