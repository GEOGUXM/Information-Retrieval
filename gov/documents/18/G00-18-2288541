      Below are links to the newly-organized Local Rules of Bankruptcy
      Procedure. The local rules are the same, but we are providing them in a
      different format with the following features: 1. Smaller files
      resulting in faster, more reliable downloads. 2. Search capability
      within many of the files. 3. More logical organization of the Rules.
