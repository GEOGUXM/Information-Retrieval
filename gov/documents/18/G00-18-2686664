                         FACE Technology

Engineering

   FACE engineering technology has been constructed to meet the
   requirements of working with diverse ecosystems ranging from desserts
   to croplands and forests. The exact engineering specification of a
   given site has therefore varied according to these ecosystem lead
   demands. The following page attempts to illustrate the typical
   engineering features and challenges associated with a FACE site
   implementation and does not attempt to reflect the precise
   implementation of any single site.

   The generic FACE system array hardware consists of a high-volume
   blower, a plenum or wide ring-shaped pipe for air distribution, and 32
   vertical standing vent pipes for emitting CO[2] into the exposure
   volume. The carbon dioxide used in FACE experiments is typically
   obtained as a by-product of manufacture of agricultural fertilizer from
   methane and atmospheric nitrogen. Ring2.jpg (33185 bytes)

   Food-grade, liquefied CO[2] is delivered to the FACE site by truck and
   transferred to an insulated receiving tank. Tank pressure is maintained
   at 1725 kPa to keep the CO[2] in a liquid state.

   A refrigeration unit and an electric heater is then used to maintain
   this pressure regardless of demand for CO[2] by the FACE control
   system. Liquid CO[2] is supplied to the electrical heat exchangers
   which vaporize the CO[2] as needed. equipeng.jpg (12360 bytes)

   The gaseous CO[2] is then channeled through 5 cm internal diameter
   metal pipes to a pressure regulator that reduces line pressure to 140
   kPa above ambient. The CO[2] gas is piped from the regulator to the
   FACE plot at low pressure through 5 cm polyethylene tubing.

   CO[2] flow is measured by an electronic flow sensor and controlled by a
   Kurz rotary ramp metering valve that provides a very even, linear
   gradation of gas flow over the range 0 to 1550 kg hr^-1. The metering
   valve was operated directly by the FACE control computer. CO[2] gas was
   then injected into the plenum immediately down-stream of the air supply
   fan.

   Fan and Plenum

   A toroidal plenum is typically assembled 2 m outside of the 30 m
   diameter circle of vertical vent pipes (VVPs) so as to minimize the
   impact of the equipment on vegetation within the study area. The plenum
   used in forest plots consists of a 34 m diameter torus made of 38 cm
   diameter polyethylene pipe. A radial fan is used to provide air flow
   (102 m^3 min^-1 at 2.0 kPa pressure) around the plenum. The fan is
   placed in a 1.5m tall shed located some distance away from the VVP
   circle. The fan intake, with dimensions 1 m x 2 m, was oriented to the
   west, perpendicular to the radius of the FACE circle.

   Vertical Vent Pipes (VVPs)

   Injection of CO[2]-enriched air into a face plot takes place at the
   vertical vent pipes (VVPs). This is the most critical control step in
   the free-air approach and determines how well [CO[2]] is controlled in
   the FACE plot. The following elements of the system are each adjustable
   to some degree.
   FaceRing.jpg (23175 bytes)

   Upwind control - Thirty or so VVPs constructed from 15 cm diameter
   polyethylene pipe are typically spaced in a 30 m diameter circle around
   the FACE plot. Normally, valves at the bases of the VVPs are opened or
   closed so as to provide release of CO[2]-enriched air from the upwind
   direction only. This feature reduced CO[2] losses that would occur if
   it were released on the downwind side and reduced the potential for
   carry-over of injected CO[2] to adjacent plots.

   Feathered edges
   - When the wind speed is greater than the stall-speed of the anemometer
   (0.4m s^-1) VVPs are opened on the upwind side of the plot. If 16 VVPs
   of the upwind semi-circle are opened, excessive CO[2] concentrations
   occur near the edges of the plot where tangents are about parallel to
   wind direction. To prevent this, CO[2] is released from an arc that
   encompasses 12 VVPs over 135 degrees of the VVP circle. Furthermore, a
   "feathering" of the VVPs (Lewin et al. 1994) is achieved by keeping the
   second VVP from each end of the arc of 12 upwind VVPs closed (i.e.,
   only 10 VVPs open). This arrangement was determined from empirical
   observations of the arrangement of open VVPs that produced the most
   even spatial distribution of CO[2] concentration under a wide range of
   wind speed and turbulence conditions.

   Low wind speed regime
   - Detection of true wind direction becomes unreliable with wind vanes
   below a minimum stall velocity, which was 0.4 m s^-1 for the model
   usually used. The control-limiting process under these low-wind
   conditions, is the information feed-forward from the moment of a change
   in the rate of release of CO[2] to the detection of CO[2]
   concentrations within the FACE plot. At wind speeds below the
   anemometer stall threshold, it will take at least 40 s for an
   adjustment in the rate of CO[2] release to traverse the air handling
   system, be emitted from the VPPs, and carried across the plot, to be
   detected at the control point in the center. Use of a more sensitive
   anemometer (i.e., sonic anemometer) would not improve control over the
   concentration of CO[2]. Therefore, when wind speed dropped below that
   threshold for a 20 s period, directional control was terminated and
   every other VVP around the FACE ring was opened. This is the most
   problematic condition for maintaining control of CO[2] concentration in
   a free-air system because (1) transport from the VVP into the plot is
   very irregular in all three cardinal directions; (2) low wind speed
   means that transport of the CO[2]-enriched air from the VVP to the
   sample intake in the center of the plot for the CO[2] control infrared
   gas analyzer (IRGA) is slowed, increasing feedback delay; and (3)
   parcels of air differentially enriched with CO[2] due to lack of mixing
   may move irregularly through the plant canopy and back into the plot.

   The CO[2]-enriched air is typically emitted at approximately 3% CO[2]
   (30,000 mmol mol^-1) from ports drilled into the VVPs. Ports are
   arranged in triplets of 2.5 cm diameter holes with one of them directly
   on a radial line facing the plot center and the other two set at 60^o
   to each side of center (Lewin et al. 1994). The triplet emitter ports
   were spaced at 0.5 m vertical intervals from 2 m above the ground to
   the top of the pipe. Since the wind profile changes greatly with
   elevation from ground level to several meters above the top of the
   canopy, the vertical configuration of the emitter ports was adjusted
   empirically to achieve optimal three-dimensional distribution of
   [CO[2]] within the experimental plots by applying plastic tape to cover
   some of the ports.

   CO[2] Control System
   CO[2] Control System

   Regulation of CO[2] concentrations within the FACE ring and
   registration and logging of all pertinent data are achieved via a set
   of three fully integrated subsystems: (1) wind and CO[2] detectors; (2)
   data acquisition system; (3) CO[2] control program; and a separate
   CO[2]distribution monitoring system.

   Wind and CO[2] detectors
   - Wind speed is measured near the top of the canopy by a sensitive cup
   anemometer (Model 100075, Climatronics, Bohemia, N.Y.) and wind vane
   (Climatronics model 100076) mounted on one of the VVP towers.

   For [CO[2]] measurements, a non-dispersive infrared CO[2] gas analyzer,
   or IRGA (Ultramat 21P, Siemens Corp., Mainz, Germany) located at the
   center of the FACE plot continuously monitors [CO[2]] at a control
   point within the canopy. Air is sampled from a control point at the
   center of the array. The sampled air is pumped at 2.5 l min^-1 through
   approximately 10 meters of 4.3 mm diameter polypropylene tubing before
   it reaches the analyzer. The time for the sample to traverse this
   distance, along with measurement delays inherent in the analyzer,
   resulted in a total delay of 10 to 12 s between when the air sample
   entered the sampling tube and when the resulting concentration was
   delivered to the control program. The CO[2] signal attenuation in the
   tubing was evaluated by Farrow et al. (1992). Tubing used for all CO[2]
   monitoring was made from opaque, black polypropylene (Impolene,
   Imperial Eastman, Chicago, IL) with low CO[2] adsorptivity and
   permeability, and high resistance to ultraviolet radiation.

FACE as a Research Platform

   RingPeople.jpg (25941 bytes) Large scale, free-air carbon dioxide
   enrichment (FACE) facilities provide a platform for multi-disciplinary,
   ecosystem-scale research into the effects of elevated atmospheric
   carbon dioxide concentrations on terrestrial ecosystems. The large
   CO[2]enriched volumes available at a FACE research facility encourages
   concurrent research by teams of investigators, who can study different
   aspects of ecosystem response to CO[2] enrichment.

   Since their studies are temporally and spatially co-located, the
   individual research studies can be integrated into a comprehensive view
   of the functioning of the ecosystem under elevated atmospheric CO[2]
   conditions.

   This concurrent use by numerous independent scientists provides
   economies of scale and the potential to gain new insights into
   ecosystem responses that are difficult or impossible to obtain with
   smaller scale studies. However, it also allows for common-mode errors
   or problems that may affect several different research projects.

Facility operations:

   The value of all research performed at a user facility is ultimately
   dependent on the care with which the facility is run. Down time,
   inaccurate or incomplete operations data, and poorly documented
   performance will limit the usefulness of all investigations conducted
   at the facility. Core facility operations must be adequately funded and
   managed to insure that the scientists using the facility have
   sufficient information to properly evaluate their results. The facility
   operations staff should be considered a part of the science team and
   kept informed of the needs and concerns of all investigators.
