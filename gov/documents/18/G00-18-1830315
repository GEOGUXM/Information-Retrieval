   The NCEM Image Analysis Facility (IAF) is designed to handle the
   computational needs of the users of the Center. Apart from hosting a
   number of commercial scientific software packages, there is also an
   on-going development of custom software solutions by the resident
   staff. The main focus of the IAF application software is in the area of
   image processing and image simulation, all with the goal of extracting,
   quantitatively if possible, structural information from images taken on
   the Center's electron microscopes.

Software

   Image processing and analysis facilities are available at several user
   stations in the computer user area. Listed below are the main software
   packages applied in the area of image simulation, image processing and
   modelling. In addition there are software packages for data analysis,
   plotting, image visualization and general presentation software. NCEM
   public domain software packages can be downloaded from our software
   page.

Image Simulation / Crystallography

     * NCEMSS (NCEM Simulation Software) for HRTEM image simulations.
       Developed at the NCEM, this package can simulate through-focus and
       through-thickness series of HRTEM images from model structures up
       to 25nm x 25nm in area (perfect crystal or defect structures). It
       includes symmetry operators for all 230 space groups and scattering
       factors for 98 elements. Executables for a number of common
       platforms are available from the NCEM for download.
     * SHRLI (Simulated High-Resolution Lattice Images) can be used for
       simulations from models up to 3nm x 3nm in area (perfect crystal or
       small defect structures). Images are displayed in 256-level
       grayscale.
     * MacTempas is a general HRTEM image simulation software package
       running on the NCEM Apple Macintosh computers. An add-on package
       for quantitative comparison of images and automatic parameter and
       structure refinement is currently being developed at the NCEM.
     * Desktop Microscopist is available on the 4 Macintosh workstations
       and provides a number of useful functions, ranging from tables of
       d-spacings and angles to CBED patterns, Kikuchi maps and search of
       the Electron Diffraction Data base for identification of unknown
       compounds.

   Through focus series of ARM images of [001] mullite showing the
   presence of an oxygen- deficient column is confirmed by image
   simulations. More at: T. Epicier, M.A. O'Keefe and G.Thomas, Acta
   Cryst. A46 (1990) 948-962.

   [tilt.gif]

   Simulated HRTEM images of a cubeoctahedron consisting of 561 Pd atoms,
   repesenting a typical catalyst particle. In experimental HRTEM
   investigations of dispersed catalysts, the orientations of the
   nanoparticles with respect to the incident electron beam are unknown. A
   large proportion of the particles present in any micrograph field will
   show the presence of "lattice fringes", leading to a first impression
   that many particles must lie close to zone-axis orientations. Since
   these particles are sufficiently small to possess large
   reciprocal-space shape functions that will be intersected by the Ewald
   sphere for quite large tilts away from the nearest zone axis, the
   electron scattering produced by these intersections will often lead to
   "lattice fringes" that are not simply related to the crystal structure
   of the particles. Such misleading "lattice fringes" can lead to
   misidentification of the particles.

                      Image Processing / Data Analysis

     * SEMPER is a general-purpose image processing package. It includes
       many operations suitable for processing of electron microscope
       images, and has been extended locally. It is used for Fourier-space
       filtering of experimental images, for cross-correlation and lattice
       averaging, and for spatial-frequency enhancement.
     * CRISP provides crystallographic image processing by applying
       symmetry principles to the Fourier transform of experimental high
       resolution electron microscope images of perfect crystals.
     * NIH Image is a public-domain package for general image manipulation
       with a limited set of image processing tools. It is useful for
       grayscale enhancing and Fourier filtering.
     * Prism is similar to, but greatly extends the capabilities of Image.
     * Digital Micrograph is a general image processing package with many
       features specific to electron microscopy. DM has been extended by
       several plug-in programs which have been developed at the Center.
     * EmiSpec for off-line analysis of spectral information obtained at
       the Center's analytical microscopes.
     * "NCEMPackage" is an extension to Digital Micrograph and contains a
       number of routines for image processing, analysis and feature
       extraction. It includes peak finding, lattice refinement,
       displacement analysis, noise reduction filters, template matching,
       routines for use in holography and more. It comes with an
       integrated help system on the available commands.
     * "Phase" is an extension to Digital Micrograph which uses the
       concept of the geometric phase to analyze variations in reciprocal
       space to determine quantitatively real space displacements, local
       lattice parameters and local strain. As with "NCEMPackage", an
       on-line help function is available.

                              Atomic modelling

     * CrystalKit produces models of interfaces and defects for input to
       either MacTempas, NCEMSS or EMS image simulation software packages.

   [CoSi2.gif]

   Example of modelling and image simulation of an interface between CoSi
   and Si. The model on the top was created in CrystalKit starting with
   two perfect lattices of CoSi and Si, defining the orientation
   relationship between the crystals, the interface plane and the zone
   axis. The model is shown slightly titled off the zone axis with the
   atomic bonds drawn. The atomic coordinates were then imported directly
   into MacTempas for simulation of the HRTEM image shown below.

                                  Hardware

           Presently the IAF equipment consists of the following:
     * Four Apple Macintosh 604/200 workstations for image simulation,
       image processing and general computing are networked to a file
       server. One machine is connected to a LeafScan 16 bit scanner for
       input of images from negatives.
     * One Apple Macintosh Quadra 800 is used as an input/output station.
       It is connected to a flatbed scanner, a SuperMac ProofPositive
       color dye-sublimation printer and a Matrix filmwriter.
     * One Apple Macintosh 604/132 server controls a Micropolis 16GB RAID
       5 disk array for storage of user data.
     * One 200MHZ PC runs off-line data analysis and image processing.

                               Input & Output

     Since all the computers are networked together, data that is input
       using any particular input device can be made available on all
    computers; similarly, data on any computer can be sent to any output
   device. Users should bring sufficient desired storage media if network
                         transfer is not available.

                               Input media --
     * Negatives -- selected areas of experimental micrographs can be
       input as digitized images using a Leafscan transmission scanner.
       This scanner supports a variety of negative sizes. For a 35mm
       film-window, maximum resolution gives 5080 pixels by 7400 pixels.
       Images can be digitized at 8 or, for wider dynamic range, at 16
       bits. This scanner accepts positive or negative transparencies in
       color or black/white.
     * Prints -- can be scanned in as 8-bit pixels at a resolution of up
       to 800 dots per inch through a gray-scale Agfa scanner, or through
       a ScanMaker II RGB/Grayscale scanner.
     * Video tape and live video -- frames can be digitized (grabbed) as
       8-bit images with 640 by 480 pixels.

                               Output media --
     * Slides -- 24-bit color slides can be produced on 35mm film at a
       resolution of 4096x2732 pixels.
     * Negatives -- 35mm negatives of grayscale images can be output with
       8-bit intensity (256 levels of gray) at a maximum resolution of
       4096x2732 pixels
     * Paper -- images can be output as laserprinter halftones on 8.5" x
       11" paper or in color/grayscale on a dye-sublimation SuperMac
       Proofpositive printer and also on an Apple Color Stylewriter.
     * Storage Media -- 3.5" floppy disk , 44MB/88MB or 200MB 5-1/4"
       Syquest cartridges, CD-ROM, 100MB Iomega Zip.
     * Networks -- user data (including simulated or processed images) can
       be output over ethernet to the user's own computer using FTP.
