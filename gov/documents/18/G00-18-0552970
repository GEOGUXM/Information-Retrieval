                                  Cosmology

            Cosmology is the science of the Universe as a whole.

   We live in a scientific age in which new knowledge is generated by
   observation and careful deduction.

   Cosmology is now a very active branch of science, which draws upon the
   principles of mathematics and physics as applied to astronomical and
   astrophysical observations.

   The scientific age began four centuries ago, when scientists such as
   Galileo Galilei, realized that the way to knowledge and understanding
   must be based upon observations of Nature and demonstrated facts rather
   than upon a dogma or intellectual construct.

   Prior to the development of the scientific method, philosophers sifted
   through facts and observations keeping those that matched their theory
   and rejecting those that didnÂ’t.

   The astronomers of Ancient Greece put the Earth firmly at the center of
   the Universe because that fit their principles of physics and
   preconceived ideas that the stars could not be so big and far away.

   In the 16^th century, Nicolas Copernicus, a Polish monk, put forward
   the idea that the planets and the Earth orbit the Sun. This concept was
   in direct conflict with the teachings of the Church, which held that
   the Earth was the center of the Universe and that Heaven was beyond the
   Celestial Spheres for the planets. Copernicus's heliocentri model of he
   Universe never obtained support from the Chuch during his lifetime. He
   died in 1543, unaware that he had sown the seeds for a revolution
   initiated by Galileo that laid the foundations for the scientific age
   and a systematic evolution in our view of the Universe.

   Galileo is the architect of moder science because he built a telescope
   powerful enough to study the moon and planets and he his his
   observations to demonstrate that the Copernican model is corrrect. He
   then publicized his results.

   Cosmologists today have equipment and resources that Galileo could not
   have imagined. Nevertheless, the Scientific Method developed by Galileo
   and others continues to be the guiding principle and approach for
   scientists of all disciplines.

   Cosmologists develop and use extremely sophisticated scientific
   instruments and high-power telescopes to observer the most distant
   objects known. They use powerful computers and alogrithms to process
   and analyze their observations. They work on very complicated
   mathematical theories to make predictions to test their theories. They
   study the nature of matter on a scale which is incredibly small as they
   strive to understand the origins of the Universe. Cosmology in the
   scientific age is a highly specialized branch of science, which has the
   primary aim of answering fundamental questions about the Universe.

   Cosmologist are perhaps more aware than most scientists of the need to
   make their work accessable and understandable to non-scientists as well
   as to scientists in other disciplines. Te big questions of cosmology
   are of great interest to people from all walks of life.

   For example

   Is the Universe finite or infinite?

   If it is finite, how big is it?

   Is the Universe curved? (open, flat, or closed?)

   How old is the Universe?

   How did the Universe begin?

   What is the future of the Universe?

   As time has gone on the scientific method has provided some surprising
   answers.

   And raised more questions as our ignorance is illuminated to the point
   we have a good idea of the large scale picture of cosmology.
