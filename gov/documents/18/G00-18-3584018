A schematic of the APEX detector which has been designed to search for
antiproton decay at the Fermilab antiproton accumulator.

The APEX detector is shown during installation. The large cylinder is the APEX
vacuum tank. Downstream of the tank are three planes of counters. The
scintillating fiber tracking detectors are the objects wrapped in silver paper.

"Just installed !" A subset of the APEX collaboration standing in front of the
newly installed detector in March 1995. Front row: Ron Ray, Martin Hu, Mike
Martens, Brent Corbin, Steve Geer (spokesman). Back row: Dick Gustafson, Andy
Scott, William Wester.

The back of the calorimeter seen just before the installation of the tail
catcher and muon telescope. Visible are the phototube bases, cabling, and the
beampipe which passes through the center of the calorimeter. The silver assembly
to the left of the picture is some vacuum equipment in the beamline.

Looking downstream just after installation of the APEX experiment. The silver
assembly at the right of the picture is some vacuum equipment in the beamline.
Just downstream of this there is a plane of veto counters followed by the
cylindrical APEX decay tank (wrapped in brown heating blanket). Mike Martens can
be seen standing in the experimental pit. Downstream of the tank the silver
wrapping that contains phototubes for the scintillating fiber tracker can be
seen.

The front face of the calorimeter which is constructed from 10 x 10 cm^2 cells.
The central cell is missing to enable the beampipe to pass through the
calorimeter. This picture was taken in 1992 after installation of the APEX test
experiment T861.

Side view of the three planes of DEDX counters and fiber trackers seen just
after installation in March 1995. The 3 upper and 3 lower phototubes are 5"
tubes mounted on the horizontal dEdx counters. The silver wrappers contain the
multianode scintillating fiber phototubes. To the left of the picture the end of
the decay tank can be seen. Tom Armstrong is perched on the right.

Steve Geer (spokesman) standing in front of the calorimeter after installation
of the T861 APEX test experiment in the spring of 1992. The beampipe of the
antiproton accumulator can be seen passing through the center of the
calorimeter.

Mike Martens standing behind the 3.7 m long APEX decay tank, which was operated
at 10^-11 Torr. Ports for r.f. coupling loops and Ti-sublimation pumps are
visible.

The APEX test experiment T861 after installation in spring 1992. The antiproton
accumulator beampipe is seen going through the front face of the calorimeter.
Just in front of the calorimeter scintillation counters are seen on the left and
right of the beampipe. Further scintillation counters form a box around the
beampipe at the right of the picture.
