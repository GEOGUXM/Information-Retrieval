RUC/MAPS Information
     __________________________________________________________________

  Regional Analysis and Prediction Branch -- NOAA /OAR / FSL /FRD

   The Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) is an operational atmospheric prediction
   system comprising primarily of a numerical forecast model and an
   analysis system to initialize that model. MAPS is the research
   counterpart to the RUC. The RUC has been developed to serve users
   needing short-range weather forecasts, including those in the US
   aviation community.

   , Great Lakes , NE , SE) . FSL test version: Forecasts out to 24 h
   updated every 3 h, hourly forecasts out to 6 h. Information on 20km RUC

   The RAP Branch focuses on the development of the
     * Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) - running operationally at the National
       Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
     * Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) - the development
       version of the RUC, run in various test versions in real time at
       FSL.

   The key features of RUC/MAPS include:
     * high-frequency (every 1 h) 3-d objective analyses over the
       contiguous United States
     * high-frequency short-range weather model forecasts (out to 12 h) in
       support of aviation and other mesoscale weather forecast users
     * currently assimilates data from
          + commercial aircraft (relayed through ACARS - Aircraft
            Communications, Addressing, and Reporting System)
          + wind profilers (404 and boundary-layer 915 MHz)
          + rawinsondes and special dropwinsondes
          + surface reporting stations and buoys
          + RASS (Radio Acoustic Sounding System) - experimental
          + VAD (velocity-azimuth display) winds from NWS WSR-88D radars
          + GOES total precipitable water estimates
          + SSM/I total precipitable water estimates
          + GPS total precipitable water estimates
          + GOES high-density visible and IR cloud drift winds
     * uses a hybrid isentropic-sigma vertical coordinate.

   The RUC development and implementation effort receives substantial
   support from NOAA and the FAA's Aviation Weather Research Program
