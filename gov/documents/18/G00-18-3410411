     The Apex Predators Program (APP) is located at the Narragansett, RI
    Laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast
    Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC). We are one of three programs in the
    Population Biology Branch of the Fisheries and Ecosystems Monitoring
      and Analysis Division. The mission of the APP is to conduct life
     history studies of commercially and recreationally important shark
       species. Our research is focused on migrations, age and growth,
    reproductive biology, and feeding ecology. Information gathered from
       our research programs provides baseline biological data for the
                    management of large Atlantic sharks.
