          Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act

   The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA)
   was signed into law on November 13th, 1998, becoming P.L. 105-383. The
   Act recognized that many of our nation's coastal areas suffer from
   harmful algal blooms (HAB) and hypoxia each year, threatening coastal
   ecosystems and endangering human health. To respond to these concerns,
   the act calls for:

   (1) The Establishment of an Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal
   Blooms and Hypoxia
   (2) A National Assessment on Harmful Algal Blooms
   (3) A National Assessment on Hypoxia
   (4) An Assessment and a Plan for Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico

   The Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia met
   April 15, 1999, to review the outlines for the two national
   assessments, discuss methods for stakeholder participation, and develop
   a timeline for these assessments. According to the law, the Task Force
   must submit the two national assessments to Congress by November 13,
   1999.

   The law requires that these national assessments be developed in
   cooperation with states, Indian tribes, local governments, industry,
   academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations. A meeting
   with a small group of Stakeholders was held on June 2, 1999. As chair
   of the Coordinating Committee, a representative from the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), gave a presentation on
   Processes for Stakeholder Participation in the two national
   assessments. Then, the group discussed these processes and developed a
   Stakeholder Communication Strategy. This web page is a key part of the
   strategy to solicit broad input.

   The Coordinating Committee, created to support the Task Force,
   developed outlines and initial drafts of a National Assessment on
   Harmful Algal Blooms and a National Assessment on Hypoxia. We would
   like your input on these very early drafts (and subsequent revisions).

   For example, do the assessments:
     * answer the right questions?
     * address the right issues?
     * evaluate the right management options?
     * use the right sources?

   Send your comments to habhrca@www.habhrca.noaa.gov

   The drafts for these national assessments are based on federal, state,
   and academic reports collected over the last 5-10 years (References for
   the HAB Assessment and References for the Hypoxia Assessment). If you
   know of other useful reports, let us know
   (habhrca@www.habhrca.noaa.gov).

   We are currently looking for more opportunities to discuss HABHRCA with
   the public.  Do you know of other meetings this fall where HABHRCA
   discussions would be appropriate?  Would you like to organize and host
   a forum to discuss the progress and findings of the assessment?  We are
   looking for meetings, places, and people who are willing to organize
   these sessions.  If you have any suggestions, please send them to:
   habhrca@www.habhrca.noaa.gov

   With regard to the Assessment and Plan for Hypoxia in the Gulf of
   Mexico, HABHRCA codifies a process which had already begun following a
   request by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task
   Force (MR/GM). The MR/GM Task Force, formed in the Fall of 1997, asked
   the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) for a
   scientific assessment on the causes and consequences of Gulf hypoxia.
   The OSTP, through its Committee on Environment and Natural Resources
   (CENR), established a Hypoxia Work Group, chaired by NOAA, which
   developed a plan to conduct the scientific assessment. At the HABHRCA
   Task Force meeting of April 15, 1999 it was agreed that the existing
   CENR Hypoxia Work Group would continue to be responsible for the
   integrated assessment of the causes and consequences of hypoxia in the
   Gulf of Mexico as called for under this law. Six technical papers that
   form the basis for the integrated assessment are currently available
   for public comment. Please direct your comments on those papers to
   hypoxiawg@cop.noaa.gov

   The MR/GM Task Force was also asked to take on the responsibility for
   developing the Action Plan required by the law and they are expected to
   formally accept this charge at their next meeting at the end of June.
   The Action Plan will consist of recommendations to reduce, mitigate,
   and control hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on the results
   of the integrated assessment.
