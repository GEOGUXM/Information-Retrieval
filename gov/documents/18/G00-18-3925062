   The December 1999 launch of  Terra, the first of the Earth Observing
   System (EOS) series of satellites, commenced a period in NASA's history
   during which unprecedented amounts of data will be available.  The
   overall goal has been to study our global environment and obtain
   sustained and continuous observati-ons of the Earth's atmosphere,
   oceans, land surfaces, ice coverage, and land uses. Twenty-four
   distinct measurement areas are having significant data collected,
   processed, analyzed and used to improve our understanding of the Earth.
   We have initiated a period of greatly enhanced observational capability
   for understanding the planet and how it is changing, both naturally and
   as the result of human interaction. The planned launch of the second
   satellite, Aqua, will result in even more valuable information.

   The volume of data which will be produced is without precedent. Over
   one terabyte (10^12 bytes) of data will be produced by the EOS project
   each day.

   The number of users of this data now exceeds  10,000 and includes
   representation from all user domains.

   NASA has built the EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) to handle
   this immense influx of information, and is using the Hierarchial Data
   Format for

   EOS (HDF-EOS), developed as an extension to NCSA's HDF.  This website
   is designed and maintained to facilitate and broaden the use and
   utility of HDF-EOS.

   NASA invites your participation in the ongoing development and
   implementation of HDF-EOS as the primary data standard for NASA's Earth
   Science data. Please direct any questions or comments to:
