The Safeguards, Safety and Nonproliferation (SSN) Division at Brookhaven
National Laboratory conducts research and development and provides technical
support in the areas of nonproliferation and national security.

The division's programs are divided into seven areas:

     SSN and its predecessor organization TSO have been involved in
     nuclear safeguards and security issues since 1968. SSN facilities
     include a classified document repository, the SSN LIBRARY, a
     laboratory for nuclear detector development, electronic and
     mechanical assembly facilities, a machine shop, a laser laboratory,
     bioassay laboratories, and other laboratories for Raman LIDAR and
     optical sensing systems.
