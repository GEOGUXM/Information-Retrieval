   Site Content

   The FirstGov for Employers Web site provides a wealth of information
   for new business owners and experienced business owners alike. Included
   in these pages you will find information such as the requirements
   related to hiring employees, periodic reporting requirements,
   downloadable forms and publications (requires the latest version of the
   free Adobe Acrobat Reader* to read and print them), electronic
   services, and links to other helpful Web sites.

   Site Navigation

   Each page begins with a table containing a banner and a top navigation
   bar. The navigation bar contains links to the Home page, the Help page,
   and the Site Map. The bottom of each page contains links to the
   Contact, Privacy Statement, Linking Policy, and our Disclaimer, as well
   as to the Adobe and Excite Web sites.

   Pages are presented in a table containing a navigation bar on the left
   and page content on the right. At the top of each page is a graphic
   containing a link to the content area of the page to provide a method
   of skipping redundant navigational links.

   Site Accessibility

   This Web site is designed to assure it will serve the needs of as many
   people as possible. In the spirit of universal access, the use of
   alternative (text-only) pages has been minimized, and each page coded
   with accessibility in mind. Prior to release, each new Web page is
   tested with Bobby Accessibility* software.

   Many of the pages on this site offer links to downloadable forms and
   publications from other Web sites. These forms and publications are in
   Adobe Acrobat PDF format. For assistance in viewing these files, the
   Adobe Web site provides information for the Visually Impaired.

   Should you experience any problems using this site, please contact us,
   and we will respond to you in a timely manner. We welcome any comments
   or suggestions regarding this site.

   Tax Law or Wage Reporting Questions

   If you have specific tax law or wage reporting questions, we recommend
   that you forward your questions to the IRS Help Desk*, as they can
   provide the expertise to assist you in answering your questions. For
   other employment law questions, please contact the appropriate federal
   agency.
