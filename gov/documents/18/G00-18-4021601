   Soil and Water Conservation Assistance Program

        The Soil and Water Conservation Assistance Program is a voluntary
   effort for farmers and ranchers that provides cost share and incentive
   payments to address threats to soil, water and related natural
   resources, including grazing land, wetland and wildlife habitat; comply
   with Federal and State environmental laws; and make beneficial,
   cost-effective changes to cropping systems, grazing management, manure,
   nutrient, pest, or irrigation management, land uses, or other measures
   needed to conserve and improve soil, water and related natural
   resources.

   Scope
       SWCA is available nationwide, but only in areas not designated
   under section 1230(c) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C.
   3830(c)).
       These are areas outside the Environmental Quality Incentives
   Program (EQIP) designated priority areas, Wetlands Reserve Program
   (WRP) priority areas, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) national
   priority areas.
       SWCA will help address the current unfunded backlog of conservation
   applications and other Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
   conservation program requests.

   Funding
       SWCA is budgeted at $20 million for fiscal year 2001. Funds are
   distributed to the states using an allocation formula which is based on
   29 environmental factors which characterize the resources of the state,
   and consideration of those areas of the state that are outside of EQIP
   priority areas, WRP priority areas, and CRP national priority areas.

   Eligibility Requirements
       Applicants must own or control the land and agree to implement
   specific eligible conservation practices.

   Specifics
       The NRCS state conservationist, in consultation with the State
   Technical Committee, will determine eligible practices, using a
   locally-led process.
       Cost-shared practices shall be maintained for the life of the
   practice.
       There will be a continuous signup, with periodic ranking cutoff
   dates as determined by the state conservationist in consultation with
   the State Technical Committee.
       The state conservationist, with input from the State Technical
   Committee, will rank and select applications for funding.
       There will be a five- to 10-year contract period. The maximum total
   payment per participant for SWCA shall not exceed $50,000.
       The federal share will be 75 percent of the cost of an eligible
   practice, based on the percent of actual cost, percent of actual cost
   with not-to-exceed limits and flat rates or average costs. Participants
   will be paid based upon certification of completion of the approved
   practice.

   In-Kind Contributions
       Producers may contribute to the cost of a practice through in-kind
   sources. Eligible in-kind contributions may include: personal labor,
   use of personal equipment, donated labor or materials, and on-hand or
   approved used materials.

   Program Responsibility
       NRCS is the agency designated by the Secretary of Agriculture as
   being responsible for program management and leadership for SWCA.
       The Farm Service Agency (FSA) will disburse the cost share and
   incentive payments to the participants. FSA provides facilities on
   behalf of CCC to make program payments to participants.
