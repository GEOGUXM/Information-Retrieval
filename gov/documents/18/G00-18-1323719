   Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April
   2000 1. Introduction The United States Department of Energy (DOE)
   presents this Proposed Plan for site-wide interim remedial actions at
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Site 300 for public
   review and comment. DOE is the responsible party and lead agency for
   environmental investigations and cleanup of Site 300. This Proposed
   Plan summarizes DOE's preferred cleanup interim actions for areas at
   Site 300 where contaminants were released, and includes information
   previously presented in numerous site investigation reports and the
   Site 300 Site-Wide Feasibility Study (SWFS) (Ferry et al., 1999). It
   meets the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
   Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, or Superfund). CERCLA
   regulates past releases but not ongoing operations at a site. At Site
   300, the State of California and local agencies regulate ongoing
   operations. This expanded, comprehensive version of DOE's Proposed Plan
   is supplemented by an abbreviated fact sheet version. Both versions are
   intended to aid the public in commenting on DOE's proposed cleanup
   plans. Information on how to obtain copies of both versions of the
   Proposed Plan and who to contact for additional information is
   presented in Section 7. DOE encourages members of the local community
   and other concerned citizens to review and comment on the proposed
   actions before an interim cleanup strategy is selected and approved.
   These comments will be considered when DOE selects the interim cleanup
   measures that will be performed at Site 300. Following public comment,
   DOE will describe the cleanup plan in an Interim Record of Decision
   (ROD), which will be submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval.
   Public comments on this Proposed Plan will be addressed in a
   Responsiveness Summary, which will be included with the Interim ROD.
   The Interim ROD is scheduled to be finalized in December 2000. This ROD
   will be considered interim because: (1) additional testing and
   evaluation of technologies is still taking place, (2) final cleanup
   standards are being negotiated, and (3) some areas of Site 300 still
   need further investigation. DOE has agreed that ground water cleanup
   goals will be no higher than drinking water standards or any more
   stringent State Water Quality Objectives during this interim cleanup. A
   final ROD, which will set final cleanup levels, will be submitted in
   2007. The selected interim remedies are intended to be consistent with
   the final remedies, although the ultimate decision will be made at the
   time of the final ROD. Cost estimates are based on a 30 year period of
   operation for comparison purposes only. The interim and final cleanup
   actions will be selected in consultation with the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA), the California Department of Toxic Substances
   Control (DTSC), and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
   (RWQCB). DOE believes that implementing the preferred interim remedial
   actions will protect human health and restore the environment at Site
   300 in a responsible, cost-effective manner. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 1
   UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at
   Site 300 April 2000 2. Site Background LLNL Site 300 is an 11 square
   mile DOE facility operated by the University of California. It is
   located in the Altamont Hills approximately 17 miles east of Livermore
   and 8.5 miles southwest of Tracy (Figure 1). Most of the site is in San
   Joaquin County, but the western part is in Alameda County. Access to
   Site 300 is restricted by perimeter fencing and security guards.
   Although nuclear weapons have never been tested at Site 300,
   non-fissile radioactive materials may be included in explosive
   components that are tested during firing table activities. As a
   consequence, radioactive debris may be generated from detonation of
   these test assemblies. Current practices mitigate the environmental
   impact of these activities. Site 300 is primarily an experimental test
   facility that conducts research, development, and testing of high
   explosives materials. Experiments began at Site 300 in 1955. During
   site operations, a number of contaminants were released to the
   environment. These releases primarily occurred from surface spills,
   leaching from unlined landfills and pits, high explosive test
   detonations, and past disposal of waste fluids in lagoons and dry wells
   (sumps). DOE began environmental restoration at Site 300 in 1981. Prior
   to 1990, environmental investigations at Site 300 were conducted under
   the oversight of the California RWQCB. In 1990, the U.S. EPA placed
   Site 300 on the National Priorities (Superfund) List. Since then, the
   U.S. EPA and the State of California have jointly regulated the
   environmental cleanup process. Environmental investigations identified
   23 locations where contaminants were released to the environment. The
   nature and location of these release sites are shown on Figure 2. The
   primary contaminants at Site 300 include the solvent trichloroethylene
   (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), high explosive (HE)
   compounds (HMX and RDX), perchlorate, tritium, uranium-238, nitrate,
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), silicone-based oil (TBOS/TKEBS), and
   metals. In some cases, these compounds have migrated into ground water
   as shown on Figure 3. 2.1. Description of Operable Units All release
   sites at Site 300 have been assigned to one of eight operable units
   (OUs) (Figure 2) to more effectively manage the site cleanup. The eight
   OUs are briefly described below and the seven OUs for which additional
   remedies are proposed in this Plan are discussed in Section 6. 2.1.1.
   General Services Area (OU 1) Past disposal of degreasing solvents
   caused VOC contamination in the subsurface. A ROD for this OU was
   signed in 1997, and ground water and soil cleanup is underway. The
   final cleanup remedy was determined by DOE after considering public
   comments related to the remedial alternatives for this OU. Since the
   cleanup strategy has been decided for this OU, it is not discussed
   further in this Proposed Plan. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 2 UCRL-AR-136376
   Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April
   2000 2.1.2. Building 834 (OU 2) Past TCE spills have resulted in soil
   and ground water contamination. Silicone-based lubricating oil
   (TBOS/TKEBS) is also present in ground water. Some TCE-contaminated
   soil was removed in 1983. An Interim ROD was signed in 1995, and ground
   water and soil cleanup is underway. Innovative cleanup technologies are
   also being tested at Building 834. 2.1.3. Pit 6 Landfill (OU 3) From
   1964 to 1973, waste was buried in 9 unlined debris trenches and animal
   pits at the Pit 6 Landfill. The waste included laboratory equipment,
   craft shop debris, and biomedical waste. VOCs, tritium, perchlorate,
   and nitrate are present in ground water near the landfill. DOE
   excavated the portion of the waste containing uranium-238 in 1971. The
   landfill was capped in 1997 to prevent infiltrating rain water from
   further leaching contaminants from the buried waste. 2.1.4. HE Process
   Area (OU 4) Spills occurred at the former Building 815 steam plant,
   where TCE was once used to clean pipelines, resulting in soil
   contamination and a plume of TCE in ground water. High explosives,
   nitrate, and perchlorate have also been found in the soil and ground
   water as a result of wastewater discharges to unlined lagoons, which
   were closed in 1989. Ground water extraction and treatment is underway
   to prevent TCE in ground water from Building 815 from moving offsite.
   Similar contaminants were also found in ground water near the former
   High Explosive Burn Pits, which were capped in 1998. 2.1.5. Building
   850/Pits 3 & 5 (OU 5) This OU has been divided into 3 subareas for
   cleanup evaluation purposes: the Building 850 Firing Table area, the
   Pit 2 Landfill area and the Pit 7 Complex area (consisting of the Pit
   3, 4, 5 and 7 landfills). Each of these subareas is described below.
   2.1.5.1. Building 850 Firing Table Area Tritium, uranium-238, high
   explosives, metals, and PCBs were found near the Building 850 firing
   table. PCB-contaminated shrapnel around the firing table from explosive
   experiments was removed in 1998. A sand pile contaminated with tritium
   is located on the edge of the firing table. 2.1.5.2. Pit 2 Landfill
   Area The Pit 2 Landfill operated from 1956 to 1960 and contains firing
   table waste from Buildings 801 and 802. There is no evidence of
   contaminant release from the Pit 2 Landfill. The nearby Pit 1 Landfill,
   where contamination has been detected only in the soil, was closed by
   capping in 1992. Therefore, it is not discussed further in this
   Proposed Plan. 2.1.5.3. Pit 7 Complex Area From 1958 to 1988, a large
   volume of gravel and debris was generated by high-explosive firing
   table operations and placed in four unlined landfills at the Pit 7
   Complex. Uranium-238 and tritium have been and continue to be released
   from the Complex. These releases cause ongoing contamination of the
   ground water. Several remedial alternatives for the Complex were
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 3 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 presented in the SWFS, but
   DOE and the regulatory agencies have agreed that additional site
   characterization and evaluation of cleanup options is required prior to
   selecting a remedy. Significant remaining issues include: * DOE is
   continuing to investigate the amount and distribution of tritium and
   uranium sources in the landfill waste. It is necessary to further
   characterize the main contaminant sources in the landfills to support
   modeling needed to make remediation decisions. * The magnitude and
   extent of uranium contamination in ground water resulting from DOE
   activities relative to natural sources of uranium is still being
   determined. * The implementability and permanence of permeable reactive
   barriers, in situ stabilization, freezing, or source control
   technologies other than excavation and/or capping have not been fully
   evaluated. The Site 300 Remedial Project Managers agree that DOE should
   address the Complex separately, and not include a preferred remedy in
   this Proposed Plan. Proposed future activities include: 1. Continued
   characterization of the landfill waste; 2. Further investigations into
   the fate and transport of contaminants; 3. Modeling to predict the
   future extent of the tritium and uranium plumes with and without source
   control; and 4. Large and small scale treatability studies to evaluate
   remedial technologies. The information obtained during these
   investigations will be included in a focused, area-specific Remedial
   Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the Pit 7 Complex. The
   feasibility study portion of this document will evaluate a wider range
   of technologies than were presented in the SWFS. Following the focused
   RI/FS, a preferred remedy will be presented in a Pit 7 Complex Proposed
   Plan and at a public meeting. DOE will prepare an Interim ROD for the
   Pit 7 Complex which will be incorporated as an amendment to the Interim
   Site-Wide ROD. The public will be encouraged to participate throughout
   the remedy selection process. A document and milestone schedule for the
   Pit 7 Complex will be determined with the regulatory agencies prior to
   signing the Site-Wide Interim ROD. DOE believes that considering
   additional remediation alternatives for the Pit 7 Complex will result
   in the selection of a permanent, cost-effective solution while
   remediation activities continue at other OUs at Site 300. The Pit 7
   Complex is not discussed further in this Proposed Plan. 2.1.6. Building
   854 (OU 6) TCE was used at Building 854 as a heat-exchange fluid, and
   was found in soil and ground water. Other contaminants at Building 854
   include nitrate, perchlorate, tritium, PCBs, metals, high explosives,
   and uranium-238. Some of the TCE-contaminated soil was excavated in
   1983. Ground water extraction in the source area began in 1999, as a
   treatability study. 2.1.7. Building 832 Canyon (OU 7) VOCs, nitrate,
   high explosives, and perchlorate have been found in soil and ground
   water at Buildings 830 and 832. A treatability study is underway to
   evaluate whether ground water and soil vapor extraction would be
   effective cleanup measures for the VOCs. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 4

   Site 300 April 2000 2.1.8. Buildings 801, 833, 845, and 851 and the Pit
   9 Landfill (OU 8) As described below, OU 8 is divided into four
   subareas for cleanup evaluation purposes: the Building 801 Firing Table
   area, the Building 833 area, the Building 845 and Pit 9 Landfill area,
   and the Building 851 Firing Table area. Building 801 Firing Table The
   Building 801 firing table was used for explosives testing, and its
   operation resulted in contamination of adjacent with metals and
   uranium-238. No contaminants have been found in ground water. Use of
   this firing table was discontinued in 1998 to accommodate an expanded
   facility. The firing table gravel and some underlying soil were
   removed. Waste fluid discharges to the Building 801 dry well resulted
   in low concentrations of VOCs in soil and ground water. The dry well
   was decommissioned and filled with concrete in 1984. Debris from the
   firing table was buried in the nearby Pit 8 Landfill until 1974, but
   there is no evidence of contaminant release from the Pit 8 Landfill.
   Building 833 TCE was used as a heat-exchange fluid at Building 833.
   Surface discharge of waste fluids caused contamination of soil and
   ground water. Building 845 and Pit 9 Landfill The Building 845 firing
   table was used until 1963 to conduct explosives experiments and
   continues to be used for explosive waste treatment. As a result, the
   soil is contaminated with uranium-238 and high explosives. Debris
   generated at the Building 845 firing table was buried in the Pit 9
   Landfill, but no evidence of release from the landfill has been found.
   Building 851 Firing Table This active firing table is still used to
   conduct experimental high explosives research. These experiments have
   resulted in uranium-238, high explosives, metals, and VOCs in soil, and
   uranium-238 in ground water. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 5 UCRL-AR-136376
   Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April
   2000 3. Summary of Site Risks A baseline risk assessment was conducted
   for Site 300 (Webster-Scholten, 1994) to evaluate risks to people,
   plants, and animals that may be exposed to contaminants in soil, air,
   surface water, or ground water. Risk assessments predict the magnitude,
   if any, of adverse health effects. The baseline risk assessment
   identified the contaminants and potential exposure pathways that may
   need to be addressed by cleanup actions. The Site 300 baseline risk
   assessment evaluated present and future risks under the assumption that
   no cleanup would take place. Selection of cleanup actions will be based
   in part on the extent to which they can reduce these risks. The Site
   300 baseline risk assessment used conservative assumptions that favored
   protecting public health and the environment. Therefore, actual human
   or ecological exposure and risk are likely to be much lower than those
   calculated in the baseline risk assessment. Furthermore, the baseline
   risk assessment used the historical maximum contaminant concentrations,
   many of which have decreased over time. Carcinogenic (cancer) risk for
   humans is expressed as the probability of developing cancer over a
   lifetime. For example, an additional cancer risk of one in one million
   (1 × 106) means that there is potential to increase the risk of getting
   cancer by one in one million in addition to the cancer risk from other
   causes1. An additional cancer risk of one in one million or less is
   acceptable to the U.S. EPA. An additional cancer risk between one in
   ten thousand (1 × 104) and one in one million (1 × 106) may be
   acceptable provided the risk is properly managed by decreasing exposure
   potential. U.S. EPA requires that cancer risks above one in one million
   must be addressed by various risk controls and/or remedial actions, as
   discussed in the SWFS. For noncarcinogens, a Hazard Quotient (HQ) is
   calculated for each individual contaminant. The HQ is the ratio of
   calculated exposure to acceptable exposure values, as determined by the
   U.S. EPA and State Agencies. HQs for multiple contaminants are added
   together to provide a Hazard Index (HI). HIs less than 1 are considered
   protective of human health. The ecological HI is the ratio of observed
   exposure to a toxicological benchmark derived from existing scientific
   literature. Baseline human health risks and hazards for Site 300 were
   estimated using industrial adult onsite exposure and offsite
   residential exposure scenarios. The adult onsite exposure scenario
   estimates health risk where an adult is assumed to work in the
   immediate vicinity of worst-case contamination 8 hours a day, 5 days
   per week for 30 years. The residential exposure scenario estimates the
   risk to a family living adjacent to the site. The risks associated with
   ingestion of ground water were calculated for residents drinking water
   from hypothetical wells at the site boundary and from existing private
   wells near the site. Risk estimates for most release sites and
   contaminants were well below the protective threshold designated by the
   U.S. EPA. Adult onsite risks above this threshold were generally
   associated with (1) workers inhaling VOCs and/or tritium volatilizing
   from the subsurface, or (2) direct skin contact with PCBs and dioxins
   in the soil. Onsite risks were also associated with 1 Note: The risk of
   getting cancer from other causes is one in three for Californians.
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 6 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 drinking contaminated
   ground water; however, ground water from wells is not currently used
   for drinking at Site 300. Estimated offsite residential risks were
   associated with people potentially drinking contaminated ground water,
   or inhaling vapors volatilizing from contaminated surface water.
   However, no members of the public are currently being exposed to any
   contaminants from Site 300. The Site 300 ecological assessment
   evaluated the potential for adverse impact to plants and animals from
   long-term exposure to contaminants, and focused on potential
   reproductive damage and reductions in reproductive life span rather
   than the risk of developing cancer. The Site 300 baseline ecological
   risk assessment identified potential impacts to several animal species
   that could potentially visit or migrate into contaminated areas at Site
   300. HQs for individual ground squirrels exceeded 1 for TCE and
   perchloroethylene (PCE) in the Building 834 and Pit 6 Landfill OUs. In
   addition, HQs for cadmium exceeded 1 for adult animals in the Building
   834, HE Process, and Building 850 areas. However, an evaluation of the
   percentage of the affected population, as well as the distribution of
   the ground squirrel population (both in space and time), provides
   evidence that the Site 300 ground squirrel population has not been
   adversely impacted by contaminants at the site. HQs for individual deer
   exceeded 1 for cadmium in the Building 834, HE Process, Building 850,
   and Building 801 areas. In 1994, additional soil samples were collected
   throughout the site and a detailed record of deer sightings was
   maintained and analyzed. Areas with deer sightings generally had low to
   non-detectable cadmium levels, indicating that the localized presence
   of cadmium does not pose a significant threat to the deer populations,
   as their primary habitat does not exhibit elevated cadmium levels. HQs
   for individual kit fox (a State of California and federally-listed
   endangered species) exceeded 1 for TCE, PCE, and cadmium in the
   Building 834 OU, and for TCE and PCE in the Pit 6 Landfill OU. While
   there is no evidence that kit fox currently use these areas, individual
   kit fox living in dens in these areas in the future are potentially at
   risk. A single observation of a Swainson's Hawk (a threatened species)
   was made in the California Department of Fish and Game Ecological
   Reserve, adjacent to Site 300. However, Site 300 is not its preferred
   habitat. As the Swainson Hawk's normal territory is from about 2,000 to
   10,000 acres, it is unlikely that any single individual would spend
   significant time at Site 300, and localized contamination at Site 300
   is unlikely to cause any adverse impact. Numerical baseline risk
   estimates for each area at Site 300 are presented in Section 6 of this
   Proposed Plan. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 7 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed
   Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 4. Cleanup
   Objectives The preferred remedial alternatives address VOCs, tritium,
   uranium-238, perchlorate, nitrate, high explosive compounds, PCBs, and
   other contaminants in surface and subsurface soil/rock, surface water,
   ground water, and air at the seven Site 300 OUs described in this
   Proposed Plan. The cleanup objectives for the Interim ROD for the Site
   300 contaminants of concern are: For Human Health Protection: 1.
   Restore ground water containing contaminant concentrations (single
   carcinogen) above State and Federal Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)
   and any more stringent Water Quality Objectives. Prevent futher impacts
   on ground water above State and Federal MCLs and any more stringent
   Water Quality Objectives from contaminated soil. 2. Prevent human
   incidental ingestion and direct dermal contact with contaminants in
   surface soil that pose an excess cancer risk of 1 × 106 (one in one
   million) or a HQ greater than 1, a cumulative excess cancer risk (all
   carcinogens) in excess of 1 × 104 (one in ten thousand), or a
   cumulative HI (all noncarcinogens) greater than 1. 3. Prevent human
   inhalation of VOCs and tritium volatilizing from subsurface soil to air
   that poses an excess cancer risk of greater than 1 × 106 (one in one
   million), or HQ greater than 1, a cumulative excess cancer risk (all
   carcinogens) in excess of 1 × 104 (one in ten thousand), or a
   cumulative HI (all noncarcinogens) greater than 1. 4. Prevent human
   inhalation of VOCs and tritium volatilizing from surface water to air
   that poses an excess cancer risk greater than 1 × 106 (one in one
   million), or HQ greater than 1, a cumulative excess cancer risk (all
   carcinogens) in excess of 1 × 104 (one in ten thousand), or a
   cumulative HI (all noncarcinogens) greater than 1. 5. Prevent human
   inhalation of contaminants bound to resuspended surface soil particles
   that poses an excess cancer risk greater than 1 × 106 (one in one
   million), or HQ greater than 1, a cumulative excess cancer risk (all
   carcinogens) in excess of 1 × 104 (one in ten thousand), or a
   cumulative HI (all carcinogens) greater than 1. 6. Prevent human
   exposure to contaminants in media of concern that pose a cumulative
   excess cancer risk (all carcinogens) greater than 1 × 104 (one in ten
   thousand), and/or a cumulative HI (all noncarcinogens) greater than 1.
   For Environmental Protection: 1. Restore water quality, at a minimum,
   to Water Quality Objectives that protect beneficial uses within a
   reasonable time frame. Maintain existing water quality that complies
   with Water Quality Objectives. This will apply to both individual and
   multiple constituents that have additive toxicological or carcinogenic
   effects. 2. Ensure ecological receptors important at the individual
   level of ecological organization (State of California or
   federally-listed threatened or endangered species, or State of
   California species of special concern) do not reside in areas where HIs
   exceed 1. 3 . Ensure existing contaminant conditions do not change so
   as to threaten wildlife populations and vegetation communities.
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 8 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 To the degree that these
   cleanup objectives are achieved by interim measures, the interim
   measures may be selected as the final remedies for the site, pending
   review of their effectiveness and any needed contingency plans. The
   Final ROD will make the ultimate determination. The preferred
   alternatives will achieve these objectives by managing risk and hazard
   by implementing exposure controls, extracting and treating contaminated
   ground water and soil vapor, in situ treatment of contaminated ground
   water, removing contaminated surface soil and subsurface soil and
   bedrock, monitored natural attenuation and monitoring contaminants in
   ground water. The preferred alternatives are described for each OU in
   Section 6 of this Proposed Plan. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 9 UCRL-AR-136376
   Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April
   2000 5. Summary of Remedial Technologies A number of methods were
   evaluated to remediate areas where soil and bedrock, ground water, or
   surface water is currently contaminated, or could become contaminated
   in the future. The cleanup technologies evaluated in the SWFS are
   summarized below. 5.1. Monitoring Monitoring is defined as routine,
   periodic, baseline sampling and analysis of contaminated media not
   associated with the operation and optimization of remediation systems.
   Typically this will include ground water and surface water sampling and
   analysis for all contaminants of concern, and inspection of surface
   conditions of waste sites. If disruption of waste sites is visible,
   appropriate maintenance will be conducted. Monitoring will determine if
   the contaminant plumes are expanding or migrating. Every five years,
   physical surveys of plant and wildlife communities will be conducted to
   determine species composition for the purpose of identifying new
   species of potential concern (i.e., rare, threatened or endangered)
   that may be at risk from contamination at Site 300. Should such species
   be determined to be present in areas of contamination, the appropriate
   regulatory agency will be consulted (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service or California Department of Fish and Game) and a preliminary
   screening assessment will be conducted as required. Monitoring will be
   conducted to ensure that the populations of ground squirrels and deer
   continue to be unimpacted by contaminants at Site 300. Algae and
   micro-invertebrate bioassays will also be conducted on samples from
   springs to ensure aquatic organisms remain unimpacted by contaminants
   at Site 300. 5.2. Risk and Hazard Management The overall goals of risk
   and hazard management are to control exposure to contaminants and
   ensure the remedies protect human health and the environment while
   cleanup objectives are being achieved. Administrative controls are the
   basis of risk management, such as restricting building access,
   ventilation controls, and measures to prevent people from drinking
   contaminated ground water. A risk and hazard monitoring and assessment
   program will be developed and implemented, which will include sample
   collection and analysis to determine current exposure concentrations,
   and integrating the data into risk assessment calculations to determine
   any changes in risk and hazard. These data and analyses will be used to
   evaluate compliance with Remedial Action Objectives. In addition, as
   part of the LLNL program to mitigate impacts to wildlife, biologists
   will monitor those areas in which the relevant ecological HI exceeds 1.
   Currently, the only threatened, endangered, or species of special
   concern that may potentially be exposed to unacceptable levels of
   contaminants is the San Joaquin kit fox. Thus, areas where the
   ecological HI for the kit fox exceeds 1 will be monitored. Should kit
   fox or other similar species of special concern to wildlife agencies
   (i.e., those that burrow or live in dens) be found in these areas, DOE
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 10 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 will consult with the
   appropriate wildlife agency to develop response actions, such as
   monitoring or animal relocation. Additionally DOE will annually monitor
   areas where PCBs/chlorinated dibenzo - dioxins (CDDs) are present in
   surface soil for any threatened or endangered species, or species of
   special concern. Biologists will continue to monitor Site 300 for the
   presence of sensitive species not previously identified. If any such
   species are found, their life history will be reviewed to determine the
   potential for unacceptable exposure to contaminants at the site. Should
   it be determined that species have a potential risk of exposure, their
   presence in areas where a relevant HI exceeds 1 will be determined. The
   risk and hazard monitoring and assessment program for Site 300 will be
   presented in detail in the Site-Wide Compliance Monitoring Plan. The
   overall cleanup approach assumes that Site 300 will remain under DOE's
   control indefinitely, and that the site access restrictions currently
   in place (fencing and security patrols) will continue for the
   foreseeable future. CERCLA and the Federal Facility Agreement for Site
   300 include provisions for assuring cleanup if ownership were to
   change. All remedies would be reevaluated if any transfer of ownership
   or change in land use is anticipated. 5.3. Mon itored Natural
   Attenuation Natural attenuation consists of natural physical, chemical
   or biological processes that act without human intervention to reduce
   the amount of contamination in soil or ground water. For example,
   tritium decays (or attenuates) naturally to non-toxic helium. As a
   cleanup approach, monitored natural attenuation relies on these natural
   processes to achieve cleanup standards. A monitored natural attenuation
   remedy consists of monitoring and tracking the natural degradation of
   contaminants in the environment to make sure that there are no damaging
   effects on human health and the environment. This method has proven
   effective for certain contaminants (for example, gasoline and
   radionuclides with short half-lives). Recent studies have demonstrated
   that under certain conditions monitored natural attenuation may also be
   appropriate for other Site 300 contaminants, such as VOCs and high
   explosives. For this approach to be acceptable, appropriate long-term
   monitoring must be conducted, there must be no active source of
   contamination, and human health and the environment must be protected.
   In addition, it must achieve cleanup goals in a time frame comparable
   to active remediation. 5.4. Ground Water Extraction and Treatment For
   this technology, ground water is pumped or siphoned from specially
   designed wells and treated to remove contaminants before discharge to
   the ground or returning the treated water to the water table. The
   extracted water can be treated using granular activated carbon (GAC),
   bioreactors, or ion exchange systems, depending on the contaminants.
   The U.S. EPA considers these to be "presumptive technologies" for
   certain contaminants (U.S. EPA, 1996). This means that these
   technologies have proven effective at other sites, using them should
   reduce costs, and a simplified evaluation process is appropriate. EPA
   expects that presumptive technologies will be used for remedies where
   ground water extraction and treatment are part of the remedy.
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 11 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 The objectives of ground
   water extraction may include reducing the amount and concentration of
   contamination, stopping the spread of contaminants, reducing risk,
   and/or restoring beneficial uses of ground water. Extraction of ground
   water containing tritium may not be easily implementable and may raise
   safety concerns because (1) no cost-effective technology to remove
   tritium from water is available, and (2) bringing water containing
   tritium to the surface and concentrating the tritium during a treatment
   process could result in increased risk to humans. The proposed
   treatment method for removing perchlorate from extracted ground water
   is a combination of granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption,
   followed by biotreatment, and ion exchange polishing. GAC will remove
   organic compounds and some portion of the perchlorate. Following GAC
   treatment, biotreatment will either employ plants (phytoremediation),
   denitrifying bacteria (bioreactor) or a combination of the two (called
   a cascading modular biotreatment system, which is a containerized
   wetland). In the bioreactor and other engineered biotechnologies,
   nutrients are added externally to foster microbial activity.
   Biotreatment is the primary process for removing perchlorate from
   ground water. Ion exchange resins are used as the final, polishing
   step. 5.5. Soil Vapor Extraction and Treatment Under this technology,
   contaminated vapors in the soil above the water table are pumped from
   special wells, then treated to remove contaminants before discharge to
   the atmosphere. This technology is effective only for contaminants that
   evaporate relatively easily, such as TCE. The extracted vapor is
   treated using GAC. Soil vapor extraction is often combined with ground
   water extraction to increase the effectiveness of the cleanup.
   Extracting soil vapor and ground water at the same time (called
   dual-phase extraction) is a "presumptive remedy" as defined by EPA
   (U.S. EPA, 1996). Presumptive remedies have been identified by EPA and
   commonly selected at various cleanup sites. For this reason, use of
   presumptive remedies reduces the justification required and streamlines
   the remedy selection process. 5.6. Enhanced In situ Bioremediation In
   situ (in place) bioremediation is a process through which microbes
   already living in the ground ingest contaminants and break down the
   contamination into non-toxic compounds. This process can be enhanced by
   injecting additional nutrients into the subsurface. 5.7. In situ
   Reactive Barriers In this technology, a trench is excavated to a depth
   below the ground water table. The trench is filled with a permeable
   material designed to react with and/or remove contaminants from ground
   water flowing through the material. In situ reactive barriers can be
   used to control the migration of VOCs, metals, and uranium in ground
   water. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 12 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for
   the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 5.8. Excavation and
   Removal of Surface Soil and Soil and Bedrock Underlying Firing Tables
   Though costly, excavating contaminated soil under the firing tables
   effectively reduces health risks and stops further ground water
   contamination. At some firing tables, explosive tests contaminated the
   adjacent soil. This soil can be removed to prevent worker exposure.
   5.9. Landfill Waste Characterization, with Contingent Monitoring,
   Capping, or Excavation This technology addresses existing or potential
   releases from the landfills. It begins with detailed investigations of
   the landfill contents, followed by modeling to estimate potential
   impacts to ground water, and risk assessment to evaluate potential
   impacts to humans and the environment. The results of these activities
   will be used to help design the most appropriate cleanup. Additional
   opportunities for stakeholder input, such as workshops and public
   meetings, would be included throughout the process. DOE considered five
   possible approaches to address the Pit 2, 8 and 9 Landfills: (1)
   monitoring only, (2) capping, (3) partial excavation with capping, (4)
   partial excavation without capping, or (5) total excavation. Any
   excavated waste would be transported to and placed in an approved
   offsite disposal facility or an engineered onsite containment unit.
   5.10. Future Work Sufficient data exist to recommend the preferred
   cleanup alternatives described in this Proposed Plan. However,
   additional work is needed to: * Complete a focused Remedial
   Investigation/Feasibility Study for the Pit 7 Complex, as described in
   Section 2.1.5.3. * Define the nature and extent of contamination, if
   any, at the Sandia Test Site, the Advanced Test Accelerator (Building
   865) and Building 812. Investigations of these facilities have been
   scheduled. * Determine the natural background for nitrate at Site 300.
   * Understand how PCBs, perchlorate, and high explosive compounds
   degrade under the Site 300 subsurface conditions. * Find ways to
   stabilize landfill waste in situ to prevent leaching of contaminants to
   ground water as a potential alternative to excavating or capping the
   landfills. * Develop or evaluate new technologies to treat tritium in
   ground water since no cost- effective technology currently exists.
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 13 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 * Determine if innovative,
   environmentally friendly "green" technologies, such as using gravity,
   solar or wind power to run ground water extraction and treatment
   facilities, or using plants or microbes to treat ground water
   contaminants, may be applicable to Site 300. * Determine cleanup
   standards for dinitrotoluene and TBOS/TKEBS in ground water since no
   regulatory standards exist for these compounds. * Determine how to: *
   Implement any required building and/or land use restrictions; * Address
   PCBs in soil at Building 854; and DOE will continue to investigate
   innovative technologies and apply them, if appropriate, to maximize the
   cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of the cleanup. 4-00/ERD-PP
   S300:hkb 14 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental
   Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 6. Evaluation and Comparison of Remedial
   Alternatives A number of cleanup alternatives were evaluated in the
   SWFS using the EPA criteria shown in Figure 4. The SWFS compares the
   remedial alternatives by analyzing how each alternative would perform
   against the first eight EPA criteria, and by finding the best balance
   among them. The two most important criteria are providing adequate
   protection of human health and the environment, and compliance with all
   federal, state and local applicable or relevant and appropriate
   requirements (ARARs). Alternatives that do not meet these two criteria,
   called threshold criteria, are not viable. Community acceptance
   (criterion 9) will be evaluated after public comments on this Proposed
   Plan are evaluated. DOE compared the alternatives discussed in the SWFS
   and selected the preferred alternative for each area of the site. In
   most areas at Site 300, the alternatives are a combination of the
   technologies described in Section 5. DOE's preferred cleanup
   alternative for each area at Site 300 are shown in Table 1. The
   estimated costs shown on Table 1 are the sum of capital, operation, and
   maintenance costs over 30 years, expressed as present-worth values. The
   costs of any previous cleanup actions are not included in the
   estimates. Based on DOE's preferred cleanup alternatives, the estimated
   30-year present-worth cost to clean up the Site 300 operable units
   described in this Proposed Plan is approximately $85,000,000. The
   30-year period was used for cost comparison purposes, and does not
   necessarily represent the time until cleanup is complete. The cleanup
   decision made in the Interim Site-Wide ROD may be modified by the Final
   ROD scheduled for 2007. The major components of DOE's preferred cleanup
   for Site 300 are: 1. Extract and treat contaminated ground water at
   Buildings 834, 830, 832, 854, and in three parts of the High Explosives
   Process Area. This cleanup will restore the beneficial uses of ground
   water beneath Site 300 and protect offsite ground water supplies. Table
   2 summarizes the proposed remedial components and treatment
   technologies to address specific Site 300 ground water contaminants in
   each OU. 2. Extract and treat soil vapor containing VOCs at Buildings
   834, 830, 832, and 854. Removing VOCs from the soil and bedrock above
   the water table will reduce risks to humans and protect the underlying
   ground water from further contamination. 3. Remove the
   tritium-contaminated sand pile at the Building 850 Firing Table. This
   will prevent further leaching of tritium into the soil and ground
   water. Also, remove PCB-contaminated surface soil in the area adjacent
   to the firing table to reduce health risk to site workers. 4. Allow
   tritium in soil, bedrock, and ground water to decline naturally through
   monitored natural attenuation at Building 850. Monitored natural
   attenuation would be implemented only after any required source control
   measures have been implemented. DOE also proposes monitored natural
   attenuation for tritium and TCE at the Pit 6 Landfill, where monitoring
   data indicate natural breakdown of TCE is occurring. 4-00/ERD-PP
   S300:hkb 15 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental
   Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 5. Implement exposure controls in any
   area where an elevated risk or hazard to humans or the environment
   remains. During cleanup, DOE will implement a formal risk and hazard
   management program that will include periodically collecting additional
   samples, reviewing building occupancy and land use, and refining risk
   and hazard estimates. Exposure controls will manage risks to site
   workers, the public, and the environment. 6. Continue conducting
   periodic monitoring throughout Site 300 and the adjacent offsite area.
   Monitoring will ensure that the cleanup adequately protects humans and
   the environment and will help measure the progress of cleanup. 7.
   Continue to closely monitor the Pit 2, 8, and 9 Landfills. There is no
   evidence of contaminant release from these landfills. DOE will install
   additional monitoring equipment at these landfills to ensure early
   detection of any future releases of contaminants, and will upgrade and
   formalize the landfill maintenance program. DOE also plans to
   re-engineer the surface water drainage near Pit 2. 8. Take no further
   action for contaminants in soil and bedrock at some areas where certain
   contaminants: (1) are found in low concentrations, (2) pose no risk to
   humans or the environment, (3) pose no threat to ground water, and (4)
   cannot be cleaned up cost-effectively. DOE does not propose a no
   further action remedy for any of the contaminated ground water at Site
   300. If these approaches work as intended, they could become the final
   remedies, subject to the Final ROD evaluation in 2007. The time it will
   take to complete the cleanup of Site 300 will be long, possibly greater
   than 30 years to achieve interim ground water cleanup goals of MCLs or
   below. This is primarily due to the difficulty in removing contaminants
   dissolved in the ground water and the lack of cost- effective treatment
   technologies for tritium. Qualitative estimates of the time to achieve
   cleanup are provided in Chapter 7 of the SWFS. Refined cleanup time
   estimates based on detailed modeling will be provided in the Remedial
   Design Reports that will be prepared after the Interim ROD. Cleanup
   time estimates will improve as remediation progresses and cleanup data
   are evaluated. In 2002, DOE will prepare a Site-Wide Contingency Plan
   that will anticipate how DOE might respond if any part of the cleanup
   does not go as planned. The Contingency Plan will also anticipate how
   the cleanup might be modified in the event of any future changes in
   land use at Site 300, or if a transfer of site ownership is
   anticipated. Significant or fundamental changes to the remedies will be
   supported and documented in an Explanation of Significant Differences
   or ROD Amendment, respectively. The remedial alternatives for each of
   the seven Site 300 OUs evaluated in the SWFS that are discussed in this
   Proposed Plan are summarized below, along with background information
   and a description of the preferred alternative for each OU. 4-00/ERD-PP
   S300:hkb 16 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental
   Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 6.1. Building 834 Complex (OU 2) 6.1.1.
   Site Background Since the late 1950s, the Building 834 area facilities
   were used for materials testing. TCE was the primary heat transfer
   fluid for these operations until the entire system was dismantled
   between September 1993 and May 1994. DOE estimates that about 500
   gallons of TCE were released to the ground surface between 1962 and
   1978, contaminating the subsurface soil/bedrock and shallow ground
   water in the area. 6.1.2. Extent of Contamination TCE has been
   identified as the primary contaminant of concern because it has been
   most frequently detected in soil, bedrock, and ground water, and
   because of its relatively high historical concentrations in ground
   water [up to 800 parts per million (ppm)]. Other VOCs have been less
   frequently detected, at lower concentrations in soil and ground water.
   A silicon-based lubricant (TBOS/TKEBS) has also been detected floating
   on the ground water in monitor wells near Building 834, and nitrate has
   been detected in ground water. Ground water contaminants are present in
   a shallow perched water-bearing zone. This zone is limited in extent
   and is underlain by several thick, low permeability rock layers that
   prevent the downward migration of contaminated ground water into the
   regional aquifer. The shallow ground water plumes originate at spill
   locations near the buildings in the northern part of the area and
   extend approximately 1,500 ft to the south (Figure 5). 6.1.3. Ongoing
   Remedial Actions Ground water and soil vapor extraction and treatment
   have been operating at Building 834 since 1995 under an Interim ROD.
   Remediation has successfully reduced TCE concentrations in ground water
   from an historical maximum of 800 ppm in 1993 to 120 ppm in 1998, and
   TBOS/TKEBS concentrations from 7,300 ppm in 1995 to less than 100 ppm
   in 1998. Nitrate concentrations have decreased from an historical
   maximum of 480 ppm in 1997 to 280 ppm in 1998. Soil vapor extraction
   has significantly reduced VOC concentrations, and has removed
   approximately 48 pounds of VOCs from subsurface soil and rock since
   1998. Other remedial activities include excavation of VOC-contaminated
   soil in 1983 and installation of a surface water drainage diversion
   system in 1998 to prevent rainwater infiltration in the contaminant
   source area. 6.1.4. Summary of Site Risks for the Building 834 Complex
   The Building 834 Complex baseline risk assessment prepared as part of
   the Site-Wide Remedial Investigation (Webster-Scholten, 1994)
   determined that the only exposure route that could potentially result
   in unacceptable risk is for on-site workers exposed to VOC vapors
   evaporating from subsurface soil in and around facility buildings.
   Based on soil sample analyses made in 1983, an excess human cancer risk
   from inhalation of VOC vapors inside of Building 834D was calculated as
   1 × 10-3 (one in one thousand) with an HI of 36. This means that a
   person spending 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 30 years inside
   Building 834D could have a one in one thousand additional chance of
   contracting cancer and a high likelihood of experiencing a
   non-cancerous medical affliction. This potential exposure route is
   limited to 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 17 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan
   for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 employees working
   within Building 834D. Building 834D is currently used as a storage
   facility, without any regular occupants. The baseline risk assessment
   also indicated a human cancer risk of 6 × 10-4 (six in ten thousand)
   and an HI of 21 for inhalation of TCE by workers outdoors in the
   vicinity of Building 834D. This potential exposure is limited to
   employees working on-site in the vicinity of Building 834D. These risk
   calculations assumed no remedial action would occur. Full scale ground
   water extraction began in 1995 and soil vapor extraction began in
   August 1998 to mitigate VOC inhalation risk in the Building 834 area.
   Although the perched ground water in the Building 834 area contains
   high concentrations of contaminants, there is no current exposure to
   human or ecological receptors from ground water. Modeling indicates
   that contaminants from the Building 834 Complex would not impact
   off-site water-supply wells. Ground water cleanup in this area is based
   on the applicable Water Quality Objectives in the Central Valley
   RWQCB's Water Quality Control Plan for Region 5 (Basin Plan). The
   Building 834 area is isolated and access is restricted by full-time
   security patrols and fencing that surrounds Site 300. DOE plans to
   maintain and operate Site 300 for the foreseeable future. Thus, public
   exposure is unlikely given the DOE land-use commitment at Site 300. The
   Building 834 Complex baseline ecological assessment prepared as part of
   the Site-Wide Remedial Investigation (Webster-Scholten, 1994)
   determined a potential risk from TCE, PCE and cadmium existed for the
   following biota: ground squirrels, deer and kit fox. Individual
   juvenile ground squirrels and individual kit fox are potentially at
   risk from inhalation of TCE and PCE (the combined inhalation HI
   exceeded 1 for these species). Individual adult ground squirrels, kit
   fox and deer are also potentially at risk from oral ingestion of
   cadmium (the combined oral and inhalation pathway HQ exceed 1 for these
   species, which was driven by the oral pathway). Site-wide population
   surveys and area-specific presence/absence surveys to identify the true
   risk to these biota found no current adverse impact. For
   special-status, threatened or endangered species, such as the kit fox,
   which must be protected on an individual basis, monitoring as described
   in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 6.1.7 will be conducted to ensure continued
   protection of the species. 6.1.5. Summary of Cleanup Alternatives for
   the Building 834 Complex Three remedial alternatives were assembled and
   evaluated to address contaminants in the Building 834 Complex, as
   summarized in Table 3. 6.1.6. Evaluation of Alternatives The no-action
   alternative (Alternative 1) is required by the National Oil and
   Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) to provide a
   baseline for comparison to other remedial alternatives and is the basis
   of the baseline risk assessment. Under a no-action response, all
   remedial and monitoring activities in the Building 834 complex would
   cease. There are no costs associated with the no-action alternative.
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 18 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 Alternative 1 may not
   protect human health and the environment. Alternatives 2 and 3 both
   address all risks to human health and the environment through active
   remediation of soil, bedrock, and ground water. Alternative 3 provides
   additional mass removal and plume control by enhanced in situ
   bioremediation of VOCs in ground water downgradient of the Building 834
   Complex. Alternative 3 would be expected to achieves cleanup objectives
   somewhat faster than Alternative 2. However, additional removal of TCE
   through in situ bioremediation would provide no significant
   quantifiable health risk benefit compared to Alternative 2 because the
   perched water-bearing zone is not currently being used for drinking
   water. Because the rate of contaminant degradation through enhanced in
   situ biodegradation is not yet known, the ability to further reduce
   contaminant mobility and volume above that attained through pumping and
   treating ground water under Alternative 2 is not certain. Ongoing
   studies are expected to provide data on the viability of in situ
   biodegradation to further reduce contaminant mobility and volume.
   Although DOE intends to continue research on bioremediation
   technologies, and may in the future wish to propose adding its use,
   this alternative is not yet suitable for implementation. Alternative 3
   costs exceed those of Alternative 2 by $2.4 million. 6.1.7. The
   Preferred Remedial Alternative for the Building 834 Complex DOE
   believes that, among the three proposed remedial alternatives,
   Alternative 2 provides the best balance of trade-offs with respect to
   the EPA evaluation criteria. The primary components of the preferred
   remedial Alternative 2 are: 1. Monitoring soil vapor and ground water
   to determine if the ground water plumes are migrating or expanding,
   evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial action in reaching
   remediation goals, and for post-remediation monitoring. 2. Risk and
   hazard management to prevent contaminant exposure to humans and impacts
   to ecological receptors. As part of the hazard management program,
   ecological monitoring will be conducted as discussed in Sections 5.1
   and 5.2. 3. Soil vapor extraction and treatment by carbon adsorption at
   the VOC source area. Soil vapor extraction would be conducted to reduce
   VOC concentrations in soil to levels protective of ground water
   (drinking water standards or below), and to mitigate VOC inhalation
   risk in and around Building 834. 4. Ground water extraction and
   treatment by air stripping with GAC for the air stream, and
   phytoremediation (remediation of nitrate using plants) at the source
   area and in downgradient portions of the plume. Ground water extraction
   will be conducted to reduce contaminant concentrations to drinking
   water standards or below. These components are described in detail in
   the SWFS. The ground water contaminant plumes and the components of the
   preferred remedial Alternative 2 that address contaminants in the
   Building 834 OU are shown in Figure 5. Alternative 2 protects human
   health and the environment. The risk reduction components of this
   alternative are readily implementable with modifications to the
   existing ground water and 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 19 UCRL-AR-136376 Final
   Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 soil
   vapor extraction and treatment systems at Building 834. In addition,
   these remediation systems would reduce contaminant concentrations in
   soil, bedrock, and ground water Ground water and soil vapor extraction
   (dual-phase extraction) is an established remedial technology,
   considered by EPA to be a presumptive remedy for the cleanup of VOCs in
   soil and ground water. Since functioning interim treatment systems are
   already in place, Alternative 2 will readily fulfill the first eight
   EPA evaluation criteria in Figure 4. The only human health risks under
   Alternative 2 are possible ingestion of ground water containing
   contaminants in concentrations exceeding drinking water standards, and
   inhalation of VOC vapors above health-based concentrations in and
   around Building 834D. There are no existing exposure pathways for
   ground water with concentrations above drinking water standards.
   Modeling indicates that contaminants from the Building 834 Complex
   would not impact offsite water-supply wells. Soil vapor extraction and
   treatment will protect human health by reducing VOC concentrations in
   subsurface soil and rock, thereby mitigating inhalation risk.
   Alternative 2 also includes measures such as building use restrictions
   and monitoring indoor air with ventilation controls, if necessary, to
   prevent VOC exposure to humans. As part of the hazard management
   program to mitigate impacts to special-status, threatened or endangered
   species, such as the kit fox, which must be protected on an individual
   basis, biologists will monitor the Building 834 area. If kit fox or
   similar (i.e., burrowing or denning) special-status species are found
   to be inhabiting the site and could be exposed to TCE or PCE, the DOE
   will notify and consult with the California Department of Fish and Game
   and the U.S. Wildlife Service to determined the proper course of action
   to protect the kit fox from short- and long-term impacts. Additional
   biological monitoring is discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. The
   present-worth cost of Alternative 2 for the Building 834 OU is
   $12,095,000 based on 30 years of monitoring, exposure control and
   remediation. 6.2. Pit 6 Landfill (OU 3) 6.2.1. Site Background From
   1964 to 1973, approximately 1900 cubic yards of solid waste was buried
   in nine unlined trenches and animal pits within the Pit 6 Landfill. The
   buried material included laboratory and shop debris, and biomedical
   waste. Low concentrations of TCE and other VOCs, tritium, perchlorate,
   and nitrate have been released from the buried debris to the
   environment. These releases have migrated to shallow ground water about
   30 ft below the Pit 6 Landfill. The main contaminant of concern in
   ground water is TCE. Tritium has also been found at activities well
   below its drinking water standard, and perchlorate and nitrate have
   each been found in one well. 6.2.2. Extent of Contamination A ground
   water TCE plume extends southeast from the Pit 6 Landfill as shown in
   Figure 6. VOC concentrations in ground water have decreased
   significantly over the past few years, and are close to or below
   drinking water standards in all wells. VOC concentrations in ground
   water have declined from an historical TCE maximum of 250 parts per
   billion (ppb) in 1988 to concentrations below 6 ppb in 1998. The
   drinking water standard for TCE is 5 ppb. All indications are that TCE
   is degrading naturally. 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 20 UCRL-AR-136376 Final
   Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000
   Tritium activities are above background levels in four monitor wells,
   suggesting a past localized release, possibly due to infiltration of
   rain through areas of subsidence in the landfill before it was capped.
   Detected activities are well below the 20,000 picoCuries per liter
   (pCi/L) drinking water standard. No evidence of releases of other
   radioactive contaminants from the landfill has been detected in soil or
   ground water. Perchlorate has been detected in ground water in one well
   at a maximum concentration of 47 ppb. Nitrate has also recently been
   detected in ground water at 228 ppm but may have a source other than
   the landfill. The only surface water contaminant found in 1998 was TCE
   at 0.77 ppb at Spring 7, where concentrations have been declining.
   Contaminants are present in ground water in shallow gravel and bedrock
   in the vicinity of the Pit 6 Landfill. No contaminants associated with
   releases from the landfill have been detected south of the Site 300
   boundary. 6.2.3. Previous Remedial Actions A cap was installed over the
   Pit 6 Landfill as a CERCLA Removal Action in 1997 to prevent
   infiltrating rain water from further leaching contaminants from the
   buried waste. Other remedial activities performed at the Pit 6 Landfill
   include: (1) removal of waste containing uranium-238 in 1971, and (2)
   extraction and treatment of about 71,000 gallons of ground water
   containing TCE as a treatability study in late 1998. 6.2.4. Summary of
   Site Risks for the Pit 6 Landfill The baseline risk assessment for the
   Pit 6 Landfill area determined that there was a potential risk to
   on-site workers who may inhale TCE vapors evaporating from subsurface
   soil in the vicinity of the landfill. An excess human cancer risk from
   inhalation of TCE vapors in the landfill area was calculated as 5 ×
   10-6 (five in one million). This means that a person spending 8 hours a
   day, 5 days a week, for 30 years at the landfill near a release site
   may have a five in one million additional chance of contracting cancer.
   This potential exposure route is limited to employees working on-site
   in the immediate vicinity of the landfill. The landfill cap, installed
   as part of a CERCLA Removal Action in 1997, mitigates this inhalation
   risk. Furthermore, based on the marked decrease in TCE concentrations
   in ground water, DOE expects that the subsurface soil concentrations
   have also substantially decreased from those used in the risk
   assessment. A potential cancer risk of 4 × 10-5 (four in one hundred
   thousand) was also identified for onsite workers inhaling VOC vapors
   from surface water at Spring 7. Since it has been dry for several
   years, there is currently no potential for VOC inhalation from this
   spring. However, if the spring were to become active again, VOC
   analyses of shallow ground water suggest that VOC concentrations will
   be below levels of concern. The baseline risk assessment also
   identified a future cancer risk for offsite residents inhaling TCE
   volatilizing from the surface of the State Vehicle Recreational Area
   residence pond located east of the landfill (Figure 6). This risk
   scenario assumed no cleanup actions would be taken and that VOCs would
   migrate to the water supply wells used to fill the pond. However, VOCs
   have not migrated to the water-supply wells, the landfill cap was
   installed to prevent further releases of VOCs, and ground water VOC
   concentrations upgradient have substantially diminished. The Pit 6
   Landfill baseline ecological assessment prepared as part of the
   Site-Wide Remedial Investigation (Webster-Scholten, 1994) determined a
   potential risk from VOCs (primarily TCE 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 21
   UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at
   Site 300 April 2000 and PCE) existed for the following biota: ground
   squirrels and kit fox. Individual ground squirrels and individual kit
   fox are potentially at risk from inhalation of VOCs (the combined
   inhalation HI exceeded 1 for these species). An engineered layer was
   installed as part of the landfill cap to prevent exposure of squirrels
   and kit fox to contaminants in the pit. Site-wide population surveys
   and area-specific presence/absence surveys to identify the true risk to
   these biota found no current adverse impact. For special-status,
   threatened or endangered species, such as the kit fox, which must be
   protected on an individual basis, monitoring as described in Sections
   5.1, 5.2 and 6.2.7 will be conducted to ensure continued protection of
   the species. 6.2.5. Summary of Cleanup Alternatives for the Pit 6
   Landfill Three remedial alternatives were assembled and evaluated to
   address contaminants of concern in environmental media in the Pit 6
   Landfill area, as summarized in Table 4. 6.2.6. Evaluation of
   Alternatives The no-action Alternative 1 is required by the NCP to
   provide a baseline for comparison to other alternatives and is the
   basis of the baseline risk assessment. Under a no-action response, all
   monitoring activities in the Pit 6 Landfill would cease. There are no
   costs associated with the no-action alternative. Alternative 1 may not
   protect human health and the environment. Alternatives 2 and 3 both
   address risk to human health and the environment and include measures
   to restore the beneficial uses of ground water. Ground water
   contaminants may be reduced more rapidly through extraction and
   treatment of ground water in Alternative 3 than by natural attenuation
   in Alternative 2. However, the more rapid contaminant removal provided
   in Alternative 3 would provide no significant quantifiable health risk
   benefit compared to Alternative 2, because ground water in this area is
   not currently used for drinking water. Alternative 3 poses additional
   short- term risks to humans compared to Alternative 2 if water
   containing tritium is brought to the surface during ground water
   extraction. Alternatives 2 and 3 can be readily implemented, although
   Alternative 3 would require additional time, labor, and expense to
   construct, operate, and monitor the treatment system. Alternative 3
   costs exceed those of Alternative 2 by $3.6 million. 6.2.7. The
   Preferred Remedial Alternative for the Pit 6 Landfil DOE believes that,
   among the three proposed remedial alternatives, Alternative 2 provides
   the best balance of trade-offs with respect to the EPA evaluation
   criteria. The primary components of the preferred remedial Alternative
   2 are: 1. Monitoring ground water to: (1) determine if the plumes are
   migrating or expanding and ensure there is no impact to people living
   downgradient, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of natural attenuation of
   contaminants in ground water to meet cleanup goals, (3) identify any
   potentially toxic by-products resulting from biodegradation, and (4)
   verify attainment of cleanup standards. Ground water monitoring will
   also continue for nitrate and perchlorate to further understand their
   extent, sources (natural and man-made), and fate in the environment. 2.
   Risk and hazard management to prevent contaminant exposure to humans
   and impacts to ecological receptors until cleanup standards are
   achieved in surface water and ground 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 22
   UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at
   Site 300 April 2000 water. As part of the hazard management program,
   ecological monitoring will be conducted as discussed in Sections 5.1
   and 5.2. 3. Monitoring and modeling ground water flow to verify the
   effectiveness of natural processes (or natural attenuation) in
   continuing to decrease VOC and tritium concentrations to drinking water
   standards or below. The landfill cap was installed in 1997 to prevent
   further releases of contaminants from the buried waste. These
   components are described in detail in the SWFS. Alternative 2 protects
   human health and the environment through monitored natural attenuation.
   EPA defines natural attenuation as "the naturally occurring process in
   soil and ground water that act, without human intervention, to reduce
   the mass, toxicity, mobility, volume, or concentration of
   contaminants." Ground water data from monitor wells in the Pit 6
   Landfill area indicate that TCE and other VOCs are naturally degrading
   or attenuating to drinking water standards and below, as demonstrated
   by the steady decrease in VOC concentrations over time, and the
   presence of the degradation product cis-1,2-dichloroethlyene, which is
   present in concentrations below its MCL. Another possible TCE
   degradation product, vinyl chloride, has never been detected in the Pit
   6 Landfill area. This could be because vinyl chloride is not created by
   the degradation in this area, or because it further degrades very
   quickly, never reaching detectable concentrations. Tritium decays to a
   stable, non-toxic daughter product (helium), and has a short (about
   12-year) half-life. This means that half of the tritium in the
   subsurface will be gone in 12 years. Current maximum levels of tritium
   in ground water (about 2,000 pCi/L) in the Pit 6 Landfill area are well
   below the 20,000 pCi/L drinking water standard. EPA Office of Solid
   Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Directive 9200.4-17 (1997) states
   that monitored natural attenuation may be appropriate as a remedial
   approach where it can be demonstrated to be capable of achieving the
   site's cleanup objectives in a time period that is reasonable compared
   to that offered by other methods. Monitored natural attenuation for
   VOCs and tritium in ground water at the Pit 6 Landfill in preferred
   Alternative 2 meets the EPA criteria to establish this type of remedy.
   These include: (1) the contamination does not currently pose an
   unacceptable risk, (2) source control measures have been implemented,
   and (3) chemical data suggest that natural attenuation mechanisms are
   operating to reduce contaminant concentrations. The water-bearing zone
   affected by VOCs and tritium is not currently a drinking water source,
   and there is no current risk of ingesting contaminated ground water.
   Natural processes should continue to reduce contaminant concentrations
   to restore the beneficial uses of ground water. Risk and hazard
   management would be applied to prevent human health impacts until
   cleanup standards are achieved. All components of the preferred
   alternative are readily implementable. Alternative 2 will readily
   fulfill the first eight EPA evaluation criteria in Figure 4. As part of
   the hazard management program to mitigate impacts to special-status,
   threatened or endangered species, such as the kit fox, which must be
   protected on an individual basis, biologists will monitor the Pit 6
   landfill area. If kit fox or similar (i.e., burrowing or denning)
   special-status species are found to be inhabiting the site and could be
   exposed to VOCs, DOE will notify and consult with the California
   Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb
   23 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at
   Site 300 April 2000 Wildlife Service to determine the proper course of
   action to protect the kit fox from short- and long-term impacts.
   Additional biological monitoring is discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
   The estimated present-worth cost of Alternative 2 for the Pit 6
   Landfill OU is $2,377,000 based on 30 years of monitoring, exposure
   control and monitored natural attenuation of VOCs and tritium in ground
   water. A Contingency Plan will be prepared for Site 300 in 2002 that
   will describe how DOE plans to address foreseeable technical and
   logistical issues and problems that may arise during remediation of
   Site 300. For example, the Contingency Plan will include plans for
   analysis of trends in contaminant concentrations in ground water. If
   monitoring indicates that 1) contaminants have significantly increased
   above MCLs, 2) unanticipated plume migration or expansion occurs, or 3)
   releases are occurring from the landfill, changes to the remedial
   action will be considered in consultation with the regulatory agencies.
   These changes could include implementing active remedial measures where
   monitored natural attenuation was the preferred remedy, and installing
   and operating extraction wells and treatment facilities, if
   appropriate. 6.3. High Explosives (HE) Process Area (OU 4) 6.3.1. Site
   Background The HE Process Area consists of surficial release sites at
   Building 815, Building 810, the former HE rinsewater lagoons, the
   former HE Burn Pits, and the related ground water plumes. Building 815
   served as a central steam plant for the HE Process Area from 1958 to
   1986. Surface spills at the drum storage and dispensing area for the
   steam plant resulted in TCE releases to the ground surface. In
   addition, from 1959 to 1985, waste fluids were discharged to dry well
   810A, resulting in VOC releases to the subsurface. From the mid- to
   late-1950s to 1985, wastewater containing HE and associated compounds
   was discharged to former unlined rinsewater lagoons, and subsequently
   leached to the subsurface. Three Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA) regulated burn pits were located in the vicinity of Building 829
   in which HE particulates and cuttings, explosive chemicals, and
   explosives-contaminated debris were burned. This facility was operated
   from the late 1950s until 1998. HE compounds and VOCs were released to
   the environment in the vicinity of the HE Burn Pits. 6.3.2. Extent of
   Contamination Contaminants in ground water in the vicinity of Building
   815 have been detected in shallow soil and bedrock. TCE concentrations
   in ground water in the Building 815 area have decreased over time from
   an historical high of 450 ppb in 1992 to 330 ppb in 1998. Other VOCs
   have also decreased, with most concentrations below the level
   detectable in the laboratory. All other VOCs are below the drinking
   water standards and State Water Quality Objectives. HE compounds,
   nitrate, and perchlorate have also been detected in ground water in the
   vicinity of the HE rinsewater lagoons and in shallow soil and bedrock.
   The HE compounds in ground water are decreasing or stable in
   concentration. Contaminants originating from the HE rinsewater lagoons
   have, to an extent, mixed with VOCs in ground water originating from
   the Building 815 and 810 area. The HE Process Area ground water plumes
   are shown in Figures 7 4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 24 UCRL-AR-136376 Final
   Proposed Plan for the Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 and
   8. TCE has been detected at relatively low concentrations in subsurface
   soil and bedrock in the vicinity of the HE rinsewater lagoons. VOCs,
   nitrate, and perchlorate have been detected in ground water in shallow
   bedrock in the vicinity of the HE Burn Pit area. The HE Burn Pit area
   is geologically isolated from other contaminated areas in the HE
   Process Area. Low levels of HE compounds and VOCs are present in
   shallow subsurface soil in the vicinity of the burn pits. TCE has been
   detected in a well adjacent to Spring 5, located approximately 800 ft
   south of Building 815. Ground water from this well feeds the spring,
   which supports wetland-type vegetation, but there is no measurable
   surface water flow at Spring 5. The TCE detected near the spring is
   believed to originate at Building 815. 6.3.3. Ongoing Remedial Actions
   In 1989, the HE rinsewater lagoons were excavated and capped to prevent
   further releases of VOCs, HE compounds, nitrate, and perchlorate to the
   subsurface. The HE Burn Pits were also capped and closed in 1998 under
   RCRA to prevent releases of contaminants to the subsurface. In June
   1999, a ground water extraction and treatment system was installed at
   the Site 300 boundary, south of Building 815 and the HE rinsewater
   lagoons, as part of a CERCLA Removal Action. The purpose of this system
   is to prevent the offsite migration of the TCE originating from these
   release sites. 6.3.4. Summary of Site Risks for the HE Process Area The
   baseline risk assessment for the HE Process Area determined that there
   was a potential risk to on-site workers who may inhale VOC vapors
   evaporating from subsurface soil in the vicinity of Building 815. The
   excess human cancer risk from inhaling VOC vapors in the Building 815
   area was calculated as 5.1 × 10-6 (about five in one million). This
   means that a person spending 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 30 years
   in the vicinity of Building 815 may have a five in one million
   additional chance of contracting cancer. The potential exposure route
   is limited to employees working on-site in the immediate vicinity of
   Building 815. The maximum historical VOC concentration detected in
   shallow subsurface soil was TCE at 0.05 ppm in 1987. An active remedy,
   such as soil vapor extraction, is generally not warranted or very
   effective when VOC concentrations are this low. A potential excess
   cancer risk of 1 × 10-5 (one in one hundred thousand) was also
   identified for onsite workers inhaling VOC vapors from surface water at
   Spring 5. This risk was calculated from VOC concentrations in an
   adjacent well, since the actual flow in Spring 5 is too low to measure,
   and the spring consists of moist soil with wetland vegetation. It was
   assumed for risk assessment purposes that the same water-bearing unit
   in which the well is completed feeds the spring. The baseline
   assessment also assumed that the concentrations in the shallow ground
   water were the same as in the spring. Since no actual standing water
   exists at Spring 5, the calculated risk levels are extremely
   conservative. In addition, no one regularly works in the vicinity of
   Spring 5 and VOC concentrations in ground water that feeds the spring
   have decreased over time. More than half of the calculated risk
   resulted from the presence of 1,1- DCE, which has not been detected in
   ground water in the area since 1987. Although the ground water in the
   HE Process Area contains high concentrations of contaminants, there are
   no other exposure pathways from ground water to human or ecological
   4-00/ERD-PP S300:hkb 25 UCRL-AR-136376 Final Proposed Plan for the
   Environmental Cleanup at Site 300 April 2000 receptors. Cleanup of the
   ground water in this area is based on the applicable Water Quality
   Objectives of the Central Valley RWQCB's Water Quality Control Plan for
   Region 5 (Basin Plan). The HE Process Area baseline ecological
   assessment prepared as part of the Site-Wide Remedial Investigation
   (Webster-Scholten, 1994) determined a potential risk from copper and
   cadmium existed for the following biota: aquatic organisms, ground
   squirrels, and deer. Aquatic organisms are potentially at risk from
   copper in the shallow, near surface ground water at a location
   designated as Spring 5 (the Toxicity Quotient using California Applied
   Action Levels exceeded 1 for copper in ground water samples from this
   location). Individual adult ground squirrels and individual adult and
   juvenile deer are potentially at risk from oral ingestion of cadmium
   (the combined oral and inhalation pathway HQ exceed 1 for these
   species, which was driven by the oral pathway). Surveys for the
   presence of surface water at Spring 5, and algae and micro-invertebrate
   bioassays conducted to identify the true risk to aquatic organisms
   found no current adverse impact. Similarly, site-wide population
   surveys to identify the true risk to deer and ground squirrels found no
   current adverse impact. Monitoring as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2
   will be conducted to ensure continued protection of these populations
   and any special- status species identified in the future. 6.3.5.
   Summary of Cleanup Alternatives for the HE Process Area Two
   alternatives, a no action alternative required by EPA guidance and a
   remedy using presumptive technologies that have proven effective at
   Site 300, were presented in the SWFS, as summarized in Table 5. 6.3.6.
   Evaluation of Alternatives The no-action Alternative 1 is required by
   the NCP to provide a baseline for comparison to other alternatives, and
   is the basis of the baseline risk assessment. Under a no-action
   response, all monitoring and remediation activities in the HE Process
   Area would cease. Alternative 1 may not protect human health and the
   environment or meet all ARARs. There are no costs associated with the
   no-action alternative. The treatment methods incorporated into
   Alternative 2 include presumptive technologies as defined by EPA.
   Alternative 2 is described below. 6.3.7. The Preferred Remedial
   Alternative for the HE Process Area DOE believes that, among the two
   proposed remedial alternatives, Al
