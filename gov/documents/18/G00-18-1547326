   Veterans Data and Information

   Welcome to the Department of Veterans Affairs Veteran Data and
   Information Web Site, designed to provide you with veteran information
   in support of our policy and planning issues. Included are social and
   economic information about veterans, demographical and geographical
   veteran information, statistical information by veteran program areas
   and veteran survey information as well as references to other veteran
   information sites.

   By periodically reexamining fundamental statistical priorities and
   improving VA's capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate data, this
   web site is fundamental to reinventing government. Through our ability
   to forecast and model, we will support anticipatory government -
   prevention rather than the cure - to provide better service for our
   Nation's veterans.
