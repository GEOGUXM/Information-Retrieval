                             General Information

   A. Introduction
   These instructions explain the application process for obtaining
   permanent labor certification under the Immigration and Nationality
   Act. While applicants for temporary labor certifications may use Form
   ETA 750, these instructions for temporary labor certifications.
   Section 212(a)(14) of the Act provides that certain aliens may obtain a
   visa for entrance into the United States in order to engage in
   permanent employment if the Secretary of Labor has first certified:
   There are not sufficient United States workers who are able, willing,
   qualified, and available for the employment, and
   The employment of the alien will not adversely effect the wages and
   working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.
   This certification is referred to as a "labor certification" Labor
   Certifications are granted and denied by certifying officers in the
   national and regional offices of the Employment and Training
   Administration of the Department of Labor.
   The Department of Labors regulations on permanent labor certifications
   are published in part 656 of Title 20 of the Code of Federal
   Regulations.
   The regulations require that an application for Alien Employment
   Certification be filed in every instance, to initiate this process.
   This application form includes a Part A "Offer of Employment" and a
   Part B "Statement of Qualifications of Alien". The regulations set
   forth, in detail, the application process for permanent labor
   certification.

   application with a U.S. Consular Office if the alien is abroad or with
   an Immigration and Naturalization Service Office if the alien is in the
   United States, not with the Department of Labor or a State employment
   service.
   E. Occupational Schedules
   To facilitate the processing of requests for labor certifications, the
   United States Employment Service, Department of Labor has established
   schedules with predetermined findings for specific occupations:
   Schedule A is a list of occupations for which the Administrator, United
   States Employment Service, has determined that there are not sufficient
   U.S. workers who are able, willing qualified, and available and that
   the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed
   will not be adversely affected by the employment of aliens.
   Schedule B is a list of occupations for which the Administrator, United
   States Employment Service, has determined that generally there are
   sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing qualified, and available
   and that the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly
   employed generally will be adversely affected by the employment of
   aliens.
   Applications for Schedule A Labor certifications are granted or denied
   by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the U.S. Consular
   office where the application is filed. General documentation
   requirements for Schedule A occupations are described in part IV of
   these instructions.

   and information on occupations listed on Schedules A and B may be
   obtained from State employment service offices, Immigration and
   Naturalization Service District Offices, and Consular offices abroad.
   F. Fraud, False Statements and Perjury
   Any employer or alien, or their agent or attorney, who, in the labor
   certification application process, knowingly and willfully falsifies,
   conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact,
   or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or
   representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing
   the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or
   entry, is subject to prosecution and a fine of not more than $10,000 or
   imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. 18 U.S.C. 1001.

   Certification or knowingly presents any such application containing,
   any such false statement is subject to prosecution and a fine of not
   more than $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than 5 years or both. 18
   U.S.C. 1546.

   $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. 18 U.S.C.
   162(2). This penalty applies whether the statement or subscription is
   made within or outside the United States.
   G. Other Information
   Employers and aliens may have agents apply for labor certification on
   behalf. Each party (employer and/or alien) represented by an agent must
   sign a statement designating the agent and taking full responsibility
   for the accuracy of any representations made by the agent. The
   authorization statements are in Parts A and B of the Application for
   Alien Employment Certification Form. Since employers and aliens must
   take full responsibility for the accuracy of their agents
   representations, they are advised not to sign blank application forms.
   Employers and aliens may have attorneys represent them. Each attorney
   must file a Notice of Appearance on Immigration and Naturalization
   Service Form G-28, naming the attorneys client(s).
   The Department of Labor will notify the employer in writing, with a
   copy to the alien, of determinations on the employers Application for

   Naturalization Service or by a Consul of the United States Department
   of State, are valid indefinitely. Invalidations are made in cases of
   fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact involving the
   labor certification application.
   If a labor certification application has been denied, the employer may
   file a new application for the same occupation at any time after 6
   months from the date of the denial of certification. However, if the
   denial was solely because the wage offered was too low, the employer
   may reapply immediately.
   Refusal to complete any item on the application form or to submit
   documentation required by regulations is grounds for denying the
   application.
   Documents not in the English language must be accompanied by a
   translation, certified by the translator as to the accuracy of the
   translation and his or her competency to translate.

                                   Part II

   Documentation to Submit With Applications for Occupations Not on
   Schedule A
   The Department of Labors regulations for the permanent labor
   certification process require the employer to submit documentation
   which shows clearly that the job, the job offer, and recruitment of
   U.S. workers for the job are all in compliance with the regulations.
   This Part describes the documentation required by the regulations. The
   documentation requirements described in this Part do not apply to
   applications for Schedule A occupations. Documentation for Schedule A
   occupations is described in Part IV of these instructions. The employer
   must submit the required general documentation, as well as the specific
   documentation which may be required for the particular occupation.
   A. General Documentation Requirements
   Failure of the employer to comply with any of the eight certifications
   in item 23 of Part A, Form ETA 750 may result in denial of the
   Application. The certifying officer may require the employer to submit
   additional documentation, As appropriate, to document clearly
   compliance with any of the eight certifications.
   As attachments to the Application for Alien Employment Certification
   form, the employer must submit the following documentation, to show
   clearly that the employer has been attempting to recruit U.S. workers
   for the job as required by the Department of Labors regulations. (For
   job offers involving Sheepherders, See Section H below):
   The employer has been attempting to recruit U.S. workers for the job
   opportunity at the prevailing wage and at prevailing working conditions
   through the labor referral and recruitment sources normal to the
   occupation, without success, and has reason to think recruitment will
   continue to be unsuccessful. Such sources that may be appropriate in
   particularly instances are recruitment at private employment agencies,
   labor unions, schools and colleges, radio or television advertisements,
   and development or promotion of present employees. If any such
   recruitment has taken place, the employer must document the results of
   recruitment by naming the applicants and the lawful job-related reason
   for not hiring each applicant and submit copies of resumes and job
   application forms supporting the reasons for not hiring each applicant.
   The job offer, as shown on Part A of the Application for Alien
   Employment Certification form and in advertisements, notices, and other
   recruitment methods used by the employer may not describe the job with
   unduly restrictive job requirements are requirements not normal to the
   occupation, unless the employer adequately documents that the
   requirements arise from business necessity. "Business necessity" is not
   employer or customer preference or convenience, it is a requirement
   which, if absent, would actually undermine the employers business. The
   employer must always document the business necessity for a language
   other than English.
   If the job involves a combination of duties, e.g. engineer-pilot, the
   employer must document one or more of the following:
   The employer has normally employed persons for that combination of
   duties; and/or
   Workers customarily perform that combination of duties in the
   geographic area; and/or
   The combination of duties is based on a business necessity.
   The employer must describe on the forms the job and recruitment methods
   using the actual minimum requirements needed to perform the job. The
   employer must state whether it has hired workers with less training or
   experience for similar jobs, and, if so, the employer must explain why
   it is not feasible to do so for the job offered to the alien.
   If unions are customarily used as a recruitment source in the area or
   industry, the employer must document such recruitment, clearly showing
   that they were unable to refer U.S. workers.
   B. Job Offers for Household Domestic Service Workers
   If the job is for a household domestic service worker, and the employer
   additionally requires the worker to live on the employers premises, the
   employer must submit, in addition to the documentation described above
   in the section on "General Documentation Requirements," all of the
   following documentation:
   A complete statement for live at work job offers on Form ETA 750, Part
   A.
   Two copies of an employment contract between the employer and the
   alien, each signed and dated by both. (Not by their agents.) The
   employment contract must clearly state:
   The wages to be paid on an hourly and weekly basis;
   Total hours of employment per week, and the exact daily work schedule;
   That the alien is free to leave the employers premises during all
   non-work hours except that the alien may work overtime if paid for the
   overtime at no less than the legally required hourly rate;
   That the alien will reside on the employers premises;
   Complete details of the duties to be performed by the alien;
   The total amount of any money to be advanced by the employer with
   details of specific items, and the terms of repayment by the alien of
   any such advance by the employer;
   That in no event shall the alien be required to give more than 2 weeks
   notice of intent to leave the employment contracted for and that the
   employer must give the alien at least 2 weeks notice before terminating
   employment;
   That a duplicate contract has been furnished to the alien;
   That room and board will be provided at no cost to the worker; and
   Any other agreements or conditions not specified on the Application for
   Alien Employment Certification form.
   Documentation of the aliens paid experience in the form of statements
   from past or present employers setting forth the dates (month and year)
   employment started and ended, hours of work per day, number of days
   worked per week, place where the alien worked, detailed statement of
   duties performed on the job, equipment and appliances used, and the
   amount of wages paid per week or month. The total paid experience must
   be equal to 1 full years employment on a full-time basis; e.g. 2 years
   experience working half-days is equal to one years full-time
   experience. However, six months experience working 16-hour days is not
   equal to 1 years experience. Time spent in a household domestic service
   training course cannot be included in the required one year of paid
   experience.
   Each statement documenting the aliens paid experience must be signed
   and must contain the name and address of the person who signed it, and
   show the date on which the statement was signed. A statement not in the
   English language must be accompanied by a translation certified by the
   translation as to the accuracy of the translation, and as to the
   translators competency to translate.

   qualified U.S. worker.

   Evidence that the alien is a graduate of a school of medicine
   accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the United
   States Commissioner of Education.
   E. Job Offers for College or University Teachers

   offers as college and university teachers. The statue permits the
   employer to reject applications for the job from qualified U.S. workers

   professional rank jobs are considered teachers. Faculty members who do
   not teach are excluded from this provision. The employer must show that

   instructions.

   Employment Certification, including the fully-completed application
   form and all necessary documentation described in Part II of these
   instructions, to the local employment service office.
   Employers seeking labor certifications for jobs as college or
   university teachers or on behalf of aliens of exceptional ability in
   the performing arts and aliens applying for labor certifications in
   occupations listed on Schedule A need not make the recruitment efforts
   described in this Part.
   A. Job Order
   Upon receipt of a completed application (except in the situations
   described in the above paragraph) the local office of the State
   employment service will make additional efforts to assist the employer
   in finding able, willing, and qualified United States workers who are
   available for the job. The State employment service office will examine
   the application and from it will prepare and process a job order
   through the regular employment service recruitment system for 30
   calendar days. The employment service may refer U.S. workers to the
   employer. The employer must cooperate in this attempt to recruit U.S.
   workers.
   B. Employment Service Advertisement
   In conjunction with the employment service job order, the employer must
   advertise the job opportunity for at least three consecutive days, in a
   newspaper of general circulation or a professional or ethnic
   publication as appropriate for the occupation and which is most likely
   to bring responses. The advertisement shall:
   Direct applicants to report to the local State employment service
   office for referral to the employer.
   Include a local office name or identification number and the complete
   address or telephone number of the local office.
   Describe the job opportunity with particularity:
   Offer at least the prevailing wage for the occupation.
   State the rate of pay and offer at least prevailing working conditions.
   State the jobs actual minimum requirements.
   Offer training if the job opportunity is the type for which the
   employer customarily provides training and;
   Offer wages, terms and conditions of employment which are no less
   favorable than those offered the alien.
   The employer shall supply the local office with at least one copy of
   the advertisement, with the name of the newspaper or publication and
   dates of publication.
   C. Recruitment Within Employers Organization
   As part of the recruitment process, the employer must post a notice of
   the job opportunity in bold letters in a conspicuous place within its
   organization. The notice must contain the same information required for
   the employment service advertisement, including the wage offer and
   other terms and conditions. The notice must be posted for at least ten
   consecutive business days where notices to employees, such as wage and
   hour and occupational safety and health notices, are normally posted.
   The requirement of posting does not apply to private households.
   The employer must submit the notice posted, starting where and for how
   long the notice was posted, and whether it remained unobstructed for
   the entire period of posting.
   D. Other Recruitment
   If the employer has not used other recruitment sources normal to the
   occupation or otherwise required by the Department of Labors
   regulations, the employment service local office or the certifying
   officer may require such recruitment after submission of the
   application.
   E. Results of Recruitment
   The employer must report to the local employment service office the
   results of its recruitment through the employment service job order,
   the employment service advertisement, the notice posted within the
   employers organization, and other post-application recruitment.
   Documentation of the results must include all of the following:
   The number of U.S. workers responding to the recruitment;
   The names, and the addresses, phone numbers, and resumes of all U.S.
   workers interviewed; and
   The lawful job-related reason for not hiring each applicant.
   F. Employment Service Findings
   After the required recruitment period, the State employment service
   will forward the application and all other documentation, along with
   its findings, to the appropriate Department of Labor regional
   certifying officer for a determination. If the certifying officer
   denies the application, the employer and the alien will be informed of
   their rebuttal and appeal rights.

                                   Part IV

   Documentation Required for Occupations on Schedule A
   The Schedule A list of pre-certified occupations is subject to revision
   from time to time, based on U.S. labor market conditions. Therefore,
   current information on specific occupational groups and qualification
   standards included in Schedule A should be obtained from State
   employment service offices, the U.S. Department of States Consular
   Offices abroad, and District Offices of the Immigration and
   Naturalization Service.
   Documentary requirements for individual eligibility may vary and
   specific information can be obtained from the above agencies and the
   regulations at 20 CFR 656.22.
   A determination on a Schedule A application is based on whether the
   alien meets the qualification standards of the group under which the
   alien is applying for labor certification. The alien may have to show
   evidence of prearranged employment. The Schedule A determination of the
   Immigration and Naturalization Service or U.S. Department of State is
   conclusive and final.
   General documentation requirements which may apply to any Schedule A
   group are:
   A.  Original documents may be submitted, not necessarily in duplicate;
   B.  If return of the original is desired, it may be accompanied by a
   photostatic or typewritten copy, provided such copies are permitted by
   law (Do not make copies of a certificate of naturalization or
   citizenship);
   C.  Photostatic copies without the original may be submitted, if they
   are certified by an immigration or consular officer as identical to the
   original;
   D.  Affidavits or published material are recommended as evidence of the
   aliens technical training or specialized experience; and
   E.  Affidavits must be signed and dated by someone familiar with the
   aliens work, such as former employers or recognized experts and must
   fully identify the applicant showing the capacity in which the
   applicant is testifying.
   Reminders
   Read instructions carefully before completing forms and preparing
   documentation.
   Applications for Alien Employment Certification must be submitted in
   duplicate.
   Date and sign all copies of forms in original signature.
   Employers must file their application with the State Employment Service
   Office serving the area of intended employment.
   Schedule A applications filed by aliens must be filed with District
   Offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the United
   States or with U.S. Consular offices abroad.
   The employer and the alien will be notified, in writing, when a
   determination is made on tier application.
   Questions on procedures for filing for a labor certification should be
   directed to States Employment Service Offices.
