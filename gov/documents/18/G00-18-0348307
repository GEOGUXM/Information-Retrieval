               The Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center
     __________________________________________________________________

   The mission of the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center (BHNRC)
   is to define, through research, the role of food and its components in
   optimizing human health and in reducing the risk of nutritionally
   related disorders in the diverse population. Scientists at the Center
   conduct research toward understanding how dietary components interact
   with genetic, physiological, sociological, and environmental factors
   and affect the health of the American population so diversified by
   gender, ethnicity, lifestyle and environment.

   Work has begun on two new buildings that will add over 100,000 square
   feet of high quality research space to the Beltsville Human Nutrition
   Research Center. In addition to laboratories, the new buildings that
   are Phases I and II of a three phase project will include a new Human
   Study Facility. Completion of the new buildings is expected in 2003.
