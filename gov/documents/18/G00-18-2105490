   Ionospheric Storms

   Solar activity such as flares and coronal mass ejections often produce
   large variations in the particle and electromagnetic radiation incident
   upon the earth. Such variations can, in turn, lead to disturbances of
   the "quiet-time" magnetosphere and ionosphere. These disturbances, when
   affecting the ionosphere are known as ionospheric storms, tend to
   generate large disturbances in ionospheric density distribution, total
   electron content, and the ionospheric current system. Ionospheric
   storms have important terrestrial consequences such as disrupting
   satellite communications and interrupting the flow of electrical energy
   over power grids. They also provide the most challenging conditions
   under which accurate assessment of the vertical delay calibrations, to
   be used in the WAAS aircraft navigation system, must be maintained.
   Thus, it is important to monitor such storms, and, if possible,
   forecast their evolution.

   Monitoring and Nowcasting Ionospheric Storms Using the Global GPS
   Network

   The ability to use the global GPS network to generate global maps of
   the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC) in near real-time
   presents us with a new and powerful tool for not only detecting
   ionospheric storms and monitoring their behavior, but also for pursuing
   scientific research that will lead to a more complete understanding of
   storm phenomena. A differential mapping technique (DMT) has been
   developed, which makes it possible to identify, characterize, and
   classify storms by distinguishing storm-time variations of the
   ionosphere from quiet-time variations. What is unprecedented in this
   approach is the ability to study ionospheric storms on simultaneous
   world-wide scales in near real-time.
