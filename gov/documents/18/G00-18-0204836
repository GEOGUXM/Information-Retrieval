   NASA's Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) contains information and data
   from space flight experiments funded by the National Aeronautics and
   Space Administration (NASA). These experiments were conducted from 1961
   to the present time, and include human, animal and plant studies. Our
   goal is to not only provide life sciences data from the last 40 years
   via this Web site, but to also archive life sciences experiments from
   future Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. The
   intended audience for the LSDA Web site encompasses all individuals,
   ranging from scientists and teachers to the general space enthusiast.
   This project is a work in progress. New information will be added on a
   regular basis. We welcome your input and feedback.

   Overviews   OVERVIEWS: Read about the missions on which these
   experiments were performed and the research areas that space life
   scientists are  interested in. Also get a list of experiments performed
   on Unmanned Research Missions, Historical Missions, Space Shuttle
   Missions, and the Nasa-Mir Program.

   Search Database   SEARCH DATABASE: Search for information about
   experiments, missions, biospecimens, flight hardware items, personnel,
   documents and images. Search for data sets and associated data
   collection timetables.

   Photo Gallery   PHOTO GALLERY: The LSDA Photo Gallery is a library of
   images related to life sciences space flight missions, experiments, and
   hardware. It also includes images of ground based experiments,
   astronauts, historical missions and drawings of future missions or
   projects.

   Just For Fun   JUST FOR FUN: This section of the LSDA is for the young
   and young at heart. Click above for games and activities that will
   teach you about space flight and what happens to the human body in
   space. You can also learn more about astronauts, what it takes to
   become an astronaut, and read about one child's experience while
   attending his first Space Shuttle launch. ATTENTION TEACHERS: Plants in
   Space lesson plan demo is now available.
