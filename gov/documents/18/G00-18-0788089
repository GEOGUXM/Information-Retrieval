    Carbon Cycle Science Breakthroughs. . . . at NOAA and Beyond Article
    "Carbon is the backbone of life on earth, from the food that sustains
   us to the energy that fuels the world economies. In the form of carbon
       dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, it is also an important
       regulator of the earth's climate as a major contributor to the
     planetary greenhouse effect. A small active fraction of the Earth's
       large carbon reservoirs exchanges naturally between the ocean,
       atmosphere and land. While the climate is directly affected by
   atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, we must also understand
    how carbon cycles among these active reservoirs if we hope to be able
         to predict future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations
                                accurately."
