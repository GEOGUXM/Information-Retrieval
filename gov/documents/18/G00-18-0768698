      Assessing the Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on the Nation's
                                     Resources


   Since 1990, the U.S. Geological Survey has been participating in the
   U.S. Global Change Research Program--a comprehensive and integrated
   research initiative to understand, assess, predict, and respond to
   human-induced and natural processes affecting the Earth's environment.

   In 1997 the program began a national assessment of the impacts of
   climate variability and change. The assessment will apply what research
   is finding to help understand the potential impacts, both detrimental
   and beneficial, that global change may have on the environment,
   society, and the economy.
