                 City of Villages Draft EIR and Related Documents
                            Released for Public Review

      SAN DIEGO - The next step in the process to plan San Diego's future has
      been reached with the release of the draft environmental impact report
      (draft EIR) for the City of Villages. Also released for public review
      are three related documents, the Draft Strategic Framework Element,
      City of Villages Map and Five-Year Action Plan.

      The Strategic Framework Element is an update to the City's General
      Plan. The element employs "smart growth" concepts and proposes a City
      of Villages. The village strategy draws upon the strengths of existing
      San Diego neighborhoods by combining housing, commercial, employment
      centers, schools and civic uses together with easy access to transit.

      "More than 150 public meetings have been held over the past two and a
      half years to inform citizens about issues facing our City's future and
      to hear community concerns. We are now asking for more feedback before
      the City Council considers the draft EIR and strategy for adoption this
      summer," said Coleen Clementson, the City's General Plan Program
      Manager.

      The draft City of Villages Map has been updated to reflect the San
      Diego Association of Governments revised population projections for
      2030. The revised projections call for about 349,000 more residents and
      a need for approximately 104,000 additional homes by the year 2020.
      These figures are lower than the original 2020 forecast issued in 1998.

      Copies of the draft EIR, draft Strategic Framework Element, revised
      City of Villages map, and five-year Action Plan are available for
      viewing at all City libraries and community service centers, and at the
      Planning Department, 202 C St., fourth floor. These documents are also
      available on the City of Villages web page.

      The full draft EIR, map, Element and Action Plan can also be purchased
      at City Publications in the Development Services Center, 1222 First
      Ave., third floor, for the cost of reproduction:
