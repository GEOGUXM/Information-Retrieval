   DIS provides infrastructure options to help agencies launch
   well-supported online services more quickly.

   Agencies are rolling out more online applications than ever for their
   constituents, who get to these services in two ways: through the states
   Internet portal, Access Washington, or by visiting an agencys web page
   directly. But no matter how a customer gets to an online application,
   he will expect to use it at any time of day and get instant help if he
   has questions about how it works. In the customer-centric world of the
   Internet, it does not matter if the task at hand needs to be completed
   with government or a private business--the service expectations are the
   same. DIS can help government meet those high expectations by seeking
   out and contracting with industry-leading infrastructure resources like
   SafeHarbor.com.
