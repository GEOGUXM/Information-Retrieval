   Hearings Program

   A water right hearing is a quasi-judicial proceeding that has, as an
   objective, the development of an adequate record upon which the SWRCB
   can rely to make good decisions. In general, water right hearings are
   conducted in a manner deemed suitable to the particular case. The
   SWRCB, assisted by personnel from the Division of Water Rights and
   Office of Chief Counsel, holds hearings to secure relevant information
   promptly and without unnecessary delay and expense to participating
   parties or the SWRCB. Subsequently, the record developed at the hearing
   is used to formulate a decision that affects the rights of the
   participants.
