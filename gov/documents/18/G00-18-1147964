     The State Department offers services ranging from helping Americans
    prepare for trips overseas to assisting U.S. businesses in developing

                           Services for U.S. Businesses

      One of the State Department's objectives is to create new opportunities
      for American businesses overseas. Resources within the State Department
           that work to further this goal include the following offices.

       The Office of the Coordinator for Business Affairs (CBA). This office
      helps ensure that U.S. business interests are considered in the foreign
       policy process, that American companies have opportunities to compete
           fairly for foreign business, and that international trade and
          investment disputes are resolved. The office coordinates State
       Department advocacy on behalf of American businesses and offers them
      problem-solving assistance in opening markets, leveling playing fields,
        and resolving trade and investment disputes. For more information,
      visit http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/business/index.html or call
                          202-647-1625; fax 202-647-3953.

      Information on the State Department's effort to promote foreign trade,
      as well as economic analysis, business information, and country reports
                is available on the State Department's web site at
                      http://www.state.gov/www/services.html.

      The Office of the Procurement Executive. Companies that are interested
      in doing business with the State Department also can obtain the latest
         information on procurement contracts and government acquisitions
          through the Internet. The Office of the Procurement Executive's
         Acquisition homepage at http://www.statebuy.gov/home.htm provides
          access to offices within the Department of State's acquisition
                                    community.

      The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. This office
       ensures that a fair share of the Department's acquisitions are placed
      with small and disadvantaged firms, as well as those owned by women. It
          serves as advocate, counselor, trainer, and provider of liaison
       services to the small business community. The office publishes United
        States Department of State: A Guide To Doing Business, which lists
            useful information concerning the Department's procurement
       opportunities, points of contact, subcontracting opportunities, etc.
      This can be obtained in hard copy from the Superintendent of Documents
       (see preceding section on publications for sales information) or free
            of charge on the web at http://www.statebuy.gov/osdbu1.htm.

        Overseas Security Advisory Council. The Overseas Security Advisory
      Council (OSAC), a joint venture between the Department of State and the
         U.S. private sector, was created in 1985 to interact on overseas
        problems of mutual concern. Since then, OSAC has developed into an
           effective vehicle for security cooperation. Among their many
      accomplishments, government and business representatives have joined to
         use OSAC as a forum to produce a series of publications providing
      guidance, suggestions, and planning techniques on a variety of security
          related issues. U.S. private sector organizations with overseas
      interests interested in receiving additional information should send a
                               letter of request to:

                 Services for Americans Traveling or Living Abroad

      State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs assists American citizens

      wish to visit or reside in the United States. This bureau issues Travel
       Warnings, Consular Information Sheets, and other publications related

       Bureau of Diplomatic Security, can be directly accessed on the web at
                             http://travel.state.gov.

                            Overseas Citizens Services

       Overseas Citizens Services (OCS) in the State Department's Bureau of
      Consular Affairs is responsible for the welfare and whereabouts of U.S.
      citizens traveling and residing abroad. It has three offices: American
      Citizens Services, Children's Issues, and Policy Review and Interagency
                                     Liaison.

         American Citizens Services (ACS) assists in all matters involving
        protective services for Americans abroad, including arrests, death
       cases, financial or medical emergencies, and welfare and whereabouts
      inquiries. This office also issues Consular Information Sheets, Travel
           Warnings, and Public Announcements, and provides guidance on
      nationality and citizenship determination, document issuance, judicial
         and notarial services, estates and property claims, and disaster

        Children's Issues (CI) was created to assist families in crisis and
        provide information to Americans on international adoption. CI also
          serves as the U.S. Central Authority on The Hague Convention on
        International Parental Child Abduction. The treaty provides for the
       return of children to their habitual place of residence if wrongfully
        removed. To receive information about international parental child

          Policy Review and Interagency Liaison provides guidance on the
          administration and enforcement of U.S. citizenship laws and the
       documentation of Americans traveling and residing abroad. The office
       also has responsibility for the federal benefits program, under which
       more than 500,000 American citizens receive monthly federal benefits
                        payments outside the United States.

                                 Passport Services

      In 1997, the State Department issued more than 6 million U.S. passports
        to American citizens through its regional passport agencies and one
      processing center in the United States and at more than 280 diplomatic
        and consular posts around the world. There are 13 regional passport
       agencies and one special issuance agency for official and diplomatic
        passports. These agencies are located in Boston; Chicago; Honolulu;
