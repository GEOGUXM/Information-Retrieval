   "If it matters to you, it matters to us"

   Welcome to the Food and Agriculture Council Homepage.

   Please note:As of September 2001, the web pages associated with
   www.sci.usda.gov including this National Food and Agriculture site are
   being updated and redesigned. Please check again to see the result of
   this important update.

   The Food and Agriculture Council (FAC) at the national, state, and
   local levels are the vehicles used to coordinate the U.S. Department of
   AgricultureÂ’s programs, initiatives, and activities requiring
   cooperative involvement across mission area and agency lines. FACs were
   instituted by the Secretary of Agriculture in order to provide a policy
   level, cross agency, decision making and communication medium as needed
   to achieve the USDAs goals and objectives.

   The National FAC (NFAC) is the management entity designated by the
   Secretary of Agriculture to carry out USDA's field restructuring and
   modernization effort. The NFAC is comprised of the Administrators of
   all USDA agencies that are active at the State level. The Chair of the
   NFAC rotates annually between the Administrators of the Farm Service
   Agency, the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and
   the Deputy Under Secretary for Operations and Management of the Rural
   Development agencies.

   The NFAC is supported by an Executive Officer who also heads USDAs
   Service Center Implementation Team (SCIT). The SCIT is an interagency
   staff that supports the activities of the NFAC, and initiates
   activities and projects on behalf of the partner agencies to ensure the
   successful implementation of the USDAs Service Center Initiative.

   State FACs are the primary USDA interagency forums in each
   State/Territory through which State-level agency heads of the three
   partner agencies can efficiently coordinate seamless interagency
   program delivery, collocated offices, and streamlined operations of the
   three county based USDA agencies.

   Local FACs are the management structure in each USDA Service Center
   that implement programs, policies, and procedures at the local level.
   Local FACs are charged with the responsibility of exploring the
   potential for collocating offices that are located in the same
   community and service delivery territory, and for increasing the
   sharing of personnel and material resources.
