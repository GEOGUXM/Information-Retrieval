                          Privacy Policy Statement

   Thank you for visiting the CodeTalk Website and reviewing our Privacy
   Policy.

   Code Talk is a Federal inter-agency Native American web site that
   provides information for Native American communities. Code Talk is
   hosted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office
   of Native American Programs. HUD is committed to protecting your
   privacy rights. These rights are ensured through the Privacy Act and
   other federal statutes.

   Our Privacy Policy for visits to http://www.codetalk.fed.us/ is clear.

     We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our
     web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Here is how we handle information about your visit to our web site.

   Information Collected and Stored Automatically
   If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site,
   read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit automatically. This information does not
   identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the
   following information about your visit.

   The Internet domain (for example, xcompany.com if you use a private
   Internet
   access account, or yourschool.edu if you connect from a university's
   domain), and IP address (an IP address is a number that is
   automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the
   Web) from which you access our web site.
   The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.
   The date and time you access our site.
   The pages you visit.
   If you linked to our pages from another web site, the address of that
   web site

   We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
   visitorsÂ—to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
   types of technology our visitors use.
   We do not track or record information about individuals and their
   visits.

   Links to Other Sites
   Our Web site has links to other federal agencies and to private
   organizations. Once you link to another site, it is that site's privacy
   policy that controls what, if any, information it collects about you
   and your visit.

   Information Collected When You Send Us an E-mail Message
   When inquiries are e-mailed to us, we again store the text of your
   message and e-mail address information, so that we can answer the
   question that was sent in, and send the answer back to the e-mail
   address provided. All suggestions are used to guide the design of our
   Web site.
   We do not retain the messages with identifiable information or the
   e-mail addresses for more than 10 days after responding unless your
   communication requires further inquiry. If you send us an e-mail
   message in which you ask us to do something that requires further
   inquiry on our part, there are a few things you should know.
   First, the material you submit may be seen by various people in our
   department, who may use it to look into the matter you have inquired
   about. If we do retain it, it is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974,
   which restricts our use of it, but permits certain disclosures.

   Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
   communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information, you
   might want to send it by postal mail instead.
