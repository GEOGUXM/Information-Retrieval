                    Notice of Proposed Local Rule Changes
                      and Invitation for Public Comment

   In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 2071(b), the Courts Civil Rules
   Advisory Committee has recommended revisions to LR 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15,
   16, 26, 42, 47, 51, 52, 54, 56, 67, and 83, and proposed a new LR 100.
   These changes integrate recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil
   Procedure, and are designed to accommodate electronic filing and
   service using the Courts Cm/ECF Electronic Filing System.

   The proposed local rules can be viewed and downloaded on the courts
   website at
   ord.uscourts.gov. In addition, paper copies of the proposed rule
   changes are available for inspection at each of the divisional clerks
   offices.

   Persons wishing to comment on the proposed local rule changes must
   submit their
   comments in writing not later than the close of business on March 3,
   2002 to the following address:
