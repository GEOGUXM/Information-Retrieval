   the PCHB and procedures for filing a new appeal
   The Pollution Control Hearings Board hears appeals from orders and
   decisions made by the Department of Ecology and other agencies as
   provided by law.  The Board's sole function is to provide litigants a
   full and complete administrative hearing, as promptly as possible,
   followed by a fair and impartial written decision based on the facts
   and law.  The Board is not affiliated with the Department of Ecology or
   any other state agency.
       The Board consists of three members, who are appointed by the
   governor and confirmed by the State Senate for staggered six-year
   terms. One of the three must be an attorney. All are salaried employees
   of the State, who also serve on the Shorelines Hearings Board.
       This page provides links to important information about practice
   before the board.  For more information, please follow the links to our
   Information page and Legal Resources page.
