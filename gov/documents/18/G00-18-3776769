       _______________________________________________________________

     Use the form below to search for documents in this web containing
     specific words or combinations of words. The text search engine will
     display a weighted list of matching documents, with better matches
     shown first. Each list item is a link to a matching document; if the
     document has a title it will be shown, otherwise only the document's
     file name is displayed. A brief explanation of the query language is
     available, along with examples.

Query Language

     The text search engine allows queries to be formed from arbitrary
     Boolean expressions containing the keywords AND, OR, and NOT, and
     grouped with parentheses. For example:

   information retrieval
          finds documents containing 'information' or 'retrieval'

   information or retrieval
          same as above

   information and retrieval
          finds documents containing both 'information' and 'retrieval'

   information not retrieval
          finds documents containing 'information' but not 'retrieval'

   (information not retrieval) and WAIS
          finds documents containing 'WAIS', plus 'information' but not
          'retrieval'

   web*
          finds documents containing words starting with 'web'
