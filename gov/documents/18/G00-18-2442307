Vancouver HOV

Moving People Forward...

   On October 29, 2001, a new High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane opened on
   I-5 between 99th Street and Mill Plain Boulevard. The lane is reserved
   for vehicles with two or more passengers (carpools, vanpools and buses)
   as well as motorcycles. The lane is a significant step in our region's
   vision toward keeping people moving on I-5 now and in the future.

   The lane opens in conjunction with the completion of the I-5 widening
   project in Vancouver. The hours of operation are from 6 to 8 a.m.
   during the weekday morning commute, providing a more reliable trip for
   Clark County carpoolers and bus riders heading to Portland for work.
   The lane is open to all traffic at all other times.

   As congestion has grown in Southwest Washington, the community asked
   WSDOT to better manage the use of area freeways. Through an extensive
   planning and public involvement effort led by the Southwest Washington
   Regional Transportation Council (RTC), an HOV lane was identified as an
   affordable and efficient way to improve travel on I-5. Click for larger

   Vancouver's first HOV (high occupancy vehicle or carpool) lane on I-5
   south is tangible evidence that we are building a highway system not
   only for today, but also for the future. This lane is our region's
   first step toward a vision of ensuring a reliable and safe corridor
   during congested peak travel times for all commuters choosing to ride
   in carpools, vanpools or buses.

   The Vancouver lane is the initial phase of a bi-state plan that
   includes a southbound lane in Oregon during the morning commute. Future
   extension would be in conjunction with the I-5 widening in Delta Park
   that is currently under discussion.
