      Celebrating our Centennial NIST at 100: Foundations for Progress


                             From NBS to NIST

      Over the past century, the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology has had several different names. Founded as the National
    Bureau of Standards in 1901, it was renamed Bureau of Standards in
    1903. In 1934, the word national was affixed again to its name. For
    more than 50 years it remained the National Bureau of Standards, or
   NBS. It became the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or
   NIST, in 1988. To eliminate confusion, the name National Institute of
         Standards and Technology is used throughout this web site.

    During its first 100 years, NIST was led by the following directors:
