                        FPDT - Functional Description
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Forecast Products Development Team, formally known as the Sounding
   Implementation Branch, provides for the design, development, test,
   evaluation, documentation, and implementation into operation of next
   generation polar (NOAA and DMSP) and geostationary (GOES) sounding
   product systems. This includes support of study, planning, and design
   activities for next generation sounding instruments and algorithms. For
   the current operational sounding and sounding related climate product
   systems, FPDT implements science-related improvements.

    Operational science support functions:

     * trouble-shooting/correction of operational problems identified by
       user-feed back;
     * implementation of fallback contingencies in the event of
       instrument/channel(s) failure;
     * pre-launch support and post-launch implementation of sounding
       product systems from new satellites,
     * implementation of sounding product systems from reactivated
       satellites

    Science-related improvement functions:

     * the adaptation, development, test, evaluation, and implementation
       steps required for the transition of science advances from research
       to the operational environment.

   FPDT is responsible for the development of new/improved automated and
   interactive graphics capabilities to expand and improve the utility of
   sounding data in both the research and operational environment. FPDT
   provides for operational automated quality control and the capabilities
   associated with the access of data across the Wide Area Network. The
   team conducts seminars and provides training in the derivation and use
   of sounding products. Also, FPDT has the responsibility for the
   procurement of contract software services required in support of
   sounding activities.
