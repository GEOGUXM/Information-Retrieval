   The figure below shows a schematic of the accumulator ring and
   transport beam lines that are being designed and built by Brookhaven
   National Laboratory for the SNS Project.  This equipment represents an
   integral part of the machine between the upstream linac (Berkeley, LANL
   and J-Lab) and the experimental area and target station (ANL and
   ORNL).  Its prime purpose is to strip, accelerate and transport the
   particle beam from the linac to the target station.

       When completed in 2006, the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) will be
   the world's foremost neutron scattering science facility for
   conducting, chemistry, and structural biology.  The design calls for a
   beam of negatively charged hydrogen (H-) ions to be generated and
   accelerated to an energy of one billion electron volts (GeV) using a
   linear accelerator (linac).

     The H- beam will then be transported to an accumulator ring, where it
   will be converted to protons by stripping away the electrons and
   bunched into a short (less than one microsecond ) pulse.  Finally, the
   pulsed proton beam will be directed onto a liquid mercury target, where
   60-Hz pulses of neutrons will be created through spallation reactions
   of the protons with the mercury nuclei.  Inside the target building,
   the emerging neutrons will be slowed or moderated and channeled through
   beam-lines to instrumented experimental areas where users will carry
   out their research. [USEMAP:new_pa11.gif]
