     __________________________________________________________________

   1.    Introduction. Fire weather observation stations provide the
   specialized weather observations for fire weather forecasts, wildfire
   control and suppression, and various other wildland management
   operations. These stations may be either manned observation stations
   operated by the fire control agencies or the National Weather Service
   (NWS) or unmanned Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) which are
   operated by the various Federal and state wildland management agencies.

   They can also be dual purpose stations as is the case of a number of
   fire danger stations of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the Bureau of
   Land Management (BLM), and National Park Service (NPS) which also
   participate in the NWS substation observation program. These dual
   purpose stations take both climatological observations and fire weather
   observations and are considered to be NWS cooperative observing
   stations. The operation and maintenance of dual purpose stations for
   climatological observation purposes are covered in WSOM Chapters B-17
   and B-73.

   2.    Establishment of Stations. Fire weather observation stations may
   be established by either the fire control agencies or the National
   Weather Service. Observation stations established for the support of
   fire control agency programs should be instrumented by those agencies.
   However, in the case of a fire danger station being established at an
   existing NWS office or cooperative observation station, the requesting
   agency will provide only those additional specialized instruments, such
   as those for measuring fuel moisture, which are required for fire
   danger purposes. NWS offices must obtain the approval of the Regional
   Director before establishing or instrumenting a fire weather
   observation station. NWS fire weather offices may provide assistance in
   the site selection and instrument exposure of new stations.

   3.    Station Number Assignment and Documentation. Area Managers will
   be responsible for the assignment of station numbers for fire weather
   observation stations, including Remote Automatic Weather Stations
   (RAWS) used by Weather Service fire weather offices, in their areas of
   responsibility. The station number assignment will be in accordance
   with the national fire weather observation station identification
   system in appendix A of this chapter and should be coordinated, as
   necessary, with other Weather Service fire weather offices and the
   appropriate fire control agencies. Each Fire Weather Office should
   maintain complete documentation for each fire weather observation
   station in its area of responsibility. This documentation consists of a
   letter sized map showing the county numbering system and station
   locations and a tabular listing of all observation stations with the
   following information for each station.

       (1)     Station name; (2) number assigned; (3) county; (4)
   protection agency (e.g., USFS, BLM, NPS, State Division of Forestry,
   private agency, or other); (5) latitude and longitude to the nearest
   tenth degree or hundredth degree, if available); (6) section, township,
   and range; (7) elevation of the station in feet.

   Updated copies of the tabular documentation for fire weather
   observation stations should be sent to the regional headquarters.

   4.    Relocating or Closing Stations. Fire weather observation
   stations, with the exception of dual purpose stations, may be relocated
   or closed at the option of the agency operating the station. However,
   the relocation or closing of a station operated by the Nationa1 Weather
   Service will be coordinated with the appropriate wildland management
   agencies before any action is taken. NWS offices may assist the
   wildland fire control agencies in site selection for station relocation
   or in the selection of stations to be closed. If the station is dual
   purpose, e.g., a climatological and fire weather station, the
   climatological part of the station operation will remain active unless
   approval for closing is given by the appropriate Regional Substation
   Management Office.

   5.    Station Inspection and Instrument Maintenance. Station inspection
   and instrument maintenance and service are the responsibility of the
   agency operating the station, except that the climatological activities
   of a dual purpose station will be inspected by a substation network
   specialist. Weather Service offices may provide technical and training
   assistance to the wildland management agencies in establishing their
   station inspection and instrument maintenance programs; but NWS
   personnel will not actively participate in their routine station
   inspection programs. NWS offices furnished special fire weather
   instruments by a land management agency will perform the routine
   servicing of the equipment, such as changing fuel moisture sticks,
   wicking, charts, etc.

   6.    Weather Instrumentation. The basic instructions for the
   installation, maintenance, operation, and reading of weather
   instruments are contained in publications such as the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook No. 1, "Surface Observations," and Weather
   Service Observing Handbook No. 2, "Substation Observations." The U.S.
   Forest Service also publishes guidance for fire weather observation
   stations. The exposure of the weather instruments should conform to the
   standards outlined in Weather Service or USFS publications. Instruments
   provided by the fire control agencies should, as far as practicable,
   meet NWS instrument specifications. NWS offices may advise and assist
   fire control agencies in procurement, siting, and proper instrument
   exposure. Federal agencies may arrange to purchase weather instruments
   from NOAA's National Logistics Supply Center (NLSC) in Kansas City,
   Missouri, through Chief, Electronics Branch, within the regional
   Engineering Division. This is required to assure that impact on stock
   availability and central repairs (if applicable) at the National
   Reconditioning Center is coordinated.

   7.    Expendable Supplies. NWS fire weather offices will provide, on
   request, fire weather observation stations with expendable
   observational supplies, such as WS Form D-9, "10-Day Fire Danger and
   Fire Weather Record," coding sheets, psychrometric tables,
   psychrometric wicking, anemometer oil, hygrothermograph chart sheets
   and ink, "Reading and Setting Thermometer" cards, cloud charts, and
   other observer aids.

   8.    Observations. Daily observations are usually scheduled for a time
   corresponding to the most critical burning period. However,
   observations must be scheduled so that they are received in sufficient
   time to use in forecast preparation. Additional observations from
   selected stations, particularly higher elevation stations, may be
   scheduled at other times to provide a check on changes in weather
   conditions or to aid in forecast preparation and updates. A schedule of
   observations will be established by the NWS fire weather office and the
   fire control agencies to meet both fire danger rating and forecast
   needs. This schedule will be included in the Annual Operations Plan
   (see WSOM Chapter D-6).

   8.1    Special Observations. Fire weather observers should be
   encouraged to provide special observations to NWS fire weather offices
   any time there is an unexpected significant increase or decrease in
   fire danger; such as strong winds, a significant change in humidity, or
   lightning. These special observations will follow WS Form D-9, "10-Day
   Fire Danger and Fire Weather Record," guidelines and format. Special
   observations, containing the information required in WS Form D-1, "Fire
   Weather Special Forecast Request," should be provided whenever a
   special forecast is requested. Fire weather offices should arrange for
   the provision of special observations during special weather support
   activities.

   8.2    Remote Automatic Weather Station Observations. The volume of
   observations available from Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS)
   may be too large for a fire weather office to effectively analyze and
   use. Fire weather offices should arrange with the fire control agencies
   to routinely receive only selected RAWS observations. Arrangements
   should be made, and procedures established, to provide fire weather
   offices with access to other RAWS observations to meet special forecast
   requirements. All arrangements for the routine and special acquisition
   of RAWS observations will be coordinated with NWS regional
   headquarters.

   8.3    Other Fire Weather Related Observations. Where land management
   agencies have established specialized weather detection systems and/or
   networks, such as lightning detection systems or radar, the Regional
   Director will negotiate with the appropriate land management agency for
   NWS field office access to the specialized weather information.

   9.    Instructions to Observers. Instructions for taking fire weather
   observations are contained in publicat10ns, such as the USDA Forest
   Service Handbook No. 494, "Fire Weather Observers' Handbook."
   Instructions for recording fire weather observations are printed on the
   cover of each pad of WS Form D-9, "10-Day Fire Danger and Fire Weather
   Record."  Observers should be aware of these instructions. NWS offices
   and personnel may assist in the training of fire weather observers.
   Fire weather observers participating in climatological or hydrological
   observation programs will be instructed by the substation network
   specialist.

   The county numbers will begin in the northwest corner of the state and
   progress from west to east and north to south. All counties should be
   numbered even though some may have no observation stations.

   The station numbers within each county will begin with the number "01"
   and will continue until all existing stations are numbered. It is
   unlikely that any county will have as many as 100 observation stations
   and, therefore, little or no chance of exceeding the two-digit
   numbering system. Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) observations
   which will not be archived by the U.S. Forest Service will be assigned
   two letters (e.g., AA, AB, etc.) instead of two numbers for the station
   number group11.

   There are several states that have more than 100 counties each. In
   these states, any two adjacent counties may be combined into a single
   numbered area. Enough two-county pairings should be made to reduce the
   number of areas to 99 or less. Observation stations in the two-county
   area should be numbered consecutively.

   Since Alaska is not divided into counties, it will be necessary to
   arbitrarily designate "districts" for use in this numbering system. It
   is suggested that geographical features, such as mountain ridges and
   rivers, be used as boundaries for these districts. This form of
   boundary is preferable because it is not subject to change as is a
   protection agency boundary or a fire control area.

   This numbering system is not intended to replace any numbering or name
   system used by the fire control agency. It has been devised to provide
   a universal numbering system for processing fire weather observational
   data.
