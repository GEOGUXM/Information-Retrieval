     ND overview image A starting clone containing an insert is digested
       with a pair of restriction enzymes chosen to yield one Exo III
       processive end and one Exo III protective end. The DNA is then
        incubated with Exio III to initiate 3' to 5' digestion of the
   processive end. Aliquots are removed at various time points and treated
   with S1 nuclease to remove the single stranded tails. The DNAs are then
   self-ligated and cloned into E. coli. Clones are picked and grown. The
    DNA is then purified from each andsized on an agarose gel. Using the
    sizing information, DNAs are chosen for sequencing. These DNAs chosen
            shouldgive complete coverage of the original insert.
