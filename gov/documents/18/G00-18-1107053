                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



           The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows the listing of
   "distinct population segments"(DPSs) of vertebrate species or
   subspecies as threatened or endangered, if severe declines in abundance
   are indicated or substantial risks are facing the species. Thus, two
   key questions must be addressed in determining whether a listing under
   the ESA is warranted: 1) Is the entity in question a "species" as
   defined by the ESA? and 2) If so, is the "species" in danger of
   extinction (endangered) or likely to become so (threatened)? Guidance
   on what constitutes a "distinct population segment" is provided by the
   joint U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS) interagency policy on vertebrate populations
   (USFWS-NMFS 1996). Once a DPS is identified, NMFS considers a variety
   of factors in determining whether a listing is warranted.

           In response to a petition to list 18 species of marine fish in
   Puget Sound under the ESA (Wright 1999), NMFS initiated status reviews
   of seven of these species: Pacific hake, Merluccius productus (Ayres,
   1855); Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus Tilesius, 1810; walleye
   pollock, Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas, 1815); Pacific herring, Clupea
   pallasi Valenciennes, 1847; brown rockfish, Sebastes auriculatus
   Girard, 1854; copper rockfish, S. caurinus Richardson, 1845; and
   quillback rockfish, S. maliger Jordan and Gilbert, 1880. NMFS formed a
   Biological Review Team (BRT), composed of scientists with expertise in
   one or more of these species, to conduct these status reviews. This
   report summarizes the biological and environmental information gathered
   in that process and the scientific conclusions reached by the BRT for
   Pacific hake, Pacific cod, and walleye pollock. Since these latter
   three species are members of the Order Gadiformes (Cohen et al. 1990,
   Robins et al. 1991, Eschmeyer 1998) they are jointly referred to as
   gadiforms throughout this document. This review is part of a larger
   effort by the National Marine Fisheries Service to complete status
   reviews for all seven of the petitioned species of marine fish in Puget
   Sound.

                              Marine Fish DPSs

           The BRT examined environmental, geologic, biogeographic, life
   history, and genetic information in the process of identifying DPSs
   that satisfy ESA and joint interagency policy definitions (USFWS-NMFS
   1996) of "discreteness" and "significance." In particular,
   geographically-discrete and temporally-persistent spawning
   aggregations, tagging data, biogeography, ecological and habitat
   factors, and variation in seasonal migration patterns, parasite
   incidence, and genetic population structure were found to be most
   informative for this process. Data relating to group or stock
   demographics (year-class strength, growth rate, body size at maturity,
   age at maturity, length frequency, fecundity, etc.) and morphometrics
   and meristics were less informative for DPS delineation, since the
   extent to which these characteristics are influenced by environmental
   or genetic differences is relatively unknown. Based on this
   examination, the BRT identified a DPS for Pacific hake and a DPS for
   walleye pollock in this region that can be considered species under the
   ESA. The BRT also concluded that there is good reason to believe that
   Pacific cod from Puget Sound are part of a DPS that extends beyond the
   boundaries of the Puget Sound ecosystem, to at least as far north as
   Dixon Entrance.

                        Assessment of Extinction Risk

           The ESA (section 3) defines the term "endangered species" as
   "any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a
   significant portion of its range." The term "threatened species" is
   defined as "any species which is likely to become an endangered species
   within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion
   of its range." According to the ESA, the determination of whether a
   species is threatened or endangered should be made on the basis of the
   best scientific information available regarding its current status,
   after taking into consideration conservation measures that are proposed
   or are in place. In this review, the BRT did not evaluate likely or
   possible effects of conservation measures, and therefore did not make
   recommendations as to whether identified DPSs should be listed as
   threatened or endangered species; rather, the BRT drew scientific
   conclusions about the risk of extinction faced by identified DPSs,
   under the assumption that present conditions will continue.

           The majority of the BRT concluded that the Pacific hake DPS,
   the walleye pollock DPS, and all three potential DPS scenarios for
   Pacific cod in the Eastern Pacific are not in danger of extinction.
   Although the BRT concluded that none of the population segments of the
   three gadiform species examined is in danger of extinction, in each
   case, the BRT acknowledged that their level of concern would have been
   elevated if the geographic size of the DPSs or population segments
   examined had been smaller.

                       Georgia Basin Pacific Hake DPS

   DPS delineation

           The BRT concluded that inshore resident Pacific hake from Puget
   Sound and the Strait of Georgia constitute the Georgia Basin Pacific
   hake DPS(Fig. 1). The Georgia Basin is comprised of the marine waters
   of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and eastern Strait of Juan de
   Fuca. The BRT identified a variety of evidence to support their
   conclusion that Georgia Basin Pacific hake constitute a separate DPS
   relative to offshore Pacific hake: 1) Differences in annual migration
   behavior, 2) significant allozyme frequency differences between Puget
   Sound and offshore Pacific hake, 3) absence of the protozoan parasite
   Kudoa paniformis in inshore populations compared to its common
   occurrence in offshore Pacific hake, 4) differences in otolith
   morphology between Strait of Georgia and offshore Pacific hake, 5)
   distinctiveness of the habitats of inshore Pacific hake (they spawn in
   deep, inshore basins that receive large freshwater inputs and are the
   only populations of Pacific hake that inhabit fjord-like environments),
   6) wide geographic separation of inshore and offshore spawning locales,
   and 7) demographic data showing that inshore Pacific hake are generally
   smaller for a given age, mature at a smaller size, and reach a smaller
   maximum length than offshore fish. The BRT expressed several concerns
   about the available data; for example: 1) it is not clear whether
   demographic differences between Georgia Basin and offshore Pacific hake
   are driven by environmental or genetic differences, 2) some of the
   allozyme loci that show differences between Puget Sound and offshore
   Pacific hake have been shown to be under selection in other animals,
   and 3) there is no obvious physical barrier preventing mixing of
   offshore and Georgia Basin Pacific hake, especially during the
   June-August period when offshore Pacific hake may occur near the mouth
   of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

   Summary of BRT risk conclusions

           The BRT concluded that the Georgia Basin Pacific hake DPS was
   not presently in danger of extinction, but could with nearly equal
   likelihood fall into either of two categories:

   1) not in danger of extinction, nor likely to become so in the
   foreseeable future, or 2) not presently in danger of extinction, but
   likely to become so in the foreseeable future. As a whole, the BRT gave
   slightly higher support to the first category. The biomass of Pacific
   hake in Port Susan during the spawning period has declined by 85% over
   the past 15 years, yet numbers have fluctuated around 30 million fish
   until dropping to less than 11 million in 2000. Over the same period,
   size composition and size-at-maturity for females have also decreased
   substantially. In contrast, such significant declines in biomass, fish
   size, or maturity, are not evident for Pacific hake populations in the
   Canadian portion of the Strait of Georgia and these populations are
   much larger than the Port Susan population.

           In addition to the concerns about the status of Puget Sound
   Pacific hake, the BRT identified several areas of uncertainty regarding
   the relationships among stocks and effects of potential risk factors.
   The extent of any mixing of spawning products or spawners among stocks
   within the Georgia Basin is unknown. Risk factors are also poorly known
   and for the most part, the BRT could only speculate on potential
   factors and their effects. For example, two hypothetical models of
   pinniped predation on Pacific hake in Port Susan were considered, but
   the results were inconclusive.

           Over the next year, much new information is expected to become
   available that will likely resolve many of the uncertainties about the
   status and relationship of stocks of Pacific hake within the Georgia
   Basin DPS. When it is available, the BRT urges that this new
   information be considered and extinction risk be reevaluated.

                                 Pacific Cod

   DPS delineation

           The majority opinion of the BRT was that there is good reason
   to believe that Pacific cod from Puget Sound are part of a DPS that is
   larger than Puget Sound and that this DPS extends northward to at least
   Dixon Entrance (Fig. 2). However, the BRT concluded that there is
   insufficient information available at present to identify the exact
   northern boundary of the DPS that incorporates Puget Sound Pacific cod.
   A high level of uncertainty concerning the northern boundary of the DPS
   was expressed during the decision-making process, and the BRT agreed
   that there is insufficient information available at present to identify
   DPSs of Pacific cod with a high degree of certainty. The BRT struggled
   with this decision and noted that the lack of suitable data to answer
   the DPS question for Pacific cod was a cause for concern.

           The conclusion that the Pacific cod DPS is larger than Puget
   Sound was supported by:

   1) genetic data that show a lack of significant heterogeneity among
   Pacific cod sampled largely during summer and fall at various locations
   in the northeastern Pacific Ocean (although it is possible that if
   collections had been of spawning fish the data might have shown greater
   population structure), 2) results of adult tagging studies in the
   Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound showing movement amongst inshore
   locations and some limited movement between inshore and coastal areas
   (although rare tagging studies on spawning fish do show some level of
   spawning site fidelity), and 3) the ecological similarity of fjord-type
   marine habitat in Puget Sound to habitat along the coasts of British
   Columbia and southern Alaska.

           The BRT considered several scenarios as to where the northern
   boundary of the DPS may occur, including: 1) the northern extent of the
   Georgia Basin (encompassing the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and the
   eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca), 2) the north end of Vancouver Island
   (encompassing the Georgia Basin and Amphitrite Bank spawning
   aggregations), 3) Dixon Entrance, and 4) Southeast Alaska. Although the
   BRT was unable to determine the exact northern boundary of the Pacific
   cod DPS, a majority of the BRT felt that the northern boundary of the
   Pacific cod DPS extends at least as far north as Dixon Entrance.

           Although the BRT could not with any certainty identify multiple
   populations or DPSs of Pacific cod within the region south of Dixon
   Entrance/Southeast Alaska, they acknowledged the possibility that
   significant stock structuring does exist within this region and that a
   finer DPS structure might be revealed by further information on the
   behavior, ecology, and genetic population structure of Pacific cod. The
   BRT recognized that the DPS, that includes Puget Sound Pacific cod, may
   represent fish that are uniquely adapted to survive at the southern end
   of the species range.

   Summary of BRT risk conclusions

           As with the northern boundary considerations for the Pacific
   cod DPS, the BRT struggled with the assessment of extinction risks. Of
   the four scenarios considered for the northern boundary of the DPS for
   Pacific cod (see summary above), the BRT did not distinguish between
   DPS scenarios 1 and 2 for its extinction risk assessment. The BRT
   considered risks for three DPS scenarios: 1) Georgia Basin, 2) Puget
   Sound to Dixon Entrance, and 3) Puget Sound through Southeast Alaska.

           In general, as the size of the DPS grew to encompass more
   spawning locations and greater numbers of Pacific cod, the BRT
   considered the risks of extinction to diminish. The majority of the BRT
   concluded that Pacific cod encompassed by DPS scenarios 2 (Puget Sound
   to Dixon Entrance) and 3 (Puget Sound through Southeast Alaska) are not
   in danger of extinction, nor are they likely to become so in the
   foreseeable future. A minority of the BRT felt that Pacific cod within
   either DPS scenario 2 or 3, although not presently in danger of
   extinction, are likely to become so in the foreseeable future. In fact,
   most BRT members could not rule out the possibility that Pacific cod in
   DPS scenario 2 (Puget Sound to Dixon Entrance) are likely to become
   endangered in the foreseeable future.

           The BRT was divided on the extinction risk status of Pacific
   cod encompassed by scenario 1 (Georgia Basin). Although the BRT agreed
   that Pacific cod in the Georgia Basin scenario are not presently in
   danger of extinction, the BRT was nearly equally divided on the
   question of whether Pacific cod in this population segment are likely
   to become endangered in the foreseeable future if present trends
   continue. As a whole, the BRT gave slightly higher support to placing
   Pacific cod in this population segment in the category of not in danger
   of extinction, nor likely to become so in the foreseeable future.

           The BRT identified several concerns: 1) the apparent loss of
   the major, known spawning locations in Puget Sound, 2) general
   synchronicity in declining trends in Pacific cod abundance from Puget
   Sound to Southeast Alaska, and 3) relatively little quantitative
   information or understanding about the effects of potential risk
   factors. Overall, it is not certain which risk factors, either singly
   or in combination, may be significantly contributing to the current low
   stock sizes of Pacific cod.

              Lower Boreal Eastern Pacific Walleye Pollock DPS

   DPS delineation

           The BRT concluded that aggregations of spawning walleye pollock
   in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, south of a provisional northern
   boundary of 140^oW, are part of a single DPS, which is the Lower boreal
   Eastern Pacific walleye pollock DPS. The DPS name is derived from the
   zoogeographic literature, which describes the general area occupied by
   this unit as containing a "well-defined lower boreal fauna" (Briggs
   1974, p. 278). The provisional northern boundary of the Lower boreal
   Eastern Pacific DPS coincides with the northern and western stock
   boundary for Southeast Alaska walleye pollock at 140^oW (Fig. 3).

           The BRTs conclusion that a walleye pollock DPS extends from
   Puget Sound northward to encompass all of Southeast Alaska, with a
   provisional northern boundary at 140^oW, was supported by the following
   considerations: 1) the walleye pollock reproductive traits of pelagic
   spawning and pelagic distribution of eggs and larvae, 2) the ecological
   similarity of fjord-type marine habitat in Puget Sound to habitat along
   the coasts of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska, 3) the more or
   less continuous distribution of spawning sites for walleye pollock
   within the geographic confines of the DPS, 4) that regulatory agencies
   in the area consider walleye pollock in northern British Columbia and
   Southeast Alaska to consist of a single stock, 5) recognition of a
   significant zoogeographic faunal break in Southeast Alaska, 6) the
   consideration that walleye pollock from Puget Sound through Southeast
   Alaska are spawning in fjords, whereas further north walleye pollock
   are spawning in more open water, and 7) the unlikely potential for
   walleye pollock from Southeast Alaska to mix with walleye pollock from
   the central and western Gulf of Alaska. The BRT did not preclude the
   possibility that further information on the behavior, ecology, and
   genetic population structure might provide a basis for delineating
   smaller DPSs of walleye pollock within the Lower boreal Eastern Pacific
   DPS.

           Although the BRT could not with any certainty identify multiple
   populations or DPSs of walleye pollock within the Lower boreal Eastern
   Pacific DPS, they acknowledged the possibility that more than one DPS
   for walleye pollock may exist in the range from Puget Sound to
   Southeast Alaska. However, the BRT was unable to find compelling
   evidence that this finer DPS structure exists. As an example of the
   uncertainty inherent in the walleye pollock DPS decision, it should be
   noted that none of the BRT members ruled out the possibility that there
   could be a DPS for walleye pollock at the level of the Georgia Basin.

   Summary of BRT risk conclusions

           The BRT concluded that walleye pollock in the Lower boreal
   Eastern Pacific DPS are not in danger of extinction, nor are they
   likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future if present trends
   continue. However, most BRT members could not entirely rule out the
   possibility that walleye pollock in this DPS, although not presently in
   danger of extinction, are likely to become so in the foreseeable
   future.

           Information on the status of walleye pollock stocks in the DPS
   is very limited and usually based on catches or catch rates in
   recreational or commercial fisheries. The abundance of walleye pollock
   in Puget Sound is at low levels, especially in southern areas, but
   stocks outside Puget Sound do not appear to be at or declining to such
   low levels. As with Pacific hake and Pacific cod, little quantitative
   information is available about potential risk factors or their effects
   on the status of walleye pollock in the DPS. The lack of suitable data
   to assess extinction risk is a cause for concern.

                 Consideration of the Puget Sound Ecosystem

           It is important to note that the BRT's considerations of the
   status and trends of Pacific hake, Pacific cod, and walleye pollock in
   the Puget Sound area did not, and should not, occur in a vacuum. In
   addition to these three species, several other fish species from this
   area have either been listed under the ESA, or have been petitioned for
   listing. These include 23 ESUs of anadromous salmonids in the Pacific
   Northwest, Pacific herring, and various species of rockfishin or close
   to the Puget Sound area. A significance emerges from consideration of
   these species collectively that is not apparent when any one is
   considered alone. Joint consideration of these species together
   suggests ecosystem-level implications that are difficult or impossible
   to evaluate under terms of the ESA. It is possible, hypothetically,
   that the reduced or declining trends of each of the individual species
   in this group could be considered as insufficient for affording any of
   the species legal protection under the ESA. But taking no action, under
   such circumstances, might be a major mistake if this collective
   information is an indication that the Puget Sound area, as an
   ecosystem, is experiencing major change. Such changes could be of more
   far-ranging concern than could ever be recognized if any one species
   were considered individually. Environmental variation and general
   ecosystem dynamics, could easily lead to at least some of the declines
   in abundance observed for any one of these species. The commonalities
   and synchronous nature of the information is compelling, and
   scientifically, this raises the need to determine the degree to which
   these common changes are anthropogenic, both for individual species and
   within the Puget Sound ecosystem as a whole. The complexity of factors
   responsible for population fluctuations emphasizes the need for better
   understanding of the unique features of Puget Sound compared to
   surrounding and similar environments, many of which are interconnected
   with the Sound via such factors as the climate, currents, migrations,
   and dispersal of various species. It is important to understand the
   natural variation within such systems over various time scales from
   decades to thousands of years. The potential for stratigraphic sediment
   analysis is noted in this regard. So are studies of the dynamics of
   species compared across the observed diversity of life-history
   strategies. Measures of the ebb and flow, or the extinction,
   recolonization, and persistence of the populations of the various
   species in the Puget Sound ecosystem are important as a basis for
   judging how problematic the picture before us is, to what degree the
   changes are of anthropogenic origins, and how significant these changes
   are as a basis for taking management action. In the absence of such
   information, the BRT was restricted to a largely species by species
   consideration of the data.
