                       National Council on Disability

                                 At a Glance
     __________________________________________________________________

   Background and Mission

   The National Council on Disability (NCD) was initially established in
   1978 as an advisory board within the Department of Education. The
   council is composed of 15 members, appointed by the President of the
   United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Rehabilitation Act
   Amendments of 1984 transformed NCD into an independent agency.

   The overall purpose of the agency is to promote policies, programs,
   practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all
   people with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the
   disability, and to empower them to achieve economic self-sufficiency,
   independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of
   society.

   Specific Duties

   The statutory mandate of NCD includes the following duties:
     * Review and evaluate federal policies, programs, practices, and
       procedures concerning people with disabilities, including programs
       established or assisted under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
       amended, and the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of
       Rights Act.
     * Review and evaluate all statutes and regulations pertaining to
       federal programs that assist people with disabilities, to assess
       their effectiveness in meeting the needs of these people.
     * Review and evaluate emerging federal, state, local, and private
       sector policy issues that affect people with disabilities,
       including the need for and coordination of adult services, access
       to personal assistance services, school reform efforts and the
       impact of these efforts on persons with disabilities, access to
       health care, and policies that operate as disincentives for
       individuals to seek and retain employment.
     * Make recommendations to the President, Congress, the Secretary of
       Education, the Director of the National Institute on Disability and
       Rehabilitation Research, and other officials of federal agencies
       regarding ways to promote equal opportunity, economic
       self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration
       into all aspects of society for Americans with disabilities.
     * Provide Congress with advice, recommendations, legislative
       proposals, and other information that NCD or Congress deems
       appropriate.
     * Gather information about the implementation, effectiveness, and
       impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.
     * Advise the President, Congress, the Commissioner of the
       Rehabilitation Services Administration, the Assistant Secretary for
       Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in the Department of
       Education, and the Director of the National Institute on Disability
       and Rehabilitation Research on the development of programs to be
       carried out under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
     * Advise the Commissioner on the policies and conduct of the
       Rehabilitation Services Administration.
     * Make recommendations to the Director of the National Institute on
       Disability and Rehabilitation Research on research affecting people
       with disabilities.
     * Advise the Interagency Disability Coordinating Council on
       priorities for its activities and review the recommendations of the
       council for legislative and administrative changes.
     * Prepare and submit to the President and Congress an annual report,
       National Disability Policy: A Progress Report.

   Population Served and Current Activities

   Many government agencies deal with issues and programs that affect
   people with disabilities, but NCD is the only federal agency charged
   with addressing, analyzing, and making recommendations on issues of
   public policy that affect people with disabilities regardless of age,
   disability type, perceived employment potential, economic need,
   functional ability, veteran status, or other individual circumstance.

   NCD recognizes its unique opportunity to facilitate independent living,
   community integration, and employment opportunities for people with
   disabilities by ensuring an informed and coordinated approach to
   address their concerns and eliminate barriers to their active
   participation in community and family life.

   NCD plays a major role in developing disability policy in America. In
   fact, the agency originally proposed what eventually became ADA.

   Key issues include personal assistance services, health care reform,
   the inclusion of students with disabilities in high-quality programs in
   typical neighborhood schools, equal employment opportunity, community
   housing, monitoring the implementation of ADA, improving assistive
   technology, and ensuring that persons with disabilities, including
   minorities, fully participate in society.
