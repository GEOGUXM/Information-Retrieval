                Welcome to the Center for Molecular Modeling

   The CENTER FOR MOLECULAR MODELING (CMM) is a major supplier of
   molecular modeling resources and expertise to the NIH research
   community. We help organize molecular modeling users at the NIH by
   sponsoring the inter-institute MOLECULAR MODELING INTEREST GROUP
   (MMIG). We have used the NIH network to create a distributed molecular
   modeling environment (MMIGNET) that is accessible from UNIX
   workstations and personal computers maintained by individual
   investigators throughout the NIH's Institutes.

   The CMM's computational chemists collaborate with NIH researchers on
   molecular modeling-related projects. Our scientific interests include
   the modeling of macromolecular structure and dynamics, the
   structure-function relationships of macromolecules, macromolecular
   interactions, enzyme mechanism, and ligand binding.
