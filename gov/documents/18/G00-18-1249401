               Scans Link 2 Key Pieces of Schizophrenia Puzzle

   Using functional brain imaging, National Institute of Mental Health
       scientists for the first time have linked two key, but until now
       unconnected, brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. They have shown
       that the less patients' frontal lobes activate during a working
       memory task, the more the chemical messenger dopamine, thought to
       underlie the delusions and hallucinations of schizophrenia, rises
       abnormally in the striatum, a relay station deep in the brain.
       Together with other evidence, this suggests that the excess
       dopamine activity that antipsychotic drugs quell may be driven by a
       defect in the prefrontal cortex, the brain's executive control
       center. Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, M.D., Karen Berman, M.D., and
       colleagues report on their PET (positron emission tomography)
       study, published online January 28, 2002, in Nature Neuroscience.
       The most disabling form of mental illness, schizophrenia affects
       one percent of the adult population, typically in young adulthood,
       with hallucinations, delusions, social withdrawal, flattened
       emotions and loss of social and personal care skills. Although the
       cause of the disorder remains a mystery, studies that shed light on
       the role of dopamine in schizophrenia hold promise for advancing
       understanding and, ultimately, improving treatments.
       The researchers used two different types of radioactive tracers in
       the same scanning sessions with 6 patients and 6 healthy controls
       to simultaneously monitor two different types of brain activity. A
       radioactive form of oxygen revealed where blood flowed, and hence
       what parts of the brain were active during the experimental task. A
       radioactively-tagged chemical precursor of dopamine indicated
       activity of this chemical messenger. The PET scanner employs an
       array of radiation detectors to get a fix on the destinations of
       the tracers, producing color-coded, quantitative images of the
       activity being measured.
       The scans were taken while subjects performed an abstract reasoning
       / working memory task that activates the prefrontal cortex. As in
       previous studies, the patients showed reduced prefrontal activation
       and performed poorly on the task, suggesting disturbed functioning
       of that part of the brain. Also consistent with previous findings,
       patients' striatal dopamine activity was abnormally elevated. In
       patients, but not in controls, the researchers observed a tight
       coupling and highly significant inverse correlation between these
       two abnormalities, suggesting that they share a "common
       pathophysiological mechanism."
       The striking linkage is likely traceable to a primary dysfunction
       of the prefrontal cortex, argue the investigators, who cite basic
       science findings that dopamine activity in the striatum is under
       the control of the prefrontal area. Stimulating or inhibiting this
       area affects firing of striatal neurons and dopamine release. A
       recent study in rats found that neurons that project from the
       prefrontal cortex to the striatum are inhibitory in effect,
       suggesting an anatomical mechanism by which reduced prefrontal
       activity might take the brakes off striatal dopamine release. Using
       magnetic resonance spectroscopy, colleagues in the NIMH Clinical
       Brain Disorders Branch have discovered a similar correlation
       between decreased NAA (N-Acetyl Aspartate), an indicator of the
       health of cells, in the prefrontal cortex, and excess dopamine
       release in response to amphetamine.
       "These results provide a long-sought insight into the roots of
       dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia," said Berman. "They
       suggest a possible treatment strategy that targets prefrontal
       cortex dysfunction, not just excess dopamine."
       Also participating in the research were: Daniel Weinberger, M.D.,
       Philip Kohn, Giuseppe Esposito, M.D., NIMH; Robert Miletich, M.D.,
       Ph.D., Mario Quarantelli, M.D., National Institute on Neurological
       Disorders and Stroke; Richard Carson, Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center.

   While patients performed a working memory task, the less the prefrontal
   cortex (red) activated, the more dopamine increased in the striatum
   (green).
