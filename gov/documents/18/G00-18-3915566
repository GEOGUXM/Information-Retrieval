   Welcome to JCISS
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Joint Center for International and Security Studies (JCISS) was
   created in 1994 as a strategic research and educational partnership
   between the University of California at Davis (UCD) and the Naval
   Postgraduate School in Monterey (NPS). Founded and co-directed by
   Professor Emily O. Goldman of UC Davis and Professor Jan Breemer of
   NPS, JCISS brings together scholars and practitioners of national
   security affairs to conduct innovative research on post-Cold War
   national security problems.

   The philosophy that guides this unique teaming approach is the
   following. The international system, including its military component,
   is going through revolutionary change. This means that the principles
   and concepts that were at the heart of the nation's national security
   solution during the Cold War may no longer be relevant; the givens then
   may not be so today. It follows that we must "re-tool," and doing so
   can best be done by pooling the specialized knowledge and insights of
   theoreticians and operators, of the scholar and the practitioner of
   security affairs. The desirability of this kind of collaboration has
   always been there. It has become imperative in light of the progressive
   blurring of the dividing line between the civilian and military spheres
   of competence in the wake of the revolution in information
   technologies.

   The changed security environment also has implications for the way that
   we educate students. The study of security can no longer be confined to
   the realm of military affairs, so the education of military officers
   must be more firmly embedded in the fabric of civilian society.
   Civilian students must not leave school believing peace and security
   concerns are not worthy of study; their education should develop
   awareness of these issues. The unique JCISS teaming approach fosters
   communication and understanding between military and civilian students
   so that jointly both are better prepared to face the novel security
   challenges of the twenty-first century.

JCISS Research Programs

   JCISS fosters collaborative research between academics and
   practitioners in the areas of national security, defense, and
   international peace and security studies. The Center has underway
   several research projects that examine the impact of the new global
   security and technological environments on US foreign and national
   security policy, and international security.

   Revolution in Military Affairs

   The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) debate concerns how the United
   States can and should exploit new technological opportunities to ensure
   the continued effectiveness of its military forces as an instrument of
   national and international security. JCISS hosted several workshops and
   conferences to explore how RMAs impact political and military
   organizations, established wisdom in security studies, and
   international balances of power. Areas of focus include the
   consequences of RMAs for national security, international relations
   theory, and US foreign policy; international reaction to the US
   information technology (IT) RMA, particularly the rise of competitors;
   impact of the IT-RMA on domestic political support for military
   engagement; the IT-RMA and deterrence.

   Information Warfare

   The US military is in the process of adapting to warfare in the
   information age. JCISS is currently examining what is unique or
   significantly different about the dynamics associated with information
   warfare that requires new or altered policy, doctrine, organizations,
   and force structure. Areas of focus include organizational and
   management dimensions of an IT-based military; IW and civil-military
   relations; and the national security challenges posed by network
   centric warfare. JCISS sponsors a Working Paper Series on Information
   Technology and International Security (ITIS), which publishes
   debate-provoking deductive and empirical studies that examine the
   national and international security implications of information
   technologies.

   Diffusion of Military Innovation

   Diffusion is a topic of considerable relevance to policy-makers
   interested in determining how other states and military organizations
   will respond to an American-led RMA. Much of current US foreign and
   security policy counts on a large and long-standing US conventional
   superiority over most possible challengers, in most types of warfare.
   Is this a reasonable expectation? JCISS is examining assumptions about
   diffusion that undergird the RMA debate to provide a basis for
   anticipating how others are likely to respond to current military
   trends and US practices, and how long the United States is likely to
   retain its military edge. Areas of focus include diffusion of
   innovative technologies, ideas, and applications among the world's
   militaries and non-state actors from the Napoleonic era to the
   information age; impact of cultural, economic, political, and
   organizational features on military diffusion; diffusion to competitors
   and allies; and the impact of diffusion for US military superiority.

Virtual Research Center

   JCISS is the first civilian-military research and educational center
   for the study of national security issues. It is intended that this
   collaborative effort be the first step toward a nation-wide network of
   academic institutions and researchers concerned with international and
   security issues.

   To that end, JCISS hosts a Virtual Research Center (VRC) linking
   national security scholars and practitioners so they can debate current
   issues and explore new approaches for US strategy. The VRC is a
   response to the need to redesign the way academic institutions involved
   in national security research "network" with national security
   practitioners.

   The VRC allows researchers and policy-makers the opportunity to
   participate in on-going debate on international and national security
   issues, a feedback loop that sharpens the researcher's focus and makes
   the policy-maker a full participant in the research. The JCISS
   technological concept is fundamentally different from other electronic
   media in the tailored nature of its support to the national security
   policy community. It is as close to the policy-maker as his or her desk
   and as easily accessible as a few keystrokes. It allows the
   policy-maker to be an active participant in the problem solving process
   and ensures academic research remains attuned to the ongoing concerns
   of the policy community. The medium allows feedback from practitioners
   to be easily incorporated, builds a process that is not dependent on
   airline schedules and contractor satellite facilities, and uses
   leading-edge technology to provide the product more quickly. Electronic
   media offers a way to re-capitalize the field of national security
   studies by expanding participation in the national security debate to
   include academics, national security researchers, and policy-makers
   nation-wide. The VRC also offers Virtual Conference Rooms--protected
   places where policy-makers and researchers may quietly meet to refine
   concepts and engage in one-on-one or multi-participant discussions.
