   accessible via the web, for translations to and from VRML and X3D.

     * Working Model 3D Translator - a translator for physical dynamics
       product "Working Model 3D" to VRML.
     * Deneb2VRML - a translator from Deneb Robotics models to VRML.
     * VRML to X3D and X3D to VRML - early alpha versions of VRML97 to X3D
       and the reverse translators.

   These translators are a product of the Visualization and Usability
