   Farm Bill Dormant
   Senator Johnson made enactment of a new farm bill a top priority last
   year, and he plans to keep that effort up in 2002. The Senate farm bill
   contains a number of provisions that benefit South Dakota's family
   farmers and ranchers, including Johnson legislation concerning: country
   of origin labeling for beef, lamb, pork and other commodities, quality
   grade certification on U.S.-produced meat, and banning meatpackers from
   owning livestock prior to slaughter. The Senate farm bill also
   increases loan rates for crops grown in South Dakota and places new
   emphasis on conservation programs.
