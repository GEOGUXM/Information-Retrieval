      Experts in food allergy, genetically modified crops, other scientists,
      physicians and government regulators will meet for a workshop,
      "Assessment of the Allergenic Potential of Genetically Modified Foods,"
      sponsored by five federal agencies at the Sheraton Hotel at 1 Europa
      Drive, Chapel Hill, N.C., Dec. 10-12.

      The press and public may attend as observers to the degree space
      permits. The agenda and registration forms are at

      Organized by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,
      which is one of the institutes of the National Institutes of Health,
      and the National Toxicology Program, which is headquartered at NIEHS,
      the workshop is also sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency's
      Office of Research and Development; the NIH's Office of Rare Diseases,
      and the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and
      Nutrition.

      addresses outlining the issues at 8:30 a.m.

      This meeting was originally set for Sept. 24-26 but was postponed
      because of travel difficulties following the terrorist attack on the
      Twin Towers in New York City.
