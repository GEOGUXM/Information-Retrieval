                         Water Resources of Arkansas

      [Nov16Pic.jpg] The U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's largest
     earth-science agency and the principal Federal agency for providing
   hydrologic information and for appraising the Nation's water resources.
    The water resources of Arkansas consist of numerous streams, springs,
      lakes, and aquifer systems. Streamflow, ground-water levels, and
   water-quality data are collected throughout the state. These hydrologic
     data and other data are used in research and hydrologic studies to
       describe the quantity, quality, and location of Arkansas' water
    resources. The collection, analysis, and interpretation of these data
    is done in cooperation with other federal, state and local agencies,
                     universities, and research centers.
