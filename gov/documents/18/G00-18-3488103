   [ISMAP:leftmen3.gif]   On-line NCRR directories are available here to
   readily identify the array of research resource facilities,
   biomaterials, and models available to biomedical investigators across
   this country. Research Resources serve as institutional, regional or
   national facilities for clinical, animal or biomedical technology
   research; those facilities provide expertise, specially adapted
   laboratories and research equipment. Biological materials--ranging from
   cells, genes, tissues to whole animals--some of which are available at
   no charge or a modest handling fee to qualified investigators. For
   others, investigators should check with the resource to determine
   appropriate cost.
