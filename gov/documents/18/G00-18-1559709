   Congressional Accountability Act Pursuant to the Congressional
   Accountability Act, all congressional offices are protected by the
   Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (OSHA). The Office of
   Compliance enforces these protections for all covered employees. OSHA
   standards require that plans be developed so that employees know what
   to do in an emergency. Emergency Preparedness on Capitol Hill An
   emergency preparedness program has been developed and updated for the
   Capitol complex by the Capitol Police. Under the overall program, each
   office must appoint an "office emergency coordinator" (OEC) and have an
   emergency plan that coordinates with the overall plan for the building.
   The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for: * Informing employees
   about available exit routes. Posting a diagram of exit routes in a
   prominent location is a good idea. * Identifying a specific meeting
   location within the designated assembly area for personnel, and an
   alternate location. Personnel should be prepared to relocate for
   reasons of inclement weather or extended evacuation. * Accounting for
   all personnel and providing the Capitol Police Officer in the assembly
   area (wearing an orange vest) with the name(s) of anyone who is
   missing. * Making sure that persons needing assistance to evacuate have
   notified the Capitol Police (see page 2 for specific numbers) so that
   assistance can be planned. OEC's should also assist temporary employees
   and visitors in an emergency situation. New congressional offices and
   those updating their plans should review the Office of
   Compliance/Guidelines for Preparing Emergency Action Plan and Sample
   Plan 1997 at www.compliance.gov for more detailed information. Lessons
   Learned at the World Trade Center On September 11, 2001 two large
   employers were able to get most of their employees to safety before the
   towers collapsed. All but six of Morgan Stanley's 2,500 employees who
   worked on floors 43 through 74 of one of the towers made it to safety.
   All of the 800 employees of the U.S. Customs Service, who worked in an
   eight-story building, were also unharmed. Both employers attribute
   their success to the time and effort they invested in improving their
   evacuation planning after the 1993 bombing. While having an Emergency
   Evacuation Plan does not guarantee that all employees will be able to
   leave their work areas unharmed, these two examples strongly suggest
   that having a good plan in effect during an emergency can save lives.
   The following items address common deficiencies in emergency
   procedures. 10 Safety Recommendations for Every Office * Be thorough
   and comprehensive in planning for emergencies. Try to cover all
   contingencies-not just the quickest way out of the building. * Train
   all new people when they come on-board about the contents of the plan.
   Interns, like other short-term employees, should be familiar with
   emergency evacuation information. * Implement a system to back up and
   store data in a remote location that can be retrieved later. Newspaper
   articles reported that some workers in the World Trade complex lost
   their lives when they returned to their offices to collect OMPLIANCE
   information. * Keep the plan current. As staff leave the organization
   be sure to assign a new employee to be Office Emergency C Coordinator.
   * Do practice drills. Problems are frequently discovered when the
   drills are practiced. * Plan for the unexpected. During an actual
   emergency, there may not be telephone service or emergency lighting and
   OF certain doors or passageways may be blocked or non-accessible. *
   Follow the plan once it has been activated. Once the plan is activated
   for whatever reason, complete the evacuation. Unless directed by the
   Capitol Police or other law enforcement at the scene, follow the plan.
   The two organizations mentioned earlier, experienced no or very few
   fatalities because they followed the plan and left their buildings
   quickly. * Once the fire alarm is sounded, do not wait for an
   announcement over the public address system. The fire alarm signal is
   your signal to evacuate the building. There may not be an announcement.
   * Know the facts, make no assumptions. Do you know how to open an
   emergency exit that has a delayed opening FFICE device? Can the fire
   alarms be heard inside the restrooms? How will persons needing
   assistance get out of the building? (See Emergency Evacuation brochure
   for your building for guidance) O * Ask questions. Know what your role
   and responsibilities are in an emergency evacuation. Your life can
   depend on it. Not all emergencies will be handled in the same way by
   the authorities. Some evacuations may call for moving people through
   pedestrian tunnels. Others may require that you "shelter in place" or
   stay where you are. Listen for specific instructions. However, absent
   any instruction, follow your Emergency Evacuation Plan. For further
   information about evacuation procedures call the Capitol Police. For
   additional information on OSHA requirements relating to your emergency
   plan, contact the Office of Compliance at 202/724-9250. YOUR CHECKLIST
   FOR SAFETY ...DO IT TODAY * Know your office emergency coordinator. An
   emergency coordinator is assigned in each office to help you evacuate
   your work areas during an emergency. They have been trained to help. *
   Read the "Emergency Evacuation Procedures" brochure for your building.
   Prepare yourself for an emergency by reading the brochure and your
   office's plan. Know where your assembly area and alternate assembly
   area are located. * Know your emergency evacuation routes. Practice
   your evacuation route and an alternate exit in case your normal egress
   is blocked. * Practice your evacuation procedure. When you hear an
   alarm, don't ask questions. Leave your work area and building
   immediately. Do not use elevators during an evacuation. Fill in the
   information below and keep in a handy location. Important Information &
