   Library of Congress, International Horizons -- Digital collections from
                              around the world

   "The Library of Congress serves both the working government of a free
    people and the scholarly frontiers of all people. It will not serve
   either well if the Library simply spreads information to other places
           without generating knowledge and distilling wisdom."
