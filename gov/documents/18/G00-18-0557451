                Travel Warnings & Consular Information Sheets

What Are Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets & Public Announcements?

   Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides, based on
   all relevant information, to recommend that Americans avoid travel to a
   certain country. Countries where avoidance of travel is recommended
   will have Travel Warnings as well as Consular Information Sheets.

   Public Announcements are a means to disseminate information about
   terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or trans-national
   conditions posing significant risks to the security of American
   travelers. They are made any time there is a perceived threat and
   usually have Americans as a particular target group. In the past,
   Public Announcements have been issued to deal with short-term coups,
   bomb threats to airlines, violence by terrorists and anniversary dates
   of specific terrorist events.

   Consular Information Sheets are available for every country of the
   world. They include such information as location of the U.S. Embassy or
   Consulate in the subject country, unusual immigration practices, health
   conditions, minor political disturbances, unusual currency and entry
   regulations, crime and security information, and drug penalties. If an
   unstable condition exists in a country that is not severe enough to
   warrant a Travel Warning, a description of the condition(s) may be
   included under an optional section entitled "Safety/Security." On
   limited occasions, we also restate in this section any U.S. Embassy
   advice given to official employees. Consular Information Sheets
   generally do not include advice, but present information in a factual
   manner so the traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning
   travel to a particular country.

   If you are looking for information on any of the U.S. territories and
   possessions, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam or
   American Samoa, you can go to the CIA Factbook.

     Select a letter for the country about which you'd like information.
