   New CMC Claims Submission on the Internet

   Submitters who are currently using the TelePoint (dial-up) system can
   access the Web site and start submitting their claims, view
   submissions, acquire Claim Control Numbers (CCNs) and verify receipt of
   transmissions all on the Internet. For detailed instructions about how
   to use these features, see below.

   Instructions for CMC Submission.

   If you have any questions regarding the instructions below, please call
   the CMC help desk at 916-636-1100.

   Submission Instructions
     * Select either the "Transaction Services" or "Login" link from the
       Medi-Cal home page.
     * Enter your submitter ID and password. Your submitter ID must be
       prefixed with CMCSUB, and the password is the same password you use
       for CMC dial-up access. Press "Submit".
     * The "Transaction Services" menu will appear. You may select either
       "CMC Uploads" or "Perform Computer Media Claims Data Uploads".
     * You can either enter the location and name of the file that you
       want to send or click "Browse" to locate the file on your PC or
       Network that you want to send.
     * Once you have located the file, click "Upload File". (Note: It is
       recommended that you zip files prior to uploading so that upload
       times are reduced.) The maximum file size for all files regardless
       of whether or not they are zipped is 2 megabytes.
     * After a few moments, depending on the size of the file, a
       confirmation page will appear. If the upload was successful, a
       "Volser Number" will be displayed which may be used to check the
       status of your transmission. Volser detail may not be available for
       up to 24 hours after the submission is uploaded, and details are
       available for approximately 30 days.

   CMC Submission Inquiry on the Internet

   The new "CMC Submission Inquiry" link on the Medi-Cal Web site offers
   submitters the option to check CMC submission status. Submitters can
   check to see if their batch was deleted, had a partial release or full
   release. For those batches that are not released, information will be
   available regarding batch errors, as well as how many provider numbers
   and/or claims were impacted. For the released batches, submitters will
   be given the range of Claim Control Numbers (CCN) assigned to each
   provider in the batch. These CCNs will assist providers attempting to
   check the status of their individual claims. For detailed instructions
   about how to use these features, see below.
