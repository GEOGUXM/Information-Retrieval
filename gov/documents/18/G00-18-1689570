   SATELLITE TOWN MEETING.... a live, interactive television program about
                    what works in schools and communities

   Get plugged into the good news about education....

   The Satellite Town Meeting is the U.S. Department of Education's
   monthly television program about improvements in teaching and learning
   that are happening in schools and communities across the nation. On
   each show, the Secretary of Education invites national experts as well
   as local educators and community leaders to share their ideas about how
   schools are preparing all students for the challenges of the 21st
   century.

   In panel discussions with parents, teachers, principals and business
   experts, as well as videotaped reports on innovative schools, viewer
   call-ins, and special segments on resources, the Satellite Town Meeting
   focuses on what works.

   The program is broadcast live on the third Tuesday of each month during
   the school year, from 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern. The Secretary and his
   guests talk about the most important issues facing today's schools and
   communities - improving reading skills, expanding technology, boosting
   student achievement, assuring safety, serving children with
   disabilities, raising mathematics performance, and more.

   communities taking part in the program each month via satellite.... Or
