                      Long Valley Caldera Response Plan

                              [redrule_480.gif]

   The U.S. Geological Survey response plan for volcanic unrest in the
   Long Valley area is designed to improve communication about significant
   scientific information derived from monitoring measurements to local,
   state, and Federal civil authorities. The table shows a graded measure
   of the U.S. Geological Survey's concern about the possibility that a
   given level of unrest might threaten local communities with a volcanic
   eruption from within Long Valley caldera or along the Mono-Inyo Craters
   volcanic chain (it does not apply to regional earthquakes occurring in
   the tectonic regime outside the caldera or away from the Mono-Inyo
   Craters volcanic chain). This ranking offers civil authorities a
   framework they can use to gauge and coordinate their response to a
   developing seismic or volcanic crisis. Effective communication and
   coordination with emergency management officials are particularly
   important because the USGS has neither the authority nor the expertise
   to make decisions regarding the civil response to an evolving crisis.

   The 4-level color-coded notification system below was developed in 1997
   to replace a 5-level system devised in 1991 (see reference below).

                    UNREST LEVELS AND NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

   Geologic behavior

                                  Condition

   USGS Response

   Typical behavior since 1980 includes:

   Background: as many as 10 to 20 small earthquakes with magnitudes (M)
   less than 3 (M<3) per day and uplift of the resurgent dome at an
   average rate of about 1 inch per year.

   Weak unrest (likely to occur several times a year): For example
   increased number and (or) strength of small earthquakes or a single
   felt (magnitude M>3) earthquake.

   Minor unrest (likely to occur a few times a year): For example, a swarm
   with several M>3 earthquakes.

   Moderate unrest (likely to occur about once a year): For example a M>4
   earthquake or more than 300 total earthquakes in a day.

                                    GREEN

                              No immediate risk

   ROUTINE MONITORING plus

   Information Calls to USGS personnel, Town, County, and State
   (California OES, State Geologist) and local Federal agencies (USFS,
   BLM) regarding locally felt earthquakes and notable changes in other
   monitored parameters such as ground deformation, fumarole activity, and
   gas emissions.

   Intense Unrest (may occur about once per decade): For example, a swarm
   with at least one magnitude 5 earthquake and (or) evidence of magma
   movement at depth as indicated by an increased rate in ground
   deformation.

                                   YELLOW

                                    WATCH

   INTENSIFIED MONITORING: Set up emergency field headquarters at Long
   Valley caldera. Initial WATCH message sent by USGS to California OES,
   which promptly informs local authorities. (Includes above information
   calls)

   ERUPTION LIKELY within hours or days (may occur every few hundred
   years): Strong evidence of magma movement at shallow depth

                                   ORANGE

                                   WARNING

   GEOLOGIC HAZARD WARNING issued by USGS to Governors of California and
   Nevada and others who inform the public. (includes WATCH response)

   ERUPTION UNDERWAY (may occur every few hundred years)

                                     RED

                                    ALERT

   SUSTAINED ON-SITE MONITORING AND COMMUNICATION. Maintain intensive
   monitoring and continuously keep civil authorities informed on progress
   of eruption and likely future developments.

    Notes:

   CONDITION
   A given condition is keyed to successively more intense levels of
   geologic unrest detected by the monitoring networks. It is based on
   results from the geophysical monitoring networks operated in the region
   since 1980 and on premonitory activity observed before volcanic
   eruptions elsewhere in the world. They are derived from specific status
   tables for each monitoring network (see Open File Report 91-270).

   USGS RESPONSE
   The USGS response for a given condition includes the responses
   specified for all lower levels.

   ESTIMATED RECURRENCE
   Intervals for a given condition are based on the recurrence of unrest
   episodes in Long Valley caldera since 1980, the record of magnitude 4
   or greater earthquakes in the region since the 1930's , and the
   geologic record of volcanic eruptions in the region over the last
   50,000 years.

   COLOR-CODE YELLOW CONDITION
   During a color-code yellow condition, our response will involve
   establishing an on-site operations center and mobilizing USGS field
   crews for intensified, on-site monitoring.

   EXPIRATION OF WATCH, WARNING, AND ALERT
   The table below shows the length of time (in days) a given condition
   remains in effect AFTER the level of unrest drops below the threshold
   that initially triggered the condition.

   CONDITION

                               EXPIRES AFTER

                                            SUBSEQUENT CONDITION*

   WATCH

                               14 days

                                            GREEN (no immediate risk)

   WARNING (eruption likely)

                               14 days

                                            WATCH

   ALERT (eruption in progress)

                               1 day

                                            WARNING

   *Determined by the level of unrest at the time the previously
   established condition expires. In the case of the end of an episode of
   eruptive activity (ALERT ), a WARNING will remain in effect for at
   least 14 days, depending on the level of ongoing unrest.
