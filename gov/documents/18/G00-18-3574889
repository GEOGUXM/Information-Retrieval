                                NERSC Network

          The NERSC network consists of a border router
          ernerscgw.nersc.gov which connects multiple internal subnets to
          ESnet via an OC12 (622 Mbps) link. The two major internal
          subnets are the Production Subnet which includes most of the
          NERSC production machines and the PDSF Subnet which contains the
          PDSF Linux cluster. Each subnet consists of a high speed layer 2
          switch which connects to the border router via gigabit ethernet
          and supports 10/100/1000 Mbps fiber and copper ethernet.

   Traffic Statistics
          Network traffic statistics are collected every five minutes and
          can be displayed for each border router interface in daily,
          weekly, monthly and yearly graphs. Alternatively, a current
          traffic summary consisting of the daily graph for each interface
          can be displayed on one page.

   End-to-end data transfer optimization
          Attempting to move large datasets to/from NERSC and having
          difficulties? NERSC can help! We have expertise in large network
          transfers and are happy to work with clients to improve transfer
          performance. Most machines have not been properly tuned to make
          large transfers across the WAN. With a few simple adjustments
          you could see a 5x improvement. Please contact user services for
          assistance with network tuning for large data transfers.
