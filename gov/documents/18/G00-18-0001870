            SAPHIRE Users Group Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   The purpose of this area is to provide the answers to common questions
    related to the SAPHIRE Users Group and SAPHIRE for Windows software.


   How do I get a copy of the SAPHIRE software? The software (including
   updates to the software), manuals, newsletters, and on-call support are
   part of the membership in the SAPHIRE Users Group which may be obtained
   through us here at Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC. The mission of the SAPHIRE
   Users Group is to provide support and training for SAPHIRE users.
   Who paid for the development of SAPHIRE? The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission is the sponsor of the SAPHIRE software.
   Why are the SAPHIRE Users Group membership costs so low? The price of
   membership in the Users Group covers our direct costs of providing
   support and training material to end users. Since the INEEL is a
   national "cost-recovery" laboratory, we are not permitted to (and do
   not) maintain a "profit margin" on activities associated with the
   SAPHIRE Users Group.
   What are the advantages of joining the SAPHIRE Users Group? There are
   several advantages to joining the Users Group:
    1. Membership provides updates during the length of the contract.
    2. Access to the SAPHIRE 'Members' pages and related information is
       provided.
    3. On-call support from SAPHIRE experts and developers is provided.
    4. Provide feeback for suggested enhancements and bug reporting.

   How do I get a SAPHIRE membership? The specific details can be obtained
   from our Membership Information page.
   What is the difference between IRRAS and SAPHIRE? SAPHIRE is the
   Windows (95, 98, Me, 2000, NT, etc.) version of IRRAS (IRRAS runs only
   under DOS). While both IRRAS and SAPHIRE are designed to solve fault
   trees and event trees and manage the corresponding information, SAPHIRE
   has several new analysis features not included in IRRAS. In addition,
   on the same analysis problem, SAPHIRE generally outperforms IRRAS.
   What training is available for SAPHIRE? Yes, we do teach a "SAPHIRE
   BASICS" course. This class lasts about three days and covers the
   important aspects of using SAPHIRE. For information on the class agenda
   and costs please see our training page.
   What are the PC requirements to run SAPHIRE for Windows? Please see our
   SAPHIRE Info page for technical information on the SAPHIRE software.
   Does IRRAS or SAPHIRE run on a UNIX, Apple, Alpha, etc., machine? Both
   IRRAS and SAPHIRE are designed to run on Intel-based processors (e.g.,
   Pentium, x86 CPU). No native language support is available or planned
   for non-Intel computers. Intel software or hardware emulators for other
   types of computers may be able to run IRRAS or SAPHIRE assuming the
   emulator is a 80386 level or higher (also, Windows 95 or NT emulation
   would be needed to run SAPHIRE for Windows).
   How do I convert my old IRRAS fault trees to SAPHIRE? Upgrading a
   database to SAPHIRE is quite easy. Just copy the IRRAS database
   subdirectory into a new subdirectory. Then, access the copied database
   with SAPHIRE for Windows. Once SAPHIRE sees that the files are from
   IRRAS, it will ask you if you would like to upgrade the files to the
   SAPHIRE format. Say "yes" and the conversion will begin (it generally
   takes a few seconds to complete).
   How do I convert my fault trees developed in my "ABCXYZ" software so
   they will work with SAPHIRE? Both SAPHIRE for Windows and IRRAS have
   the ability to load fault tree information in one of two text format.
   First, the SETS file format is supported. Simply copy the SETS logic
   file into the SAPHIRE project subdirectory and then load the file via
   the "Utility, Load and Extract" option. Second, the native text
   input-output of IRRAS and SAPHIRE is a format called MAR-D. Search the
   help file that is built into SAPHIRE for "MAR-D" for more information.
   ANY information that can be put into SAPHIRE or IRRAS can be loaded or
   exported using the MAR-D format.
   How can I incorporate my fault trees/event trees into a document? IRRAS
   can output fault and event trees as HPGL files. These files can be read
   into many different word processing and graphics programs. SAPHIRE for
   Windows can output fault and event trees as "Windows meta-files"
   (.WMF), "Enhanced meta-files" (.EMF), or "Bitmaps" (.BMP). These types
   of graphic files can be read into many different word processing and
   graphics-editing programs.
