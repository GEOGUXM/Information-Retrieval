     Funding Available for Coral Reef Conservation Projects Through the
                    National Fish and Wildlife Foundation

   NOAA is working with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to
   provide funding for coral reef conservation projects. NFWF is accepting
   proposals for projects that build public-private partnerships to reduce
   and prevent degradation of coral reefs and associated reef habitats
   (e.g. seagrass beds, mangroves etc.). Projects may address causes of
   coral reef degradation wherever they occur, from inland areas to
   coastal
   watersheds to the reefs and surrounding marine environment. Proposals
   should support partnerships that provide solutions to specific problems
   to help prevent coral reef degradation through one or more of the
   following activities:
     * Reducing impacts from pollution and sedimentation;
     * Reducing impacts from over-harvesting and other fishing activities;
     * Reducing impacts of tourism and boating;
     * Restoring damaged reefs;
     * Increasing community awareness through education and stewardship
       activities.

   Proposals are due April 3, 2002 (no exceptions). For more information
   and application instructions see
   http://www.nfwf.org/programs/coralreef.htm or contact Michelle Pico.

                                  SYMPOSIUM
                                     ON
     EFFECTS OF FISHING ACTIVITIES ON BENTHIC HABITATS: LINKING GEOLOGY,
                   BIOLOGY, SOCIOECONOMICS, AND MANAGEMENT

   Date and Location:
   November 12-14, 2002
   Tampa, Fla., at Doubletree Westshore Hotel

   Goal:
   To help ensure sustainable fisheries and healthy, diverse ecosystems by
   advancing the
   scientific knowledge available to resource managers to evaluate and
   appropriately
   manage fishing activities that affect benthic habitat.

   Approach:
   The symposium will have one series of sequential sessions. Topical
   elements of the
   program (see http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/bh2002/) will be initiated by
   one or more
   invited papers which have been asked to provide a
   national/international overview,
   followed by a limited number of contributed presentations, and
   extensive poster
   opportunities in separate, but dedicated, non-concurrent sessions.
   Symposium
   publications will include the meeting abstracts, and a post-meeting
   American
   Fisheries Society volume of peer-reviewed papers. We also plan to offer
   local field
   trips and other activities.

   Call For Papers and Abstracts:
   A call for abstracts and papers will be issued December 2001, with date
   of response
   in March 2002. See web site for calendar and instructions to authors.
   The symposium
   will try to accommodate all papers either as oral or poster
   presentations. All
   participants will be strongly encouraged to submit a paper based on
   their abstract.
   The papers will be subject to peer-review and, if accepted, will be
   published in a
   special volume by the American Fisheries Society. Details to be posted
   at the Web
   site as they are developed.

   Anticipated Participants:
   Marine, estuarine, and large lake biologists, geologists, and
   economists studying the
   effects of fishing and associated science; fishery managers
   representing state,
   federal, tribal, and international entities; commercial and
   recreational fishing
   representatives; and environmental groups are invited.

   Sponsors include:
   American Fisheries Society, Ecological Society of America, NOAA's
   National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA Undersea Research Program,
   NOAA's National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science, National Sea
   Grant Program, NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management,
   and U.S. Geological Survey.

   If you would like to be added to the symposium mailing list and receive
   additional
   conference information as it becomes available, please send your
   mailing address
   along with an indication of interest in attending or contributing a
   paper to the
   symposium to: lori@esa.org.
