                             Infrared Radiometry

                                [3dline.gif]

     [why.gif] The world around us is glowing in the infrared. Gases and
     clouds in the atmosphere, the ocean, and nearly everything else
     around us emits infrared radiation. Infrared radiometers are passive
     sensors that emit no energy of their own, but instead measure the
     "brightness" of the naturally occurring infrared radiation in the
     environment. Spectral, angular, or other variations in this
     brightness can then be used to tell us the amount of atmospheric
     constituents, the physical properties of clouds, or the roughness of
     the ocean surface.

  How does Infrared Radiometry work?

     Planck curves All objects at temperatures above absolute zero
     radiate energy because of molecular and atomic motion. The
     brightness of such "blackbody radiation" depends on temperature and
     electromagnetic wavelength. As temperature increases, blackbody
     radiation moves to shorter wavelengths. For example, at 300 K
     (roughly room temperature) an object radiates maximum energy at a
     wavelength of 10 µm, whereas at 6000 K (such as our sun) an object
     radiates maximum energy at a wavelength near 0.5 µm. Therefore, an
     infrared radiometer operating at wavelengths near 10 µm is good for
     measuring the "brightness temperature" of typical terrestrial
     objects. The brightness temperature is equal to the physical
     temperature for a perfect blackbody (an object with 100%
     absorption), but is less than the physical temperature for an object
     with lower absorption.

  Infrared Spectro-Radiometry

     [ftir1_120.gif] We have developed a multi-channel spectro-radiometer
     for measuring spectra of atmospheric emission. This instrument is
     based on a commercial Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR)
     spectrometer. It measures emission over the frequency range of
     approximately 500 cm^-1 (20-µm wavelength) to 2000 cm^-1 (5-µm
     wavelength) in steps of 1 cm^-1. We are using these emission spectra
     to improve radiative transfer models, to quantify the effect of
     water vapor on climate, and to investigate the radiative properties
     of clouds.

     Our measurements recently resulted in creation of a new model
     (CKD_2.1) for the water vapor continuum in the atmospheric
     transmission window near 10 microns. The new model was created by
     Dr. S.A. Clough of AER, Inc. The improvement made by this model is
     equivalent to the radiative effect of doubling the amount of carbon
     dioxide in the atmosphere. Many atmospheric radiative transfer
     codes, including Lowtran/Modtran, Fascode, and LBLRTM, now use the
     new continuum model. You can find out more about the FTIR instrument
     and the FTIR data.

     Single-Band Infrared Radiometry

     We also use commercial radiometers that measure the radiance
     integrated over a particular spectral band. Typically, these
     radiometers have a filter that limits the spectral band to some
     portion of the 8-12 µm "window," where the atmospheric emission is
     relatively low. Such radiometers are useful for measuring the
     brightness temperature of the atmosphere, of clouds, or of the ocean
     surface. We are experimenting with using these radiometers to
     measure the polarization of emissions from a rough ocean surface,
     which might be useful for measuring sea-surface roughness or for
     determining wind speed and direction.
