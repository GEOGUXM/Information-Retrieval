   Active Contours and Deformable Templates: A Quick Tour
   by Dr. Hemant D. Tagare, Associate Professor, Dept. of Radiology and
   Electrical Engineering, Yale University
   Talk given at NLM on September 21, 2000.

   Abstract

   This is an informal tutorial on medical image segmentation for
   non-specialists. I will review two common techniques used for
   segmenting medical images: active contours and deformable templates.
   Both of these try to evolve a curve or a surface from an initial guess
   to nearby edges (or ridges) in the image. The evolution is usually
   guided by image and shape dependent forces, which are called external
   and internal forces.

   I will introduce the following basic ideas in active contours and
   deformable templates:
     * Design of external forces:
          + Edge-seeking and Ridge-seeking active contours. Gradient
            Estimation. Maximum-likelihood type active contours.
     * Design of internal forces:
          + Smoothness and Shape dependent forces.
     * Bias and stability of active contours.
     * Numerical algorithms for evolution of active contours:
          + B-spline active contours
          + Dynamic Programming
          + Level set/Front Propagation

   I will present examples from my work and the literature.

   Cervical and Lumbar Spine Image Analysis
   by Dr. R. Joe Stanley, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Electrical and
   Computer Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla
   Talk given at NLM on October 6, 2000.

   Abstract

   This research investigates image processing and pattern recognition
   techniques used for anterior osteophyte classification in cervical
   spine x-ray images. The specific objectives for this research are to:
     * investigate histogram-based cervical spine image enhancement
       algorithms
     * evaluate several edge operators for highlighting vertebra
       boundaries
     * examine a B-spline algorithm for approximating vertebra boundaries
       from manually chosen point sets
     * explore radius of curvature-based features for anterior osteophyte
       classification
     * examine four different pattern recognition algorithms for anterior
       osteophyte classification using the radius of curvature-based
       features
     * look at the applicability of the cervical spine image enhancement
       and vertebra boundary determination techniques to lumbar spine
       images
     * propose future directions for cervical spine image analysis, and
     * propose image analysis techniques for lumbar spine images.
