     President Clinton: Strengthening the Federal Government-University
                            Research Partnership

   "More than any other nation in the world, we rely on a partnership
   between our government and our public and private research universities
   to conduct research that improves our economy, health, and national
   security, while also training our future science and technology
   workforce. It is vitally important that this partnership be equitable
   and effective to sustain U.S. leadership across the frontiers of
   scientific knowledge."

   President Bill Clinton

   December 29, 2000

   Research and education lie at the heart of this Administration's
   investment in America's future. That is why President Clinton has
   issued an Executive Order that strengthens the research partnership
   between American universities and the Federal government. The Executive
   Order establishes the principles that will provide the framework for
   the development and analysis of future Federal policies and regulations
   for the government-university research partnership. It also directs the
   Office of Science and Technology Policy to conduct regular reviews of
   the research partnership in full consultation with all stakeholders.

   One of the hallmarks of the U.S. research enterprise is the reliance on
   public and private universities to perform basic research in the
   national interest. Government supported basic research at our nation's
   universities represents a dual investment in the future of the nation:
   helping to assure the health, security, and quality of life of our
   citizens, while also training our future scientific and technical
   workforce. Recognizing the importance of the synergy in this
   relationship and of its continued effectiveness, the President has
   established a set of principles to serve as a sound foundation for this
   partnership.

   For the first time the common goals, rationale and objectives of the
   partnership are set forth. They are incorporated in four guiding
   principles:
     * Research Is an Investment in the Future. Government sponsorship of
       university research not only to conduct research, but also to train
       the next generation of scientists and engineers is an investment in
       the future of the nation, helping to assure the health, security,
       and quality of life of our citizens.
     * The Linkage Between Research and Education Is Vital. The
       integration of research and education is the hallmark and strength
       of our nations universities. The intellectual development and
       scientific contributions of students who participate in
       Federally-sponsored research are among the most important benefits
       of publicly-supported research.
     * Excellence Is Promoted When Investments are Guided by Merit Review.
       A well-designed merit review system rewards quality and
       productivity in research, and can accommodate endeavors that are
       high-risk that have the potential for high pay-off.
     * Research Must Be Conducted with Integrity. The ethical obligations
       entailed in accepting public funds in the conduct of research are
       of the highest order. The credibility of the collective enterprise
       relies on the integrity of each of its participants.

   The following operating principles are intended to assist agencies,
   universities, individual investigators, and auditing and regulatory
   bodies in implementing the guiding principles:
     * Agency Cost Sharing Policies and Practices Must be Transparent.
       Agencies should be clear about their cost sharing policies and
       announce when and how cost sharing will figure in selection
       processes, including explicit information regarding the amount of
       cost sharing expected.
     * Partners Should Respect the Merit Review Process. Excellence in
       science is promoted when all parties adhere to merit review as the
       basis for distributing Federal funds for research projects and
       refrain from seeking Federal funds through non-merit-based means.
     * Agencies and Universities Should Manage Research in a
       Cost-Efficient Manner. The goal of all those involved in
       sponsoring, performing, administering, regulating, and auditing
       university-based research and associated educational activities of
       the research enterprise should be to make maximum resources
       available for the performance of research and education.
     * Accountability and Accounting Are Not the Same. The principal
       measure of accountability must be the research results and whether
       the work was consistent with the original scope of the proposed
       research. Equally important, but different, are sound financial
       accounting methods, which are important to assure research sponsors
       that public funds have been used properly to achieve the goals in a
       cost-effective manner.
     * The Benefits of Simplicity in Policies and Practices Should Be
       Weighed Against the Costs. When it comes to simplicity in
       regulatory, accounting, and administrative practices the goal is to
       maximize the impact of each research dollar spent. Therefore, one
       size doesn't necessarily fit all.
     * Change Should be Justified by Need and the Process Made
       Transparent. The process of change in the government-university
       partnership should be made as transparent as possible.
       Modifications in administrative, regulatory, auditing requirements,
       or in cost sharing expectations, should be kept as infrequent as
       possible but consistent with the need to respond to changing
       circumstances.
