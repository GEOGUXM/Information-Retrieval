     __________________________________________________________________

      1. Does the 1% fee apply to services and hardware?

        A. The 1% fee is a contract access fee, and it applies to all
        products and services ordered from the contract.

      2. Some agencies are directed to use other programs, such as the GSA
      Schedules. How can SDC help with this?

        A. The SDC is doing our best to educate federal agencies on the
        benefits of the 8(a) contracts. We have developed collateral
        material and attended many tradeshows to make the FAST 8(a)
        contracts known. The 8(a) contracts have several advantages over GSA
        Schedules, such as the ability to issue sole source orders, where
        GSA Schedule orders must be competed.

      3. 8(a) credit - is there a uniform process?

        A. Yes, a uniform process has been formalized and policy issued. In
        order for GSA, FTS to give credit to the requesting office, that
        office must supply GSA with their agency bureau code (also called a
        funding code). That code is reported in the Federal Procurement Data
        System (FPDS), and the credit is then transferred to the using
        activity. If the code isn't supplied, then GSA is unable to give
        credit. If a using activity uses the contracts, then they must
        report the order to the FPDS system for credit. Currently, the code
        system (FIPS 95-2) does not give us codes for activities below the
        bureau level, the system is being revamped to get the codes to the
        procurement level, rather than just the bureau level.

        [back to the top]

      4. Many customers are unaware of our contracting vehicles; can
      something be issued to bring attention?

        A. Yes, we are working with various DOD & Civil agencies of Small
        and Disadvantage Business Utilization Offices (OSDBU) and the SBA to
        make their activities aware of the FAST contracts. We have
        participated in many Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization
        tradeshows this year, to bring more attention to the 8(a) contracts.
        Please supply us with any agency names that you run across that are
        unaware of our contracts and we will follow up to with marketing
        material and information.

      5. The FAST program is 3 to 4 years old, what is your acquisition
      strategy?

        A. We do have a strategy and it involves (a) extending the current
        contracts and (b) offering a new contracting action in late
        summer/early fall of this year.

      6. Currently there are 7 labor categories, how do you add additional
      categories and where do they come from?

        A. In accordance with the last contract modification (Sections B.1.1
        and B.2), additional labor categories and hardware/software
        available under this contract is that described and priced on the
        contracts awarded under the GSA Multiple Award Schedules 58 and 70
        and IT schedules that have replaced them for necessary work
        consistent with SIC Code 7373.

        [back to the top]

      7. We have customers interested in doing business under the contracts,
      but the period of performance of their requirements exceeds the
      expiration date of the contract. What do we do?

        A. Orders can be placed under the contract up until the expiration
        of the contract. The duration of the task can exceed the expiration
        date of the contract.

      8. What do we do when we have self-marketed and successfully have an
      agency wanting to do business with our company under your contracts and
      we send them to our regional CSC and the CSC bids the job and we don't
      get
      the award?

        A. Make sure that the client specifies to the CSC that they want to
        use your firm, as a sole source. This is the biggest problem we have
        seen with these contracts, if the agency doesn't specify your firm,
        then the CSC will compete amongst schedule holders, or other
        contract vehicles. It is a good idea to contact the CSC
        representative to let them know you are working on this deal, so
        they are informed of your role. If you have difficulties, we will
        assist where possible

      9. The dollar threshold of self-marketed efforts used to be $3 million
      per contract, now per task?

        A. Yes, modification 2 changed this from per contract to per task
        order award.

        [back to the top]

      10. If you have $3 million on base task order, can you continue to
      issue task orders?

        A. You can have multiple tasks for different requirements. If you
        have a task order that is worth $3 million, it cannot be modified to
        exceed that amount as a sole source.

      11. What does SDC and CSC mean?

        A. SDC stands for Solutions Development Center - SDCs award and
        administer IT contracts, i.e., SDCs develop solutions, for CSCs and
        other government agencies. CSC stands for Client Support Centers.
        CSCs provide direct client interface and support, issue and manage
        task orders against contracts, and deliver (resell) solutions to our
        clients.

      12. Will your radio advertisements profile industry partners?

        A. No, they will be broad SDC announcements. GSA is not allowed
        legally to promote the business of one specific industry partner.

        [back to the top]

      13. Will the industry partner be notified when a sale has been made via
      the SmallBizMall?

        A. Yes, an e-mail will be sent notifying you of a sale.

      14. Will it report to FPDS?

        A. We are working on an integration plan to have the data on sales
        move from the Smallbizmall and report not only to FPDS, but our
        internal systems of ITSS and ITOMS and ultimately to our financial
        system Pegasys.

      15. Is there a mall fee and how much?

        A. There is a transaction based mall fee of 1/2%, which will be
        included by the mall contractor in your unit prices.

        [back to the top]

      16. Is the SmallBizMall CeKa's site or GSA's?

        A. SmallBizMall.gov is the government's portal to our partner's site
        8amall.com, which is where the electronic commerce takes place.

      17. Will there be a credit card fee when used on SmallBizMall?

        A. The credit card fee is a separate issue from all other fees
        involved. The standard credit card fee you have with your credit
        supplier, will be applied whenever the card is accepted.

      18. Can transactions up to $3 million be accomplished on this site?

        A. If the purchaser is not a contracting officer, then they will be
        limited to the spending limit on their credit cards. Once the forms
        are available, the parameters to be considered are the contracting
        officer's warrant authority, funding availability and the $3 million
        order ceiling under the contracts.

        [back to the top]

      19. Are services available through SmallBizMall?

        A. Services will be available when the forms (e.g. GSA Form 300, DD
        Form 1155 and SF 1449) are implemented, on or about mid-summer 2000.

      20. Will you be marketing the SmallBizMall to get customers?

        A. Yes, the SDC has been marketing the site at trade shows,
        conferences, etc. in order to educate the customer. The latest
        initiative was E-Gov on July 10, 2000.

      21. How much is the fee to join the site?

        A. There is no sign up fee to join the site.

        [back to the top]

      22. Will customized solutions be available as well?

        A. Yes, you may offer them via the SmallBizMall.

      23. Can bulk purchases be made on SmallBizMall?

        A. Yes, based on the offerings on the site.

      24. Individual catalogs or one main catalog?

        A. Partners on the site create their own catalog for their
        storefront and those catalogs are combined into a database.

        [back to the top]

      25. Is this information/pricing visible to competitors?

        A. Yes, it's public information.

      26. What is the timeframe from start to finish?

        A. From the time you desire to participate in the mall, the time
        frame is about six weeks, which includes signing partnership
        agreements, training, and catalog development.

      27. Who is SmallBizMall available to?

        A. Only 8(a) FAST contract holders may participate. Ordering
        activities are any and all federal customers.

        [back to the top]

      28. All products are allowed to be listed, no restrictions?

        A. Correct as long as they are information technology related.

      29. What if a company has graduated from the 8(a) program, can they
      still join the mall?

        A. Yes, if a company has a FAST 8(a) contract they can participate
        in the mall for the life of their contract.

      30. What is the fee structure through the CSCs?

        A. The fee structure for the value-added services of the CSCs ranges
        from 2% to 6%.

        [back to the top]

      31. Is the 4% fee for services, a hard fee or is it negotiable?

        A. The value-added fee is negotiable between client and CSCs.

      32. What is the process for competition for a task over $3 million?

        A. Tasks over $3 million must allow each contract holder a fair
        opportunity to compete. The task will be posted to the EPS system
        for review by all contract holders, any firm wishing to propose, may
        do so by responding to all aspects of the RFP.

      33. What happens in the case of sole source task order (under $3
      million),
      where modifications take the task order total over the $3m?

        A. First, make sure to plan wisely up front and to be honest with
        pricing. Should the dollar value extend past the $3 million due to
        unexpected add ons, the Small Business Administration will need to
        be notified and approval granted. The SDC and any CSC used will need
        to be notified as well and all efforts coordinated through them.

        [back to the top]

      34. Regarding the Small Business Catalog that the SDC produces, who do
      we
      send updated information to and can we do so earlier then asked?

        A. Please send your company profile and history as soon as possible.
        Whenever your company information should change, such as address,
        phone, etc., send those changes as they happen. Contact Sharon Henry
        (816-926-7266) or Jean Poppie (816-926-7708) for catalog updates.

        For any other changes or updates to company information, please
        contact one of the following SDC staff members:


   Delta Helm    816-926-1387 delta.helm@gsa.gov
   Lori Burghart 816-823-3369 lorinda.burghart@gsa.gov
   Howard Innis  816-823-4658 howard.innis@gsa.gov

      35. For the orders currently out on the street where the CAF is not
      embedded in
      pricing, do we change?

        A. No, in process orders will not need to be changed. Any orders
        initiated after execution of your mod should reflect the new
        procedure.

      36. What is the process for direct ordering authority?

        A. The recommended process is to use the regional FTS CSC. If this
        option is not desired, then delegation of authority can be granted
        to ordering activities through the SDC, but only by written request.
        All requests should be directed to Delta Helm or Howard Innis, SDC's
        Contracting Officers.

      and is
      there any policing activity to this effect?

        A. There is no policing activity at this time because we trust
        vendors to be
        honest and fair with their pricing. Quoted prices are maximum loaded
        rates, which can be lowered at any time. All other rates must be IAW
        schedule rates and prices.

      39. Can we link our homepage to the Smallbizmall?

        A. Yes, Ceka and GSA are providing the portal for your storefronts.
        You can link from the Smallbizmall to your homepage. Each vendor is

        A. Yes, at this time.

      50. Can items on the Mall be packaged as a fixed price solution?

        customer, industry partner and CeKA.
