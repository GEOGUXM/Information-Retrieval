   For Consumers

   Welcome to the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) consumer page.

   Whether you are listening to the radio, watching TV, talking on the
   phone, or using your pager, youre involved in communications. This page
   is devoted to giving you, the consumer, easily accessible information
   about the ever-changing telecommunications marketplace in which we
   live.

   to see how we refer to things here at the FCC. If you have a question
   about a particular subject, see our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
   section that was developed from the comments of consumers like you who
   have called our Consumer Centers for assistance.

   If you havent found exactly what you want, then you may find your
   answer in one of the documents in our Fact Sheet Directory, where weve
   divided our information by subject matter, such as telephone,
   satellite, radio and the Internet. Still want more information, then
