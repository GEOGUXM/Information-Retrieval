              THE CENTURY IN SOUND: AN AMERICAN’S PERSPECTIVE

                      The Century In Sound (RealAudio)

   PART I INTRO:

   Welcome to the VOA’s Century in Sound: An American’s Perspective. I’m
   Adam Phillips. We human beings are a talkative, exuberant, often
   maddening bunch. We like to be noticed by our peers and leave our mark
   for future generations. For thousands of years, we’ve had writing,
   painting and other ways to record our thoughts and feelings. But until
   recently, the sounds we made were lost forever as soon as they were
   heard. All that changed with the invention of sound recording. The
   20^th century was unique in the way it enabled us to preserve the
   music, the historic speeches, the breaking news and the feel of
   everyday life through its sounds.

   What you are about to hear is a montage of the sounds we made during
   this dramatic, extremely noisy century according to my own limited
   perspective. There is no narration in the program and only one
   interruption for news. You will notice some threads and common themes
   in this montage. You will also hear some meanderings, and apparent
   detours. If at times, you find yourself wondering where you are, what
   time it is, and what all the sounds and voices mean, don’t worry. The
   20th century itself was a lot like that too. And now, part one of VOA’s
   Century in Sound: An American’s Perspective.
