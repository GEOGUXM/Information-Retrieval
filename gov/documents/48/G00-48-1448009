     The Joint Genome Institute's completion of sequencing and comparative
     analysis of mouse DNA related to human chromosome 19 was published
     today in the journal Science. The JGI team's analysis permitted more
     than 1200 HSA19 genes to be verified or defined and revealed clues to
     the evolutionary history of this gene-rich human chromosome. This first
     chromosome-wide comparative sequencing study also provides a preview of
     how the whole mouse genome sequence will aid in discovery of genes and
     other functional DNA sequences throughout all 23 sets of human
     chromosomes. HSA19/mouse Home

     Joint Genome Institute Gives TempliPhi the Thumbs Up. The US Department
     of Energys Joint Genome Institute has changed its DNA template
     preparation procedure to a method using Amersham Pharmacia Biotechs
     TempliPhi DNA amplification kit, the company said Friday.

     The Joint Genome Institute's Walnut Creek facility has been given a new
     name. The name change - to the Production Genomics Facility from the
     Production Sequencing Facility - reflects a shift in focus and its
     changing scientific environment, according to JGI Director Trevor
     Hawkins.

     "The Human Genome" Nature, "Initial sequencing and analysis of the
     human genome", pp.860-921. The human genome holds an extraordinary
     trove of information about human development, physiology, medicine and
     evolution. Here we report the results of an international collaboration
     to produce and make freely available a draft sequence of the human
     genome. We also present an initial analysis of the data, describing
     some of the insights that can be gleaned from the sequence. Human

     Microbial Marathon at Joint Genome Institute: Fifteen Organisms
     Sequenced in One Month. During the month of October, high-quality draft
     sequences of 15 bacterial genomes were produced at the U.S. Department
     of Energy's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in Walnut Creek, California --
     a rate of better than one genome for every one and a half working days.

     Consortium to Sequence Fugu Fish: Potential Boon for Gene Hunters.
     Scientists searching human genome for genes, and the DNA sequences that
     control their activity, will soon have a valuable new resource courtesy
     of the Japanese delicacy, Fugu. An international consortium led by
     researchers at the Joint Genome Institute of the US Department of
     Energy has announced a collaborative agreement to sequence the Fugu
     genome... Fugu Genome Home

     Microbial Month at JGI (Currents Magazine). The Department of Energy's
     Joint Genome Institute (JGI) launched its first "Microbial Month,"
     aimed at turning out high-quality draft sequences of fifteen different
     bacterial genomes before month's end.

     Rough Draft of Three Chromosomes Completed (Science Now) The Human
     Genome Project, the publicly funded international effort to determine
     the precise makeup of the human genetic code, has taken another leap
     forward. Yesterday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced that
     researchers have produced so-called rough drafts of chromosomes 5, 16,
     and 19. "We're close to completing three chapters on the book of human
     life," Richardson said ...
