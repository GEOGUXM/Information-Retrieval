                  DISTRICT COURT FAX NOTICING NOW AVAILABLE

     Civil/Criminal noticeable documents can be sent to you by facsimile
                     transmission. This is how it works;

   Attorneys who choose to participate authorize the Clerk of court to fax
   copies of order, judgments and notices entered in civil and criminal
   cases directly to the firm's fax number in lieu of mailing a copy of
   the document. If the document cannot be transmitted due to equipment
   failures or busy conditions, the document will be automatically printed
   and mailed to you with a note describing the reason for the fax
   failure. We encourage you to participate in this service to provide you
   the benefit of immediate notification. To authorize this service, read
   and complete the form below. We anticipate starting this program
