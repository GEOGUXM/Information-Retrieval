   intial order November 15, 2001, on the last of the 14 checklist items
   that Qwest must pass to receive legal authority to provide

   telecommunications services - The new WUTC rule will require any
   telecom company to notify customers at least 30 days in advance if it
   intends to stop providing any telecommunications service. This rule

   keep their existing 509 area code, but all local calls would have to be
   dialed with the area code and phone number.
