   About ACF

   The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is responsible for
   Federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of
   families, children, individuals, and communities. ACF oversees and
   finances a broad range of activities in partnership with state, local
   and tribal governmental agencies. These agencies provide direct
   services and assistance to children, youth, families, persons with
   developmental disabilities, refugees, migrants, Native Americans,
   legalized aliens, and others eligible to receive help under ACF
   legislative authorities.

   ACF also conducts research, collects and analyzes data, prepares budget
   documents and reports to Congress, issues regulations and policy
   materials, publishes various technical assistance reports, and develops
   the Annual Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Plan.
