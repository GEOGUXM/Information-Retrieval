      Government's fast track to the latest services and products industry
      has to offer.

      FAST, Federal Administrative Services Team was formed by the U.S.
      Treasury Department under the Franchise Business Activities Initiative
      to save government agencies like yours both time and money. Previously
      known as FBAE /Franchise Business Activities East, "FAST" is a
      competitive, fully reimbursable, fee-for-service organization that
      provides timely, competitively priced products and services to both the
      U.S. Department of the Treasury and outside agencies. Federal agencies
      who opt to purchase common administrative products and services from
      FAST benefit from lower costs, higher quality, and the easiest, and
      fastest procurement vehicle available.

      What is Franchising?
      Franchising is an Entrepreneurial Government Enterprise that provides
      common administrative support services, on a competitive and cost
      reimbursable basis, within a framework of standards and legal
      authorities for rendering the service(s) and accounting for
      expenditures and charges.
