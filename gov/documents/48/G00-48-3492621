   photo by University of Alaska Every eleven years the Sun reaches a
   period of maximum surface activity, known as the solar maximum. During
   this period, the Sun produces the greatest number of sun spots and
   associated phenomena, and generates intense "space weather". Very large
   solar flares and coronal mass ejections erupt from the Sun during the
   solar maximum, ejecting clouds of energetic debris toward Earth. When
   this material slams into our planet's upper atmosphere geomagnetic
   storms are created. The result of this solar activity can include
   potential hazards such as disruption of electronic communications and
   electrical power transmission. On the brighter side, a geomagnetic
   storm can trigger aurora borealis, or "Northern Light" displays, that
   might be visible in Maryland if the storm is strong enough. During
   periods of maximum solar activity, Marylanders have a better chance of
   viewing these spectacular light shows.

   Sun experienced a solar maximum. Solar activity is still vigorous,
   producing many strong geomagnetic storms. In October and November of
   2001 several coronal mass ejections occurred, creating auroral displays
   visible in Maryland. If you missed these events, you can see photos
   from October 2001 and November 2001 at Spaceweather.com. There will
   most likely be more auroral displays visible in Maryland before the
   solar cycle tapers off to it's minimum in 2006. If you are in an area
   that is relatively dark at night (away from urban night light), look to
   the north. You might see the shimmering sheets, curtains and spires of
   multicolored, ionized gasses known as the Northern Lights. There are a
   number of web sites devoted to predicting the space weather and auroral
   activity, that can alert you to potential displays.
