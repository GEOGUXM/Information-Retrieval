  Getting to the Lab. of Experimental and Computational Biology in Bethesda or
                                Frederick (LECB)

    Formerly the Laboratory of Mathematical Biology (LMMB)

   The Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology is located in
   serveral research campuses of NIH located in Maryland. These include
   the Frederick and Bethesda campuses. To get to any of the three from
   Washington without a car, take the Metro subway to the main NIH campus
   in Bethesda. (Click here for an aerial photo of the NIH campus).

     * DC to BETHESDA: To get to the NIH Bethesda Campus from Washington
       D.C., you can use the Metro to get to the NIH campus by taking the
       Red Line to Shady Grove (i.e. north) and getting off at the Medical
       Center stop.
     * NIH SHUTTLE: To get to the Frederick Campus from Bethesda, walk
       across the NIH campus to building 31 and take the FCRDC/NIH DAILY
       SHUTTLE SERVICE to get to the Frederick campus. Here is a local map
       of FCRDC.
     * DRIVING: to get to the Frederick Campus driving from Bethesda, take
       Rt 270 North toward Frederick. This turns into Rt. 15 North.
       Alternative, from Baltimore take Rt. 70 West until Frederick where
       you then take Rt. 15 North. Take the 7th Street Exit. Turn right on
       7th street and follow it until it dead ends at Ft. Detrick. Then
       turn left onto Porter Street and continue until the large parking
       lot at the corner of Porter Street and Newmen Street. Park here.
       Then walk down Newmen Street to the intersection with Miller Drive.
       Take a left and Bld 469 is on your right. Here is a area map of
       Washington-Baltimore showing the main highways to Frederick. Here
       is a local campus map of FCRDC.
