   ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES I. REGISTRATION FOR THE ELECTRONIC FILING
   SYSTEM A. Passwords. Each attorney admitted to practice in this Court
   shall be entitled to one System password to permit the attorney to
   participate in the electronic retrieval and filing of documents in
   accordance with the System. Registration for a password is governed by
   paragraph I.B. B. Registration. 1. A registration form, in the form
   attached, shall be submitted for each attorney. A duplicate copy of the
   attached form may be used. 2. All registration forms shall be mailed or
   delivered to the Office of the Clerk, United States Bankruptcy Court,
   Southern District of New York, One Bowling Green, New York, New York
   10004-1408, Attn: Electronic Case Filing System Registration. 3. Each
   attorney registering for the System will receive an envelope, clearly
   marked "Personal and Confidential," and containing the attorney's
   assigned System password from the Office of the Clerk. Any attorney may
   -1- request an alternative means for receiving a password by
   telephoning the Office of the Clerk to arrange for retrieval of the
   attorney's password. 4. Attorneys may find it desirable to change their
   Court assigned passwords periodically. Attorneys may modify their
   password or other account information such as name and address by using
   the Account Maintenance option from the Utilities menu once they are
   logged into the System. II. ELECTRONIC FILING AND SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS
   A. Filing. 1. Except as expressly provided in paragraph III, below, all
   motions, pleadings, memoranda of law, or other documents required to be
   filed with the Court in connection with a case shall be electronically
   filed on the System. 2. All documents that form part of the motion or
   pleading and which are being filed at the same time and by the same
   party may be electronically filed together under one docket number,
   e.g., the motion and a supporting affidavit, with the exception of a
   memorandum of law. A memorandum of -2- law must be filed separately and
   shown as a related document to the motion. 3. Persons filing documents
   that reference exhibits not prepared in electronically produced text
   shall scan and electronically file only excerpts of the exhibits that
   are directly germane to the matter under consideration by the Court.
   Such exhibits must be clearly and prominently identified as excerpts,
   and the complete exhibit must be made available forthwith to counsel
   and the Court on request (and must be available in the Courtroom at any
   hearing pertaining to the matter). Persons filing excerpts of the
   exhibits pursuant to these Revised Electronic Filing Procedures do so
   without prejudice to their right to file additional excerpts or the
   complete exhibit with the Court at any time. Opposing parties may file
   additional excerpts if they believe that they are germane. 4. Title of
   Docket Entries. The person electronically filing a document is
   responsible for designating a title for the document using one of the
   main -3- categories provided in the system, e.g., motion, application,
   etc. 5. Fees Payable to the Clerk. An application for authorization to
   pay filing fees by credit card may be made with the financial officer
   of the Office of the Clerk. B. Service. 1. General Rule: Except as
   otherwise provided in the next paragraph, all documents required to be
   served shall be served in paper (i.e., "hard copy") form in the manner
   mandated by the applicable law and rules. 2. Consent to Electronic
   Service: Whenever service is required to be made on a person who has
   requested, or is deemed to have requested, electronic notice in

   by serving the "Notice of Electronic Filing" generated by the System by
   hand, facsimile or e-mail in the first instance, or by overnight mail
   if service by hand, facsimile or e-mail service is impracticable. 3.
   Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, -4- conventional service of
   documents in hard copy shall be required in the following
   circumstances: (a) Service is required to be made in accordance with
   FRCP 4, FRCP 45, FRBP 7004 or FRBP 9016. (b) The FRBP, LRBP or an order
   of the Court requires delivery or service upon an agency of the United

   The attorneys for the debtor, or the debtor pro se, shall upon the
   commencement of a case, serve the petition, schedules and statement of
   affairs on the United States Trustee and the trustee assigned to the
   case. 4. Orders. All signed orders (including, without limitation,
   orders to show cause) shall be filed electronic- ally by the Court. To
   facilitate the review, execution and filing of a proposed order, the
   person presenting the proposed order shall provide the presiding judge
   with a 3.5 inch floppy disk containing the proposed order in word
   processing (not PDF) format, together with any document to be
   electronically -5- filed in connection therewith. The presiding judge
   shall also be provided with a hard copy of all such documents. C.

   pleading or other document. Additionally, the electronically filed
   document shall indicate an "electronic signature," e.g., "s/Jane Doe".

   affidavits, stipulations and other documents which must contain

   electronically and bear "electronic signatures." The hard copy of the
   originally executed document shall be maintained by the filer for the

   case or proceeding to which the document relates. III. DOCUMENTS FILED
