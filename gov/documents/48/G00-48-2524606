   This sequence of chlorophyll-a concentration (mg/m**3) images from the
   Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) show the manifestation
   of the Tropical Pacific 1997-1998 El-Nino/La-Nina effects on the
   spatial and temporal distribution of surface chlorophyll-a. These
   changes are attributed to the Tropical Pacific dynamic variability,
   such as wind-driven upwelling, advective processes, and wave
   propagation. The frames in this movie are 8-day SeaWiFS composites. The
   first frame is centered on October 3, 1997, and the last frame is
   centered on June 20, 1998.
