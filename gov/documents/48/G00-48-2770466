                               VERTICAL DATUM

   Sea Level--In this report, "sea level" refers to the National Geodetic
   Vertical Datum of 1929--a geodetic datum derived from tha general
   adjustment of the first-order level nets of both the United States and
   Canada, formerly called "Sea Level Datum of 1929."

                                  ABSTRACT

   Ground-water conditions in Georgia during 1999 and for the period of
   record were evaluated using data from U.S. Geological Survey
   ground-water-level and ground-water-quality monitoring networks. Data
   for 1999 included in this report are from continuous water-level
   records from 130 wells and chloride analyses from 14 wells. Data from
   one well is incomplete because data collection was discontinued.

   Chloride concentration in water from the Upper Floridan aquifer in most
   of coastal Georgia was within drinking-water standards established by
   the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency. In the Savannah area, chloride concentration has not
   changed appreciably with time. However, chloride concentration in water
   from some wells that tap the Floridan aquifer system in the Brunswick
   area exceeds the drinking-water standards.

                                INTRODUCTION

   Ground-water-level and ground-water-quality data are essential for
   water assessment and management. Ground-water-level fluctuations and
   trends can be used to estimate changes in aquifer storage resulting
   from the effects of ground-water withdrawal and recharge from
   precipitation. These data can be used to address water-management needs
   and to evaluate the effects of management and conservation programs.

   As part of the ground-water investigations conducted by the U.S.
   Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the State of Georgia and
   city and county governments, a Statewide water-level-measurement
   program was started in 1938. Initially, this program consisted of an
   observation-well network in the coastal area of Georgia to monitor
   variations in ground-water storage and quality. Additional wells were
   later included in areas where data could be used to aid in water
   resources development and management.

   During 1999, periodic water-level measurements were made in 46 wells,
   and continuous water-level measurements were obtained from 165 wells.
   Continuous water-level records were obtained using analog (pen and
   chart) recorders and electronic data recorders that record the water
   level at 60-minute intervals. For wells having incomplete water-level
   record, water levels during periods of missing record may have been
   higher or lower than recorded water levels. Water samples collected
   from 85 wells during May, June, July, August, September, October,
   November, and December 1999 were analyzed to determine chloride
   concentration in the Savannah and Brunswick areas.

   Purpose and Scope

   This report presents selected ground-water-level and
   ground-water-quality data for Georgia for calendar year 1999 and for
   the period of record. Graphs showing ground-water levels in 130 wells
   are presented. Graphs show chloride concentrations in water collected
   from 14 wells tapping the Floridan aquifer system in the Savannah and
   Brunswick areas. The text includes a brief discussion of the aquifers
   and aquifer systems, ground-water levels, and chloride concentration in
   water. An extensive list of references of water-resources
   investigations are presented in "Selected References;" previously
   published reports on Georgia ground-water conditions are listed in
   table 1.

   Georgia Well-Identification Numbering System

   Wells described in this report are given an identification number
   according to a system based on the USGS index of topographic maps of
   Georgia. Each 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle in the State has been
   assigned a three to four-digit number and letter designation (example,
   07H, 11AA) beginning at the southwestern corner of the State. Numbers
   increase sequentially eastward and letters advance alphabetically
   northward. Quadrangles in the northern part of the State are designated
   by double letters; AA follows Z, and so forth. The letters "I", "O",
   "II", and "OO" are not used. Wells inventoried in each quadrangle are
   numbered consecutively, beginning with 01. Thus, the fourth well
   inventoried in the 11AA quadrangle is designated 11AA04.

   Hydrologic Unit Codes

   The hydrologic unit is a geographic area representing part or all of a
   surface drainage basin or distinct hydrologic feature as delineated by
   the USGS, Office of Water Data Coordination, on state hydrologic unit
   maps; each hydrologic unit is identified by an 8-digit number.

                                                                      Next
