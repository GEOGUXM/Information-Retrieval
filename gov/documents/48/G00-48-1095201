     LIST OF QUESTIONS

     What are 'shadow bands'?

     These are among the most ephemeral phenomena that observers see
     during the few minutes before a total solar eclipse. They appear as
     a multitude of faint bands that can be seen by placing a white sheet
     of paper several feet square on the ground.They look like ripples of
     sunshine at the bottom of a pool, and their visibility varies from
     eclipse to eclipse. 19th century observers interpreted them as
     interference fringes caused by some kind of diffraction phenomenon.
     The Sun, however, is hardly a 'point source' and the patterns are
     more random than you might expect from diffraction effects.

     The simplist explanation is that they arise from atmospheric
     turbulence. When light rays pass through eddies in the atmosphere,
     they get refracted. Unresolved distant sources simply 'twinkle', but
     for nearby large objects, the incoming light can get split into
     interfering bundles that recombine on the ground to give mottled
     patterns of light and dark bands, or portions of bands. Near
     totality, the image of the sun is only a thin crescent a few arc
     seconds wide, which is about the same size as the atmospheric eddies
     as seen from the ground. Bands are produced because the sun's image
     is longer in one direction than another. The bands move, not at the
     rate you would expect for the eclipse but at a speed determined by
     the motion of the atmospheric eddies.

How long will we continue to be able to see total eclipses of the Sun?

     The Earth-Moon system is unique in the solar system, because only
     for this system at the present time, does the angular size of the
     Moon match the angular size of the sun as seen from the surface of
     the Earth. This means that sometime during its orbit, the Moon can
     exactly cover the Sun, causing an observer to be thrown into an eery
     night time in the middle of the day!

     But, the orbit of the Moon is not stable. Because of tidal friction,
     the orbit of the Moon is steadily growing larger, so that the
     angular size of the Moon from the Earth is growing smaller. When we
     get to the point where the Moon only covers 98 percent of the Sun's
     disk, enough of the Sun will still be visible at totality, that you
     will not experience night time during a total eclipse.

     The Sun has a diameter of 870,000 miles. At the present time, the
     Sun's angular diameter varies from 32.7 minutes of arc when the
     Earth is at its farthest point in its orbit (aphelion), and 31.6 arc
     minutes when it is at its closest (perihelion). The Moon on the
     other hand has a diameter of 3,476 kilometers, and varies in
     distance between 356,000 (perigee) and 406,000 kilometers (apogee).
     This means its angular size changes from 33.5 to 29.43 arc minutes.
     So, there is plenty of opportunity for the angular sizes of the Moon
     and Sun to be equal for a total eclipse.

     But, the Moon's orbit is increasing by about a centimeter per year,
     so that when the Moon drifts about 20,200 kilometers further out
     from the Earth, the Moon will be so far away even at perigee, that
     its disk will be smaller than the Sun's disk even at perihelion. At
     a generous speed of 2 centimeters per year, it will take about 1
     billion years for the last total eclipse to occur. A complicating
     factor is that the size of the Sun itself will grow slightly during
     this time, which will act to make the time of 'no more total
     eclipses' a bit earlier than 1 billion years hence.

     What happens more often, solar or lunar eclipses?

     According to Fred Whipple's book 'Earth, Moon and Planets', page
     102-104, Solar eclipses are fairly numerous, about 2 - 5 per year,
     but the area on the ground covered by totality is only a few miles
     wide. In any given location on Earth, a total eclipse happens only
     once every 360 years. Eclipses of the Moon by the Earth's shadow are
     actually less numerous than solar eclipses; however, each eclipse
     covers about 1/2 the surface of the Earth. At any given location,
     you can have up to 3 lunar eclipses per year, but some years there
     may be none. In any one calendar year, the maximum number of
     eclipses is 4 solar and 3 lunar.
     __________________________________________________________________

Typically, how big a temperature drop do you get during a total solar
eclipse?

     My guess would be that it would be equal to the typical daytime
     minus nighttime temperature difference at that time of the year and
     location on the Earth. It would be modified a bit by the fact that
     it only lasts a few minutes, which means the environment would not
     have had much time to thermally respond to its lowest temperature,
     so it would probably only be 3/4 or 1/2 the maximum day-night
     temperature difference. Because the patch of the shadow travels
     faster than the speed of sound, weather systems will only be
     affected very locally directly under the instantaneous foot print of
     the eclipse. The main effect is in the 'radiant heating' component
     which goes away suddenly at the moment of eclipse and produces a
     very fast temperature decrease. If the wind is blowing, your body
     probably exaggerates by evaporative cooling, just how large the
     actual temperature swing actually is.

When can I see the next solar eclipse from North America?

     Have a look at the Eclipse Paths page and find the eclipse nearest
     your location. My impression is that there will not be any total
     SOLAR eclipses visible from North America for a good many years. On
     August 21, 2017 there will be one whose track goes from Washingtion
     state, and exits on the east coast near the Carolinas. There will,
     however, be lots of LUNAR eclipses to entertain us!
     __________________________________________________________________

How well are the ground tracks for solar eclipses known in advance of the
event?

     I am not an expert in this area, but the positions of the Sun and
     Moon are known to better than 1 arc second accuracy. This means that
     on the Earth, the location of the track of totality is probably
     known to about (1.0/206265.0) x 2 x pi x 6400 km = 0.19 kilometers
     or a few hundred meters at the Earth's equator.
     __________________________________________________________________

Is there a book that shows the solar eclipse tracks going back a few hundred
years?

     I have found three books that may be helpful if you can find them at
     your library. The research library at the Goddard Space Flight
     Center shows the following books:

     "Atlas of historical eclipse maps for east asia 1500BC to 1900 AD"
     by F.R. Stephenson and M.A. Houlden, (Cambridge University Press)
     1986. This is a book of maps of China showing the eclipse tracks,
     but includes no other geographic locations.

     "Canon of Eclipses" by Theodor Oppolzer, translated by Owen
     Gingerich in 1962. (Dover Books, New York). This book is one long
     table showing where all of the solar eclipses are from 1207 BC to
     2161 AD. You have to look up the month and year, and it gives the
     information you can use to plot the track of totality.

     "Canon of Solar Eclipses" by Jean Meeus and Hermann Mucke,
     (Astronomiches Buro, 1983) Vienna Austria, second edition. I haven't
     had a chance to look at this book yet.

     Other places to look are back issues of Sky and Telescope. There
     have been articles on solar eclipses showing their ground tracks,
     but I don't recall if they go back too far in time. If I come across
     any other references, I will post them in a revised version of this
     response in the future.

     Oh yes, there is a website that shows plots of eclipses. See my
     answer to a previous question for its location.

Do lunar and solar eclipses have any noticeable effect on humans?

     There is no evidence that eclipses have any physical effect on
     humans. However, eclipses have always been capable of producing
     profound psychological effects. For millenia, solar eclipses have
     been interpreted as portents of doom by virtually every known
     civilization. These have stimulated responses that run the gamut
     from human sacrifices to feelings of awe and bewilderment. Although
     there are no direct physical effects involving known forces, the
     consequences of the induced human psychological states have led to
     physical effects.

Why don't eclipses occur every new moon?

     Eclipses only occur if the satellite of a planet is located within
     0.5 degrees of the plane of the Ecliptic, on a line which passes
     through the center of the Sun and the Earth. The Moon travels along
     an orbit which is inclined by 5 degrees to the Ecliptic plane, so
     there are only two opportunities each month when it passes through
     the plane of the Ecliptic...called the ascending and decending
     nodes. These two points connected to the barycenter of the Earth-
     Moon system ( roughly the center of the Earth ) define a 'line of
     nodes', and eclipses of the Sun and Moon will occur if this line of
     nodes coincides with the line drawn between the center of the Earth
     and Sun. Again, the Moon also has to be within 0.5 degrees of one or
     the other of the nodes so that the disk of the Sun is partially or
     totally covered in a solar eclipse. A similar argument explains why
     lunar eclipses do not happen every full moon at the node opposite
     the Sun from the Earth.

How do computers predict eclipses?

     Astronomers first have to work out the orbital mechanics of how the
     Earth and Moon orbit the Sun under the influences of the
     gravitational fields of these three bodies. From Newton's laws of
     motion, they mathematically work out the motions of these bodies in
     three dimensional space, taking into account the fact that these
     bodies have finite size and are not perfect spheres, and that the
     Earth and Moon are not homogeneous bodies. From careful observation,
     they then feed into these complex equations the current positions
     and speeds of the Earth and Moon, and then program the computer to
     'integrate' these equations forward or backward in time to construct
     ephemerides of the relative positions of the Moon and Sun as seen
     from the vantage point of the Earth. Eclipses are specific
     configurations of these bodies which can be identified in the
     computer runs and captured. Current eclipse forecasts are accurate
     to less than a minute in time over a time span of hundreds of years.

When was the last time a lunar or solar eclipse happened on the equinoxes?

     I couldn't find any exact matches, but did find several close calls:

     September 20 1960 partial solar
     September 23 1987 total solar
     September 22 2006 total solar
     September 23 2033 partial solar
     September 19 2043 lunar eclipse
     March 23 1951 lunar eclipse
     March 19 2007 partial solar
     March 20 2015 total solar
     March 25 2024 partial lunar
     March 20 2034 total solar
     __________________________________________________________________

When was the last solar eclipse seen from North America, and when will the
next one happen?

     May 10, 1994 was annular and seen in the United States. The next
     eclipse that can be seen in the United States will be on May 20,
     2012, and will also be annular. Similar eclipses occur 18 years
     apart in the Saros Cycle.
     __________________________________________________________________

Do lunar eclipses only happen at the descending node of the lunar orbit?

     I have not thought about this very much, but there are in principle
     two locations where eclipses can occur. These are the points in the
     lunar orbit that intersect the ecliptic plane where the sun moves in
     the sky. These are called the Ascending Node and the Descending
     Node. The Ascending Node is the one located opposite of the Earth
     from the Sun and it is here that lunar eclipses occur. The
     Descending Node is between the Sun and the Earth and it is here that
     solar eclipses can occur. Because the orbital plane of the Moon, and
     so the so-called line of nodes, rotates once every 18 years, the
     above nodes, can switch places. So, the more complete answer is that
     lunar eclipses can also happen at the Ascending Node.
     __________________________________________________________________

Why do eclipse tracks move eastwards even though the Earth rotates from west
to east?

     Because the Moon moves to the east in its orbit at 3,400 km/hour.
     Earth rotates to the east at 1,670 km/hr at the equator, so the
     lunar shadow moves to the east at 1,730 km/hr near the equator. You
     cannot keep up with the shadow of the eclipse unless you traveled at
     Mach 1.5!
     __________________________________________________________________

When were solar eclipses first predicted accurately?

     The Babylonians knew how to predict lunar eclipses with high
     accuracy, but solar eclipses are far more difficult because the
     'footprint' on the earth is only a few tens of miles across and
     requires arc minute positional accuracy and forecasting for any
     specific locale. Apparently Thales ca 610 BC is credited with
     predicting a solar eclipse using knowledge of a previous eclipse 47
     years before and adding the Saros cycle. He predicted the year, but
     not the month and the day. It wasn't until Ptolemy's time that solar
     eclipse forecasting became more precise and useful.
     __________________________________________________________________

Why don't solar eclipses occur exactly at Noon?

     Because the geometry required for a total solar eclipse has nothing
     to do with local Noon. It has to do with when the lunar shadow
     sweeps across your location during the time when the Sun is above
     the horizon. Even so, it is possible for the Sun to be in full
     eclipse before it rises at your particular location!
