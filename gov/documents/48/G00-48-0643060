                        Information for Small Employers

   While the information on this page applies to all employers, it has
   been specifically designed for small businesses which may not have a
   human resources department or a specialized EEO staff. We realize that
   the information provided here may not answer all of the questions you
   may have. This section of the website is not intended to answer all of
   the sophisticated legal issues that can arise in employment
   discrimination cases. What we do hope is that this page will help you
   answer some of the most common questions that employers encounter. Most
   importantly, we hope to make it easier for you to comply with the
   anti-discrimination laws and help you in your dealings with the EEOC.
