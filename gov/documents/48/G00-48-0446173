   DOT HS 809 086 Traffic Safety Facts 1999 U.S. Department of
   Transportation National Highway Traffic Alcohol Safety Administration
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defines a
   fatal traffic crash as being alcohol-related if either a driver or a
   nonoccupant (e.g., pedestrian) had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
   of 0.01 grams per deciliter (g/dl) or greater in a police-reported
   traffic crash. Persons with a BAC of 0.10 g/dl or greater involved in
   fatal crashes are considered to be intoxicated. This is the legal limit
   of intoxication in most states. Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related
   crashes fell by 1 percent from 1998 to 1999. The 15,786 alcohol-related
   fatalities in 1999 (38 percent of total traffic fatalities for the
   year) represent a 30 percent reduction from the 22,404 alcohol-related
   fatalities reported in 1989 (49 percent of the total). NHTSA estimates
   that alcohol was involved in 38 percent of fatal crashes and in 7
   percent of all crashes in 1999. The 15,786 fatalities in
   alcohol-related crashes during 1999 represent an average of one
   alcohol-related fatality every 33 minutes. An estimated 308,000 persons
   were injured in crashes where police reported that alcohol was present
   - an average of one person injured "There were 15,786 approximately
   every 2 minutes. alcohol-related Approximately 1.4 million drivers were
   arrested in 1998 for driving under fatalities in 1999 - the influence
   of alcohol or narcotics. This is an arrest rate of 1 for every 38
   percent of the 132 licensed drivers in the United States (1999 data not
   yet available). total traffic fatalities About 3 in every 10 Americans
   will be involved in an alcohol-related crash for the year." at some
   time in their lives. In 1999, 30 percent of all traffic fatalities
   occurred in crashes in which at least one driver or nonoccupant had a
   BAC of 0.10 g/dl or greater. Seventy percent of the 12,321 people
   killed in such crashes were themselves intoxicated. The remaining 30
   percent were passengers, nonintoxicated drivers, or nonintoxicated
   nonoccupants. Table 1. Types of Fatalities in Fatal Crashes Involving

   20590 2 Traffic Safety Facts 1999 - Alcohol The rate of alcohol
   involvement in fatal crashes is more than 3 times as high at night as
   during the day (60 percent vs. 17 percent). For all crashes, the
   alcohol involvement rate is more than 5 times as high at night (17
   percent vs. 3 percent). In 1999, 29 percent of all fatal crashes during
   the week were alcohol- related, compared to 51 percent on weekends. For
   all crashes, the alcohol involvement rate was 5 percent during the week
   and 13 percent during the weekend. From 1989 to 1999, intoxication
   rates decreased for drivers of all age groups involved in fatal
   crashes. Drivers over 64 years old experienced the largest decrease in
   intoxication rates (29 percent), followed by drivers 16 to 20 years old
   (30 percent). Figure 1. Intoxicated Drivers in Fatal Crashes by Age
   Group, "From 1989 to 1999, 1989-1999 intoxication rates Percentage of
   Drivers with BAC 0.10 g/dl or Greater decreased for drivers of all age

   1998 1999 The highest intoxication rates in fatal crashes in 1999 were
   recorded for drivers 21-24 years old (27 percent), followed by ages
   25-34 (24 percent) and 35-44 (21 percent). Intoxication rates for
   drivers in fatal crashes in 1999 were highest for motorcycle operators
   (28 percent) and lowest for drivers of large trucks (1 percent). The
   intoxication rate for drivers of light trucks was higher than that for
   passenger car drivers (20 percent and 17 percent, respectively).

   1999 - Alcohol 3 Safety belts were used by only 19 percent of the
   fatally injured intoxicated drivers (BAC of 0.10 g/dl or greater),
   compared to 30 percent of fatally injured impaired drivers (BAC between
   0.01 g/dl and 0.09 g/dl) and 48 percent of fatally injured sober
   drivers. Fatally injured drivers with BAC levels of 0.10 g/dl or
   greater were 6 times as likely to have a prior conviction for driving
   while intoxicated compared to fatally injured sober drivers (12 percent
   and 2 percent, respectively). Figure 2. Previous Driving Records of

   all pedestrians 16 years of age or older killed in traffic crashes in
   1999 were intoxicated. By age group, the percentages ranged from a low
   of 10 percent for pedestrians 65 and over to a high of 50 percent for
   those 35 to 44 years old. The driver, pedestrian, or both were
   intoxicated in 38 percent of all fatal pedestrian crashes in 1999. In
   these crashes, the intoxication rate for pedestrians was more than
   double the rate for drivers - 31 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
   Both the pedestrian and the driver were intoxicated in 5 percent of the
   crashes that resulted in a pedestrian fatality. National Center for

   states and the District of Columbia now have 21-year-old minimum
   drinking age laws. NHTSA estimates that these laws have reduced traffic
   fatalities involving drivers 18 to 20 years old by 13 percent and have
   saved an estimated 19,121 lives since 1975. In 1999, an estimated 901
   lives were saved by minimum drinking age laws. Figure 3. Cumulative
