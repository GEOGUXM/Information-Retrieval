   As of 4/29/1999 Mail Relaying through the site mailserver has been
   disabled.

   What is relaying?

   The general definition is when someone tries to directly route mail
   through a smtp server from a machine not on the same site or network as
   the smtp server to another machine not on the same site or network as
   the smtp server or the originating address. This has become a preferred
   practice for email spammers and email system attackers for hiding their
   tracks.

   Who is Affected?
    1. Users and mailing lists at FNAL that point to offsite addresses
       will NOT be affected when using the alias.
    2. Users that must telnet to a system at the lab to read their mail
       will NOT be affected by this.
    3. Users that use FNAL dialup lines or FNAL provided ISDN lines will
       NOT be affected.
    4. Users that are traveling or Users using ISP's to read mail on lab
       mailservers such as POPGTW, IMAPSERVER1, and IMAPSERVER2, may be
       affected.

   But I need to relay mail

   There are legitimate uses of mail relay at FNAL. People with portable
   machines who travel to other sites and don't want to reconfigure their
   machines and need to stay in contact with others are one.

   We have the ability to accommodate laptop users individually and one
   can contact the helpdesk to arrange for an exemption. This is a manual
   process and we have a service goal of 1 business day to handle these
   requests.

   In the long term, mail relay is expected to be disabled on all machines
   at FNAL and the use of authenticating mail agents the method of
   continuing the legitimate use.

   The interoperability of authenticating SMTP servers and email clients
   is being tested.

   For FNAL to accept mail one of the following must be true:
    1. The message must have a destination address in the "fnal.gov"
       domain, or
    2. The message must originate from a host in the "fnal.gov" domain. By
       this we mean that the host the mail is sent from must be in the
       fnal.gov domain. This is not the same as setting your From: address
       in your e-mail client to user@fnal.gov.

   Problems-

   I can't send mail offsite when using my ISP

   Users should be using the ISP's mailserver to provide e-mail services,
   particularly outgoing email. Users should have fewer problems with
   incoming mail, and should under most circumstances be able to fetch
   mail from the FNAL POP or IMAP servers.

   How to I change my settings?

   If you are having a problem sending mail using smtp.fnal.gov along with
   a private ISP you need to change your SMTP server on your email client.
   Here is how to do it with some of the popular clients.

     * Outlook Express
     * Pine
     * Netscape Messenger
     * Eudora
     * Pegasus
