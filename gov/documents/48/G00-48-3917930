Local Offices for Water Resources

   The USGS manages water information at offices located throughout the
   United States. Although all offices are tied together through a
   Nation-wide computer network, each collects data and conducts studies
   in a particular area. Local information is best found at sites listed
   below. If you can't find the information you want at one site, we
   recommend checking neighboring sites, as study areas sometimes overlap.
   Additional information also can be found under National Programs or
   Headquarters and Regional Offices.
