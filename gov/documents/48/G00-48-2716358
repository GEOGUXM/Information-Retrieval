   HYDRO-RADAR
     __________________________________________________________________

   [HYDRO-RADAR] NOAA/ETL has long operated X-band (3-cm wavelength)
   Doppler radars, such as NOAA/D for studies of storm dynamics, boundary
   layer turbulence, and ocean surface characteristics. Compared to storm
   surveillance radars such as NEXRAD, the X-band radar's small size, low
   power, portability, excellent spatial resolution, and versatile
   scanning capability are advantageous for many applications. However,
   X-band has traditionally been considered to be a poor choice for
   quantitative rainfall measurement because of its strong attenuation by
   rain... until now.

   The recent addition of differential phase (Kdp) capability now allows
   ETL's X-band radar to circumvent the attenuation problem by using
   signal phase rather than amplitude to measure rainfall. The method is
   also superior to traditional reflectivity-based estimates of rain
   intensity in that it avoids problems associated with calibration,
   partial beam filling, partial blockage by terrain, the presence of
   hail, and because it is less affected by variations in drop size
   distribution. Light to moderate rain rates are more readily measured at
   shorter wavelengths, such as X-band, with the differential phase method
   than can be done at longer wavelengths. The radar also measures
   differential reflectivity, ZDR, which further increases the rain rate
   accuracies and allows inferences of particle type. Moreover, ETL is
   implementing automated, remote, unattended operating capabilities for
   this radar. These new features combine to make the ETL X-band research
   radar a very attractive tool for hydrometeorology applications,
   especially for small to moderate size watersheds and in complex
   terrain.

   The radar's differential phase capability has been tested in Colorado
   and Texas. It will be employed at Wallops Island, Virginia, in 2001 for
   rain statistics studies to support of NASA's space-borne Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer. These experiments have shown that the
   X-band differential phase estimates of rain rate and rainfall
   accumulation are applicable for even heavier intensities than
   originally anticipated. For more details see the short conference
   article.
