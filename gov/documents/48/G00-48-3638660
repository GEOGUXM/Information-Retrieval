  [world.gif] Tropospheric ozone production in rural areas

   [bluebar.gif]

   While ozone in the stratosphere has a beneficial role, the ozone close
   to the planet's surface, in the region known as the troposphere,
   displays a destructive side. Because it reacts strongly with other
   molecules, it can severely damage the living tissue of plants and
   animals. It is one of the key pollutants in "smog" that hangs over many
   cities around the world. Measurements have revealed that ozone can
   reach extremely high abundances in rural areas, where crop and forest
   damage are of concern. This phenomenon is being studied by Aeronomy Lab
   scientists, who have shown that volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   emitted from vegetation and human-made sources are interacting with
   nitrogen compounds from power plants and automobile exhaust to produce
   the ozone. The current approach to improving air quality has been to
   control the amounts of human-made VOCs. However, scientists at the
   Aeronomy Laboratory and from other institutions have discovered that in
   some regions of the country, the natural emissions of VOCs are far
   greater than the human-made ones. This may mean that in some cases,
   controls on human-produced nitrogen oxides would be more a more
   effective way to reduce ozone. This important finding is of great
   interest to National, State, and industry policymakers, who are
   considering what approaches will work best to decrease the levels of
   ozone.

   In a major effort to address the needs of the policymaking community,
   scientists at the Aeronomy Laboratory played leading roles in launching
   the NARSTO (North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone)
   program in 1994. This interagency, international program is focusing
   the air quality research in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico so that it
   addresses key policy-relevant questions now faced by the U.S. and its
   neighbors. The Aeronomy Lab worked with scientists from the
   Environmental Protection Agency, universities, industry, other NOAA
   labs, and other national and international organizations to develop the
   program.

               Producing ozone in the troposphere rendition...

   The Puzzle, the Pieces, and Now... the Picture Begins to Emerge. In the
   1960s, with smog increasing in many cities, the United States launched
   an effort to improve air quality and, thereby, the health of its
   citizens. Passed in 1970, the Clean Air Act placed controls on
   human-caused volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, one of the two
   primary ingredients that go into the production of ozone and other
   oxidants in the lower atmosphere. While some cities succeeded in
   "clearing the air," others had a puzzling result: no change. In cities
   like Atlanta, Georgia, of the southeastern U.S., ozone standards were
   frequently being violated. What was going on? In the 1980s, researchers
   from the NOAA Aeronomy Lab and other institutions began to sort out the
   pieces of the puzzle, finding that with regard to ozone production,
   "all cities are not alike." In particular, some regions of the country
   have high natural levels of VOCs, coming from the trees and other
   vegetation of the area. Human activity adds to the amount of VOCs, but
   often is not the dominant contributor. So is high ozone just "natural"
   to these cities, then? Absolutely not-- because of the other ingredient
   that is necessary to make ozone... nitrogen oxides. Natural levels of
   nitrogen oxides are quite low, and so natural ozone production is
   relatively small even in areas with high amounts of natural VOCs. Along
   come humans, with activities such as fuel combustion in cars and power
   plants causing large increases in nitrogen oxides. The largely
   human-produced nitrogen oxides react with the natural and human-made
   VOCs alike, producing the unnaturally high ozone. For scientists and
   policymakers, the picture is becoming clearer and new strategies for
   improving air quality are emerging. Backed by a more complete
   understanding of the science, the path to cleaner air is now coming
   into view for many cities.

   Studying the Fundamentals of Air Quality with the NOAA Aircraft
   Operations Center WP-3D Aircraft. In 1994, the NOAA WP-3D aircraft
   embarked on its first full-blown mission to study the atmospheric
   chemistry related to ozone in the troposphere. No stranger to research,
   the "P-3" has long been used by NOAA scientists to study hurricanes.
   But in the 1994 and subsequent missions, the P-3 has been loaded with a
   full complement of instrumentation for measuring the chemical
   composition of the atmosphere. Put to work in the 1994 and 1995 field
   experiments of the Southern Oxidants Study, the P-3 was used to study
   processes governing the formation of ozone and other oxidants in the
   region surrounding Nashville, Tennessee. The research has yielded
   valuable insights into the mechanisms whereby ozone is produced from
   the interaction of biologically and human-produced volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides from automobiles and power plants.
   The research has also shown that the amount of ozone in cities of the
   southeast U.S. often depends on processes that go far beyond that
   city's borders-- in other words, that excessive ozone is a regional
   problem. Findings like these will form the scientific basis for
   decisions of State and local governments that aim to improve air
   quality.
