   Re: Creditor Mailing Matrix

   We are happy to announce that the 3 column mailing matrix is now
   available to print in PDF labels format on the ecf.utb.uscourts.gov
   PACER site. PACER users who need to access a case mailing matrix will
   locate the matrix report under "reports" in the blue CM/ECF menu bar
   and select "Mailing Matrix by Case."
