   Abstract Submission Instructions
   Abstracts
   An abstract is a concise summary of a paper. It should describe the
   paper and include a statement of the issue, research methods and
   significant findings. Abstracts should be written as one continuous
   paragraph. Footnotes should not be included at the end of an abstract.
   This information should be included in the body of the abstract in
   proper American Physical Society (APS) format. Required disclaimers
   (references to funding agency and contract number) will be included as
   endnotes.

   Abstracts must be submitted by January 15, 2001. Authors who submit
   post-deadline abstracts still have the opportunity to participate in
   the conference and publish abstracts on the web, but their submissions
