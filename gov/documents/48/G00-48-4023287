   Electronic Freedom of Information Act Reading Room

     On October 2, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Electronic
     Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA).

     E-FOIA enables electronic access to federal agency records without a
     formal FOIA request -- unless the records or part of the records are
     protected from disclosure by any of the nine exemptions contained in
     the law.
