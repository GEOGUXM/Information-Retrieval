                          The most recent  ISS - CD
                               was shipped on:
                              November 12, 2001


   Happy computer holding a disk. Please install the new ISS Data CD as
   soon as possible and prior to obtaining any new refresh files.

   The Inspection Selection System (ISS) contains both carrier identifying
   and safety status information on all known Interstate Motor Carriers
   operating in the United States. It's inspection prioritization score is
   based on SafeStat, but also includes carriers with insufficient
   inspection data which are prioritized in order to gain inspections and
   establish their Safety profile. High risk carriers in the PRISM system
   are also identified and prioritized for inspection. SafeStat considers
   a carrier's past crash history, vehicle inspection OOS rate, driver
   history, and safety management.


   ISS Replacement CD -- SafeStat scores are calculated on a quarterly
   basis (4 times/year). This should occur in January, April, July, and
   October, but delays may occur. Based on this run, an ISS replacement CD
   is created which completely replaces the ISS carrier database. The
   replacement CD should be distributed and installed as quickly as
   possible.

   ISS Refresh Subscriptions -- ISS carrier identification and
   insufficient data is refreshed weekly based on ongoing inspections and
   other changes in the master carrier record. These refresh files are by
   individual carrier and are available as a subscription through SAFER.
   Law enforcement personnel desiring a subscription should register with
   SAFER. The ISS software will allow weekly connection into SAFER to
   pickup the subscription updates and then apply them into the ISS
   database. This process should require no more than 10 minutes per week.

   Two weeks prior to release of the new replacement CD, the ISS
   subscription email system is turned off and all refresh files awaiting
   pickup are purged. This is to prevent someone from replacing new ISS
   data from the CD with older data from the refresh system.

   Within two weeks of distribution of the new data CD, the refresh
   service will be turned on again to allow routine refresh of the ISS
   data after installation of the new CD.

   Individual Carrier Refresh-- Remember that an individual carrier's ISS
   score and other data can be refreshed at any time by connected to SAFER
   from ISS.
   Missed the CD? -- If you did not receive the most recent ISS
   replacement CD, the data can be downloaded from the FMCSA Infosys
   website at any time. http://infosys.fmcsa.dot.gov. Remember that this
   file is 60 MB and you must be connected by a high speed link for a
   practical download.
