                                                                                               January 4, 2002


   The Court of International Trade has ruled in favor of the National
   Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) by dismissing a lawsuit
   brought by the Defenders of Wildlife over implementation of its dolphin
   conservation program in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean tuna
   fishery.

   "This is good news for dolphins, tuna, fisheries managers and the
   international agreement process," said Bill Hogarth, NOAA Fisheries
   director. "This court decision strengthens our holistic approach to
   dolphin-safe tuna management in the international arena. Under the
   Marine Mammal Protection Act, the United States must set strong
   protection standards that also take into account international trade,
   commerce, international agreements, and foreign policy."

   In the Dec. 7 decision, Judge Judith M. Barzilay agreed with NOAA
   Fisheries' interpretation of the International Dolphin Conservation
   Program Act (IDCPA) and upheld the legality of implementing regulations
   put into effect in January 2000. The court also affirmed that the
   government complied with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
   in completing the regulations and in negotiating the 1999 Agreement on
   the International Dolphin Conservation Program.

   Finally, the court held that NOAA Fisheries' "affirmative finding" for
   Mexico was not arbitrary and capricious. The affirmative finding allows
   Mexico to export to the United States yellowfin tuna harvested in the
   eastern tropical Pacific Ocean using purse-seine vessels with a
   carrying capacity greater than 400 short tons.

   The NOAA Fisheries tuna/dolphin team has worked over the last decade on
   a progression of key achievements leading up to the Agreement on the
   International Dolphin Conservation Plan (Agreement on the IDCP), its
   authorizing act, the IDCPA, dolphin research and monitoring, and U.S.
   regulations. These achievements have resulted in (1) a precipitous drop
   in dolphin mortality in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean since 1986
   from 133,000 dolphins per year to less than 2,000 per year, (2) a
   cooperative international mechanism for setting dolphin mortality
   limits, tracking them, and holding the tuna fleet, and appropriate flag
   countries accountable if limits are exceeded, (3) a system for tuna
   tracking and verification, and (4) a process for lifting import
   embargoes to countries that can document compliance with the Agreement
   on the IDCP.

   On Feb. 8, 2000, Defenders of Wildlife and other environmental
   organizations filed suit against the Assistant Administrator for
   Fisheries in the Court of International Trade. The plaintiffs alleged
   that NOAA Fisheries did not lawfully implement the IDCPA, the NEPA, and
   the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary
   injunction from the court to prevent NOAA Fisheries from making
   "affirmative findings" to lift embargoes against Mexico or other
   eastern tropical Pacific Ocean tuna fishing nations.

   The ruling by the Court of International Trade strongly supports U.S.
   participation in the IDCP and is a validation of the continued efforts
   of ETP-fishing nations to reduce dolphin mortality in the ETP tuna
   fishery. This ruling has far-reaching implications for international
   resource management, reaffirming the importance of multilateral
   cooperation in ecosystem-based conservation of international fishery
   resources.
