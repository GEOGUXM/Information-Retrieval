NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Smokeview
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator consists of two programs, FDS and
   Smokeview. The NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator predicts smoke and/or air
   flow movement caused by fire, wind, ventilation systems etc. Smokeview
   visualizes the predictions generated by NIST FDS.

   FDS, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, solves a form of the
   Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven
   flows of smoke and hot gases generated in a fire. Details of the
   numerical methods may be found in the FDS Technical Reference Guide.
   Instructions on how to use FDS and Smokeview can be found in the the
   FDS User's Guide.

   Smokeview visualizes FDS computed data by animating time dependent
   particle flow, 2D slice contours and surface boundary contours. Data at
   a particular time may also be visualized using 2D or 3D contour plots
   or vector plots. Details about Smokeview may be found in the Smokeview
   User's Guide.

   FDS and Smokeview along with example data files may be obtained from
   the download page . Several FDS example cases from the User's Guide are
   visualized on the samples page.

What's New

   Official release versions of both NIST FDS 2.0 Smokeview 2.0, programs
   for modeling and visualizing fire and smoke flow, are now available for
   download. New visualization techniques such as animated isosurfaces and
   animated flow vectors have been incorporated into Smokeview. New
   combustion and radiation algorithms have been incorporated into FDS.
   New Smokeview and FDS features are hilighted.
