    1: How do I obtain a copy of an opinion?
        That depends on whether you are trying to obtain an opinion that is
         published, or non-published. To obtain a published opinion, you can
         either retrieve it from our Opinions Page, or you can request it by
         coming to the Clerk's Office personally. If you are trying to get a
         copy of a non-published opinion, you will not be able to find that
        opinion on our web site. These are only available through the Clerk's
       Office, either by coming in personally, or by mailing in a request for
       the opinion. All opinions obtained through the Clerk's Office are $4.00
                                     per copy.
    2: How can I get a copy of a brief, excerpt, or case file?
       If the case you are interested in is closed, you will need to contact
       the Records Room at the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The
         number for the Records room is (404) 335-6115. If the case you are
        looking into is not closed, you will need to contact the Docket Clerk
         for that case. This can be done by calling the main Court number at
         (404) 335-6100. In both instances, a case number will be needed to
       access the information more quickly. If you need information about the
         record that the Court of Appeals received from the District Court,
           whether the case is open or closed, contact the Records Room.
    3: How can I get a copy of the local rules?
       The local rules can be downloaded from our Rules and Addenda Page, in
           .pdf format as part of the FRAP, 11th Circuit Rules and I.O.P.
        Additionally, this site allows the download of the Addenda, Addendum,
                     and proposed revisions to the Local Rules.
    4: How does an attorney become admitted to the 11th circuit?
       This question is best answered by FRAP Rule 46(a), titled "Admission
        to the Bar." This FRAP Rule contains all of the information necessary
        for an Attorney to join the 11th Circuit. See our Attorney Admissions
         page for the information related to this topic. Also, download the
          Application for Admission to the Bar as mentioned in FRAP 46(a).
    5: How do I file a brief, what should it look like?and how many copies
                                  should be filed?
       This information can be found, in detail, according to 11th Cir. R.
        28-1 through 28-4 here. We have also provided a page that states how
                       each brief should look, and be bound.
    6: Where do I find information about opinions released before 1996?
       You can either visit a law library and look through West's Federal
        Reporter, or if you prefer to look online, try Westlaw, or Lexis. Of
         course you can also obtain these older opinions through the Clerk's
                                      Office.
    7: What are the court's hours?
        The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is open
       to the public from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday. The court
         is closed on all Federal Holidays. The court does not have an after
                                  hours drop-box.
    8: What is the mailing address for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
                                   11th Circuit?
                             The mailing address is:
        Thomas K. Kahn, Clerk United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
                                       Circuit
                                 56 Forsyth St. N.W.
                               Atlanta, Georgia 30303
    9: What is the court fax number?
         The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit does not accept
         outside faxes, unless prior permission is expressly granted. If you
        have an emergency which requires a fax transmission, you must contact
           the clerk's office at (404) 335-6100 and request permission in
                         accordance with 11th Cir. R. 25-2.
   10: How do I obtain an extension of time?
         The court frowns upon extensions of time. However, the Clerk has
       authority to telephonically grant a 7-day, unopposed extension request
       with the understanding that no additional requests for extensions will
          be made. The litigant must file a letter with the Clerk's Office
       confirming the conversation/extension on or before the new filing date.
        If more than 7 days is desired, a formal motion should be filed with
        the Clerk's Office no less than 7 days before the original due date.
       The motion should contain: the reason the extension is needed; whether
       the opposing party(s) consents or objects to the request for additional
        time; and a statement that no further extensions will be requested.
