                  Performance-Based Contracting (PBC) Links

   PBC methods are intended to ensure that required performance quality
     levels are achieved and that total payment is related to the degree
     that services performed meet contract standards. Performance-based
                                 contracts:

   (a) Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than
                   the methods of performance of the work.
   (b) Use measurable performance standards (terms of quality, timeliness,
      quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans (see FAR
                          46.103(a) and 46.401(a))
   (c) Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the
    price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed or do
               not meet contract requirements (see FAR 46.407)
   (d) Include performance incentives where appropriate.

       information on their Web sites. Please refer to the information
