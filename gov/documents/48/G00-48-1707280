   High Performance Processor and Memory Technologies
   Identification and characterization of high performance microprocessors
   and advanced memory technologies, both volatile and nonvolatile, for
   use in high density, high speed applications such as solid state
   recorders and autonomous, onboard processing and storage of large
   amounts of science data. Reliability assessment and validation of
   emerging technologies such as ferroelectric RAMs (FRAMs),
   magneto-resistive RAMs (MRAMs), chalcogenide and memories.
