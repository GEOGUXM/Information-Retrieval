    One of the Senate's original standing committees, the Committee on the
    Judiciary was first authorized on December 10, 1816. The Committee has
    one of the broadest jurisdictions in the Senate, ranging from criminal
      justice to antitrust and intellectual property law. Senator Dudley
        Chase of Vermont, became the first Chairman of the Committee on
      December 13, 1816. The longest sitting chairman, before limits were
    established, was Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi serving over
                 the span of 22 years from 1956 through 1978.
