                                Introduction

   Software and Hardware Systems is a component of the Information
   Technology Research program. Official information about that program is
   provided in the Program Solicitation, document NSF 01-149. Information
   on this page is advisory only; NSF provides it to give potential PIs
   additional context for the program and informal guidance for their
   submissions.

   Proposals in this area should help create new complex systems for
   research and education. Proposed research and education activities
   might include:
     * Balancing hardware and software and balancing computation and
       communication in systems architecture.
     * Scaling up to very large systems, both in number of components,
       geographic distribution, and participation by people and devices.
     * Learning how to predict reliability and performance in enormous
       systems and ensure robust and dependable operation.
     * Communicating with devices embedded in many kinds of equipment and
       places, including needs for wireless connectivity and managing
       sensors and physically
       active devices.
     * Understanding how to share information and instrumentation among
       groups of people and equipment, and how to build and best use
       information technology inside buildings, instruments, and other
       physical and engineering systems.
     * Experimenting with information technologies included in physical
       systems.

   Examples of these problems include Grid Computing, Virtual Reality /
   Telepresence, Hybrid and Embedded Systems, and High Performance
   Networking and
   Middleware Applications. Research and education in systems design will
   support IT in all areas of science, engineering and humanities, and
   extend access to
   world-class resources across the nation. (Projects in this focus area
   must involve new kinds of IT research and education; building
   production infrastructure is not
   responsive.)
