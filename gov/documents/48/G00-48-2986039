       CERES and the California Wetlands Information System are programs
   of the California Resources Agency. This Wetlands Information System is
   designed to provide comprehensive wetlands information to the general
   public, the educational community, and government agencies. It is a
   compilation of public and private sector information, including maps,
   environmental documents, agency roles in wetlands management,
   restoration and mitigation activities, regulatory permitting, and
   wetland policies.
