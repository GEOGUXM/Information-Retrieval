    WHAT IS "OPERATION LIFESAVER"?

   WASHINGTON OPERATION LIFESAVER (WAOL) is a free public service
   education program dedicated to preventing and reducing fatalities and
   injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and along railroad
   rights-of-way. We educate the public on highway-rail grade crossing
   safety and provide vital information about the dangers encountered when
   people trespass on railroad property. We also get involved with
   engineering projects to improve public safety, and we work with the law
   enforcement community in an effort to reduce grade crossing and
   trespass incidents. WOL is part of a national program known as
   "OPERATION LIFESAVER, INC." (OLI). Both WAOL and OLI are non-profit
   organizations.

    WHY IS "OPERATION LIFESAVER" NEEDED?

   Hundreds of people are killed and thousands are seriously injured each
   year in the United States at highway-rail crossings and at other
   locations along railroad tracks. Many people are unaware that trains
   cannot stop quickly to avoid collisions. Others take chances by
   ignoring warning signs and signals, going around lowered gates,
   stopping on tracks, or simply not paying attention when approaching
   highway-rail crossings. Many people make the fatal mistake of choosing
   railroad tracks as shortcuts or as places to walk or run for
   recreation. They simply don't realize how quickly a train can be there
   until it's too late and there's no escape. Unfortunately, on the
   average of every 115 minutes somewhere in the United States, there is
   an incident at a crossing or along a railroad right-of-way. Operation
   Lifesaver programs educate the public by providing vital information so
   these tragedies can be reduced and prevented.

    WHERE CAN YOU GET "OPERATION LIFESAVER" INFORMATION?

   Free safety presentations which include a talk with colorful visuals
   and informative videos are given to any group, business or organization
   ( schools, youth groups, truck and bus companies, civic clubs, utility
   companies, corporations, etc.). You will learn many surprising and
   important facts about trains and what they can and cannot do. Our
   certified presenters tailor their presentations to meet your schedule
   and needs. Presentations vary in length from 30 to 60 minutes depending
   upon a group's time limitations. Presentations are also tailored to
   specific types of groups and age levels. For example, we have special
   programs and videos for school bus drivers, professional truck drivers,
   teens, children and others. A variety of videos ranging from cartoons
   to deadly crashes are used to help convey the Operation Lifesaver
   message.

    HISTORY OF "OPERATION LIFESAVER"

   In 1972, a concerned Union Pacific Railroad employee, working with the
   support of many Idaho communities, established a state-wide public
   education program in an effort to reduce the number of crashes,
   injuries and fatalities occurring at highway-rail grade crossings. At
   the end of the first year, the fatality rate in Idaho dropped by 39
   percent. In 1973, the same education program was started in Nebraska.
   After a one-year period, Nebraska demonstrated even more impressive
   results----a 46 percent reduction in highway-rail grade crossing
   fatalities. In recent years, increased emphasis has been placed on
   reducing and preventing the injuries and fatalities caused by people
   trespassing on railroad property.

   Operation Lifesaver is now active in the 49 continental United States
   and in parts of Canada. Since its inception in 1972, this public
   education program has dramatically reduced injuries and fatalities. A
   cooperative effort involving education, engineering and enforcement are
   the three factors that continue to make this program successful.
   Education is provided by the volunteers involved in Operation
   Lifesaver. Engineering is provided by the professionals who are
   responsible for improving and maintaining the crossings. Enforcement is
   provided by your local and state law enforcement officials and railroad
   police officers who actively enforce the laws at crossings and along
   the railroad right-of-ways.
