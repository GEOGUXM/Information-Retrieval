   Online Drivers License Renewal Now Available

   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah November 28, 2001 Governor Leavitt today announced
   Utah.gov, the new portal for Utahs online government services. Formerly
   e-Utah.org, www.utah.gov is the next phase of bringing government
   services to residents in an efficient, convenient way.

   A major goal of my administration is to provide government services
   conveniently and efficiently, said Governor Mike Leavitt. Utah.gov
   enables Utahns to conduct business with government 24 hours a day,
   seven days a week.

   The site has a new look and feel, designed to create a frictionless
   user experience that works to eliminate the organizational layers and
   complexity of government.

   Utah.gov users are busy people, so we designed the site in a
   no-nonsense manner that doesnt require a vast understanding of how Utah
   government is structured, said Amy Sawyer, general manager of Utah
   Interactive. Visitors come to Utah.gov with very specific needs, and
   our goal is to quickly direct visitors to the information most
   important to them.

   Utah.gov hosts over 3 million user visits and supports approximately
   425,000 transactions each month. The site offers a wide range of online
   services, including vehicle registration renewals, business tax
   filings, hunting and fishing licenses, business name registration, UCC
   filings, official form downloads, and hundreds of government
   information resources. More than 35 new online applications have been
   added to the portal in the last two years.

   By continuing to add convenient and cost-effective services, Utah.gov
   has established a reputation as one of the premier eGovernment portals
   in the nation, said Phillip Windley, state chief information officer.
   This year, the site was ranked among the top ten state eGovernment
   portals in the nation by the Center for Digital Government and
   Government Technology magazine. The Taubman Center for Public Policy at
   Brown University also recognized the performance of Utah.gov in its
   annual survey of eGovernment performance by ranking it 16th out of over
   1,500 state websites.

   Governor Leavitt also announced the newest service, driver license
   renewal. The online renewal system offers an easy-to-use interface
   designed to save Utahns time.

   The Renewal by Internet process allows those eligible to renew by mail
   to log on at their convenience to renew or change their address 24
   hours a day, Judy Hamaker-Mann, director of the Driver License
   Division. A renewal letter with a pin number will be sent to eligible
   drivers approximately three months before their licenses expire.

   A typical online renewal takes less than five minutes to complete, and
   citizens can print out a confirmation of their renewal immediately. The
   renewal is recorded instantly, and within 3-5 days residents will
   receive a renewal sticker to place on the back of their current
   license. In-person license renewal at one of the states 28 driver
   license offices costs $20, compared with just $15 online or through the
   mail. The system also enables citizens to initiate the voter
   registration process.

   The Driver License Division processes more than 13,000 renewals per
   month.

   In just two months, over 500 Utahns have tried the online renewal and
   address change service during the initial phase, said Hamaker-Mann.
   This will streamline the process not only for residents, but also for
   the Driver License Division.

   About Utah.gov Utah.gov is the state of Utahs homepage and official
   website (www.Utah.gov), a collaborative effort between the state of
   Utah and Utah Interactive, Inc. It was built and is marketed, operated,
   and maintained by Utah Interactive, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
   eGovernment firm NIC.
