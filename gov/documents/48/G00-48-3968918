      NOAA and Coast Guard Gain Approval for Greater Ship Safety Along
                                Olympic Coast

    International Body Approves Preliminary Measures to Protect Sanctuary
                                  Resources

   July 10, 2001

   The National Ocean Service, an agency of the Commerce Department's
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U. S.
   Coast Guard received preliminary international approval to expand
   existing protective measures for the Olympic Coast National Marine
   Sanctuary.
   The measures would move large commercial ships further offshore,
   reducing the threat of an oil spill to the sanctuary.

   The Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation of the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO), a London-based body that regulates ocean-going
   shipping, heard the proposal this week to modify the existing
   "Area-To-Be Avoided" (ATBA).
   An ATBA is an area that all ships or certain classes of ships should
   avoid because navigation is particularly hazardous or where it is
   exceptionally important to avoid casualties within the area.

   The proposal consists of two parts. First, it increases the size of the
   ATBA to the north and west of the sanctuary to provide a greater margin
   of safety around the navigational hazards of Duntze and Duncan rocks
   and Tatoosh Island. Second, the ATBA would also apply to ships greater
   than 1600 gross tons, regardless of their cargo, that are transiting
   the area.
   These ships carry large amounts of bunker fuel which, if spilled, would
   be extremely harmful to the unique, valuable and sensitive resources of
   the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.

   Vessels that are engaged in activities allowed in the sanctuary, such
   as fishing, would not be affected by the proposed changes. The
   voluntary nature of the ATBA was also evaluated and will remain in
   place.

   "Since 1995, tank vessels carrying cargoes of petroleum and hazardous
   materials have been routed outside the ATBA. Although the measure is
   voluntary, compliance has been high," said Carol Bernthal,
   superintendent of NOAA's Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. "The
   marine transportation industry has been very cooperative because they
   recognize that an oil spill would have a devastating impact on this
   ecological treasure."
   The entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, located within the marine
   sanctuary, is one of the busiest intersections on the West Coast. The
   proposal was developed based on existing vessel traffic patterns and
   oil spill risk studies. Additional input was sought through
   consultations with the Canadian Government; members of the public
   including representatives of the shipping industry, master mariners,
   ports, pilots and environmental interests; and representatives of U.S.
   federal, state, local and tribal governments.

   "While the existing program has proven successful, the future poses a
   different set of risks and we are pleased that the IMO is addressing
   them," Bernthal said.
   NOAA officials also worked closely with the United States Coast Guard
   as they developed recommendations for changes to the traffic lanes
   entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca to improve navigation safety and
   increase protection for marine resources. This proposal also received
   preliminary approval from the IMO. The result of these efforts will be
   a win-win situation for both the marine industry and the environment.
   "The Coast Guard is passionate about the marine environment here in the
   Pacific Northwest and believes that these waterways are safe, however,
   improvements can always be made", said Captain John Veentjer of the
   Thirteenth Coast Guard District. "The proposed changes to the vessel
   routing and traffic separation schemes, which were developed in
   cooperation with our Canadian neighbors who share in the management of
   these waters and with representative input from waterway users, will
   further reduce the risk of vessel accidents on these waterways."
   Final designation of these protective measures must also be approved
   and adopted by the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee when it meets in May
   2002. The target for implementation of these measures is December 2002.
