   Mound FY02 Monthly Progress Report Selected Indicators December, 2001
   1) Prepare and ship off-site all currently known TRU waste. Mound's
   first TRU waste shipment to the Savannah River Site (SRS) was completed
   on schedule, September 28. December was spent planning the preparation
   of remaining waste shipments. The next shipment is still expected to
   occur in April, 2002, depending on SRS's own shipping schedule to the
   WIPP site. 2) Reduce by approximately 37% (roughly 200,000 Ci) the
   estimated remaining tritium in the tritium complex. Achievement of this
   goal would reduce the total remaining tritium from 5.1% to just 3.2% of
   the original 10/1/97 inventory, leaving primarily just residual
   contamination in the buildings. In December, another 19,100 Ci of
   tritium were processed. Total removal is now 94,000 Ci (or 47% of the
   FY02 goal) since the 200,000 Ci removal goal was established in August.
   3) Complete all activities and documentation necessary for DOE to
   transfer all property and land within the Phase I area. In December,
   remediation of PRS 421 was initiated, and is expected to be completed
   in January weather permitting. Also, data packages addendums for PRSs
   72, 73, and 87 were submitted. Characterization of PRS 274/275
   continued on schedule. The Building Data Packages for Buildings 2, 3,
   49, 63, and magazines 80-84 are complete. The Building 2 data package
   is with the core team, and the remainder are undergoing DOE review. 4)
   Vacate all Phase II area buildings requiring D&D or D&T. Bids for the
   asbestos abatement ID/IQ contract, which will include tasks for
   Buildings 29 and 44, were received on December 17. Award will occur in
   January. Demolition of the Building 71 and 73 pads was initiated on
   Decmember 12. The Building 51 utilities have been mostly isolated, and
   removal of fixed contamination inside the building is underway; the
   building data package and work package are under internal review. 5)
   Complete characterization of PRS 266 and PRS 66. Phase III
   characterization of PRS 66 was completed in December, approximately 2
   months ahead of schedule. Sampling of PRS 266 for waste management
   purposes was completed concurrently. In addition to these two PRSs,
   sampling of PRS 80 was completed due to its proximity with PRS 66. 6)
   Complete remediation of PRS 266. The removal action for PRS 266 will
   begin in the Spring, after all data has been collected and an
   excavation plan is completed. 7) Decontaminate and demolish I Building.
   Decontamination of the MOCA room (I-101) was completed on Decmber 4.
   The ID/IQ contract for asbestos removal will be awarded in January. 8)
   Complete internal preparations for Building 38 demolition. In December,
   five manipulators were removed from the F-line of gloveboxes in
   Building 38. Preparations, including some physical work, for removal of
   the corrosive vapor system continues. Miscellaneous equipment removal
   also continues. Site of Former Building 85 PRS 421 Excavation *The
   number given for remaining buildings includes 17 that have been leased
   to MMCIC, as well as other buildings that are still owned
