      Court order halts securities sales of HMC, Znetix, freezes firms'
                                    assets

     Two Bainbridge Island companies, Health Maintenance Centers, Inc.
     (HMC), and Znetix, Inc. (Znetix), along with their founder, Kevin L.
     Lawrence, and other associated persons were enjoined yesterday from
     violating the registration and fraud sections of the federal
     securities acts.  Kevin Lawrence is the president of HMC and
     Chairman of the Board of Znetix.  The order was entered in United
     States District Court for the Western District of Washington
     enjoining the scheme and freezing the assets of HMC, Znetix and
     others named in the action.  The Washington Securities Division of
     the Department of Financial Institutions, working with the
     Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of
     Investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District
     of Washington, and the Internal Revenue Service are continuing to
     investigate.

     According to documents filed in court, the $74 million scheme of HMC
     and Znetix, (originally organized as “Project X”), involved
     “medically integrated” health and fitness facilities.  The purported
     business model provided health and fitness services as well as
     medical and fitness research and the design, manufacture and sale of
     training equipment.  HMC and Znetix offered and sold HMC and Znetix
     common stock through officers and directors of the companies,
     employees or sales agents, and a "friends-and-family" network.  The
     unregistered offerings of HMC and Znetix stock began in 1995, and
     the total number of investors is estimated to be more than 5,000
     across the nation.

     Sales of stock were in part driven by the apparent business success
     of Znetix, which sponsored many high-profile corporate sponsorships
     and publicity events.  The federal action alleges that the company
     did not in fact conduct ongoing business activities.  Many investors
     were also induced to purchase HMC stock because they were told that
     they would be able to exchange each of their HMC shares purchased
     for $1 per share for four shares of Znetix, a company they were told
     would soon go public at a share price ranging anywhere from $3 to
     $60 and acquire HMC.  Many were also informed that the time frame
     for this was a matter of months.  In fact, Znetix has not yet gone
     public, nor have the companies merged.  Finally, officers of Znetix
     should have been aware that, for many reasons, an initial public
     offering could not be accomplished in such a short time.

     In addition to being misled about the prospects or timing of the
     four-for-one exchange, it is alleged that investors were not
     adequately informed of the use of their funds.  Instead of financing
     HMC and Znetix's purported business of developing and operating
     "medically integrated" health and fitness clubs and completing an
     initial public offering for Znetix, they funded Lawrence's personal
     lifestyle.  Lawrence has allegedly used nearly $14 million in
     investor funds to buy luxurious homes or real estate, exotic cars,
     boats, and other items for himself, family members, and friends,
     while others benefited from the receipt of gifts or
     misappropriations of investor funds.

     concerning HMC, please read the instructions found on the Investor

     Maintenance Centers, Inc. Questionnaire.  Send the completed
