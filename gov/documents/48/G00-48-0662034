      The Florida Caribbean Science CenterÂ´s Sirenia Project conducts
      long-term, detailed studies on the life history, population dynamics,
      and ecological requirements of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus
      manatus).  Sirenia Project biologists work cooperatively with federal
      and state researchers and managers on research identified as essential
   for the recovery of the species.
