   The INEEL's pre-college education programs engage students in science,
   mathematics, engineering, and technology, and develop K-12 teachers to
   help those students succeed.
   INEEL's objectives are to
    1. Equip K-12 teachers with skills and knowledge to strengthen their
       teaching
    2. Give pre-service teachers opportunities to apply relevant concepts
    3. Help students in grades 7-12 develop their problem-solving skills,
       disciplinary core competencies, and employable skills for careers
       in science and technology
    4. Excite interest of students in grades K-6 in the scientific
       disciplines
    5. Reach out to families to participate in science and technology
       activities.

   To support the above objectives, our pre-college programs are:

   JASON Idaho - engaging students and teachers in natural and physical
   sciences and technology

   Teaming Teachers with INEEL - placing pre-service and practicing
   teachers with INEEL researchers working on research problems

   Student Action Teams in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and
   Technology - placing teachers and high school students in teams on
   research problems working with INEEL researchers

   Math and Science Equipment Gift Program - providing excess,
   educationally-useful federal equipment to help every possible K-12
   child in Idaho's public, private, and parochial schools acquire the
   skills needed to succeed in the information-intensive 21st century.

   Science Exposition - bringing together INEEL technical mentors,
   teachers and students, and various community groups to showcase the
   science and engineering technology of the INEEL and to champion the
   technical expertise of the laboratory.

   Scholastic Tournament - giving Idaho students an opportunity to
   participate in the annual DOE national science bowl
