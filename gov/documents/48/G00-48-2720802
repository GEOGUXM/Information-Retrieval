   Three in vitro corrosivity assays -- EpiDerm^TM, Episkin^TM assay, and
   the rat skin Transcutaneous Electrical Resistance (TER) assay, -- have
   been evaluated as potential replacement assays for in vivo corrosivity
   testing.

   The EpiDerm^TM Skin Model closely parallels human skin and is used as
   an in vitro means to assess dermal irritancy and toxicology. This
   submission is sponsored by MatTek Corporation

   Episkin^TM is a three dimensional human skin model comprised of a
   reconstructed epidermis and a functional stratum corneum. For use in
   corrosivity testing, the test material is topically applied to the
   surface of the skin for 3, 60, and 240 minutes, with subsequent
   assessment of their effects on cell viability.

   In the TER Assay, test materials are applied up to 24 hours to the
   epidermal surfaces of skin discs taken from the skin of humanely killed
   young rats. Corrosive materials are identified by the ability to
   produce a loss of normal stratum corneum integrity and barrier
   function, which is measured as a reduction of the inherent
   transcutaneous electrical resistance below a predetermined threshold
   level.

   A study on the scientific validity of the Episkin^TM and TER methods by
   the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM)
   validation study can be found here.

   These three assays will be evaluated by an Expedited ICCVAM Peer Review
   in the near future.
