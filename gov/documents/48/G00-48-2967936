Current SEC Commissioners

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has five Commissioners who are
   appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and
   consent of the Senate. Their terms last five years and are staggered so
   that one Commissioner's term ends on June 5 of each year. To ensure
   that the Commission remains non-partisan, no more than three
   Commissioners may belong to the same political party. The President
   also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top
   executive.
