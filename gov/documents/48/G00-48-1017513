      The purpose of the OIG Hotline is to receive complaints of Fraud, Waste
      or Abuse in USAID programs and operations, including mismanagement or
      violations of law, rules or regulations by USAID employees or program
      participants.  The OIG provides oversight services for the
      Inter-America Foundation, and the African Development Foundation, and
      upon request, to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
      Complaints may be received directly from USAID employees, participants
      in USAID programs, or the general public. The IG Act and other
      pertinent laws provide the protection of persons making Hotline
      complaints. You have the option of submitting your complaint(s) via
      Internet electronic mail, telephone, or U.S. mail. However, if you
      elect to submit your complaint(s) via Internet e-mail you must waive
      confidentiality due to the non-secure nature of Internet electronic
      mail systems.
