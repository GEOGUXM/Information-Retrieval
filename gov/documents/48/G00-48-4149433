About ClinicalTrials.gov

   ClinicalTrials.gov provides patients, family members, health care
   professionals, and members of the public easy access to information on
   clinical trials for a wide range of diseases and conditions. The U.S.
   National Institutes of Health (NIH), through its National Library of
   Medicine (NLM), has developed this site in collaboration with all NIH
   Institutes and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

   The site was launched in February 2000 and currently contains
   approximately 5,700 clinical studies sponsored by the National
   Institutes of Health, other Federal agencies, and the pharmaceutical
   industry in over 63,000 locations worldwide. Studies listed in the
   database are conducted primarily in the United States and Canada, but
   include locations in about 70 countries. ClinicalTrials.gov receives
   over about 2 million page views per month and hosts approximately 5,600
   visitors daily.

   ClinicalTrials.gov was developed as a result of the FDA Modernization
   Act, which was passed into law in November 1997. Section 113 of this
   Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services, through the
   NIH, to establish a registry of clinical trials for both federally and
   privately funded trials of experimental treatments for serious or
   life-threatening diseases or conditions.
