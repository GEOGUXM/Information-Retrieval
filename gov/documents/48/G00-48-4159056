   Description of research projects:

   Peach Breeding:  Efforts focus on the development of novel peach tree
   architectures useful for the development of high-density production
   systems. Such systems would allow for higher productivity per unit land
   area, production concentrated on the best fruit growing land, and more
   targeted application of chemicals. Breeding columnar trees is the most
   advanced project with high fruit quality selections being tested in 12
   states and 3 foreign countries. New columnar hybrids are being
   developed each year. Research on other promising growth forms including
   semi-dwarf, and narrow leafed types (for increased light penetration
   into canopies) is in progress.

   Can Molecular Biology Techniques Be Used To Improve Perennial Fruit
   Trees?

   Plum Pox Virus Resistant prunus

   Plum pox or Sharka is a serious disease of prunus in all of Europe and
   has recently been detected in Pennsylvania. In our program, plum trees
   have been made resistant to the virus (plum pox potyvirus) responsible
   for plum pox through the insertion of a plum pox coat protein gene into
   the plum tree. These trees have resisted the virus for over 8 years in
   special containment greenhouses in the U.S. and for over 3 years in
   field plantings in Europe.

   Descriptions of peach, nectarine and plum varieties released by the
   Benetic Improvement of Fruit Crops:  (For additional information
   contact Ralph Scorza)

   Click for larger Image Click for larger Image ‘Sentry’ peach was
   released in 1980 because of its productiveness, large fruit size for
   its early season  of maturity, excellent peach flavor, attractive
   color, firmness, and resistance to bacterial leaf spot. Fruit of
   ‘Sentry’ average 2 3/8 to 2 1/5 inches in diameter. The time of
   ripening in Kearneysville, West Virginia is mid-July or about 2 weeks
   before ‘Redhaven.’ Since its release, ‘Sentry’ has steadily gained
   importance in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic peach growing areas and
   has become one of the most popular early season peach varieties.


   Click for larger Image ‘Bounty’ peach was released in 1989 because of
   its excellent flavor, large size fruit, productivity, relative
   uniformity in maturity, attractive color, and post-harvest firmness.
   Fruit size is between 2 ¾ to 3 inches. ‘Bounty’ trees have excellent
   flower bud cold hardiness, comparable to ‘Redhaven’. Since its release
   ‘Bounty’ has become the standard for excellence in its season (mid
   August in Kearneysville, West Virginia, or with ‘Loring’) and is
   replacing ‘Loring’ as the dominant midseason peach. For flavor, size,
   color, firmness, and productivity ‘Bounty’ is difficult to beat!


   Click for larger Image ‘Bluebyrd’ plum was released in 1998 for its
   excellent flavor, attractiveness, and high productivity. ‘Bluebyrd’ is
   a blue  European type plum. It has a high sugar content (approximately
   20%), amber colored flesh, and a flavor balance that is very pleasing
   to the palate. ‘Bluebyrd’ is self sterile and requires a pollinator
   variety such as ‘Stanley’ ‘Reine Claude’, ‘Blue Ribbon’ ‘Bluefre’, etc.
   for fruit set. Fruit are larger and sweeter than ‘Stanley’. Trees bloom
   a few days before ‘Stanley’. ‘Bluebyrd’ is an excellent plum for
   commercial, roadside, or home orchards.


   Click for larger Image ‘Earliscarlet’ nectarine was released in 1985
   for its high quality, attractiveness, and early ripening season (about
   a week  before ‘Redhaven’), a time when relatively few nectarines are
   available. Fruit size ranges from 2 ¼ to 2 ¾ inches on well-thinned
   trees. Flavor is excellent. Fruit are attractive with a 80-90% red
   blush over a yellow ground color. Like most nectarines, ‘Earliscarlet’
   is susceptible to brown rot (Monilinia sp.) and is recommended for
   those who have experience in growing nectarines.
