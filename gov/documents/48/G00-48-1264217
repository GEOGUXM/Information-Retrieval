                              Store Information

    The NASA Headquarters Exchange Store is located inside the West Lobby
   of the NASA Headquarters Building at 300 E Street SW in Washington, DC.

     It is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and
                      8:30 to 1 and 2 to 4 on Fridays.

      The purpose of the Exchange Store is twofold. First, it provides
    NASA-related items to NASA personnel and visitors. Second, it creates
      revenue which in turn allows the Exchange Council to offer social
       events such as the Annual NASA picnic, the crab feast, and the
             coffee/donut socials provided throughout the year.

    For more information, contact the store at (202) 358-0162. The vendor
   information phone number is (202) 358-1290. If you have comments about
       the store you wish to give to the Exchange Council, call (202)
                                  358-4545.
