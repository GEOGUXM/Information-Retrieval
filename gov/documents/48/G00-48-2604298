                [steo1.gif]  Winter Fuels Outlook: 2001/2002

   Introduction

   Tension in world oil markets, due to anticipated U.S. military action
   in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and
   Washington, has added an obvious dimension of uncertainty to any
   particular view of winter oil prices. We assume that expressed levels
   of support and cooperation for U.S. actions by the international
   community, including members of OPEC, include a willingness to at least
   maintain the level of oil supply that existed or was anticipated prior
   to September 11. In general, a sustained upsurge in prices is excluded
   from our base case outlook. This winter--defined as the period from
   October 2001 to March 2002--is expected to bring with it lower heating
   bills than those seen last winter, particularly for homes that heat
   with natural gas. The main reasons for this outcome are: 1) under
   normal weather assumptions, heating demand is expected to be about 7
   percent below the levels experienced last winter, with most of the
   difference being concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2001; 2)
   inventories of key heating fuels--especially natural gas-are noticeably
   above year-ago levels, which should help insulate prices from any
   unanticipated demand surge; 3) crude oil prices are expected to be
   about 7 percent lower than last winter; 4) consumer prices for fuel are
   expected to be lower than last winter under normal weather conditions,
   with residential natural gas prices down 29 percent, residential
   heating oil prices down an average of 13 percent and propane prices
   down approximately 17 percent. Combined reductions in prices and
   expected usage rates are expected to lower winter heating bills for
   typical households by about 34 percent for natural gas-heated homes, 17
   percent for oil-heated households, 23 percent for residences using
   propane as a main heating fuel, and perhaps 3 to 4 percent for
   households heating with electricity.

   Overview

   Heating fuel markets are expected to start the season with lower prices
   and (generally) higher inventories than at this time last year.
   Moreover, the assumption of "normal" weather, which is about 7 percent
   less severe, in terms of heating degree-days, than that of the previous
   winter, is expected to lower demand for space-heating fuels relative to
   last year. The supply/demand balances anticipated are generally
   adequate to minimize the risk of price run-ups if very cold weather
   patterns emerge, even if sustained over a few weeks.

   The generally plentiful situation for heating fuels is particularly
   evident in natural gas markets. Above-normal levels of gas in storage
   and comparatively low current and expected spot prices reflect the
   extent to which demand has been weakened relative to available supply
   since last winter. Thus, the largest heating fuel market (about 55
   percent of U.S. households) stands to sustain large reductions
   (approximately 34 percent) in consumer expenditures this winter
   compared to the 2000/2001 heating season. Propane markets are also well
   supplied, with the aggregate inventory level now standing 8 percent
   above normal and 14 percent above the year-ago level. September spot
   prices for propane were generally between $0.41 and $0.50 per gallon
   (Mont Belvieu) compared to $0.64 in September 2000.

   In comparison to natural gas and propane, heating oil supplies are
   somewhat less robust. While higher than this time last year, heating
   oil stocks at the end of September were about 7 percent below the
   average for end-September over the previous five years. While the
   chances of weaker heating demand developing this winter compared to
   last year are good, the distillate market is less well insulated
   against demand shocks than other heating fuel markets. On the other
   hand, in view of the shock imposed on the United States economy in
   general (and on the U.S. domestic and international travel business in
   particular) from the September 11 terrorist attacks, there is a strong
   likelihood that petroleum product output, previously slated for the jet
   fuel market, may be directed toward the No. 2 fuel oil market and
   alleviate some of the relative deficit in distillate fuel supply. The
   net effect, so far as heating oil is concerned, will depend partly upon
   the extent to which stronger highway travel demand (including freight
   truck-related demand for distillate fuel) substitutes for air travel.
   On balance, the current situation should favor somewhat less strained
   domestic distillate supplies this winter than projected prior to
   September 11. It should be noted that refinery outages in the Midwest
   may make distillate fuel markets tight there. For a detailed analysis
   of this situation, see the EIA special report "PADD 2 Gasoline and
   Distillate Fuel Near-Term Outlook."

   Overall, the potential impact of a colder-than-normal winter on fuel
   prices and consumer bills is seen as being less severe than what was
   anticipated last year. While a sustained cold-weather scenario for this
   winter could result in significant upward price responses, options that
   would mitigate such price reactions are more available this winter
   compared to the winter of 2000/2001. These options mostly relate to
   higher inventory levels.

   Heating Bills

   Table WF1 below summarizes historical and base-case (normal weather)
   demand, total expenditure, and price projections for key heating fuels
   on a per-household basis. The calculations focus on particular regions
   of the country with respect to consumption and projected weather
   factors (i.e., changes in heating degree-days) but assume national
   average consumer prices for heating fuels presented in the Short-Term
   Energy Outlook. Thus, heating bill calculations are illustrative of the
   magnitude of the expected changes in fuel bills but are not necessarily
   indicative of the absolute expenditure levels to be anticipated by
   individual consumers.

   [twf1.gif]

   As Table WF1 shows, expenditures for this winter are likely to be down
   noticeably from those of last winter as a result of both lower demand
   and lower prices. In our base case-projections, the expenditure
   decreases for households are: 34 percent for natural gas, 17 percent
   for heating oil and 23 percent for propane. Although a sharp drop in
   residential natural gas heating bills is expected this winter,
   anticipated expenditures would still be well above levels seen between
   1998 and 2000. This is because during that period winter weather
   patterns were extremely mild and consumption was decidedly below
   normal. In addition (and partly as a result), delivered natural gas
   prices were lower than those expected for this winter.

   Natural Gas

   Demand

   During the upcoming heating season, demand is expected to average 71.9
   billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, down 0.96 Bcf per day (1.3 percent)
   from the level recorded last winter. The main reason for the decline in
   winter demand is an expected decline in winter heating demand per
   customer. Below-normal temperatures last winter increased demand for
   natural gas and all other energy sources. Overall, last winter had
   about 7 percent more heating degree days than normal. However, the low
   temperatures arrived early, as November and December had gas-weighted
   heating degree-days that were about 12 percent and 19 percent above
   normal, respectively. Several regions of the country recorded increases
   of more than 25 percent above normal during these two months. As a
   result, consumption this winter in residential and commercial markets
   is expected to average 21.1 and 12.1 billion cubic feet per day,
   respectively, or 6.0 and 5.2 percent below the previous winters
   consumption (Figure WF1).

   Figure WF1. U.S. Winter Natural Gas Demand

   (Year-to-Year Percent Change)

   [fwf1.gif]

   Supply

   Domestic natural gas production is expected to average 53.6 Bcf per
   day, up 1.8 percent from the previous winter. A major effort to expand
   domestic production has been evident in the significantly increased
   number of active drilling rigs exploring for natural gas. According to
   industry sources, the number of rigs drilling gas prospects reached a
   high of 1,068 in mid-July 2001. Recently the number of rigs has
   declined to 962 but remains 34 percent above the level during most of
   last year and more than double the 371 reported for April 1999.

   Figure WF2. Working Gas in Storage

   [fwf2.gif]

   However, the additions to production that may be attributed to these
   efforts has collided with a very sharp curtailment in U.S. gas demand,
   particularly in the industrial sector. The result has been a collapse
   in natural gas spot and wellhead prices and extraordinarily high rates
   of injection into storage as excess gas supply looks for a home. Since
   we currently see the likelihood of a mild recession occurring during
   the second half of 2001, swift recovery in industrial gas use seems
   unlikely. We therefore assume that increases in domestic gas production
   rates will be modest, at best, this winter. If producers continue to
   bring more than marginal amounts of new production on-line this winter,
   gas prices, which we currently project to average $2.21 per thousand
   cubic feet at the wellhead in the base case, may collapse even further
   (perhaps to well below $2) unless a very cold winter arrives and props
   up near-term prices.

   Despite the underlying demand weakness, peak winter gas demand still
   far exceeds current production capability. Thus, as usual, natural gas
   stocks in underground storage play a critical role in meeting increased
   winter demand. Last winter, net withdrawals averaged 9.5 Bcf per day.
   This was 0.2 bcf per day higher than the previous 6-year (1995-2000)
   average and, even more noteworthy, by the end of October 2000 stocks
   were 2,699 Bcf - the lowest level since 1976 (Figure WF2). This
   increased use of underground storage resources left a record low of 742
   Bcf of working gas available at the end of March 2001. This spring and
   summer the industry has been aggressively refilling its storage
   facilities and since the end of March has added an estimated 2,232 Bcf
   - 43 percent above the previous 6-year average refill rate and a record
   for the period. We estimate that at the end of September 2001, working
   gas stocks stood at 2,974 Bcf, almost 8 percent above the 6-year
   average. Stocks in the East and West Consuming regions were about 2
   percent and 14 percent above average, respectively. The producing
   region (comprised of those Gulf and Southwestern states which produce
   natural gas) was estimated to be about 22 percent above the 6-year
   average. Most storage facilities are expected to continue to add to
   stocks in October, a month in which net injections have averaged 207
   Bcf in the previous 6 years and totaled 226 last year. This is
   projected to result in a working gas stock level of well over 3,100 Bcf
   on November 1 - about 200 Bcf above the 6-year average and almost 500
   Bcf higher than last year.

   From October to March, withdrawals are expected to be about 9.2 Bcf per
   day, 2.5 percent less than last years average of 9.46 Bcf per day. Due
   to a higher level of working gas at the beginning of this heating
   season compared to last year (2,974 versus 2,473 bcf) end-of-season
   stocks of working gas are projected to be 1,295 bcf compared to 742
   last year. This would be the highest level since the 1,406 Bcf level
   reached in March 1999.

   Natural gas net imports are expected to average 10.53 Bcf per day, or
   15 percent of US demand, compared to last years 10.56 Bcf per day-also
   about 15 percent of demand. During the winter months, net imports are
   about 10 percent higher than flows during the rest of the year and
   usually increase to full pipeline capacity. That capacity increased
   about 10 percent at the end of 2000 when the Alliance Pipeline began
   carrying gas from western Canada to the Midwest. In the first quarter
   of this year Alliance deliveries were estimated to have averaged over
   1.25 Bcf per day compared to .85 Bcf per day in December 2000. The
   Alliance pipeline has a rated capacity of 1.3 Bcf per day.

   Prices

   Last winter was highlighted by high prices for natural gas at the
   wellhead and at most upstream markets. For the 6-month heating season
   (October 2000 through March 2001), the average estimated wellhead price
   was almost $5.78 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Prices at other markets
   were also at very high levels for most of the winter months with spot
   prices at the Henry Hub in Louisiana trading for over $10.00 per Mcf
   for several days in late December and early January.

   Average natural gas wellhead prices are projected to average $2.21 per
   Mcf this winter-62 percent less than last years average of $5.78 per
   Mcf (Figure WF3). Several factors account for this sharp drop,
   including: the assumed return to normal winter temperatures; increased
   domestic production; above-average stock levels, and reduced demand
   from a slowdown in the U.S. economy.

   Prices paid by residential consumers are also expected to be down
   sharply, averaging $6.69 per Mcf, almost 30 percent below last winters
   average of $9.49. This is the largest percentage decrease of the major
   space-heating fuels to the residential sector. Consumers could see
   higher or lower prices during the winter, depending on whether
   abnormally cold or warm conditions develop.

   Interval

   Heating Oil

   Demand

   The base-case distillate fuel oil demand for the upcoming winter season
   is projected to average 3.96 million barrels per day, down about
   100,000 barrels per day from last winter seasons average. Several
   factors account for the decline. The first is the 64,000
   barrels-per-day decline in purchases by electric utilities from the
   record levels of the previous winter. A decline of about 34,000 barrels
   per day is expected for industrial facilities and nonutility power
   plants. These declines reflect the effective reversal of the efforts to
   substitute fuels for natural gas during the squeeze that developed on
   that fuel last winter. Continued growth in transportation diesel
   demand, even when bolstered by recent disruptions in air traffic, is
   projected to be insufficient to offset any weather-related decline in
   space-heating requirements and the sharp decline in power-generation
   purchases. Assuming a normal winter, heating degree-days in the
   Northeastern region, the principal market for heating oil, are expected
   to be almost 5 percent lower than in the winter of 2000/2001. Despite
   fluctuations in last winter seasons purchases brought about by
   consumer fears of shortages, the projected decline in heating oil
   demand is still expected to correspond to the decline in heating
   degree-days.

   Supply

   The three sources of supply -- domestic refinery production, net
   imports and primary inventories -- are projected to meet the
   requirements of the upcoming winter, even if cold-weather episodes,
   such as those that marred the two previous winters, occur. Refinery
   output is expected to average 3.67 million barrels per day, down
   slightly from the 3.69 million barrels per day of the previous winter.
   Refinery utilization is projected to average 90.7 percent compared to
   91.4 percent during the previous winter season. Seasonal distillate
   yields are projected to average 23.8 percent, down slightly from 24.2
   percent last winter. Net imports are projected to average 150,000
   barrels per day, less than half of those of the previous winter season.
   Although stocks started the season at an estimated 124.3 million
   barrels, or 9.2 million barrels higher than at the beginning of the
   previous winter, they are projected to end the season at 99 million
   barrels, down 6 million barrels from the end of the last winter season
   (Figure WF4). Stock withdrawals are therefore projected to average
   140,000 barrels per day compared to only 60,000 barrels per day during
   the previous winter season. Nonetheless, that level is still about 11
   million barrels higher than the record low recorded at the end of the
   1995-96 winter season.

   If weather-related spikes in demand occur, supplies should be able to
   meet the extra requirement, albeit at higher marginal costs. Last
   winters experience demonstrated the flexibility of refineries and,
   especially, the availability of imports, to meet short-term
   requirements, even during times of strong economic growth and
   colder-than-average weather. In recent winter seasons, maximum record
   quarterly averages for refinery utilization and yields, respectively,
   were 96.6 percent and 24.6 percent. On a shorter-term basis, peaks for
   utilization and distillate yield were even higher, resulting in record
   distillate production of almost 4 million barrels per day. In the first
   quarter of 2001, net imports, responding to the record trans-Atlantic
   arbitrage, averaged a record 490,000 barrels per day. Moreover, for
   inventories to remain above their record end-of-season lows, they would
   still be able to supply as much as an additional 62,000 barrels per
   day.

   Figure WF4. U.S. Distillate Fuel Stocks

   [fwf4.gif]

   Prices

   Crude oil costs to U.S. refineries are projected to average 50 cents
   per gallon, down 12 cents from those of the previous winter season.
   Weaker economic performance in the U.S. and abroad and the prospects of
   normal winter weather instead of a colder-than-average season such as
   last winter are expected to continue to place crude oil prices under
   downward pressure.

   Figure WF5 depicts the base-case crude oil price projection. The
   95-percent confidence interval reflects uncertainties inherent in
   projecting oil prices, such as aberrant weather patterns and OPECs
   ability to influence prices in the event of a deep recession.

   Figure WF5. WTI Crude Oil Price: Base Case and 95% Confidence Interval

   [fwf5.gif]

   For the upcoming winter season, retail heating oil prices are projected
   to average $1.19 per gallon in the base case, 17 cents less than the
   previous winter seasons average. That decline is larger than the
   12-cent average drop in the underlying crude oil prices, implying a
   5-cent drop in the spread between retail prices and crude oil input
   costs. Of that narrowing of the total spread, 3 cents is absorbed by
   the refiners. That narrowing of refinery margins reflects the
   amelioration of concerns about the adequacy of supplies due to several
   factors: the larger beginning-of-season stock levels, enabling stocks
   to contribute more than twice as much to the distillate requirement as
   during the previous winter; the demonstrated ability of refiners to
   produce heating oil in the face of colder-than-normal weather last
   season; and, the ability of imports to respond by making available
   ample supplies, as was seen during the first quarter of 2000, during
   which net imports set a record of 490,000 barrels per day.

   Figure WF6 below summarizes the base case and the 95-percent confidence
   interval of projected residential heating oil prices. The base case
   assumes normal weather patterns. The confidence interval reflects not
   only uncertainties about weather patterns, but also possible
   fluctuations in crude oil prices, as mentioned above.

   Propane

   Demand

   Last winters cold weather failed to overcome a softening U.S. economy
   as U.S. demand for propane fell to 1.40 million barrels per day during
   the 2000/2001 heating season, a drop of 3 percent from the previous
   years heating season. Petrochemical feedstock demand, the largest
   component of propane demand, remained weak last year with feedstock
   demand for propane falling by about one-fourth compared with 1999
   volumes. Moreover, the 2001 year-to-date drop in demand for propane was
   even more dramatic with declines reaching nearly 11 percent compared
   with the same period last year.

   Propane demand for the remainder of 2001 is expected to remain below
   year-ago levels, based on weak prospects for any significant turnaround
   in the U.S economy by years end. Adding to expectations of lower
   propane demand this year was the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   forecast for a 7 percent drop in the corn crop this year. The USDA
   forecast reflects a drop in estimated acres of corn planted, which, if
   combined with lower crop yields, would lower the prospect for any
   significant volume of propane needed for crop drying during the fall
   harvest season. With Midwest inventories of propane tracking near the
   bottom of the average range, expectations of lower crop drying demand
   may lesson the pressure on inventories in the region.

   Supply

   On the basis of current inventory levels and projected supply and
   demand, the expectation for the 2001-2002 winter heating season is for
   adequate propane supplies with lower prices compared with last year.
   The projection assumes normal weather and the absence of any major
   supply disruptions.

   Domestic production accounts for the largest share of supply during the
   heating season with up to 80 percent of propane supply coming from
   natural gas processing plants and refineries. For the first half of the
   year, propane production averaged 1.06 million barrels per day, down
   more than 7 percent from the comparable period last year. Production
   from both gas processing plants and refineries were down this year but
   gas processing plant production was particularly hard hit early in the
   year when soaring natural gas prices caused many gas plants in South
   Louisiana and Texas to either shut down or significantly reduce their
   take of propane. Consequently, gas processing plant production through
   June 2001 fell nearly 8 percent compared with the same period last
   year. Refinery production of propane recorded a 6-percent decline
   during this same period. However, expectations are strong for continued
   growth in supply from both gas processing plants and refineries through
   the heating season, contingent upon much reduced and relatively stable
   natural gas prices and strong refinery runs.

   Primary propane inventory withdrawals provide the second largest source
   of propane during the heating season. Last winters colder-than-normal
   weather pushed U.S. inventories of propane down to 23.5 million barrels
   by the end of the heating season, less than 1 million barrels above
   that of the 1999-2000 season. Despite U.S. inventories being at one of
   the lowest levels in recent years from which to rebuild for the next
   heating season, the 2001 stock build was the second largest ever at
   45.0 million barrels. In contrast, the average stock build over the
   past five years measured roughly 34.2 million barrels. Following the
   near-record stock build, U.S. inventories stood at an estimated 68.5
   million barrels as of September 30, 2001, the highest September level
   since 1998. As a result, propane inventories are near the upper limits
   of the average range for the start of the 2001/2002 heating season
   (Figure WF7). Under the base case scenario, inventories are projected
   to gradually decline, reaching a level of 28 million barrels by the end
   of March 2002, or 4.5 million barrels higher than last year.

   On a regional basis, East Coast and Midwest inventories began the
   heating season either near or below the lower limit of their respective
   average ranges, while Gulf Coast inventories began the heating season
   significantly above the average range during this same period (Figure
   WF8). However, relatively low inventories in the East Coast and Midwest
   regions may not pose any serious concern due to several factors. The
   East Coast region has limited storage capacity, so re-supply during the
   heating season, via imports, plays an important role in conjunction
   with current inventories. Last year, the Midwest region began the
   heating season below the average range and had the potential for
   significant crop drying demand. This year, Midwest inventories had
   moved up within the lower limits of the average range and do not face
   the same potential for significant crop drying demand.

   While small in volume, imports provide a crucial source of supply
   during periods when demand exceeds the available supplies from
   production and inventories. Through the first half of 2001, propane
   imports averaged 145,000 barrels per day, down more than 9 percent from
   about 161,000 barrels per day averaged during the first half of 2000.
   While Canada continued to supply the largest volume of propane imports,
   its share fell by more than 26 percent during the first half of 2001.
   Although smaller in volume, waterborne imports gained during this
   period, increasing by nearly 23 percent. High propane prices earlier in
   the year and weakening world demand for propane provided the incentive
   for the increase waterborne imports. Imports from the North Sea, North
   Africa and the Middle East provided most of the increase in waterborne
   imports during 2001. Expectations are for imports to lag below last
   years levels for the duration of 2001.

   Prices

   The primary determinant of spot propane prices, as with most
   commodities, is the supply/demand balance, which can vary by region.
   Retail propane prices are influenced by price movements of other
   heating fuels, such as heating oil and natural gas during the winter
   months. Moreover, these prices are also influenced by crude oil prices,
   the prices of alternative petrochemical feedstocks and intangible
   factors such as uncertainty about future supply/demand balances. While
   spot propane prices have eased below last years high levels, other
   propane prices have remained above prior year levels.

   Residential propane prices for the upcoming winter heating season are
   expected to remain below the prior years heating season. Under the
   base-case scenario, residential prices are expected to average $1.13
   per gallon compared to $1.36 last winter (Figure WF9).

   Extreme Weather Cases

   In addition to the normal uncertainty surrounding the expected outcomes
   for key fuel volumes and prices, inferred from the inherent uncertainty
   of primary determinants (weather and economic growth for examples) as
   well as the basic stochastic nature of estimating relationships, we
   have considered demand and price responses under extreme (cold or warm)
   weather conditions. We have focused on the likely consequences of
   overall deviations (higher or lower) of 10 percent from normal weather,
   measured in terms of aggregate heating degree-days.

   Based on winter season (October--March) heating degree-days over the
   period 1975 to 2001, we estimate that the probability of experiencing a
   winter in which overall degree-days (i.e. total heating degree-days
   over the winter) are either 10 percent above or below normal ranges is
   about 8 percent. But the distribution of the incremental degree-days
   can be far from even. To simplify the analysis, however, we assume that
   the 10-percent deviations in either direction are proportionally
   distributed over the winter based on the "normal" heating degree-day
   pattern. We did not investigate how this added assumption affects the
   probabilities associated with the event, but a more typical pattern is
   admittedly one that is at least somewhat uneven.

   Over the last 26 years, only 3 winters even exhibited weather patterns
   that have led to all months deviating from normal in the same direction
   (1981-1982, 1990-1991, and 1999-2000). All of these winters were warmer
   than normal, the most significant overall deviation having been
   recorded for 1999-2000 (10.7 percent warmer than normal). On the other
   hand, 2 winters in the last 26 were more than 10 percent colder than
   normal (1976-1977 and 1977-1978). Interestingly, the coldest winter
   relative to normal since then was the 1978-1979 winter, when heating
   degree-days exceeded normal by 8.2 percent.

   This winter, with heating fuel inventories at relatively comfortable
   levels (particularly with respect to natural gas), we see a much
   reduced risk of significant upward price shocks under a scenario in
   which heating degree-days are 10 percent colder than normal. We assume
   the potential price variance for heating fuels under extreme weather
   conditions is symmetrical between upward and downward risk, a condition
   that is probably more readily justified when inventories of heating
   fuels are in good supply. The key results, which are expressed in
   percent changes, are summarized below in Table WF3.

   In contrast to last winter, the prospect of above-normal heating
   degree-days (below-normal mean temperatures) does not bring with it
   serious concerns about quantity constraints and the potential for
   extraordinary price fly-ups among the major heating fuels. This is
   particularly true for natural gas and propane, based on the ample
   pre-season supplies that have been put into storage (Figures WF2 and
   WF7).

   The case for a calm and orderly distillate fuel market under cold
   weather assumptions is less convincing inasmuch as distillate
   inventories, while currently in better shape than a year ago, still lag
   (7 percent) behind the average level seen over the last 5 years. High
   distillate production rates and high net imports forestalled as sharp a
   price runup last winter as would have normally been consistent with the
   level of demand pressure brought to bear on heating oil and diesel fuel
   markets. It is not clear that the same level of incremental supply at
   relatively moderate marginal prices can be counted on this winter.
   Nevertheless, the likely absence of pressure from abnormal amounts of
   switching into distillate from the industrial and power sectors (both
   because of the current abundance of natural gas and the general
   weakness in the economy as a whole) suggests that distillate supplies
   may actually be more adequate to meet winter contingencies than one may
   surmise from the usual inventory evaluations. This contention is now
   bolstered by the sharp reductions in jet fuel demand projections that
   are the result of the downturn in air travel growth in the United
   States. Much of the product stream that would have been slated for
   increased jet fuel demand by the commercial aviation sector is likely
   to be diverted to the distillate pool, raising the prospect for a more
   significant cushion for distillate markets this winter than may be
   conventionally obvious at this time.

   Barring any significant interruptions in oil supplies and assuming that
   U.S. refineries operate without major disruption this winter, we expect
   weather (heating degree-day) variations of up to 10 percent above or
   below normal to result in variations in fuel demand of between 2 and 3
   percent from the base case for propane and distillate fuel and
   approximately 5 percent from the base case for natural gas. Residential
   gas prices may vary under those circumstances by about 3 percent from
   the base case, while residential heating oil and propane prices may be
   expected to vary by about 5 percent from the base case under the
   weather scenarios. In terms of household heating bills, we estimate
   that expenditures may vary between 13 and 15 percent above or below the
   base case depending on the weather scenario. Thus, while there is a
   small (3 to 4 percent) probability that heating oil and winter propane
   heating bills will match the levels seen last winter, for natural gas
   the probability is virtually zero.
