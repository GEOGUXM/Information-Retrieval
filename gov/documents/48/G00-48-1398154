                       NASA Website Privacy Statement

   This policy establishes how NASA will use information we gather about
   you from your visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of
   utmost importance to NASA.

   If you visit a NASA site...

                                                                        1.

   To read or download information:

   We may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For
   example, we may count the number of visitors to the different sections
   of our site to help us make them more useful to visitors. Similar
   information is gathered for anonymous ftp, remote account login, or for
   other comparable types of connections.

                                                                        2.

   To send us an E-mail:

   By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
   personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address), as in an
   official FOIA request. We may store the name and address of the
   requester in order to respond to the request or to otherwise resolve
   the subject matter of your E-mail.

                                                                        3.

   To register:

   Some of our sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill
   out a registration form. For example, vendors looking for marketing
   opportunities by visiting our NASA Acquisition Internet Service sites
   may be asked to "register" to obtain email notices of business
   opportunities. Other information which may be collected at these sites
   through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, enable us to
   determine a visitor's interests, with the goal of providing better
   service to our customers.
   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to NASA, we will protect all such information consistent
   with applicable law.
