   DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
   Office of the Secretary

   Special Provisions for Canadian Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Imports Under
   the North American Free Trade Agreement

   AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, USDA.

   ACTION:  Notice of determination of existence of conditions necessary
   for imposition of temporary duty on potatoes from Canada.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SUMMARY: As required by section 301(a) of the United States-Canada
   Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988, as amended by the
   North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (``FTA
   Implementation Act''), this is a notification that the Secretary of
   Agriculture has determined that the necessary conditions exist with
   respect to United States acreage and import price criteria for potatoes
   classifiable to subheadings 0701.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
   of the United States (HTS) imported from Canada to permit the Secretary
   to consider recommending to the President the imposition of a temporary
   duty (``snapback duty'') by the United States pursuant to section
   301(a) of the FTA Implementation Act, implementing Article 702 of the
   United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, Special Provisions for Fresh
   Fruits and Vegetables, as incorporated by reference and made a part of
   the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) pursuant to Annex
   702.1, paragraph 1 of NAFTA.

   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Grunenfelder, Horticultural &
   Tropical Products Division, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S.
   Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1049 or telephone at
   (202) 720-3423.

   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FTA Implementation Act, in accordance
   with the NAFTA, authorizes the imposition of a temporary duty
   (snapback) for a limited group of fresh fruits and vegetables from
   Canada when certain conditions exist. Potatoes, classified under
   subheadings 0701.90 of the HTS, is a good subject to the snapback duty
   provision.
       Under section 301(a) of the FTA Implementation Act, two conditions
   must exist before imposition by the United States of a snapback duty
   can be considered. First, the import price of a covered Canadian fruit
   or vegetable, for each of five consecutive working days, must be less
   than ninety percent of the corresponding five-year average monthly
   import price. This price for a particular day is the average import
   price of a Canadian fresh fruit or vegetable imported into the United
   States from Canada, for the calendar month in which that day occurs, in
   each of the 5 preceding years, excluding the years with the highest and
   lowest monthly averages.
       Second, the planted acreage in the United States for the like fruit
   or vegetable must be no higher than the average planted acreage over
   the preceding five years, excluding the years with the highest and
   lowest acreage.
       From October 2-8, 2001, the price conditions with respect to
   potatoes were met.
       The most recent revision of planted acreage for potatoes shows that
   this year's planted acreage is below the planted acreage over the
   preceding five years, excluding the years with the highest and lowest
   planted acreages.

       Issued at Washington, DC the 12th day of December, 2001.
   Ann Veneman,
   Secretary of Agriculture.
