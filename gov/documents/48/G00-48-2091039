                          White Sands Test Facility

                       About White Sands Test Facility

     White Sands Test Facility (WSTF), located in southwestern New
     Mexico, has been a part of the NASA Johnson Space Center since its
     construction in 1963. Our primary mission is to provide the
     expertise and infrastructure to test and evaluate spacecraft
     materials, components, and rocket propulsion systems to enable the
     safe human exploration and utilization of space.

   Photoelectron Spectroscope Beginning with Project Apollo in the early
   1960s, WSTF has supported every United States human exploration space
   flight program. We continue to play a key role in the nation's space
   effort by evaluating materials and components for use in propulsion,
   power generation, and life-support systems, crew cabin equipment,
   payloads, and experiments carried aboard the Shuttle Orbiter and the
   International Space Station.


   Over the ensuing years, numerous full-scale propulsion systems for the
   Apollo Service Propulsion and Lunar Modules, Space Shuttle Orbiter, and
   the International Space Station, as well as commercial and military
   upper stages and planetary exploration spacecraft, have been developed
   and qualified through exhaustive simulated mission duty cycle testing.
   WSTF is also evaluating upgraded or redesigned Shuttle Orbiter
   components to extend service life, enhance performance, and improve
   mission safety. WSTF is formally certified to perform precision
   cleaning and depot-level refurbishment of Shuttle orbital maneuvering
   engines, reaction control system thrusters, and several other
   flight-critical propulsion system components.

   Hydrogen Explosion
   The scientific investigation of explosion phenomena at WSTF is aimed at
   improving safety at launch facilities and other areas where hazardous
   materials are used. Using ultra high-speed instrumentation to measure
   the effects of exploding liquid and solid propellants, we can more
   precisely define safety and structural requirements for new and
   existing launch facilities.


     WSTF is a center of technical excellence in the fields of high-pressure
     oxygen systems and materials and rocket propellant safety. We offer:
       * Functional and performance evaluation tests
       * Hazards/failure analyses of materials, components, and complete
         systems
       * System design evaluation and recommendations
       * Safety training courses and manuals

     We provide support to the NASA Reusable Launch Vehicle program with
     propulsion system test facilities, vehicle servicing, payload
     integration, component evaluation and refurbishment, and launch and
     landing support capabilities. For example, the four liquid oxygen and
     liquid hydrogen engines in the reusable DC-X vertical takeoff and
     vertical landing technology demonstrator vehicle were initially
     test-fired at WSTF before flight. Propellant servicing equipment and
     related ground operations were subsequently provided to support the
     DC-X launches from the nearby White Sands Space Harbor (WSSH).



   Similar static rocket engine testing, propellant servicing, and launch
   and landing support will be provided for tests of the winged,
   rocket-propelled suborbital X-34 reusable concept demonstration vehicle
   at Holloman Air Force Base. During these tests, the vehicle will be
   air-launched from a large carrier aircraft, flown to the fringes of
   space, then landed horizontally on a dry lakebed runway at WSSH.

     WSTF operates two laser-leveled lakebed runways at WSSH as an alternate
     orbiter landing site and coordinates astronaut training in flying the
     critical approach and landing phase of Shuttle missions. The Shuttle
     Training Aircraft, specially modified jets that duplicate the controls
     and light characteristics of the Shuttle Orbiter, are hangared at the
     El Paso International Airport.
