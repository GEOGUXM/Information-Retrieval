   working at the
   Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology, DBS, NCI, NIH

   Job: Computational Biology
     * DNA and Protein Sequence Analysis
     * RNA Structural Computation and Analysis
     * Searching for Functional Element in RNA Genomes
     * RNA Structure Modeling
     * Interaction of RNA and RNA-binding protein

   Currently I am especially working on the following:
     * still improving the algorithm for predicting common RNA structure
     * 3-D modeling of RNA pseudoknots and common structural core of IRES
       (internal ribosome entry sequence)
     * searching for viral and cellular IRES and the determination of
       their common structure
     * searching for functional RNA elements involving in the regulation
       of post-transcriptional gene control
