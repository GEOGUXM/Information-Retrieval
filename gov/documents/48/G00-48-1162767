   You're looking at a real flight simulator called a Link Trainer. It was
   built around 1943 and has been fully restored at our facilities.
   During World War II, over half a million pilots were trained in
   simulators like this one. They practiced instrument flight: flying
   without being able to see the ground. Pilots relied on a few simple
   instruments to keep track of the plane's location. Making a mistake
   would have been dangerous in an airplane but was safe in a simulator.
   Click on the Link Trainer below to learn about the modern simulators at
   our division of NASA/Ames, the Aviation Systems Division.
