   Instrument Description

   The Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) is a versatile airborne
   microwave imaging radiometer developed by the Georgia Institute of
   Technology and the NOAA Environmental Technology Laboratory for the
   purpose of obtaining polarimetric microwave emission imagery of the
   Earth's oceans, land, ice, clouds, and precipitation. The PSR is the
   first airborne scanned polarimetric imaging radiometer suitable for
   post-launch satellite calibration and validation of a variety of future
   spaceborne passive microwave sensors. The capabilities of the PSR for
   airborne simulation are continuously being expanded through the
   development of new mission-specific scanheads to provide airborne
   post-launch simulation of a variety of existing and future U.S.
   sensors, including CMIS, ATMS, AMSU, SSMIS, WindSat, TMI, RAMEX, and
   GEM.

   The basic concept of the PSR is a set of polarimetrc radiometers housed
   within a gimbal-mounted scanhead drum. The scanhead drum is rotatable
   by the gimbal positioner so that the radiometers (Figure 2.) can view
   any angle within ~70^o elevation of nadir at any azimuthal angle (a
   total of 1.32  pi sr solid angle), as well as external hot and ambient
   calibration targets. The configuration thus supports conical,
   cross-track, along-track, fixed-angle stare, and spotlight scan modes.
   The PSR was designed to provide several specific and unique
   observational capabilities from various aircraft platforms. The
   original design was based upon several observational objectives:

   1.      To provide fully polarimetric (four Stokes' parameters: T[v],
   T[h], T[U], and T[V]) imagery of upwelling thermal emissions at several
   of the most important microwave sensing frequencies (10.7, 18.7, 37.0,
   and 89.0 GHz), thus providing measurements from X to W band;

   2.      To provide the above measurements with absolute accuracy for
   all four Stokes' parameters of better than 1 K for T[v] and T[h], and
   0.1 K for T[U] and T[V];

   3.      To provide radiometric imaging with both fore and aft look
   capability (rather than single swath observations);

   4.      To provide conical, cross-track, along-track, and spotlight
   mode scanning capabilities; and

   5.      To provide imaging resolutions appropriate for high resolution
   studies of precipitating and non-precipitating clouds, mesoscale ocean
   surface features, and satellite calibration/validation at Nyquist
   spatial sampling.

   The original system has been extended - as discussed below - to greatly
   exceed the original design objectives by providing additional
   radiometric channels and expanded platform capabilities.

   The PSR scanhead (Figure 2.) was designed for in-flight operation
   without the need for a radome (i.e., in direct contact with the
   aircraft slipstream), thus allowing precise calibration and imaging
   with no superimposed radome emission signatures. Moreover, the conical
   scan mode allows the entire modified Stokes' vector to be observed
   without polarization mixing.

       aircraft.

   The entire assembly (including both scanhead and positioner) was
   designed for integration into several different aircraft, including:

   ·        NASA Dryden Flight Research Center’s DC-8 (nadir-7 and/or
   nadir-2 ports)

   ·        NASA Wallops Flight Facility’s Orion P-3B (aft end of the P-3
   bomb bay) (Figure 1)

   ·        Scaled Composites Proteus underbody pod

   ·        NASA Johnson Space Center’s WB-57F (palletized bomb bay)

   ·        NASA Dryden Flight Research Center’s ER-2 (Q-bay)

   To date, the PSR has flown successfully for over 340 flight hours on
   NASA and Navy P-3s and the NASA DC-8 in conjunction with several major
   field experiments (see below) sponsored by the US. Office of Naval
   Resarch (ONR), NASA, NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO), NOAA, U.S.
   Navy, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During all flights the
   PSR exhibited excellent aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical
   performance in ambient conditions as cold as -51^o C and at true air
   speeds up to 375 knots.

   The PSR/A scanhead provides either full-Stokes vector or
   tri-polarimetric sensitivity at the radiometric bands of 10.7, 18.7,
   and 37 GHz, and thus is well suited for the NPOESS Integrated Program
   Office’s internal government (IG) studies of ocean surface wind vector
   measurements - as proposed for inclusion on NPOESS. Currently, PSR data
   has been used to demonstrate the first-ever retrieval of ocean surface
   wind fields using conically-scanned polarimetric radiometer data. The
   results have suggested that the NPOESS specification for wind vector
   accuracy will be achievable with a polarimetric two-look system.

   A. Polarimetric Radiometers: PSR/D

   The first PSR scanhead (denoted "PSR/D," for its use of digital
   correlators) was developed in 1995-96 and consisted of four
   polarimetric radiometers operating at 10.7, 18.7, 37.0, and 89.0 GHz
   (see Piepmeier and Gasiewski, 1996a). In order to efficiently utilize
   the scanhead faceplate area, the 10.7 and 37.0 GHz radiometers utilize
   a common dual-band antenna, while the 18.7 and 89.0 GHz receivers each
   utilize single-band antennas. The precise radiometric bands measured by
   the PSR are X (10.6-10.8 GHz), Ku (18.6-18.8 GHz), Ka (36-38 GHz), and
   W (86-92 GHz). These bands were selected to provide sensitivity to
   clouds, precipitation, and surface features over almost one decade of
   microwave bandwidth at octave intervals.

   All antennas are of the lens/corrugated feedhorn type and are dual
   orthogonal-linear polarized with grooved rexolite lenses. Antenna
   diameters were chosen to provide beamwidths of 8^o (for both X- and
   K-bands) and 2.3^o (for both Ka- and W-bands). All main beam
   efficiencies are in the 95-97% range and all on-axis cross-polarization
   isolations exceed -27 dB.

   The microwave receivers in PSR/D were all dual-channel superheterodyne
   with a common local oscillator driving each of two identical mixers.
   The 10.7 and 18.7 GHz receivers were single sideband (SSB) and use high
   electron mobility transistor (HEMT) preamplifiers, while the 37.0 and
   89.0 GHz receivers are double sideband (DSB). Noise temperatures are
   low enough to meet the required sensitivities for airborne radiometric
   studies of ocean emission anisotropies, clouds, and precipitation.

   Tri-polarimetric detection (T[v]=<|E[v]|^2>, T[h]=<|E[h]|^2>, and
   T[U]=2 [r_goth.gif] e <E[v]E[h]^*>) was accomplished in PSR/D using
   custom three-level (1.6-bit) digital correlators operating at 1 GS/sec
   (Piepmeier and Gasiewski, 1996b). The correlators allowed detection and
   cross-correlation of 500 MHz wide intermediate frequency bands at the
   Nyquist sampling rate. High-speed ECL logic was used to accomplish the
   digital detection (Figure 3.). IF subband division was used to allow
   detection of the full IF bandwidths available from the various
   receivers (up to 2000 MHz). The digital detection hardware was backed
   up by redundant dual-polarization analog detection hardware.

                         PSR/D scanhead.

     scanhead.

   The PSR/D scanhead (Figure 4) contains an 80486 PC, an eight-channel
   digital correlator bank, and four total- power tri-polarimetric
   radiometers installed inside a 20" (51 cm) diameter and 20" (51 cm)
   long rotating drum. Radiometric data is processed using a 80486-based
   computer within the scanhead, then transmitted to an archival computer
   in the aircraft cabin via a 10-base 2 LAN link through the sliprings.
   Thus, all radiometric detection is accomplished inside the scanhead
   drum.

                PSR/D Installation

    Figure 4. PSR scanhead as seen through the access cover illustrating
    wiring

    and microwave electronics.

   The scanhead package includes a monochrome CCD telephoto video camera
   boresighted along the antenna main beams. The camera incorporates an
   orange filter and vertical polarizer to maximize the contrast of ocean
   foam against the ocean background and clouds against either ocean or
   land backgrounds. The camera is used to observe the scene for purposes
   of cloud clearing, ocean foam coverage estimation, and surface feature
   detection.

   B. Scanning Mechanism

   To provide the required imaging capabilities a nadir-viewing two-axis
   gimbal mount is used to scan the PSR radiometers in the airstream
   outside the aircraft. The gimbal mount utilizes a 30-inch diameter ring
   bearing to support a nominal aerodynamic wind load of up to 600 lbs. To
   avoid calibration problems no radome is used, however an aerodynamic
   fence is used to reduce the maximum free-stream wind loading to ~170
   psf which is appropriate for the gimbal and scanhead structure. Geared
   stepper motors with ~135 N-m of torque along with 12-bit absolute
   position encoders facilitate scanhead motion under nominal wind
   loading. Structural torsional deflections have been designed to be less
   than 0.01^o to maintain positioning accuracy. Scanhead power is
   provided by azimuthal and elevation slip rings provide power to the
   scanhead.

   The 170-lb scanning drum can be positioned to view any angle with 0.1^o
   precision using a two-axis high-torque stepper motor positioner system
   driven by a dedicated 68000-based programmable controller. Sliprings
   are used to provide power to the scanhead and to facilitate digital and
   analog data communications via ethernet and NTSC video links. In order
   to minimize damage to the electronics caused by condensation, a dry gas
   system is used to purge the scanhead drum and sliprings. The weight of
   the positioner alone is 437 lbs, yielding a total instrument weight
   (less computer control hardware) of 607 lbs. An additional 200-400 lbs
   (depending on the specific aircraft platform) is required for computer
   control hardware. Positioner and calibration load power requirements
   vary with the motor's dynamic loads and with ambient temperature, but
   the maximum required power (during warmup on ascent) is less than 1500
   watts at 120 VAC. Scanhead power consumption is an additional 240 watts
   at 28 VDC.

   All scan modes are software-selectable in flight, and include: (1)
   conical, with either fixed-angle or stepped-angle cones and including
   both fore and aft views, (2) cross-track or along-track, (3)
   fixed-angle stare, including nadir and (during modest rolls) cold sky
   stare, and (4) spotlight. Minimum scan times of ~10 seconds for a
   complete fore-and-aft viewing cone with 53.1^o half-angle (or ~4
   seconds without hot and cold calibration views) are attained in-flight
   with excellent mechanical stability. A network of IRIG-B clocks within
   the scanhead and controlling computers provides position/sample
   synchronization to better than one millisecond. A two-axis gyroscope is
   mounted on the positioner to provide roll and pitch information at ~10
   msec intervals. These data are later used to correct the observed
   imagery for minor aircraft attitudinal variations.

   C. Calibration

   Calibration of all radiometers is performed in-flight using standard
   (unpolarized) hot and cold blackbody targets. The unpolarized load
   consists of an array of canted pyramidal iron-epoxy absorbing wedges
   organized in a two-faced L-shaped configuration (Figure 5). The
   absorbing pyramids overlie a thermally-conducting substrate of aluminum
   pyramids so that the physical temperature of the entire structure
   remains homogeneous to within 1-2 K. The microwave emission temperature
   of the structure is thus precisely calculable using measurements of the
   physical temperature of the array. The pyramids are canted at an angle
   of 45^o so as to provide maximum absorption in the direction of PSR
   lens antennas. The dimensions of each pyramid were chosen so as to
   maximize absorption over the entire band of frequencies used by the
   PSR.

   PSR.

   D. PSR/A: Recent Innovations in preparation for the NASA CAMEX3
   Experiment

   Several major improvements in the scanhead and data system have been
   implemented in preparation for the CAMEX-3, thus leading to a second
   (analog) iteration of the original scanhead (PSR/A) (Figure 6). First,
   the 18-GHz feedhorn and receiver has been upgraded to cover two
   radiometric bands and now includes a fully-polarimetric channel at
   18.6-21.7 GHz, and a dual-polarized water vapor channel at 21.3-21.6
   GHz. The new K-band receiver will thus be sensitive to emissions from
   both the surface and integrated water vapor. The new receiver will also
   be a direct detecting type rather than superheterodyne. Second, each of
   the five radiometers will incorporate sub-interval calibration hardware
   to supplement the standard hot- and ambient-view calibration. The
   sub-interval calibration hardware will switch noise diodes into the RF
   inputs of the receivers at ~100 msec intervals, pulsing each diode both
   on and off so as to allow estimation of the radiometer gains and
   offsets at time intervals comparable to the drift time of receivers. In
   this manner, uncalibrated gain and offset drift caused by 1/f noise
   will be significantly reduced. Third, the digital correlators were
   replaced by analog adding correlators using quadrature hybrid arrays.
   The analog system allows measurement of all four Stokes' parameters for
   the 10- and 18-GHz channels, and the first three Stokes' parameters for
   the 37- and 89-GHz channel. Finally, using a new pyramidal calibration
   load (expected to be available in late 1998), the absolute accuracy of
   the PSR is expected to be ~1 K, thus providing excellent capabilities
   for absolute intercomparisons of measurements with radiative transfer
   model calculations.

       installation on the NASA DC-8

       in preparation for CAMEX-3.

   E. New Developments: PSR/C, PSR/S, and PSR/L

   The modularity of the PSR system allows for a straightforward
   replacement of the scanhead under field conditions with either of
   several new or planned scanheads. The replacement of a scanhead
   requires approximately two-hours of time and can thus be can be
   accomplished well within the duration of a typical field campaign. The
   logical, electrical, and mechanical interfaces to the new scanheads are
   all identical, thus minimizing design and fabrication costs as well as
   providing observational versatility. Additional PSR gimbal positioners
   are being fabricated in order to allow more than one PSR scanehad to be
   operated from a single aircraft. Synchronized operation of two PSR
   systems is possible on the DC-8, P-3, WB-57F, or Proteus aircraft.

   PSR/C.. The second PSR scanhead consists of a fully polarimetric C-band
   radiometer inside a standard PSR scanhead drum. The C-band system
   (PSR/C) provides simultaneous four-Stokes' vector measurements within
   four bands adjacent at 5.80-6.20, 6.30-6.70, 6.75-7.10, and 7.15-7.50
   GHz. Applications of PSR/C include ocean surface emissivity studies,
   soil moisture mapping, sea ice mapping, and imaging of heavy
   precipitation. The multiband capability of PSR/C will also be used to
   study the feasibility of frequency agile radiometry for observations
   over interference prone regions. Recently, am interference detection
   and removal algorithm was demonstrated using PSR/C data.

   PSR/C Scanhead

   Figure 7. PSR/C scanhead. The primary lens/feedhorn antenna is located
   to the left of a

   co-boresighted video camera and longwave (10um) IR sensor.

   PSR/S. A “submillimeter” wavelength scanhead, PSR/S, with radiometers
   operating at the temperature and moisture sounding bands on AMSU/A and
   B is currently being fabricated. This scanhead will contain several
   dual-orthogonal linearly polarized millimeter- and submillimeter wave
   radiometers with frequencies ranging from 18.7 to 500 GHz.^ This system
   (PSR/S) is being designed to study the polarization signatures of
   clouds and precipitation and will provide dual-polarized sensitivity at
   all major window channels in this range. When completed, this
   instrument will provide NOAA with the first-ever capability to perform
   comprehensive post-launch calibration of its AMSU sensors - and the
   first ever in-house capability for this critical acceptance task. PSR/S
   will also be ideally suited for post-launch calibration of all NPOESS
   microwave sensors (ATMS and CMIS) along with the ATMS on the NPOESS
   Preparatory Project (NPP).

   The PSR/S scanhead will have several sub-millimeter-wave channels,
   providing sensitivity to cirrus water content and upper tropospheric
   water vapor. These sensing capabilities will be used to study the
   distributions of ice and water phases around convective sources. Since
   water vapor is the most important of greenhouse gasses, the use of this
   scanhead will provide important information on natural mechanisms for
   stratospheric water vapor exchange.

   The submillimeter-wave channels on PSR/S will be provide simulation
   capability for the Geosynchronous Microwave (GEM) Sounder, now under
   consideration for the NOAA GOES series of satellites. GEM has been
   proposed as a practical geosynchronous microwave sounder, providing
   sounding channels at 118, 183, 380, and 424 GHz with spatial resolution
   of ~15-20 km and rapid scanning and update capability. Here, the PSR/C
   and PSR/S scanheads - used in tandem - will provide important
   radiometric imagery necessary to determine the capabilities of a
   proposed microwave sensor to sound  temperature and humidity from
   geosynchronous orbit. The combination of PSR/C and PSR/S scanheads will
   provide the first means of intercomparing the data available from the
   GEM-class sounder with data from well-understood systems such as AMSU
   and SSM/I.

   PSR/L. A new conically-scanning PSR scanhead operating at L-band
   (PSR/L) promises to provide more accurate maps of sea surface salinity
   that currently available. The high resolution of the PSR/L airborne
   sensor will be particularly valuable for coastal and estuarian salinity
   mapping and sea ice melt research.

   Field Measurement Programs

   F. Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment (1997)

   During January-March 1997 a unique multiagency complement of
   instruments for observing ocean surface emission and scattering
   signatures was installed and deployed on the NASA/Wallops Flight
   Facility (WFF) Orion P-3B aircraft (N426NA). The primary goal of the
   Ocean Winds Imaging (OWI) complement was to collect data to verify the
   utility of passive ocean wind vector sensing in high seas, with
   secondary goals being to better characterize the thermal emission and
   scattering signatures of the wind-driven ocean surface. The complement
   was flown under a variety of meteorological conditions in coordinated
   patterns over both ocean buoys along the eastern U.S. coast and an
   instrumented research vessel - the R.V. Knorr - within the Labrador
   Sea. The conditions represented a wide range of surface wind speeds,
   cloud and water vapor states, and fetch lengths. During the Labrador
   Sea deployment the OWI complement observed the ocean across sections of
   several convective meteorological systems driven primarily by arctic
   cold-air outbreaks moving eastward from Labrador, Canada over the open
   water. Several coordinated underflights of low-orbitting satellites
   sensors, including the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and the Defense
   Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) SSM/I sensors were also
   performed. The flights resulted in the acquisition by the OWI science
   team of the first high-resolution polarimetric passive microwave
   conically-scanned imagery of the ocean in a broad set of bands, and the
   first combined joint high-resolution passive and active imagery of the
   ocean surface. Total flying time for the effort (including integration
   and engineering check flights) amounted to ~48 flight hours.

    Wind Direction Harmonics (small image)

    Laborador Sea Deep Convection Experiment

    on March 4, 1997. From Piepmeier and Gasiewski [2000]. (Select image
    for full-size figure)

   Participating institutions in the integration and observation phases of
   the OWI/Labrador Sea experiment included the Georgia Institute of
   Technology School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (GIT/ECE), the
   NOAA Environmental Technology Laboratory Ocean Remote Sensing Division
   (NOAA/ETL), the University of Massachusetts at Amherst Microwave Remote
   Sensing Laboratory (U-Mass/MIRSL), the NASA/WFF Observational Science
   Branch (OSB) and Aircraft Programs Branch (APB), the National Center
   for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the Woods Hole Oceanographic
   Institution, and the Aerospace Corporation. In addition, assistance in
   the design and fabrication of critical aircraft equipment was obtained
   from the Raytheon Corporation, the NASA/Ames Research Center (ARC), and
   the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).

   The OWI complement included two active radar scatterometers for
   measuring both Bragg and specular return (the U-Mass C-band
   Scatterometer - C-Scatt and the NASA/WFF/OSB Radar Ocean Wave
   Spectrometer - ROWS), two passive polarimetric scanning radiometers for
   imaging the upwelling thermal emission from the ocean surface (the
   Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer -  PSR/D and the U-Mass Ka-band
   Scanning Polarimetric Radiometer - KaSPR), and precision fixed-beam
   radiometers for measuring the sub-track upwelling polarimetric emission
   from the ocean (the ETL Ka-band polarimetric radiometer - Kapol) and
   the above-track thermal emission from clouds and water vapor (the ETL
   Cloud and Water Vapor Radiometer - CWVR). The complement also included
   a nadir infrared pyrometer for measuring sea surface temperature, a GPS
   dropsonde package (provided by NCAR) for measuring subtrack pressure,
   temperature, humidity, and wind vector, and several video cameras
   (provided by GIT) for recording ocean foam and cloud conditions.

   The OWI experiment provided data to develop an extended geophysical
   model function (GMF) for ocean surface thermal emission for T[v], T[h],
   and T[U] at 10.7 and 37.0 GHz, and for Tv and Th at 18.7 GHz (Figure
   8). When the raw data were averaged over a large number of scans to
   reduce both instrument and geophysical noise, excellent agreement
   between the PSR and SSM/I 37 GHz azimuthal harmonic amplitudes was
   obtained for the range of wind speeds from near calm to  ~16 m/sec over
   large footprint areas and for an ensemble of ocean-atmosphere states.
   The GMF also exhibits excellent consistency between amplitudes and
   phases of the azimuthal harmonics for the 10.7, 18.7, and 37.0 GHz
   channels, with harmonic amplitudes monotonically increasing by ~50%
   from 10.7 to 37.0 GHz.

   On smaller spatial scales, the T[v] and T[h] data often showed local
   brightness variations of up to 10-15 K that are related to the presence
   of convection and/or unstable air-sea conditions. Atmospheric
   conditions suggest that these brightness perturbations are caused by
   surface wave spectrum variations. Such conditions did not influence the
   T[U] imagery nearly as much, and in many instances virtually no impact
   is seen in T[U]. The degree to which T[U] rejects such
   convection-related perturbations indicates that the polarization
   signature will provide valuable information on surface wave, and hence
   wind, direction.

   The PSR GMF was used to demonstrate the first aircraft-based passive
   microwave maps of ocean surface wind fields using a maximum likelihood
   (ML) estimator with adaptive channel weights. One-dimensional wind line
   plots were developed using full 360^o azimuthal scans, and
   two-dimensional wind field maps over a region of ~14 x 100 km were
   developed using a two-look technique. Both one- and two-dimensional
   techniques show that ocean wind direction signatures over
   mesoscale-sized regions of ~15 km or greater size are consistent enough
   for satellite mapping using a two-look polarimetric technique that
   includes T[U]. Moreover, adaptive channel weighting allows use of all
   radiometric channels during conditions where the azimuthal harmonics
   have high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but emphasizes the lower
   frequency channels during conditions when the higher frequency channels
   become perturbed by either clouds or surface roughness.

   Satellite simulations using the PSR data downsampled to spot sizes
   similar to that of the SSM/I, but including both tri-polarimetric
   channels (T[v], T[h], and T[U]) and two-looks show retrieval accuracies
   of ~8.4^o and ~0.8 m/sec without directional ambiguities. These results
   strongly support the concept of satellite-based passive ocean surface
   wind vector mapping. When the third Stokes parameter is removed the
   simulated retrieval accuracy was reduced to ~12.6^o and ~1.0 m/sec,
   with a significant increase in ambiguity rate (11.1%). When a
   tri-polarimetric system is used but with only one look, the accuracy is
   ~14^o and ~1.6 m/sec, although the ambiguity rate is slightly lower
   (7.7%). It is noted that these simulation accuracies are consistent
   with error values predicted using the Cramer-Rao error bound for
   retrievals of multichannel sinusoidal signal phases in the presence of
   satellite radiometer measurement noise. The simulations also show that
   wind direction information significantly benefits the retrieval of wind
   speed by resolving small azimuthal brightness perturbations that would
   otherwise produce wind speed errors.

   The OWI experiment also resulted in several innovations useful for
   spaceborne passive microwave wind direction sensing. The use of a 1
   GS/sec three-level digital polarization correlator in the PSR showed
   for the first time that accurate calibrated polarimetric measurements
   can be made using only standard unpolarized ambient and cold
   calibration targets. Such calibration standards are readily available
   in a space environment. The correlator demonstration also required the
   development of new expression for the response of a digital correlator
   to the input correlation coefficient, correlator A/D converter offset,
   and A/D converter hysteresis. The utility of a polarized calibration
   standard for ground-based pre-flight calibration of the three first
   three Stokes parameters was demonstrated.  Such a calibration standard
   should be useful for pre-launch calibration of future polarimetric
   sensors such as WindSat and CMIS.

   G. Hurricane Winds Experiment (HOWEX, 1997)

   The Hurricane Winds Experiment was held during August-September 1997
   for the purpose of augmenting the Labrador Sea wind vector data set
   with additional data over extremely high wind states associated with
   hurricanes. The configuration of the PSR on the NASA P-3 for HOWEX was
   identical to that for the Labrador Sea experiment. Sorties were flown
   out of Miami, FL and into the rainbands of hurricane Erika located
   southeast of Bermuda.

   H. CAMEX3 Deployment (1998)

   During August-September of 1998 the PSR was flown on the NASA DC-8
   aircraft as part of the Third Convection and Moisture Experiment
   (CAMEX3). The purpose of CAMEX3 was to study the formation, dynamics,
   and evolution of hurricanes and intense tropical convection using a
   variety of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Three
   experiments requiring specific flight patterns were performed: (1) an
   eye dynamics experiment in which the DC-8 flew down into hurricane eyes
   to observe the dynamics of the eyewall, (2) a synoptic flow experiment
   in which the DC-8 flew near the periphery of hurricanes to study the
   effects of prevailing conditions on rainband evolution, and (3) a
   landfalling tropical cyclone experiment in which the DC-8 overflew
   convection associated with a landfalling hurricane. One of the goals of
   CAMEX3 was to provide the scientific understanding of severe coastal
   weather necessary to be able to predict the need for evacuation more
   precisely than possible using existing methods. In addition, several
   flights were performed in association with the NASA   TRMM TExas and
   FLorida UNderflights experiment (TEFLUN) to study the satellite
   signatures produced by convective and stratiform precipitation.

   PSR/A was integrated into the nadir-7 port of the DC-8 for CAMEX3 and
   operated in both 52^o conically-scanned and cross-track scanned modes,
   depending on the aircraft maneuver. A new moving-map display for the
   PSR was used to provide near real-time brightness temperature imagery
   for both scientific and flight operations purposes. The display
   provided conically-scanned quick-look brightness temperature maps at
   the five PSR/A bands and at several polarizations.

   I. 1999 Mount Washington Icing Sensors Project (MWISP99)

   NOAA ETL participated in the 1999 Mount Washington Icing Sensors
   Project (MWISP99) by deploying the PSR/A scanhead in a ground-based
   configuration on the summit of Mt. Washington in New Hampshire. The
   purpose of MWISP99 was to obtain experimental signatures of supercooled
   liquid clouds viewed horizotnally using a foward-looking polarimetric
   radiometer under near-flight conditions. Such data is essential in
   developing aircraft sensors that can potentially detect aircraft icing
   conditions.  The conditions at the Mt. Washington summit (elevation
   6288', winds exceeding hurricane force (75 MPH) on an average of 104
   days a year, and cloud shrouded about 60% of the time) are ideal for
   near-flight observations of supercooled liquid clouds.

   During MWISP99 the PSR performed vertical range-height indicator (RHI)
   scans in an east-west plane using a field-of-view passing through both
   zenith and the westward horizon. Looking west, the PSR viewed over
   radar, radiometer, and lidar equipment located at the Mt. Washington
   Cog Railway Base site. A new sector-imaging scan mode was also
   implemented to obtain two-dimensional angular imagery of clouds as
   approaching from the west. The instrument operated successfully for
   over four weeks during this deployment.

   J. 1999 Southern Great Plains (SGP99) Experiment

   The 1999 Southern Great Plains Experiment was conducted from July 8th
   through 19th, 1999 over the USDA Oklahoma mesonet hydrological site.
   The goal of the experiment was to image soil moisture variations using
   S- and C-band radiometric channels. Although L-band channels provide
   greater direct sensitivity to soil moisture, the implementation of
   higher-frequency channels such as at S- and C-band is more
   straightforward on either aircraft or satellite platforms. In 2001,
   such a C-band imaging radiometer (the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer, or AMSR-E) will be operated as part of the NASA EOS Aqua
   platform. AMSR-E is a conically-scanned imaging sensor supporting a
   dual-polarization channel at 6.92 GHz. The utility of this AMSR band
   for soil moisture retrieval depends on the degree to which both
   beam-filling and vegetation effects can be compensated. To study these
   effects, as well as those of anthropogenic interference at the AMSR
   6.92-GHz band, a the PSR/C scanhead was flown on the NASA P-3 aircraft
   in grid patterns over central Oklahoma. The overflights included
   coverage almost daily coverage of the well-instrumented Little Washita
   hydrological site. The SGP99 data from the PSR over Oklahoma clearly
   show 50-70 K decreases in upwelling horizontally-polarized brightness
   temperature as the result of a major precipitation event that deposited
   1-2” of rain, along with increases in brightness of similar magnitude
   during the subsequent dry-down phase. The images obtained from this
   experiment represent the first application of high-resolution C-band
   radiometric imaging of soil moisture, in particular using
   constant-incidence angle conical scanning.

   K. 2000 Meltpond Experiment (MP00)

   As part of NASA’s Earth Observing System AQUA sea ice validation
   program for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), a
   series of aircraft flights using the PSR over melting arctic ice were
   performed.  The campaign, Meltpond 2000, occurred during June-July 2000
   with the objective of quantifying the errors incurred in proposed
   AMSR-E sea ice algorithms resulting from the presence of melting ponds
   on the surface of dissipating pack ice.  Melt ponds are currently the
   largest source of error in the determination of Arctic sea ice
   concentrations using satellite passive microwave sensors.  A secondary
   objective of Meltpond 2000 was to develop a microwave capability to
   discriminate between melt ponds and open sea water.

   The campaign focused on the use of the PSR for high-resolution
   polarimetric surface imaging, and involved the efforts of the Navy and
   personnel at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  A Navy P-3 aircraft
   made a series of five 8-hour flights over Baffin Bay (Figure 10),
   Viscount Melville Sound, and a Canadian ice camp near Resolute, Canada.
   The P-3 flew out of Thule Air Base, Greenland.  The aircraft was
   outfitted with one of two PSR scanheads operating at two key sets of
   radiometric bands. The PSR/A scanhead covered the bands of 10.7, 18.7,
   21.5, 37, and 89 GHz, and the PSR/C scanhead covered four bands from
   6.0 to 7.5 GHz. These two scanheads were used on alternate days, thus
   demonstrating the ability to swap PSR scanheads for different
   experiments under field conditions. The aircraft also carried the
   NOAA/NOS Scanning Low Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SLFMR), operating
   at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The complement of instruments provided a
   unique sensing package in terms of spectral coverage, polarization
   capability, and imaging spatial resolution. Satellite imagery provided
   additional information on surface conditions during the overflights.

    PSR/C Imagery from Baffin Bay

    Figure 10. PSR/C imagery of ice floes within Baffin Bay, July 7,
    2000. Observations were made

    at an altitude of 21,000 feet at 6.925 GHz, horizontal polarization,
    annd at an incident angle of 55^o.

    Open water areas are distinguished by cold brightness temperatures.

   The aircraft radiometer measurements elucidated the microwave spectral
   and polarimetric characteristics of the Arctic ice cover during the
   summer melt period. Final data processing is nearing completion, and
   the first paper stemming from this campaign will be presented at the
   fall 2000 Oceans from Space Meeting. Collaborators on the project
   included NOAA ETL scientists A.J. Gasiewski, M. Klein, A. Yevgrafov,
   and T. Uttal, NASA scientists D. Cavalieri, T. Markus, and E. Kim, and
   Lt. Miles Ervin of the Naval Air Warfare Center at Patuxent River NAS.
   Besides fabricating and operating the radiometer equipment, NOAA ETL
   engineers were heavily involved in the modification of the P-3, the
   installation of the radiometer equipment, and flight planning and
   operations.
