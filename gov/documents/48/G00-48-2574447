CAP WTC Missions

                                          last updated: September 25, 2001

Civil Air Patrol flies missions in wake of World Trade Center disaster

   Civil Air Patrol performed aerial imaging flights at the request of New
   York
   Governor George E. Pataki. The mission was just one of dozens flown
   across
   the country by Civil Air Patrol after Tuesday's disaster at the World
   Trade Center.
   The flights over the World Trade Center site provided high-resolution
   digital images to the New York State Emergency Management Office. The
   photos
   were delivered directly to SEMO and are being evaluated by that
   agency's
   Graphic Information Systems.
