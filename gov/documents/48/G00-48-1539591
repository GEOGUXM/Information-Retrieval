   Congressional Testimony - Driver Distraction
   Statement of L. Robert Shelton, Executive Director, National Highway
   Traffic Safety Administration before the Transportation Subcommittee of
   the Committee on Appropriations, United States House Of Representative
   - May 9, 2001
     __________________________________________________________________

   NHTSA held a Public Meeting and Internet Forum that focused on the
   potential safety implications associated with driver distraction while
   using advanced in-vehicle technologies that allow drivers to phone,
   fax, E-mail, obtain route guidance, view infrared images on a head-up
   display, operate multimedia entertainment systems, or use the Internet.
   Although the Internet Forum is now closed for comments, interested
   persons can read the technical papers and other contributions that had
   been made by researchers as well as the general public, through the
   link below.
   If you would like to submit your comments about driver distraction to
   NHTSA, please send them to the docket we have set up for this purpose
   at http://dmses.dot.gov/submit/ The docket number is NHTSA-1999-6270
   The public meeting was held on Tuesday, July 18, 2000, at which
   representatives of the public, industry, government, and safety groups
   were invited to share viewpoints, information, and recommendations
   regarding strategies and research to help minimize the safety
   consequences of distraction from these in-vehicle technologies.
   Information about the public meeting can be found in several of the
   links below.

     * Driver Distraction Internet Forum: Summary and Proceedings

   This 81 page report summarizes the July 5- August 11, 2000 virtual
   conference NHTSA sponsored to focus on the risks associated with
   driver distraction when using various in-vehicle electronic
   technologies. The report summarizes the technical research and
   public comments submitted to the forum.

     * Summary of NHTSA Driver Distraction Expert Working Group Meetings

   This report describes results of several meetings of technical
   experts to identify research initiatives that could help advance our
   understanding of the driver distraction safety problem and possible
   solutions.

     * NHTSA Wireless Communications Report: An Investigation of the
       Safety Implications of Wireless Communications in Vehicles

   The wireless communications industry is perhaps matched only by the
   personal computer field in the rate at which new products and
   features are being introduced to the marketplace. In the two years
   since the research for this report was initiated, the technology has
   changed dramatically and what was once a novelty, used primarily by
   businesses, has now become commonplace among the masses. Today,
   cellular telephones are owned by more than 50 million Americans and
   new technological breakthroughs have seen a migration from analog to
   digital architectures along with the recent introduction of
   "Personal Communications Services (PCS)" as a competitor to the
   cellular market. Driven by these developments, new capabilities
   beyond voice communications are being made available at an
   accelerated rate, compelling the user to upgrade to palm-size
   devices that allow activities such as checking of e-mail, "surfing
   the net," receiving stock quotes - from the classroom, the beach or
   perhaps from our vehicles.

     * NHTSA Report: Driver Distraction with Wireless Telecommunications
       and Route Guidance Systems

   Concerns have been raised in recent years about the distraction
   potential of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies
   including driver information systems such as route navigation
   systems. Results for this reserach suggest voice recognition
   technology is a viable alternative to visual-manual destination
   entry while driving.
