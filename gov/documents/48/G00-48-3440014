                  Recent Volcanic Activity Observed by TOMS
                               & Research News

   January 2002
   Earth Probe TOMS detected a small amount of SO2 from the eruption of
   Nyiragongo (DR Congo) on January 17. Despite the severity of the
   eruption, relatively little SO2 seems to have been produced,
   particularly compared to the SO2 clouds typically emitted by
   neighbouring Nyamuragira during its eruptions. Click here to see a
   comparison between SO2 clouds from Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira (data
   have been resampled).

   December 2001
   Poster presented at Origins, Emissions and Impacts of Volcanic Gases
   meeting (Geological Society of London, UK, October 2001) added to
   Library.

   September 2001
   QuikTOMS, the fifth TOMS satellite to be launched, unfortunately failed
   to achieve orbit on September 21. Click here for details.

   August 2001
   Earth Probe TOMS detected a small amount of SO2 in a volcanic cloud
   produced during a collapse of the Soufriere Hills lava dome on
   Montserrat on July 29. SO2 was detected NE of Puerto Rico on July 30,
   though no ash was detected. EP TOMS also sensed a weak ash and SO2
   plume from Tungurahua (Ecuador) on August 6.

   June 2001
   Earth Probe TOMS did not detect any sulfur dioxide or aerosols from
   recent eruptions of Lopevi (Vanuatu; 7/8 June), Manam (Papua New
   Guinea; 25 June) and Mayon (Philippines; 24-25 June).

   April 2001
   Earth Probe TOMS detected sulfur dioxide in small eruption clouds from
   Ulawun (Papua New Guinea) on April 30 and from Popocat√©petl (Mexico) on
   April 29. See the archive for images.

   31-March-00: Usu
   The eruption of Usu (Japan) was investigated with Earth Probe TOMS. The
   TOMS overpass at 02:10 UT (11:10 JST) on March 31, 2000 was prior to
   the phreatic eruption reported to begin at 13:10 JST. No SO2 was
   observed by TOMS. The high total ozone over the Usu region may be
   preventing detection of low level SO2 emissions; however, a
   stratospheric cloud would still be detected.
