                         The Wirtz Labor Library maintains both online and card catalogs. The
   online catalog, which can be searched here, comprises holdings added to
   the Library after January 1975. It also includes certain discrete
   collections selected for conversion cataloging (from print format to
   electronic) because of their historical significance, e.g. the Folio
   Collection, the James Taylor Collection.

   The card catalog provides a catalog record of pre-1975 Library
   holdings. It can be used on site in the Library, N-2445, Frances
   Perkins Building and reference staff can provide assistance in its use
   by telephone, (202) 219-6992.

   A long-term objective is to convert the entire catalog to electronic
   format and make it accessible online. At present, conversion cataloging
   is undertaken incrementally as funding permits.
