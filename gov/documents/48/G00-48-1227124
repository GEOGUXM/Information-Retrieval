                       [west_small.gif] Why Study Comets?

   Life on Earth began at the end of a period called the late heavy
   bombardment, some 3.8 billion years ago. Before this time, the influx
   of interplanetary debris that formed the Earth was so strong that the
   proto-Earth was far too hot for life to have formed. Under this heavy
   bombardment of asteroids and comets, the early Earth's oceans vaporized
   and the fragile carbon-based molecules, upon which life is based, could
   not have survived. The earliest known fossils on Earth date from 3.5
   billion years ago and there is evidence that biological activity took
   place even earlier - just at the end of the period of late heavy
   bombardment. So the window when life began was very short. As soon as
   life could have formed on our planet, it did. But if life formed so
   quickly on Earth and there was little in the way of water and
   carbon-based molecules on the Earth's surface, then how were these
   building blocks of life delivered to the Earth's surface so quickly?
   The answer may involve the collision of comets with the Earth, since
   comets contain abundant supplies of both water and carbon-based
   molecules.

   As the primitive, leftover building blocks of the outer solar system
   formation process, comets offer clues to the chemical mixture from
   which the giant planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. If we wish
   to know the composition of the primordial mixture from which the major
   planets formed, then we must determine the chemical constituents of the
   leftover debris from this formation process - the comets. Comets are
   composed of significant fractions of water ice, dust, and carbon-based
   compounds. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth,
   cometary collisions with the Earth have occurred in the past and
   additional collisions are forthcoming. It is not a question of whether
   a comet will strike the Earth, it is a question of when the next one
   will hit. It now seems likely that a comet struck near the Yucatan
   peninsula in Mexico some 65 million years ago and caused a massive
   extinction of more than 75% of the Earth's living organisms, including
   the dinosaurs.

   Comets have this strange duality whereby they first brought the
   building blocks of life to Earth some 3.8 billion years ago and
   subsequent cometary collisions may have wiped out many of the
   developing life forms, allowing only the most adaptable species to
   evolve further. Indeed, we may owe our preeminence at the top of
   Earth's food chain to cometary collisions. A catastrophic cometary
   collision with the Earth is only likely to happen at several million
   year intervals on average, so we need not be overly concerned with a
   threat of this type. However, it is prudent to mount efforts to
   discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes,
   compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future
   trajectories.

   As with asteroids, comets are both a potential threat and a potential
   resource for the colonization of the solar system in the twenty first
   century. Whereas asteroids are rich in the mineral raw materials
   required to build structures in space, the comets are rich resources
   for the water and carbon-based molecules necessary to sustain life. In
   addition, an abundant supply of cometary water ice can provide copious
   quantities of liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the two primary ingredients
   in rocket fuel. One day soon, comets may serve as fueling stations for
   interplanetary spacecraft.
