             Our Products

             The FHWA’s R&T program develops innovative products and practices
             for use in the transportation community. These come in many forms
             and include new materials, equipment standards, design guides,
             performance-based specifications or standards, analytical methods,
             testing procedures, and management or operating practices.

             Just as important as these products, however, is the program’s
             ability to infuse innovation by directly involving end-users in the
             development of new products and in operational tests.

             The program also encompasses training and technical assistance for
             users. Thus, through research, development, innovation, and
             technology transfer, the R&T Program serves its
             clients—transportation officials, experts, and users in the public
             and private sectors.
