  Rutgers University Invites Applications for an Atmospheric/Climate Modeling
  Professorship (Posted 01/07/02)

       blueball. Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, is accepting
       applications for a tenure-track or tenured position (Assistant,
       Associate, or Full) in atmospheric modeling and dynamics.
       Preference will be given to candidates with expertise in regional
       or global climate modeling, mesoscale modeling, ocean-atmosphere
       interactions, or land-atmosphere interactions. The appointment
       carries the responsibility to teach atmospheric dynamics at the
       undergraduate level and graduate level courses in the area of
       expertise, and to develop a well-funded and nationally recognized
       research program. The new faculty member will collaborate closely
       in the teaching and research programs of the Department of
       Environmental Sciences (http://envsci.rutgers.edu), the Center for
       Environmental Prediction (http://cep.rutgers.edu), and the
       Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences
       (http://marine.rutgers.edu). An earned Ph.D. in meteorology,
       atmospheric science, physics, or equivalent is required.
       Applications should include a statement of research and teaching
       interests; a curriculum vitae; and names, addresses (including
       electronic), and telephone numbers of three to five references.
       Electronic submission of all requested material to
       search@envsci.rutgers.edu is preferred. Non-electronic submission
       can be made to:
