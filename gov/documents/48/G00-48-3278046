   The following instruments fly on TERRA (polar sun-synchronous orbit,
   10:30 a.m. descending node): Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
   Reflection Radiometer (ASTER); Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy
   System (CERES) (two identical scanners); Multi-angle Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MISR); Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS); Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT).

     * ASTER - Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
       Radiometer
     * CERES - Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System
     * MISR - Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer
     * MODIS - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer
     * MOPITT - Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere

   The spacecraft accommodates the instruments on an Earth facing bus
   launched on an ATLAS IIAS vehicle. The primary structure is a
   graphite-epoxy tubular truss. Waste heat is rejected from ASTER and
   MOPITT using a capillary-pumped heat transport system. High rate data
   (up to 108 Mbps peak) is handled by the data system and stored in a
   high capacity (148 Gb) solid state recorder. Data downlink is via TDRSS
   Ku-band or direct-to-ground X-band. Spacecraft position determination
   is via TDRSS On-board Navigation Systems (TONS).
