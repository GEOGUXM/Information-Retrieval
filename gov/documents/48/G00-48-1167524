                              National Programs

     The mission of the Biological Resources Discipline -- to work with
     others to provide the scientific understanding and technologies
     needed to support the sound management and conservation of our
     Nation's biological resources -- helps explain the depth and scope
     of many of our programs.

     Fundamentally, the BRD is committed to programs that prevent costly
     environmental train wrecks ... programs that help us protect
     ecosystems and plan for the future. Where appropriate, these
     programs have a national orientation. Key partners in many of these
     endeavors include Interior resource management bureaus, other
     Federal agencies, States, and private organizations with regional
     and ecosystem-specific interests.

     National Programs
     * Arctic Science Program
       A cooperative program of research on landscapes and species (bird,
       mammal, and fish) in the arctic and subarctic ecosystems.
     * Biomonitoring Environmental Status and Trends (BEST)
       A program designed to identify and understand the effects of
       environmental contaminants on biological resources.
     * Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL)
       The North American Bird Banding Program is jointly administered by
       the USGS Biological Resources Division and the Canadian Wildlife
       Service to study the movement, survival, and behavior of birds.
     * Decision Support Systems
       Description of BRD Decision Support System activities and
       initiatives.
     * Directory of Research Systematics Collections
       Searchable database of information on the Nation's natural history
       collections. Jointly maintained by the USGS and the Association of
       Systematics Collections.
     * Gap Analysis Program (GAP)
       A geographic approach for assessing the current protection status
       of biological diversity over large geographic areas.
     * Global Change Research Program
       The U.S. Global Change Research Program contributes to an
       understanding of the processes and impacts of global climate
       change.
     * Geospatial Technology Program
       Provides national coordination for the use and application of
       geographic information systems, remote sensing technologies,
       satellite positioning systems, telemetry, and thematic mapping in
       accordance with the BRD Geospatial Technology Strategic Plan.
     * Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS)
       A standard reference on nomenclature and taxonomy of plants and
       animals.
     * Land Use History of North America (LUHNA)
       A multi-year project to prepare a scientifically based "history" of
       land use change across North America, from prehistoric times to the
       present.
     * National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII)

     A Web-based system that provides information on the nation's
     biological resources.

     * National Ecological Surveys Team (NEST)
       Evaluates ecological inventory, monitoring, and analysis programs;
       designs nationwide species and population monitoring surveys;
       develops methods for the analysis of resulting data to estimate the
       status and trends of the Nation's biotic diversity; and maintains
       partnerships with cooperating organizations for analysis and
       management.
     * National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA)
       Designed to describe the status and trends in the quality of the
       Nation's ground- and surface-water resources and to provide a sound
       understanding of the natural and human factors that affect the
       quality of these resources.
     * North American Breeding Bird Survey
       A source of population trend and distribution information for most
       species of North American birds.
     * Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program
       A national information resource for accurate and spatially
       referenced biogeographic accounts of nonindigenous aquatic species.
     * NPFlora and NPFauna databases
       Databases of vertebrate and vascular plant occurrences in the
       National Parks.
     * Species at Risk
       A program that develops information that will lead to the
       stabilization of declining populations and reduce or eliminate the
       need for additional listings under the Endangered Species Act.
     * Standards and Protocols (S&P)
       A compendium of annotated protocols and methods for monitoring
       biological and/or ecological resources.
     * Status and Trends
       Information on published reports concerning the status and trends
       of biological resources in the United States.
       Status and Trends Reports
       LaRoe, E.T., G.S. Farris, C.E. Puckett, P.D. Doran, and M.J. Mac,
       editors. 1995. Our living resources: a report to the nation on the
       distribution, abundance, and health of U.S. plants, animals, and
       ecosystems. National Biological Service, Washington, D.C. [ISBN
       024-010-00708-7]
       Mac, M.J., P.A. Opler, C.E. Puckett Haeker, and P.D. Doran. 1998.
       Status and trends of the Nation's biological resources. 2 vols.

       Geological Survey, Reston, Va. [ISBN 016053285X]
     * Taxonomic Resources Expertise Directory (TRED)
       A directory of taxonomic specialists for the species of North
       America (north of Mexico) and adjacent oceans. Taxonomy, or
       systematics, is the part of biological science that describes and
       names the animal and plant species of the world and studies the
       relationships among all these species.
     * U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program
       A Federal interagency program providing an interdisciplinary
       approach to address environmental problems, land use, and
       conservation issues.  Man and the Biosphere Species Databases
       contain species lists for Biosphere Reserves.
     * Vegetation Mapping Program
       A multi-year project to produce vegetation maps of 235 natural
