   What is GeoMAC?


   The Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination Group or GeoMAC, is an
   internet-based mapping tool originally designed for fire managers to
   access online maps of current fire locations and perimeters in 12
   western states. Using a standard web browser, fire personnel can
   download this information to pinpoint the affected areas. With the
   growing concern of western wildland fires in the summer of 2000, this
   application also became available to the public. We hope that you find
   this important information both timely and helpful.

   The Team


   The team is a multi-agency group with technical and subject matter
   experts from the Department of Interior's fire management agencies -
   the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As the sole science
   agency for the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Geological Survey
   also plays a pivotal role.

   Other partners include the National Interagency Fire Center, U.S.
   Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and the National Oceanic &
   Atmospheric Administration. Private corporations like ESRI, ERDAS, Sun
   Microsystems, and IBM provided mapping software applications, computer
   hardware and technical expertise to the GeoMAC effort.
