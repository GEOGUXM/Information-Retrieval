                       USAID's Accessibility Statement

                                                       >> USAID Home Page

      The U.S. Agency for International Development strives to make its
      external web site fully accessible to users with disabilities, in
     accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. We are aware
    that some of the information on our site pre-dates these regulations
    and may be difficult to navigate. We are working to remedy this where
   possible. If you experience any difficulties with accessibility, please
    do not hesitate to contact our webmaster at webmaster@info.usaid.gov.

      The site has been tested using IBM Home Page Reader and JAWS for
      Windows. Many of the documents included on this site are in Adobe
   Portable Document Format (PDF) and require the Adobe Acrobat Reader or
    PDFViewer plug-in. This software is available for free download from
   Adobe. If you need to access a PDF through a screen reader, then please
   follow the instructions on Adobe's Acrobat Access 4.0 for Windows page.
     Additional plug-ins required may include Real Media Player or Apple
      QuickTime. In the case of video and audio clips, transcripts are
      provided. Please contact webmaster@info.usaid.gov if you find one
                                  missing.
