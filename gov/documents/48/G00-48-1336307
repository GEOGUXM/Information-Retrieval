   DirectorÂ’s Summary

   Fuel Development
     * Using x-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering techniques,
       oxide content in LANL-synthesized ZrN used for radiation tolerance
       studies was measured, indicating very low oxide content. This
       confirms that radiation damage studies examine damage in the
       nitride rather than the oxide, providing a mechanism in the future
       to examine the role of a surface oxide layer in enhancing or
       inhibiting sintering of nitrides.
     * The capability to perform "cold" (surrogate) fuel work in an inert
       glovebox environment has been established.
     * Candidate fuel matrix compositions and potential sintering aids
       that may be added to nitride fuels have been identified. Careful
       examination of these materials will be performed before final
       candidates are selected for testing.
     * We resolved several issues related to the physical design of the
       ATW-1 experiment capsule design with ATR experiments staff at
       INEEL. A second draft of the ATW-1 Fuel Specification was reviewed.
       Two iterations on end plug design were completed based on weld
       development test results. Independent chemical certification of end
       plug stock was completed.
     * The document, Transmutation Fuel Development for the Advanced
       Accelerator Applications (AAA) Program: Objectives, Functions,
       Requirements, and Approach was drafted and circulated for review.
     * ANL-W hosted a Transmuter Fuel Development Workshop in Idaho Falls
       during November. The workshop was successful in bringing to light
       the current status of transmuter fuel development worldwide, and
       also served as a forum for discussion of research and development
       work that should be performed to advance the state of knowledge.

   Separations Technology
     * Detailed analysis of the results of the September cold
       demonstration of the UREX process has shown that the target
       decontamination of the uranium product could have been achieved
       with the addition of two more scrub stages. This finding will be
       incorporated into design of the UREX hot demonstration.
     * The UREX hot demonstration is now scheduled for July of 2002. Fuel
       dissolution will be done prior to that time. Multiple runs are
       planned, to enable tests of flowsheet modifications.
     * Experimental setup and safety reviews have been completed for a
       test of plutonium electro-winning (a PYRO-A process step) to be
       carried out in December.

   Transmutation Science
     * For the Materials Test Loop (MTL) at Los Alamos:
            - The Hazard Control Plan and Procedures were approved and
            signed.
            - The Readiness Review Pre-Start findings were addressed, and
            the Readiness Review Committee has approved the facility for
            operation, and final facility preparations were conducted.
            - The loop was preheated, filled with LBE, and drained.
            - Initial operation is planned for the first week in December.
            - The results of the oxygen sensor development, Russian
            corrosion test of US steels and kinetic modeling were
            presented at the Winter American Nuclear Society (ANS)
            Conference.

     * For the lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) target neutron yield and
       spectrum experiments:
            - Fabrication of an LBE target and support equipment was
            completed.
            - Two flight paths were re-conditioned and tested for
            time-of-flight measurements. Collimators were aligned and
            detector electronics tested.
            - Activation foil materials were obtained and prepared for
            target irradiations which will begin in December.
     * For the corrosion probe experiments:
            - Sample materials necessary for experiments were procured and
            corrosion sample preparation completed.
            - Design was completed and fabrication of an assembly for the
            immersion of samples in LBE furnace was started. These samples
            will then be used in subsequent corrosion and surface
            analytical experiments
     * For the sodium-LBE compatibility experiments:
            - The remaining sodium and lead-bismuth compatibility tests
            were performed by injecting molten LBE into molten Na.
     * For the helium and hydrogen production experiments:
            - We reduced the background by tightening up the collimation
            with no loss of beam intensity.
            - We increased the sensitivity to charged particles by
            optimizing detector thresholds.
            - We obtained one sample of iron and began measurements to
            quantify the signal-to-background with an emphasis on neutron
            energies above 50 MeV, which are the most difficult to
            collimate and shield.
     * For the import of the IPPE target, shipping quotations were
       obtained and the shipping company selected. LANL customs
       specialists are working with ISTC to arrange all necessary
       paperwork and logistics.

     * In physics work:
            - MCNPX version 2.2.6 was released and extensively tested.
            Notification has been given to RSICC that this version (with
            minor changes under the name 2.3.0) for general release in
            December.
            - Arrangements for an MCNPX class were completed with the
            University of Nevada at Las Vegas. The class will run from
            January 14-18, 2002, and already includes 13 AAA university
            program students.
            - We met with representatives from Saclay, France, to discuss
            inclusion of the Cugnon and Schmidt models into MCNPX as part
            of the FY02 AAA activities. A memorandum of understanding was
            drafted for review by both the French and American programs
            outlining how this would be accomplished.

   Accelerator Development
     * Preparations have been underway to close out the accelerator
       development program.

   Systems Studies - Multi-Tier Transmutation / Report to Congress
     * We examined adapting a computer systems model developed originally
       for a broader nuclear-fuel-cycle scenario study to meet AAA goals.
     * We reviewed past efforts on nuclear-fuel-cycle optimization
       methodologies that invoke economic, waste, and proliferation
       objectives.
     * We reviewed a full range of proliferation metrics for possible
       inclusion in AAA.
     * We are reviewing various approaches to Multi-Criteria Analysis.
     * We reviewed past work regarding and modified codes to calculate the
       radiotoxicity of long-lived spallation products from various
       targets.
     * A paper on the use of Light Water Reactors in the transmutation of
       spent nuclear fuel was presented at the Winter ANS conference.
     * We have made significant progress in developing the time-dependent
       capabilities required for calculating life-cycle costs and
       proliferation risk required for the Report to Congress. An example
       of this progress is that we are now able to project the mass of
       spent nuclear fuel produced by the currently operating US nuclear
       power plants as a function of time under various assumptions
       regarding the length of possible extensions of their operating
       licenses.

   AAA University Programs
     * UNLV AAA University Participation Program - About 20 UNLV students
       attended the ANS student mini-conference. Two UNLV students won
       awards for best presentation. We secured former Nevada governor
       Robert List as the keynote speaker at the Winter ANS conference
       banquet.
     * AAA University Fellowship Program - Seven Fellows attended the ANS
       student mini-conference in Reno, four made oral presentations. The
       ANS conference included 32 presentations that were based on
       AAA-sponsored university programs.
     * Idaho Accelerator Center - The IAC submitted draft plan, statement
       of work, milestones, and deliverables for ISU-IAC participation in
       the project.
