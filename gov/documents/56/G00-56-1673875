                              Imaging Questions
     __________________________________________________________________

   Plat Maps

   1. I have the Assessor's Parcel number and can not view the associated
   map.
   2. I receive the message "PlatMap not found.   The PlatMap you
   requested does not exist."

   Public access to Recorded Documents Site

   1. When I print an image from the web browser the complete image does
   not print.
   2. I receive the message "Image Not Available"
   3. I receive the message "Your session has timed out. You must do a New
   Search to restart the session. If you logged on using a password you
   must reenter your password to start a new session" when I did not use a
   password.
   4. When I try to view an Unofficial Document I get a broken image icon
   at the top of the page.

   Assessor's Parcel number
   The Assessor's Parcel number has no correlation to the required
   Recorder's number.  The Recorder's number can be found on a legal
   description of the property.

   Not Found
   All maps have not been scanned.  If you are positive the number you
   entered is a Recorder's Plat Map number, then you may need to visit our
   downtown office at 111 S. 3rd Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85003, to view the map.

   Print Command
   The print command from any browser will not print the entire image.
   The image can be downloaded to a machine, then opened in imaging
   software and resized for optimal printing.  Alternately, a viewer that
   supports the PNG file type can be installed as a plugin to your
   browser.   Many viewers resize the image for optimal printing.

   Image Not Available
   The system may be down, and all or some images may currently not be
   available.

   Timed out
   Delete all the temporary internet files from your browser's
   cache(memory).

   View
   Upgrade your browser to its most recent version.
