                                      KIVA

   (updated 8/22/99)

   KIVA, a transient, three-dimensional, multiphase, multicomponent code
   for the analysis of chemically reacting flows with sprays has been
   under development at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the past
   several years. The code uses an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)
   methodology on a staggered grid, and discretizes space using the
   finite-volume technique. The code uses an implicit time-advancement
   with the exception of the advective terms that are cast in an explicit
   but second-order monotonicity-preserving manner. Also, the convection
   calculations can be subcycled in the desired regions to avoid
   restricting the time step due to Courant conditions. The range of
   validity of the code extends from low speeds to supersonic flows for
   both laminar and turbulent regimes. Arbitrary numbers of species and
   chemical reactions are allowed. A stochastic particle method is used to
   calculate evaporating liquid sprays, including the effects of droplet
   collisions and aerodynamic breakups. Although specifically designed for
   performing internal combustion engine calculations, the modularity of
   the code allows it for easy modifications for solving a variety of
   hydrodynamics problems involving chemical reactions. The code has found
   a widespread application in the automotive industry.
