   This page will help you determine if you have a document or TIFF viewer
   already available (click here to go directly to Step 3 for the test).
   If you were not able to see the document in Step 3, then you will need
   to install a document viewer. If you are using Windows 95/98/NT then go
   to step one. If you are using a Macintosh computer please go directly
   to Step 2. The viewer installs itself into your current internet
   browser to view the documents.

Step 1: Do You Need a Viewer?

   For Windows 95/98/NT:

   Go to the Start button (usually found on the bottom of your screen) and
   click on it. On the pop up menu go up to "Programs", then "Accessories"
   and see if there is a program called "Imaging". If you do NOT find
   imaging there please proceed to Step 2 and select a viewer to install.
   If you have this program you do not need to install a viewer. You may
   use "Imaging" to be able to view our images. Please proceed to Step 3
   to test the ability of your viewer.

Step 2: Get A Viewer

   The sites listed below contain instructions on how to download image
   viewers for your computer. The viewers are available for evaluation
   purposes but must be purchased according to the vendors guidelines.
   Imaging for Windows is a Free application. Viewers are available for
   both PC and Macintosh computers and for all popular internet browsers.

   Each of the sites above has detailed information for installation.
   Follow these instructions to complete installation of your chosen
   viewer.

   Click below to choose a viewer that will work with your computer:

   File Search and search for "Lemke".  Download ver. 3.1.1.  This should
   take about 20 minutes.

Step 3: Test the Viewer

   Test your viewer with this 3-page image.

Step 4: Go to the search page

   to the search page, perform a query, and then select a document from
   the "hitlist".  The "View Image" button will be at the bottom of the
   document page.  Selecting the button will open the document image.
