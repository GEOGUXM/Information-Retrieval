   The ALIAS-II instrument is a 2-channel version of the ALIAS-I (ER-2)
   instrument, with identical electronics, dewar configuration, and
   instrument- and data processing- software, built in 1993 under funding
   from NASAÂ’s High-Speed Research Program (HSRP) and Upper Atmospheric
   Research Program (UARP) to measure N[2]O, CH[4], and H[2]O on the UAV
   Perseus in a nose-to-wing path.  The spectrometer was reconfigured in
   1994 to fly on a lightweight balloon gondola. In this configuration,
   ALIAS-II measures HCl, N[2]O, and CH[4], in a very clean, open path
   defined as the 64-meter (to 128-meter) open cradle optical cell
   (balloon). The instrument weighs about 65 lbs in its balloon
   configuration. ALIAS-II has made 8 balloon flights out of Ft.Sumner,
   New Mexico, Fairbanks, Alaska, Juarzerio del
   Norte, Brazil, and during the SOLVE mission out of Esrange, Sweden, to
   study the coupling of photochemistry and transport.  See our SOLVE
   webpage.
