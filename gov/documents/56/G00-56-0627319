   PART II: Subject Matter Skills and Abilities Applicable to the Content
   Domains of Mathematics Candidates for Single Subject Teaching
   Credentials in mathematics use inductive and deductive reasoning to
   develop, analyze, draw conclusions, and validate conjectures and
   arguments. As they reason, they use counterexamples, construct proofs
   using contradictions, and create multiple representations of the same
   concept. They know the interconnections among mathematical ideas, and
   use techniques and concepts from different domains and sub-domains to
   model the same problem. They explain mathematical interconnections with
   other disciplines. They are able to communicate their mathematical
   thinking clearly and coherently to others, orally, graphically, and in
   writing, through the use of precise language and symbols. Candidates
   solve routine and complex problems by drawing from a variety of
   strategies while demonstrating an attitude of persistence and
   reflection in their approaches. They analyze problems through pattern
   recognition and the use of analogies. They formulate and prove
   conjectures, and test conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy. They
   use counterexamples to disprove conjectures. Candidates select and use
   different representational systems (e.g., coordinates, graphs). They
   understand the usefulness of transformations and symmetry to help
   analyze and simplify problems. They make mathematical models to analyze
   mathematical structures in real contexts. They use spatial reasoning to
   model and solve problems that cross disciplines. Mathematics, Part II 1
