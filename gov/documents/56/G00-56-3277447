   Common Questions
   about Employment at CIA

      We get many e-mails and letters regarding employment and student
      programs. The following are the most frequently asked questions (FAQs)
      we receive and answers to them. Please review them before submitting
      questions via our online E-mail Form. For additional information about
      the Agency's mission and history, please visit the general information
      website at www.cia.gov.

   I am a student considering a future career at the CIA, what courses should I
   take or what major should I choose?

      We do not recommend any one academic track over another. CIA employees
      come from a wide variety of academic backgrounds, as you will see by
      studying the positions advertised under the All Positions link.

      The Agency's personnel requirements change from month to month as
      positions are filled and others become available. Our best advice to
      you is to work hard and get good grades. Fluency in a foreign language
      is a plus. Integrity, character, and patriotism are a must.

   If I don't have a degree, will experience count?

      Having an undergraduate degree is not mandatory, but is highly
      recommended. Life experiences are taken into consideration. However, a
      standard requirement for overseas officers, intelligence analysts, and
      other non-clerical positions, is a college degree, preferably an
      advanced degree.

   Do I need to be a United States citizen to work for the Central Intelligence
Agency?

   Yes, you must be a citizen of the United States when you apply to work
   for the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA does not assist
   individuals in applying for US citizenship.

What is the minimum age for employment at the Agency?

   You must be at least 18 years of age.

What student programs does the CIA offer?

   The Central Intelligence Agency offers three programs for students
   considering a career in the intelligence field. Each program offers
   valuable educational and practical work experience that enhances the
   student's chosen field of study and prepares them for the future. These
   positions are extremely competitive and most students hired by the CIA
   are recommended through their campus cooperative education programs.
   Students are given a salary and excellent benefits. The CIA does not
   offer financial grants or scholarships.

   The three programs are:
     * Undergraduate Student Trainee (Co-op) Program
     * Internship Program
     * Graduate Studies Program

I am in the military. Can I transfer to the CIA to fulfill my obligation?

   No. You must fulfill your obligation to the armed services. You should
   apply via the website as your final year of service begins if you are
   interested in seeking employment with the Agency. You should also know
   that the CIA is not a veteran's preference agency.

What if I used drugs or still use drugs; will this disqualify me from
employment?

   If you are a recent or frequent user of illegal drugs, including
   marijuana, you need to know that CIA is a drug-free workplace. Drug
   abuse is one of the common reasons applicants are denied a security
   clearance, you cannot work for the CIA without a security clearance.
   You can find more information on this subject at BEFORE YOU APPLY.

Does the CIA discriminate in hiring practices?

   The Agency does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion,
   sex, national origin, disability, age, or sexual orientation in
   granting, denying, or revoking security clearances.

How do I apply for a job at the CIA?

   There are two ways to apply for a job at the CIA. The preferred and
   strongly recommended method is the online resume submission found at
   the bottom of each position advertised on the Employment website.
   Clandestine Service Positions must be mailed in to a separate P.O. box
   address. Multiple online submissions are unnecessary and will slow the
   processing of your resume.

   A confirmation of submission success will appear on your screen upon
   submission of the form. This is the only acknowledgment you will
   receive, unless we elect to contact you to discuss a position. It is
   not necessary to call to check on your resume status or continue to
   send multiple resumes.

   If you choose to mail your resume and cover letter, please send them
   to:

     Recruitment Center
     Attn: (fill in position applying for)
     PO Box 4090, Dept: Internet
     Reston, VA 20195

   For Clandestine Service Positions:

     CST Division
     P.O. Box 4605, Dept: Internet
     Reston, VA 20195

What is involved in the application process? How long does it take?

   Because of the classified nature of our work at the Central
   Intelligence Agency, the application process is a lengthy one.
   Depending on an applicant's specific circumstances, the process may
   take as little as two months or more than a year.

   Each applicant must undergo a thorough background investigation
   examining your life's history, your character, trustworthiness,
   reliability and soundness of judgment. Also examined is one's freedom
   from conflicting allegiances, potential to be coerced and willingness
   and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling and the
   protection of sensitive information. The Agency uses the polygraph to
   check the veracity of this information. The hiring process also entails
   a thorough medical examination of one's mental and physical fitness to
   perform essential job functions.

What are some of the benefits CIA offers employees?

   The Central Intelligence Agency offers its employees many benefits and
   most of them are competitive with private industry. These include:
     * Paid Time Off
     * Federal Health and Life Insurance
     * Retirement
     * Education and Training
     * Health Services
     * Child Care Centers
     * Credit Union
