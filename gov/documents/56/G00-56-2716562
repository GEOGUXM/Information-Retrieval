   In-Home Health/Medical Care Services

   In-home health and medical care services provided in the home make it
   possible for many people with serious health problems to continue to
   live in their own homes and communities instead of in special care
   facilities. Home health care and other private agencies hire and train
   individuals to provide this type of assistance.
