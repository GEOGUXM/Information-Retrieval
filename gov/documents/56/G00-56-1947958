  Focus on Clinical Trial

   Are you a woman aged 21-45 in treatment for depression?
   If so, you may be at increased risk for early-onset osteoporosis. The
   NIMH is conducting a study--at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda,
   Maryland--to examine whether a FDA-approved medication for osteoporosis
   is effective in maintaining or increasing bone mass in women with
   depression. Eligible participants will receive medical, dietary, and
   stress hormone evaluations, including bone mineral density
   measurements. This is not a treatment study for depression. See
   ClinicalTrials.gov or call 301-496-5645. More
