   202.414.6921 www.ofheo.gov OFHEO ISSUES QUARTERLY MINIMUM CAPITAL
   CLASSIFICATION REPORT INCLUDING CRITICAL CAPITAL FOR FANNIE MAE AND
   FREDDIE MAC WASHINGTON, D.C. - Armando Falcon, Jr., Director of the
   Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), announced that
   both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) were adequately
   capitalized at September 30, 2001. The Federal Housing Enterprises
   Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires the OFHEO Director
   to determine the capital level and classification of the Enterprises
   not less than quarterly, and to report the results to Congress. OFHEO
   determines whether the Enterprises are adequately capitalized,
   undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically
   undercapitalized. OFHEO has determined: - Fannie Mae's minimum capital
   requirement was $23.130 billion and its critical capital level was
   $11.785 billion at September 30, 2001. Thus, Fannie Mae's core capital
   of $23.778 billion on that date exceeded the minimum capital
   requirement by $648 million and exceeded the critical capital level by
   $11.993 billion.* - Freddie Mac's minimum capital requirement was
   $17.335 billion and its critical capital level was $8.836 billion at
   September 30, 2001. Thus, Freddie Mac's core capital of $17.743 billion
   on that date exceeded the minimum capital requirement by $408 million
   and exceeded the critical capital level by $8.907 billion.* *Although
   OFHEO's risk-based capital rule is final, the 1992 Act provides a
   one-year period between its effective date (September 13, 2001) and the
   time OFHEO may classify an Enterprise based on its risk- based capital
   requirement. Therefore, during this period, OFHEO will continue to
   classify the Enterprises based on their minimum capital requirement.

   202.414.3823 Minimum capital represents an essential amount of capital
   needed to protect an Enterprise against broad categories of business
   risk. For purposes of minimum capital, an Enterprise is considered
   adequately capitalized if core capital - common stock; perpetual
   noncumulative preferred stock; paid- in capital; and retained earnings
   - equals or exceeds minimum capital. OFHEO's risk-based capital
   requirement is the amount of total capital - core capital plus a
   general allowance for foreclosure losses - that an Enterprise must hold
   to absorb projected losses flowing from future severe interest-rate and
   credit-risk conditions, plus 30 percent to cover management and
   operations risk. OFHEO began announcing the Enterprises' critical
   capital levels as part of its quarterly report on Feb. 13, 2001. The
   critical capital level is the amount of core capital below which an
   Enterprise must be classified as critically undercapitalized and
   generally must be placed in conservatorship. Critical capital levels
   are computed consistent with the Federal Housing Enterprises' Safety
   and Soundness Act of 1992 as follows: One-half of the portion of
   minimum capital level associated with on-balance-sheet assets plus
   five-ninths of the portion of the minimum capital level associated with
   off-balance-sheet obligations. OFHEO's final risk-based capital rule
   was published Sept. 13, 2001 in the Federal Register. To view the rule
   go to www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fedreg/a010913c.html. The rule is
   considered enforceable one year after publication, (Sept.13, 2002).
   OFHEO issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for improvements to the
   final risk-based capital rule on Dec. 11. Interested parties will have
   30 days to comment on the proposal from the date of publication in the
   Federal Register, which is expected to be Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2001. OFHEO
   is an independent office within the Department of Housing and Urban
   Development. It is funded through assessments on Fannie Mae and Freddie
   Mac and uses no taxpayer dollars. OFHEO's regulatory authority is
   similar to other Federal financial regulators such as the Office of the
   Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora- tion and the Federal Reserve Board.
   ### OFHEO was established as an independent entity within the
   Department of Housing and Urban Development by the Federal Housing
   Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (Title XIII of
   P.L. 102-550). OFHEO's primary mission is ensuring the capital adequacy
   and financial safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 1700
