   About The First Judicial District
   City Hall Philadlephia, PA. The First Judicial District (FJD) of
   Pennsylvania is composed of the three courts which make up the
   Philadelphia County Court System: the Court of Common Pleas; Municipal
   Court; and Traffic Court. The operations of the First Judicial District
   of Pennsylvania are controlled by an Administrative Governing Board
   which consists of the President Judges of the Court of Common Pleas,
   Municipal Court and Traffic Court, the Administrative Judges of the
   three divisions of the Court of Common Pleas, the Administrative Judge
   of Municipal Court, the Administrative Judge of Traffic Court, and the
   Administrator of the Pennsylvania Courts. The Chairperson of the Board
   is appointed annually by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

   The COURT OF COMMON PLEAS is a ninety (90) judge court of general trial
   jurisdiction. The Court of Common Pleas is headed by the President
   Judge and is organized into three divisions based on case types. Each
   is led by an Administrative Judge. The Trial Division is responsible
   for most of criminal and civil cases; the Family Division is
   responsible for domestic relations matters (divorce, custody, child
   support and domestic violence) and juvenile cases (delinquency,
   dependency, and adoptions); and the Orphans' Division is responsible
   for cases involving estates, wills and trusts.

   The twenty-two (22) judge MUNICIPAL COURT is the Philadelphia court of
   limited jurisdiction. The Municipal Court is led by the President Judge
   and Administrative Judge and is organized into Criminal and Civil
   Divisions. The Criminal Division is responsible for adult criminal
   cases carrying a maximum sentence of incarceration of five (5) years or
   less. Municipal Court has initial jurisdiction in processing every
   criminal arrest in Philadelphia and conducts preliminary hearings for
   all felony cases. The Civil Division shares jurisdiction with the Court
   of Common Pleas in civil cases where the amount in controversy is
   $10,000 or less, handles all landlord-tenant disputes, hears certain
   code enforcement cases, and is responsible for all real estate and
   school tax cases of $15,000 or less. Because a defendant does not have
   the right to a jury trial, all cases may be appealed to the Court of
   Common Pleas for a trial de novo.

   The six judge TRAFFIC COURT is led by the President Judge and
   Administrative Judge and adjudicates all cases originating in
   Philadelphia involving moving traffic violations. Like Municipal Court,
   all adjudications in Traffic Court are directly appealable to the Court
   of Common Pleas.
