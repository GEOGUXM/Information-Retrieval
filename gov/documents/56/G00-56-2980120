Summary

   NERSC introduced new software to manage accounts in Fiscal Year 2001. A
   web interface is used to view and modify accounting and user
   information. The system is called the NERSC Information Management
   (NIM) system and it replaces the old CUB system.

   A major update to the NIM system was released on June 6, 2001. The new
   interface provides access to ERCAP allocation request functions.

   Getting Started Back to Index

   Logging in to NIM and browser requirements
          You log into NIM via your web browser. NIM works with current
          browsers using the standard settings, but you may have to change
          your custom settings. You need a valid NERSC username and NIM
          password.

   First-time login
          You must change your NIM password the first time you log in.

   Navigation frames and initial display
          NIM communicates with you through three frames in your web
          browser: the top left Menu Frame (see Menus and Links, below),
          the top right Query Frame, and the bottom Result Frame. You'll
          see a brief help frame and your usage summary immediately after
          you log in.

   getnim: the command line interface
          The inquiry-only command called getnim is used interactively and
          in scripts to get account (login name and repo) balances.

          you are the PI.

          Displays a listing of the ERCAP allocation requests for which
          you are the proxy for the PI (i.e. you have the PI's permission
          to submit the request).

   My Projects' Requests or Other Requests
          Displays a listing of the ERCAP allocation requests for projects
          in which you are a member (but not the PI or PI Proxy).

  Search & Reports Menu

   When you choose something from the Search & Reports pull-down-menu the
   resulting Query Frame will display a form that allows you to specify
   the criteria you want to use for executing your search.

   People/Logins
          Used to perform a search to find information about NERSC users.
          The selection criteria you can specify in the resulting Query
          Frame are Last Name, First Name, Login Name, Work Phone, Email
          Address, Organization, and State. If you want information about

          repositories. The selection criteria you can specify in the
          resulting Query Frame are Repo Name, PI Last Name, Allocation
          Type (e.g. production, startup), Resource Type (MPP, PVP), DOE
          Office and Program. If you want information about just one
          repository, use the Repository Quick Search instead.

   Rept: Daily Usage
          Used to perform a search to find information on daily usage by
          users or repositories. The selection criteria you can specify in
          the resulting Query Frame are: Login Name, Host Name (e.g.

          Job Month (e.g. October, March), Organization, Allocation Type
          (e.g. production, startup), Resource Type (MPP, PVP), DOE Office
          and Program.

   Rept: Year to date (for repo managers or higher)
          You can perform a search to find repositories to include in a
          year-to-date report on repository usage. The selection criteria
          you can specify in the resulting Query Frame are: Repo Name, PI
          Last Name, Organization, Allocation Type (e.g. production,
          startup), Resource Type (MPP, PVP), DOE Office and Program.

   Transactions (for repo managers or higher)
          You can perform a search for information about time transfers
          from/to repositories and reserves. The selection criteria you
          can specify in the resulting Query Frame are: From Adminunit
          (e.g. repo name, DOE Office or Program reserve), To Adminunit,
          Last Name (of the person who made the transfer), Transaction
          Date (e.g. 09-OCT-01), Resource Type (MPP, PVP).

  Actions Menu

   Bug Report

          problems with the NIM web interface.

   Change Password
          Brings up a form in the Result Frame that allows you to change

          This form is for people who wish to be new PIs or for a PI to
          designate a new PI Proxy.

   Add/Delete User (for repo managers or higher)
          Opens a new window with a form that allows PIs and Repo Managers
          to request that a user be added to or deleted from a repository.

   Transfer Resources (for repo managers or higher)
          Authorized PIs and managers can transfer time time from their
          repository (or other administrative unit like DOE Office or
          Program reserve) to another "administrative unit".

  Repository / Login Name Quick Search

   By selecting Repository (the default setting) or Login Name from this
   pull-down-menu you can display information about a specific repository
