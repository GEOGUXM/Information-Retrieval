   When Mathew Mickens' science teacher recommended him for the Library
   Youth Partnership Program, he didn't know what he was getting into. The
   senior from Hillside High School in Durham, North Carolina, had to
   interview last year for one of 12 coveted spots for the young teen
   training and employment program that marries science, literature, and
   fun. Run collaboratively by Durham's Museum of Life and Science, the
   Durham County Public Library, and two high school media centers, the
   Library Youth Partnership lets adolescents earn while they learn to
   create and deliver storytime presentations for younger children.
   Matthew thought working with other teens and training at the Museum
   would be fun. He did not know that it would also lead to a paid
   part-time position with the library. He said, "I was interested in it,
   and then I just fell in love with the program."

   Begun in the fall of 2000, the Library Youth Partnership Program builds
   upon a highly successful ten-year youth program of the museum and
   receives funding from an IMLS National Leadership Grant and a Powerful
   Partners Library Services and Technology Act grant from the North
   Carolina State Library. A total of 24 students will be trained over the
   course of the 2-year grant. They are selected from Southern and
   Hillside High Schools in south-central Durham, a low-income area of the
   county adjacent to the public library. The students are trained to work
   at the school media centers, the public library, and the museum.
   Program coordinators at the museum and library teach the students to
   work together to research, prepare, and refine several original science
   storytime programs tailored for children at three levels: first,
   second, and third grades. The Library Youth Partners are then paid to
   present the storytimes to elementary-aged children at various
   afterschool centers. The museum provides the transportation and assists
   with the science element (which sometimes means handling and
   transporting a live animal). More than 2,000 elementary students have
   seen the presentations and 2,000 more will benefit when the next round
   of presentations is ready.

   Youth in museums, a lasting legacy of Youth ALIVE!

   The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science has been integrating 12-
   to 18-year-olds into museum operations since 1992 when funding from the
   Youth ALIVE! initiative supported the consolidation of the museum's
   youth programs into the comprehensive Youth Partners Program. More than
   140 students-50% of whom are African American and are from low-income
   families-participate in the intense program annually to gain valuable
   work experience as guides, presenters, animal keepers, classroom
   assistants, exhibit researchers, and designers. The museum benefits as
   the pool of local trained volunteers, employees, and museum advocates
   grows.

   Youth ALIVE! was a Wallace-Readers Digest Fund initiative, administered
   by the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), to create
   sustainable youth programs in science centers and museums throughout
   the United States. According to DeAnna Beane, ASTC's Director of
   Partnerships for Learning, the initiative began in 1991 after a year of
   research and planning. During the next eight years, 72 science centers,
   museums, zoos, and aquariums received program grants and an additional
   34 were awarded planning grants. The initiative's impact can be seen in
   the strong programs and networks continuing among museums across the
   country.

   To provide developmentally appropriate programming for underserved
   local youth, museums were expected to collaborate with community-based
   organizations familiar to the young people and their communities. She
   said, "From the very beginning, the focus for Youth ALIVE! was on
   healthy youth development -- using the context of the museum and its
   wonderful resources to help young people develop intellectually,
   socially, and emotionally. To be successful, however, these enrichment
   and employment programs had to meet the needs of the museum, as well as
   those of the adolescents. Consequently, while the principle focus was
   not science education, it soon became apparent that the young people
   were eager to master science concepts and workplace skills in order to
   do their museum jobs well."

   It was due to the tremendous popularity of the North Carolina Museum of
   Life and Science's program (more than 100 applicants were turned away
   each year) that the idea of partnering with the library was hit upon as
   a way to expand it. Partnership discussions between the museum and
   library directors began about three and a half years ago. Chad
   Hallyburton, the museum's Youth Programs Manager, said, "We started to
   think of other ways to integrate youth and the library came to mind as
   a natural tie-in."

   The first grant application to a local foundation failed. With more
   than a year and a half of planning and the addition of the Durham
   public school partner, however, grant applications to both IMLS and the
   North Carolina State Library were successful.

   Rediscovering the young adult in libraries

   The Library Youth Partnership program came at a time when Sandy
   Roberson, Children Services Librarian at the Durham Public Library, was
   searching for ways to revive some of the services libraries once
   provided young teens. "Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there
   was a big push in libraries to add young adult librarians. Since then
   it has fallen out of favor, and the trend emerged to combine YA [young
   adult] services with adult services," she said.

   Julie Ann Walker, Executive Director of the American Library
   Association's Young Adult Library Services Association, agrees. She
   said that while library services to young adults have generally been in
   decline, in the last five years there has been a reversal of that trend
   and "a whole movement toward community-based programming focused on
   youth development" as a result of new "assets-based research." The idea
   is to build on the assets of at-risk, underserved youth with programs
   that intervene before these adolescents get into trouble.

   As the children's librarian, Roberson does not frequently work with
   teens these days, other than the students who work part-time as
   "library pages." "There's the occasional homeschooler, and some teens
   who aren't too proud to come into the children's room," she said. Yet
   more teens call each year about work and volunteer opportunities than
   the library can accommodate. The Library Youth Partnership program, she
   said, enabled the library to "tap into the museum's youth expertise."

   A great deal of the teens' training and presentation preparation
   happens under the guidance of Melissa Chiti, the library's part-time
   program coordinator. For the first year of the grant, students, usually
   in groups of four, come to the library to work on their presentations.
   In the process, they are trained in a range of topics and skills needed
   by both library employees and users, such as checking out and shelving
   books, storytelling, effective researching, use of technology, and
   exploration of career materials. "By the time Melissa is finished with
   the training," said Roberson, "the students can do 'ready reference'
   for other patrons in the children's area."

   Chiti tries to guide and nurture the youth, but the ultimate
   responsibility for creating the programs is theirs. The first step is
   to show the teens how to search for books in the children's section
   that have both science topics and a strong storyline. For some of the
   programs, the youth look for books about animals, since some of the
   science components involve showing and discussing live animals from the
   museum collection. With a big pile of books in front of them and a
   decision to make, Chiti directs the students by asking them which books
   they like the best. She then helps them understand the reasons why some
   books are better than others for presentation, explaining how to
   identify strong dramatic elements and good characterizations. The best
   determination for book selection, she said, is whether the youth enjoy
   the book because, she tells them, "You'll be getting to know the book
   very well."

   One of the books chosen was "Stella Luna," a tale about a baby bat that
   accidentally falls into a bird's nest and is raised by a mother bird.
   The book is humorous, has wonderful characters, including the bat and
   mother bird (whose parts are each read by a different student), and
   provides an opportunity to show a live bat and an owl and to contrast
   the habits of bats and birds. The typical presentation includes an
   introduction by Chiti, the dramatic reading by the youth, and the
   science presentation made with the assistance of museum staff.

   Indicators of success

   From the perspective of the three program partners, the Library Youth
   Partnership has been a "win-win-win" situation. Dean Briere, the
   museum's Vice President for Education and Programs, said, "The quality
   of the program with all three partners is so high. It's allowing us to
   reach a population the museum has not successfully attracted before.
   It's really been rewarding for us to reach these students." He accounts
   much of the success to the extensive year and a half of planning done
   prior to the start of the program and the high-level "buy-in" and
   participation by the museum and library directors and public school
   officials.

   Sandy Roberson notes the benefits of the public library's improved
   relationship with the schools. "Being a cooperative partner with the
   school media centers reminds them that we are here for them,
   particularly the inner city schools that have a difficult assignment of
   meeting high state testing requirements with no extra resources to do
   it." She recently met with a school media center coordinator to discuss
   a partnership for another Library Services and Technology Act grant
   application. She said, "The program has opened the door for more
   dialogue with the schools."

   Barbara Simmons, the Southern High School media center specialist who
   works with the youth at the school, is most struck by how the
   participating students have benefited. She said, "It has bolstered
   their self-esteem, increased their communications skills, and they have
   been able to interact with people from all over-people they wouldn't
   have normally come in contact with." She calls the youth "little
   ambassadors for Southern High School," and said, "when someone from the
   project tells me about a kid from Southern High School who's shining in
   the program, I beam, too."

   The partners also point to the popularity of the program with the
   elementary afterschool teachers. Surveys with the teachers indicated
   that 100% wanted the youth to return with more presentations. The
   presentations have reached hundreds of little children, said Roberson,
   and have introduced these children to youth from their communities "who
   are seen as 'teachers,' interacting with them in a fun way, and serving
   as positive role models."

   Students in the program appear to be hooked by their newfound status
   with the younger kids and gain a strong sense of service. The element
   of service seems to strike a chord with children going through
   adolescence, said ASTC's Beane. "This is the time in a child's life
   when they are beginning to try to figure out 'where do I belong,'
   'where do I fit,' 'who needs me,' and 'how can I be useful.' That is
   why meaningful work is so important. It is detrimental to give them
   busy work or work with little meaning because they can become cynical
   about the world of work."

   "But," she said, "giving them something that is important to other
   people, and which provides results that you can see, can have a
   powerful impact. Libraries and museums are public service entities and
   are resources to communities. Unlike entry level jobs at gas stations
   or fast food restaurants, these programs require that teenagers develop
   new, higher level, cognitive skills in order to be smart and successful
   in working with the public, especially younger children."

   Mathew Mickens seems to have caught on to this idea. When asked what he
   has learned from the Library Youth Partnership, he said, "How to help
   people, being in service to them, and doing something positive to make
   other people feel good. That's what I've learned."
