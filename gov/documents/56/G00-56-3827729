        Other Data

     Please Note:

        Please note the scale of the datasets.
        Using this data at a larger scale will NOT provide greater accuracy.
        In fact, it is a misuse of the datasets.

     Geographic Information System Data

        ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes The datasets of the NYS Museum which are
            posted here are made freely available.
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Use of this data implies you understand
            the disclaimer associated with it.
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Data is now obtained via the web browser.
            Our ftp site is no longer the source for data.
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Our Metadata references are available from
            the NYS GIS Clearinghouse.
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Data available for download is currently
            the dataset ONLY. In the future, perhaps additional project
            information will be available.

     Datasets are separated into four categories:

        ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Statewide Based data - coverage for the whole
            state (may be comprised of several datasets).
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Regional Based data - coverage for a
            portion of the state
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes County Based data - coverage for an entire
            County.
            ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes Quad Based data - coverage for an entire
            7.5' quadrangle.

     Datasets are available in Two formats:

        ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes ArcInfo and ArcView

        Museum Data Formatting Information:

          * File Format: Data is distributed in ARC/INFOÂ® EXPORT format (with
            ".e00" extension).
          * File Type: The EXPORT files are stored in DOS ASCII format.
          * File Compression: Files are compressed with PKZIP 2.04g.
          * File Decompression: Once downloaded to your site, the files can be
            decompressed using the software programs PKUNZIP in the DOS or
            Windows environment, or GUNZIP in the UNIX environment. UNIX users
            must change the ".zip" extension to ".e00.gz" before running GUNZIP
            on the files. UNIX users also have the option of using other UNIX
            shareware tools (such as ZIP for UNIX) to decompress the ".zip"
            file.

     ltblball.gif - 981 Bytes The Map Server lets you browse data in your
   web browser. (Java Browser required).
   See the dataset download section below to find out if the dataset is
   Mapserver enabled.
   Maps can be slow to load when using a modem.

                          Statewide Based Coverages

Geology

We have tiled the State using 5 tiles.

   This Index Map shows old and new ArcInfo coverages. Statewide coverages
   are "clipped" to the boundaries of these sheets to coincide with source
   maps. Old coverage system tiled the state using 10 tiles, the new
   method uses 5. The 5 tiles that comprise the state are based on the
   paper map sheets.

   Topographic Maps - Geological Survey Collection

   The NYS Geological Survey maintains a full inventory of 1:24,000
   topographic maps of the State for use by staff, and for examination by
   the general public. It does not, however, sell topographic maps. The
   Survey also has a collection of stable base mylar maps of the
   Adirondack region at 1:24,000 and 1:62,500. Many of these maps are long
   out-of-print, and have been designated "Historical Maps" by the U.S.
   Geological Survey.
   Topographic Maps can be purchased from many
   map dealers in New York for their particular regions.
   Such maps can be purchased for all parts of the state, and at several
   scales, from the NYS Department of Transportation
   See our publications list for geologic maps and prices.
