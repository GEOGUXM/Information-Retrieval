Overview

   This FDA Food Labeling web site addresses the labeling requirements for
   foods under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and its amendments.
   Food labeling is required for most prepared foods, such as breads,
   cereals, canned and frozen foods, snacks, desserts, drinks, etc.
   Nutrition labeling for raw produce (fruits and vegetables) and fish is
   voluntary. We refer to these products as "conventional" foods. For
   detailed information on dietary supplements, a special category of
   products that comes under the general umbrella of foods, but which has
   separate labeling requirements, see "dietary supplements."*

   * Terms such as "functional foods" or "nutraceuticals" are widely used
   in the marketplace. Such foods are regulated by FDA under the authority
   of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, even though they are not
   specifically defined by law.
