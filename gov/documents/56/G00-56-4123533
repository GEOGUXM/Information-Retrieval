                  Cunningham Co-Sponsors Fusion Energy Bill

   WASHINGTON
   - Congressman Randy Duke Cunningham (R-San Diego) joined a bipartisan
   coalition of House Members led by Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA)
   today to introduce a bill to strengthen U.S. fusion research and
   accelerate planning for the next step towards practical fusion energy.
   (Todays press conference will be taped and broadcast to a satellite at
   4:30p.m. EST (1:30p.m. PST). Stations may downlink the event at the
   following coordinates: Galaxy 4 Transponder 22 Vertical Downlink 4140).

   The Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001 will provide a roadmap for a
   burning plasma experiment, the first step to a commercially viable
   fusion energy power plant. The bill also calls for increased federal
   support for fusion energy research. Fusion research has long been
   considered a limitless and environmentally safe energy source and a
   possible long-term solution to our growing energy needs. Fusion is the
   energy source that powers our sun. At its most basic, it is the
   combining or fusion of two small atoms into a larger atom. When two
   atomic nuclei fuse, tremendous amounts of energy are released.

   If proven possible, fusion will be close to the ideal energy source: it
   is safe, produces no air pollutants, and its fuel source is practically
   unlimited. Debate has ceased about whether controlled fusion can be
   created on earth. Significant amounts of fusion energy are created with
   regularity in laboratories. The remaining question is whether fusion
   can make the challenging step from the laboratory to a practical energy
   source. Achieving this goal will require high quality science and
   innovative research.

   I want to thank Congresswoman Lofgren for her initiative in moving
   forward with this bill. Although fusion energy will not solve todays
   pressing energy crisis in California, fusion is an excellent prospect
   for the future. Californians know all too well that short, medium and
   long range planning are critical in meeting energy needs. We must have
   a long-range vision of what is possible for the future, said
   Congressman Cunningham.

   The Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001 will strengthen the ongoing
   fusion research program in this country and require the Department of
   Energy to develop a plan for taking the next step, added Cunningham.

   San Diego is home to some of the nations leading fusion research
   facilities, including research done at UCSD and General Atomics in La
   Jolla.
