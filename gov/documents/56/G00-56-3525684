Sediments

   The Bay was listed as an "impaired water body" under the Clean Water
   Act because of poor water clarity. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)
   has declined drastically over the past 30 years due to poor water
   clarity, which is caused by excess sediment and nutrients. While
   nutrient sources and transport have been studied since the 1980s,
   little is known about sediment sources and delivery to the Bay. The CBP
   needs information on the sources of sediment affecting water clarity so
   sediment-reduction measures can be formulated and water clarity is
   improved by 2010. The USGS will help provide information through:
     * Investigating the sources, transport, delivery, and deposition of
       sediment to the Bay.
     * Understanding the relation of sediment and nutrient enrichment to
       water clarity, submerged aquatic vegetation, and other biota in
       shallow habitats.
     * Improving predictive models, monitoring, and decision-support
       systems to help States develop, and evaluate the effectiveness of,
       sediment-reduction strategies.

   Collecting sediment cores in and around the Chesapeake Bay

   To find links to USGS programs that monitor Chesapeake Bay sediments
   please visit the Programs and Projects page. For links and information
   on various USGS data and spatial information sites on the Bay area's
   water quality and sediment levels visit the Data page. Many reports and
   publications are available visit the Publications page to find them.

   We welcome comments and suggestions on this redesigned site.
