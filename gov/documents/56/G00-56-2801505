  Abstract

   From 1992 to 1994, 147 water samples were collected at 5 sites in the
   Tar-Pamlico drainage basin in North Carolina and analyzed for 46
   herbicides, insecticides, and pesticide metabolites as part of the U.S.
   Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Based on
   a common adjusted detection limit of 0.01 microgram per liter, the most
   frequently detected herbicides were metolachlor (84 percent), atrazine
   (78 percent), alachlor (72 percent), and prometon (57 percent). The
   insecticides detected most frequently were carbaryl (12 percent),
   carbofuran (7 percent), and diazinon (4 percent). Although the
   pesticides with the highest estimated uses generally were the compounds
   detected most frequently, there was not a strong correlation between
   estimated use and detection frequency. The development of statistical
   correlations between pesticide use and detection frequency was limited
   by the lack of information on pesticides commonly applied in urban and
   agricultural areas, such as prometon, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon, and
   the small number of basins included in this study. For example,
   prometon had the fourth highest detection frequency, but use
   information was not available. Nevertheless, the high detection
   frequency of prometon indicates that nonagricultural uses also
   contribute to pesticide levels in streams in the Tar-Pamlico drainage
   basin.

   Concentrations of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, and trifluralin
   varied seasonally, with elevated concentrations generally occurring in
   the spring, during and immediately following application periods, and
   in the summer. Seasonal concentration patterns were less evident for
   prometon, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos. Alachlor is the only pesticide
   detected in concentrations that exceeded current (2000) drinking-water
   standards.
