   Angeles.  Agenda

   Task Force on the Review of DA, RDA, and EF Duties

   Every 7 years, the Dental Board is mandated by law to review DA and RDA
   duties and supervision levels.  They have directed that COMDA conduct
   the review and make recommendations to the Board.  COMDA appointed a
   Task Force on the Review of DA, RDA, and EF Duties to assist it in this
   effort, which was comprised of 14 individuals from all aspects of
   dentistry.

   The final meeting of the Task Force was May 9th. Click here for draft
   minutes.  For further information, click on the links below.

        [tiny13.gif] General Meeting Information

        COMDA generally meets in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, or
        San Diego, in order to receive input from as many members of the
        public as possible.

        COMDA normally holds its meetings the day prior to the Dental Board
        meeting, to enhance communication between COMDA and Board members.
        As a result, COMDA expects to conduct regular meetings 5 times per
        year as does the Board, as opposed to past years in which it met 4
        times per year.

        The public is invited and encouraged to attend all sessions except
        those that are specifically designated as closed sessions, as
        provided by the Government Code to assure exam security.

        Agenda notices are sent to those persons who have indicated an
        interest in the activities of the Committee.  You can place your
        name on the mailing list by placing "mailing list" in the subject
        portion, and your name and address in the message portion, of an
        e-mail.

        In addition to actively soliciting public comment on each agenda
        item, a period specifically designated for public comments is held
        at the end of each meeting.

        At its meetings, COMDA discusses such issues as:

        [1882.gif] Appropriate scopes of practice

        [1883.gif] Relevance and validity of examination requirements and
        content

        [1882.gif] Efficiency of examination processes

        [1883.gif] Relevance and validity of licensing requirements

        [1882.gif] Efficiency of the licensing process

        [1883.gif] Legislation, regulatory, and policy revisions

        [1882.gif] RDA Educational programs/radiation safety and expanded
        function courses
