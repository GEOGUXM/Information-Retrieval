   First IMAGE-ing of Particle Acceleration by Dynamic Magnetic Fields
   (HENA) * Magnetic storm particle acceleration before IMAGE: - Tail
   magnetic field relaxes impulsively - Energetic particle fluxes increase
   - Auroral brightens and expands * What is happening here? - Particles
   injected from tail? - Particles released from radiation belts? *
   IMAGE-ing by HENA (next page) reveals: - Pre-existing dense plasma
   sheet - Moves Earthward and fluxes intensify * Conclusion - Particles
   are accelerated and injected, intensifying fluxes closer to Earth, as
   magnetic field relaxes abruptly. - Consistent with model of Fok et al.,
