   Product validation is a responsibility for the product PI. The intent
   of the MODLAND validation activities is to give a quantitative estimate
   of product accuracy over a range of conditions.  The approach adopted
   by the MODLAND group is to use a combination of in-situ, airborne and
   high resolution satellite data to provide correlative measurements to
   validate the MODIS global products. In addition to the PI's, the EOS
   program has funded a number of Validation PI's to participate in the
   validation of MODIS Land products.
