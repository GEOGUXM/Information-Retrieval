   MPL-Net is a worldwide network of micro-pulse lidar (MPL) systems.
   MPL-Net is run by members of the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar Group in Code
   912 at GSFC and is funded by NASA/EOS . Additional funding for research
   cruises at sea is provided by the NASA SIMBIOS project. The MPL is a
   single channel (523nm), autonomous, eye-safe lidar system originally
   developed at GSFC and is now commercially available. The MPL is used to
   determine the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols. The MPL data
   is analyzed to produce optical properties such as extinction and
   optical depth profiles of the clouds and aerosols.

        (New Users please read this before viewing/downloading data)

   The primary goal of MPL-Net is to provide long-term data sets of cloud
   and aerosol vertical distributions at key sites around the world. The
   long-term data sets will be used to validate and help improve global
   and regional climate models, and also serve as ground-truth sites for
   NASA/EOS satellite programs such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter
   System (GLAS) on the ICESat spacecraft. (launch date Fall 2002).

   MPL-Net is composed of NASA operated sites, incorporated sites from the
   ARM MPL network, and sites privately operated by researchers from
   around the world. Also, all MPL-Net sites are co-located with AERONET
   sunphotometers. Instrument calibrations and data processing for all
   sites are accomplished using techniques developed by our group over 7
   years of MPL development and deployment. In addition to the long-term
   sites, MPL-Net provides support for field experiments each year using
   MPL systems reserved for field use (land and ship based deployments
   possible).

   This site contains images and data from the long-term sites and field
   experiments. Information on data processing, instrument specifications,
   publications, MPL news, and contact information is also given.
