   High Resolution Airborne Wideband Camera

   Background

      Many infrared sources are dusty. Absorption of starlight typically
      heats the dust grains to temperatures of tens of hundreds of Kelvin
      where they radiate most of their energy in the far infrared, at
      wavelengths of 40-300 µm that are inaccessible from the ground. Imagery
      in the spectral range with highest possible spatial resolution is the
      natural starting point from which to develop an understanding of source
      energetics and morphology. Since SOFIA is the largest far infrared
      telescope, it will have the best intrinsic angular resolution.

      High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera (HAWC) will be a facility
      camera for SOFIA which will cover the 40-300 µm spectral range with
      three bands centered at 60, 110, and 200 µm at an image scale of two
      pixels per airy disk (FWHM), its detector will be a 12x32 array of
      micromachined silicon "pop-up" bolometers, operated at a temperature of
      0.3 K. HAWC's goal is to provide a sensitive, versatile, and reliable
      FSI capability for SOFIA's user community during its first operational
      years. HAWC is one of the First Light Instruments for SOFIA.
