   This National Strategy to Restore Coastal Habitat effort began as a
   cooperative agreement in May of 2000 between Restore America's
   Estuaries and NOAA's National Ocean Service and National Marine
   Fisheries Service. The goal was to provide a framework that would lay
   the groundwork for restoring function to one million acres of estuarine
   habitat by the year 2010.

   The development of this draft National Strategy has been a cooperative
   process all along, involving representatives from federal, state, and
   local agencies, non-profit organizations, and the scientific community.
   Work teams, made up of members from each of these groups, crafted each
   section of A Draft National Strategy to Restore Coastal Habitat and
   actively sought comments and suggestions from others throughout the
   process. In addition, a national workshop was held in March of 2001 to
   present a draft version of this strategy to an even larger audience for
   review and comment.
