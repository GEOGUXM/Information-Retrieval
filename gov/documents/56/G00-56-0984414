   Curator: Craig Tupper
   NASA Privacy & Accessibility Statement

   The curator of the Space Science web (pages with addresses starting
   with http://spacescience.nasa.gov) manages the site in his "spare
   time", and is swamped with his primary job, which involves financial
   management of Space Science programs. He cannot search the Web for you,
   answer your science questions, help you write your science project, or
   evaluate your personal theory, much as he might like to. Any such
   questions submitted to the curator will be ignored. If you have
   questions of that nature, please refer to our Frequently Asked
   Questions page, which provides many helpful links.

   The curator is not responsible for web pages that do not start with the
   address http://spacescience.nasa.gov. Please call any problems with
   such pages to the attention of the responsible person.

   If there is a problem (broken link, factual error, missing information,
   etc.) on a web page that DOES start with the address
   http://spacescience.nasa.gov, then please inform the curator by sending
   an email to dtupper at hq dot nasa dot gov. Please specify the nature
   and exact location (that is, the url address) of the problem.

   Thanks for your consideration.

   -- the curator
