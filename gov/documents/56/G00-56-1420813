                         Pretrial Services History:

   On September 27, 1982, the Pretrial Services Act was signed into law by
   President Ronald Reagan. The Act (18 U.S.C. Section 3152) mandated that
   pretrial services functions shall be provided in each judicial district
       except the District of Columbia. In May 1988, the United States
     District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Fourth
       Circuit Judicial Council voted to establish a separate Pretrial
           Services Office pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3152(b).
