      What does the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) do?

        The Central Intelligence Agency's primary mission is to collect,
        evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence to assist the
        President and senior US Government policymakers in making decisions
        relating to the national security. The Central Intelligence Agency
        does not make policy; it is an independent source of foreign
        intelligence information for those who do. The Central Intelligence
        Agency may also engage in covert action at the President's direction
        in accordance with applicable law. [Return to top]

      Who works for the Central Intelligence Agency?

        The CIA carefully selects well-qualified people in nearly all fields
        of study. Scientists, engineers, economists, linguists,
        mathematicians, secretaries, accountants and computer specialists
        are but a few of the professionals continually in demand. Much of
        the Agencys work, like that done in academic institutions, requires
        research, careful evaluation, and writing of reports that end up on
        the desks of this nations policymakers. Applicants are expected to
        have a college degree with a minimum GPA of 3.0 and must be willing
        to relocate to the Washington, D.C., area. Selection for Agency
        employment is highly competitive and employees must successfully
        complete a polygraph and medical examination and a background
        investigation before entering on duty. The Agency endorses equal
        employment opportunity for all employees. For further information,
        see the employment page. [Return to top]

      How many people work for the Central Intelligence Agency and what is
      its budget?

        Neither the number of employees nor the size of the Agency's budget
        can, at present, be publicly disclosed. A common misconception is
        that the Agency has an unlimited budget, which is far from true.
        While classified, the budget and size of the CIA are known in detail
        and scrutinized by the Office of Management and Budget and by the
        Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select
        Committee on Intelligence, and the Defense Subcommittees of the
        Appropriations Committees in both houses of Congress. The resources
        allocated to the CIA are subject to the same rigorous examination
        and approval process that applies to all other government
        organizations.

        In 1997, the aggregate figure for all U.S. government intelligence
        and intelligence-related activitiesof which the CIA is but one
        part--was made public for the first time. The aggregate intelligence
        budget was $26.6 billion in fiscal year 1997 and $26.7 billion for
        fiscal year 1998. The intelligence budget for fiscal year 1999 has
        not been publicly released.

      Does the Central Intelligence Agency give public tours of its
      headquarters buildings?

        No. Logistical problems and security considerations prevent such
        tours. The CIA provides an extremely limited number of visits
        annually for approved academic and civic groups.  A brief virtual
        tour is available on this Web site. [Return to top]

      Does the Central Intelligence Agency release publications to the
      public?

        Yes.  The CIA releases millions of pages of documents each year.
        Much of this is material of historical significance or personal
        interest that has been declassified under Executive Order 12958 (a
        presidential order outlining a uniform system for handling national
        security information) or the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy
        Act (statutes which give U.S. citizens access to U.S. Government
        information or U.S. Government information about themselves,
        respectively).  The Agency handles thousands of cases each year and
        maintains the CIAs Electronic Reading Room at www.foia.cia.gov to
        release this information to the public and to provide guidance for
        requesting information. Some released information of significant
        public interest or historical value is also available at the
        National Archives and Records Administration.  Specific copies of
        any previously declassified records are available directly from the
        CIA FOIA office.

        The Agency frequently releases items of more general public interest
        on this Web site.   The site includes general information about the
        CIA, unclassified current publications, speeches and congressional
        testimony, press releases and statements, employment information,
        and basic references, including the CIA World Factbook.  Many
        documents, including the CIA World Factbook, reports on foreign
        economic or political matters, maps, and directories of foreign
        officials are also available in hard copy; these are listed in CIA
        Maps and Publications Released to the Public which is also posted
        available from the Office of Public Affairs. Publications on this
        list may be purchased from the Government Printing Office, the
        National Technical Information Service, and the Library of
        Congress.  Most CIA publications are classified, however, and are
        not publicly available.

        For more information, contact the Chief, Information Review Group,
        Office of Information Management, CIA, Washington, D.C.  20505 at
        (703) 613-1289 or the Office of Public Affairs at (703) 482-0623.

      Does the CIA spy on Americans? Does it keep a file on you?

        By law, the CIA is specifically prohibited from collecting foreign
        intelligence concerning the domestic activities of US citizens. Its
        mission is to collect information related to foreign intelligence
        and foreign counterintelligence. By direction of the President in
        Executive Order 12333 of 1981 and in accordance with procedures
        issued by the Director of Central Intelligence and approved by the
        Attorney General, the CIA is restricted in the collection of
        intelligence information directed against US citizens. Collection is
        allowed only for an authorized intelligence purpose; for example, if
        there is a reason to believe that an individual is involved in
        espionage or international terrorist activities. The CIA's
        procedures require senior approval for any such collection that is
        allowed, and, depending on the collection technique employed, the
        sanction of the Attorney General and Director of Central
        Intelligence may be required. These restrictions on the CIA have
        been in effect since the 1970s. [Return to top]

      Who decides when CIA should participate in covert actions, and why?

        Only the president can direct the CIA to undertake a covert action.
        Such actions usually are recommended by the National Security
        Council (NSC). Covert actions are considered when the NSC judges
        that US foreign policy objectives may not be fully realized by
        normal diplomatic means and when military action is deemed to be too
        extreme an option. Therefore, the Agency may be directed to conduct
        a special activity abroad in support of foreign policy where the
        role of the US Government is neither apparent nor publicly
        acknowledged. Once tasked, the Director of Central Intelligence must
        notify the intelligence oversight committees of the Congress.

      What is the Central Intelligence Agency's role in combating
      international terrorism?

        The Central Intelligence Agency supports the overall US Government
        effort to combat international terrorism by collecting, analyzing,
        and disseminating intelligence on foreign terrorist groups and
        individuals. The CIA also works with friendly foreign governments
        and shares pertinent information with them. [Return to top]

      The CIA has been accused of conducting assassinations and engaging in
      drug trafficking.  What are the facts?

        The CIA does neither.  Executive Order 12333 of 1981 explicitly
        prohibits the Central Intelligence Agency from engaging, either
        directly or indirectly, in assassinations.  Internal safeguards and
        the congressional oversight process assure compliance.

        Regarding recent allegations of CIA involvement in drug trafficking,
        the CIA Inspector General* found no evidence to substantiate the
        charges that the CIA or its employees conspired with or assisted
        Contra-related organizations or individuals in drug trafficking to
        raise funds for the Contras or for any other purpose.   In fact, the
        CIA plays a crucial role in combating drug trafficking by providing
        intelligence information to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
        Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the State Department.

      Who oversees the CIA?  Does it act on its own initiative?

        Both the Congress and the Executive Branch oversee the Central
        Intelligence Agencys activities. In addition, the CIA is responsible
        to the American people through their elected representatives, and,
        like other government agencies, acts in accordance with US laws and
        executive orders.  In the Executive Branch, the National Security
        Councilincluding the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of
        State, and the Secretary of Defenseprovides guidance and direction
        for national foreign intelligence and counterintelligence
        activities. In Congress, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
        and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as
        other committees, closely monitor the Agencys reporting and
        programs.  The CIA is not a policy-making organization; it advises
        policymakers on matters of foreign intelligence, and it conducts
        covert actions only at the direction of the President [Return to

      Where is the Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters? Is it in
      Langley or McLean, Virginia?

        Technically, you could say CIA headquarters is in both. "Langley" is
        the name of the McLean neighborhood in which the CIA resides.

        The town of McLean was founded in 1910, but before then, the area
        where CIA Headquarters is located was known as Langley.

        In 1719, Thomas Lee purchased a tract of land from the sixth Lord
        Fairfax (for whom Fairfax County, the county in which McLean is
        located, was named), and he named it "Langley" after his ancestral
        home in England. Though Lee never lived on the land, the Langley
        area soon became home to many European settlers. A few were wealthy
        people whom England had granted land, and they established large
        plantations in the area.

        During the War of 1812, President James Madison and his wife Dolley
        fled the British siege of Washington to the safety of family and
        friends in Langley. Langley was a Union stronghold in Virginia, a
        southern state, during the Civil War and had two forts, Camp Griffin
        and Camp Pierpont, which housed soldiers who helped protect
        Washington.

        With the building of the Great Falls & Old Dominion Railroad, 1903
        was a defining year for Langley. John McLean, president of
        Washington Gas and Light Company and, later, editor of the
        Washington Post, and Senator Stephen B. Elkins of West Virginia
        collaborated on construction of a railroad which would bring
        vacationing Washingtonians to nearby Great Falls and provide people
        who worked in Washington the choice of living outside of the city.
        In 1906, the railroad began operating, and the population of Langley
        and nearby Lewinsville quickly grew. In 1910, the post offices of
        these towns closed and, named for the man who helped the area grow,
        a new post office named "McLean" was opened. In 1959, the Federal
        government broke ground for the Central Intelligence Agency
        headquarters. Construction was completed in 1961, adding another
        chapter to McLean's long history.

        Despite the name change in 1910, the name "Langley" still lingers to
        describe the McLean neighborhood where the CIA is located.

      How do I cite a document on CIAs web site as a source in my research
      paper/school report/term paper?

        There are many different styles for citing sources in a school
        paper.  Various academic communities prefer one style to another, so
        consult with your instructor to find out which one is preferred.
