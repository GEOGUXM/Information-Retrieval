   The US got a rude welcome from the new milleniumnot because of the Y2K
   computer bug, but because oil prices rebounded from their historic lows
   of the late 1990s. Yet even the present situation is one of plenty,
   compared to the long-term picture.

   Inexorably dwindling fossil-fuel supplies and increasing concern about
   the environmental costs of energy production make fusion look ever more
   appealing. Potentially one of the most efficient of all processes that
   release energy, fusion has other attractions as well. The fuel (the
   hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium) could be readily obtained, and
   the reactions would not leave behind the long-lived radioactive waste
   associated with fission. But controlled fusion on a power-plant scale
   will require some years of further development; typical estimates call
   for a demonstration power plant around 2035 or so.

   The DOE supports two major fusion research programs, one based on
   magnetic confinement, the other on inertial confinement. The most
   promising form of inertial confinement fusion for energy production
   uses beams of heavy ions to heat and compress, or drive, a target.
   (Heres how it works.) The resulting burst of energy is contained,
   captured, and converted into heat in the target chamber. From a beam
   power of 4 megajoules, the fusion yield is about 200 megajoules.

   During the last decade, nearly all high-level DOE and Congressionally
   mandated committees that have studied inertial fusion energy (IFE)
   identified heavy-ion accelerators as the most promising driver
   candidates. For engineering and economic feasibility, drivers must be
   both reliable and efficient. They must also have a high pulse
   repetition rate (several pulses per second) and long life (about 30
   years). Lasers are excellent for near-term research, but they have been
   designed for a low repetition rate, typically a few shots per day.
   Heavy-ion accelerators, building as they do on decades of development
   and operation of sophisticated accelerators for high energy and nuclear
   physics, promise a highly reliable, efficient solution. As a result,
   reviews by the Fusion Policy Advisory Committee, the National Academy
   of Sciences, and the Fusion Energy Advisory Committee recommended an
   expanded program in heavy-ion accelerators for fusion energy.

   To meet these challenging demands of a power-plant driver, the Fusion
   Energy Research Program at Berkeley Lab has been addressing the
   generation of high-power, high-brightness beams of heavy ions; the
   physics of ion-beam propagation in the reaction chamber; and the
   validation of new, potentially more economical accelerator strategies.
   (Cost minimization is important because an inertial-fusion power plant
   will have to be a success not only in physics and engineering, but also
   in commerce.)

   Our program has spent more than 20 years progressively moving toward
   such an accelerator. The Single Beam Transport Experiment (SBTE) and
   the Multiple Beam Experiment (MBE-4) verified at a small scale that
   beams of sufficient brightness can be transported, accelerated, and
   compressed in the electrostatically focused portion of an induction
   accelerator. This was a go/no-go test for the entire concept. Since
   then we have largely completed a series of small experiments addressing
   all components of a heavy ion fusion plant (except conventional
   components such as turbines, generators, etc., which will be much like
   those in an ordinary power plant).

   The major goal of the accelerator research program is now the
   construction of an Integrated Research Experiment (IRE). The IRE
   accelerator will enable important experiments in beam dynamics,
   focusing physics, and target physics. The results from the IRE,
   together with target physics results from the DOE Defense Programs
   inertial-confinement fusion program and research on other inertial
   fusion technologies, will enable an informed decision about the promise
   of heavy ion fusion. The information from the IRE and the other
   programs will also provide a basis for the later construction of an
   Engineering Test Facility. The Engineering Test Facility will be
   designed to produce high levels of fusion power (hundreds of
   megawatts).

   We are planning to be in a position to begin IRE construction in fiscal
   year 2005. To achieve its goals, the IRE must accelerate ions to more
   than 100 MeV. It must accelerate hundreds of amperes of beam current
   and it must deliver several kilojoules of total beam energy. Such a
   machine is a considerable extrapolation from our previous ones, which
   typically accelerated approximately 10 mA of ions per beam to a kinetic
   energy of the order of 1 MeV. The task of the program during the last
   year has been to begin developing the data and technologies that will
   allow us to construct a cost effective IRE with confidence.

   In support of these objectives, we have joined forces under a
   memorandum of understanding with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to form a novel Virtual
   National Laboratory or VNL. (Other laboratories and institutions whose
   areas of special expertise and interest are good fits for the HIF-VNL
   may be added.) The Heavy Ion Fusion VNL, headquartered in AFRD,
   promotes rapid progress through the technical-management integration of
   the partners÷ scientific staff, equipment, and experimental facilities.

       source before the present ones run out. According to some
       projections, fusion will be on-stream just in the nick of time...
