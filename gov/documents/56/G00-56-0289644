                     About the Ships and their Missions

      NOAA operates 15 ships that conduct Fisheries, Oceanographic and
      Atmospheric Research and Charting & Hydrography. Thirteen of the ships
      participate in this program; the other two ships, JOHN N. COBB and
      RUDE, are NOAA's smallest vessels and do not have the berthing space to
      accommodate additional crew. The ships are based at one of the two
      Marine Operations Centers in Norfolk, Virginia, and Seattle,
      Washington, or at one of the 5 port offices located in Woods Hole,
      Massachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina; Pascagoula, Mississippi; San
      Jose, California; and Honolulu, Hawaii.

      Ship schedules list the ships, the cruise dates and specific projects
      being conducted. This is the schedule of all NOAA cruises; most (but
      not all) will have spaces for teachers. The schedules are updated
      frequently and usually project at least six months ahead.

      Detailed information about each ship may be found at the Marine
      Operations Center Web site. Clicking the link on the ships' individual
      names will also take you the the Marine Operations Center Web site.

      General Shipboard Policy Information contains useful information about
      ship policies, procedures, drills, etc. Some individual ship's pages
      also have further information for visiting scientists about life aboard
      ship. One site supported by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center has
      a very useful manual for cruise volunteers and first-time sailors about
      life at sea.

   Mission Descriptions

      Fisheries Research vessels perform biological and physical science
      studies in support of fisheries research. The individual projects are
      described further below. The ships are generally underway performing
      research on a 24-hour basis in the open ocean. The ships conducting
      fisheries research are ALBATROSS IV, TOWNSEND CROMWELL, DELAWARE II,
      MILLER FREEMAN, GORDON GUNTER, DAVID STARR JORDAN, McARTHUR, and OREGON
      II.

      Oceanographic vessels perform physical science studies in support of
      physical oceanography, atmospheric studies, and bathymetric mapping.
      The individual projects are described further below. The ships are
      generally underway performing research on a 24-hour basis in the open
      ocean. The ships conducting oceanographic research are RONALD H. BROWN,
      FERREL, KA혩IMIMOANA, and McARTHUR.

      Charting and Hydrography vessels' work includes echosounding, tide
      gauge installation, dive operations, shoreside surveying with GPS to
      determine electronic positioning sites, shoreline verification and
      mapping, data processing, and drafting. With the addition of a
      shallow-water multibeam system, the ships are now able to collect
      survey data simultaneously with the launches, and small boats are
      deployed to assist with shore support operations. Small boat and survey
      launch work are conducted during daylight operations, whereas ship
      operations may occur during the day or night. Teachers can anticipate
      assisting with the acquisition of survey data on survey launches,
      scanning data to assist with the final processing of data, and riding
      on small support boats to help with the installation of shore
      positioning stations and tide gauges. The ships conducting charting and
      hydrographic work are RAINIER and WHITING. Please note that work on the
      Rainier can be more physically challenging than on other ships.

      Please consider the ship's activities carefully when selecting a
      cruise. You are likely to gain more from the experience when the
      research activities bear some relation to your own interests.

   NOAA Ship ALBATROSS IV

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research

      Bottom Trawl Surveys - Bottom trawls (nets dragged along the ocean
      floor) are used to study distribution and relative abundance of fish
      and invertebrate species, fish species identification, collection of
      scales, otoliths (ear bones) and stomach contents of certain species.

      GLOBEC - GLOBal ocean ECosystem dynamics program studies the underlying
      physical and biological processes that control the population dynamics
      of Atlantic cod, haddock and two species of copepod crustaceans in
      Georges Bank, an area highly sensitive to climactic change.

      Sea Scallop Survey - The distribution and relative abundance of sea
      scallops are determined. Scallops are brought up in trawl nets and
      measured in this annual survey.
        __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN

      Overall Mission: Oceanographic and Climate Research

      The RONALD H. BROWN is NOAA's newest (commissioned on July 19, 1997)
      and most sophisticated research vessel. It has the capability to
      conduct simultaneous measurements of the full depths of the oceans and
      the lower atmosphere.

      VENTS - The NOAA Vents program is based on physical and chemical
      oceanographic observations in the northeast Pacific Ocean. These
      studies indicate the roles of hydrothermal plumes and plume-associated
      process (underwater volcanics) in the formation of metalliferous
      deposits, and their role in the regulation, occurrence, distributions,
      and balances of these metals throughout the world's oceans. Study areas
      include the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge (where new earth's crust is
      created), the Blanco Fracture Zone (movement of the earth's crust), and
      a marginal Subduction Zone (earth's crust is destroyed). These areas
      are less than 100 nautical miles off the coast of Washington. Research
      conducted in these areas include temperature studies, particulate
      matter density studies, near-bottom water motion, and studies to
      determine the presence and concentration of iron, particulate
      manganese, phosphorous, arsenic, and methane.

      OACES - The Ocean-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange Study is a collaborative
      study between the NOAA laboratories and university-based investigators
      to assess the role of the oceans in controlling the exchange of carbon
      dioxide (CO[2]) across the air-sea interface and its eventual
      penetration into the water masses of the deep ocean as part of the NOAA
      Climate and Global Change Program. The major objectives of the oceanic
      field component of OACES are to:
       1. Extend the data base for partial pressure of CO[2] in the surface
          ocean and overlying atmosphere, and total dissolved inorganic CO[2]
          (DIC) in the surface and deep ocean water masses in order to
          provide better estimates of CO[2] exchange and ventilation on
          seasonal to decadal time scales.
       2. Provide a better understanding of physical and biological processes
          that affect seasonal variations in the distribution of carbon
          species in the oceans.

      ACCE - The Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment is directed at:
       1. Providing a quantitative four-dimensional observational description
          of the pathways and material property fluxes of the meridional
          overturning circulation (MOC) within the North Atlantic Ocean that
          vary on time scales from interannual to at least decadal.
       2. Improving understanding and modeling of the relationships between
          the rates and natural variability of the MOC, internal ocean
          properties, sea surface temperature (SST), and the variability of
          the overlying atmosphere.
       3. Identifying and initiating measurements to be continued beyond the
          ACCE observational period to monitor the variability of important
          elements of the MOC and its relation to global climate variability.

   NOAA Ship TOWNSEND CROMWELL

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research

      PSI Camps - Protected Species Investigations (PSI) set up field camps
      on several of the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) atolls
      studying the Hawaiian monk seals. These field camps will be set-up
      during the March cruise, replenished on the April-May cruise and
      dismantled during the June cruise.

      Biology of Subtropical Front - Oceanographic data will be collected on
      the subtropical front which exists north of the Hawaiian Islands
      between Latitudes 27째 N and 32째 N. Data will be collected with sensors
      and sampling bottles lowered from the vessel. Plankton tows will
      probably be conducted.

      Lobster Assessment - This is the stock assessment survey to determine
      how many lobsters will be allocated to lobster fishermen whose season
      starts in July. The ship will fish for lobsters in several sites in the
      NWHI using strings of plastic traps. Live lobsters will be brought back
      for further study in the Honolulu Laboratory.

      Swordfish - Approximately 10 miles of monofilament longline will be set
      on a daily basis to capture pelagic fish species. The primary objective
      will center around how to successfully capture, tag and release
      swordfish. Data on all captured species will be collected.
      Oceanographic sampling will also be conducted.
        __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA Ship DELAWARE II

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research

      Ecosystem Monitoring - The objective of the survey is to assess the
      impact of changing biological and physical properties of the Northeast
      Continental Shelf ecosystem (northward from Cape Hatteras to Gulf of
      Maine and over Georges Bank) which influence the sustainable
      productivity of the living marine resources. Key parameters to be
      measured are: water column temperatures, salinities, and chlorophyll
      and nutrient concentrations; photosynthetic rates; ichthyo- and
      zooplankton composition, abundance, and distribution; marine mammal and
      birds abundance and distribution; and standard weather observations.
      Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hours per day.

      Bottom Trawl Survey - Bottom trawls (nets dragged along the ocean
      floor) are used to study distribution and relative abundance of fish
      and invertebrate species, fish species identification, collection of
      scales, otoliths (ear bones) and stomach contents of certain species in
      the Gulf of Maine.

      Fishing Power - During the cruise, a trawl will be towed behind the
      ship following standard bottom trawl survey procedures and survey
      techniques to measure trawl and ship fishing performance. The total
      weight and length frequency for each species caught will be recorded on
      trawl logs. Area of operation will be Gulf of Maine, Middle Atlantic
      Bight, and Southern New England and Georges Bank. Vessel operations
      will be conducted 24 hours per day.
        __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA Ship FERREL

      Overall Mission: Oceanographic Research

      NMS - The FERREL supports the National Marine Santuary Program and the
      Coastal Zone Management Program by performing oceanographic research
      and accomplishing various support projects in the NMS along the
      Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

      National Sea Grant Program - FERREL provides ship time for various
      research projects at coastal universities, such as Old Dominion
      University in Norfolk, Virginia.

      S & T - The National Status and Trends Program is a
      pollution-monitoring program documenting the effects of human
      activities on the coastal and estuarine environments by systematic
      observations in selected locations along the U.S. shoreline. The
      "status" of the present environmental condition of these sites is
      measured, then monitored by resampling on a regular basis to define
      "trends" of varying contaminant levels.

      The S & T Program samples sediment, bottomfish, invertebrates, and the
      water itself for evidence of an extensive list of trace elements,
      pesticides, and industrial waste chemicals that pollute our waters.
      Organisms are also examined for abnormalities and lesions possibly
      caused by exposure to certain pollutants.

   NOAA Ship MILLER FREEMAN

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research
      ** NOTE: Transportation funds for travel between Seattle and the
      departure/arrival ports may be available for FOCI cruises on the Miller
      Freeman.

      Bering Sea FOCI - The goal of FOCI (Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated
      Investigations) is to increase the understanding of upper-ocean
      circulation in the Bering Sea. Scientific measurements conducted
      include recovery/deployment of current meter moorings, temperature
      recorders, and satellite tracked drifters, Acoustic Doppler Current
      Profiling (ADCP), Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, and some
      mid-water trawling and bongo tows.

      Gulf of Alaska FOCI - Work is similar to Bering Sea FOCI; however,
      operations are generally more biologically oriented and are conducted
      in the Gulf of Alaska. Biological studies include various tows and
      trawls designed to estimate fish stocks and larval distributions, drift
      and mortality rates, and studies on growth and condition.

      Tsunami - Operations involve the recovery and deployment of ocean
      bottom mounted pressure sensors used to detect Tsunami activity in the
      Gulf of Alaska, followed by transit to Seattle, WA.

   NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research

      SEAMAP (South East Atlantic Marine Assessment Program) - larval and
      juvenile survey of the coastal waters south of Cape Hatteras to the
      Florida tip by means of plankton-collecting equipment such as MOCNESS
      (Multiple Open and Closing Net Environmental Sampling System), Bongo
      and Newston nets. Marine mammal studies.
        __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA Ship DAVID STARR JORDAN

      Overall Mission: Fisheries Research

      CalCOFI - California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations
      (CalCOFI) is a consortium of industry, university, state and federal
      agencies. CalCOFI was initiated in 1949 to investigate the cause of the
      collapse of the sardine fishery off Southern California, then the
      largest fishery in the world. Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)
      casts, bongo tows, manta tows, and pairovet plankton tows will be used
      to accomplish the mission.

      Rockfish - To assess the abundance and distribution of late larval and
      juvenile rockfish off the California coast by trawling.

      Shark Abundance - The abundance and distribution of sharks off Southern
      California will be measured using a pelagic longline. Some of the
      sharks will be used for tissue samples and some will be tagged and
      released.
        __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA Ship KA혩IMIMOANA

      Overall Mission: Oceanographic and Climate Research

      GOALS/PACS - The Global-Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) and the
      Pan American Climate Studies (PACS) research programs are designed to
      improve our understanding of the role of the tropical ocean in
      modifying the world's climate. The ship will deploy, recover, and
      service deep sea moorings that measure ocean currents, ocean
      temperatures and atmospheric variables throughout the equatorial
      Pacific Ocean. In addition to the buoy measurements, which are
      transmitted in real time to the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental
      Laboratory in Seattle, the ship will measure upper ocean currents,
      surface salinity, carbon dioxide content, and upper-air atmospheric
      soundings while underway. Other programs routinely conducted during the
      cruises include a census of barnacles and marine life that inhabit the
      recovered moorings (most KA혩IMIMOANA cruises) and the periodic
      replacement of undersea hydrophone moorings used to locate undersea
      spreading centers and hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise (on
      east Pacific cruises only, normally two cruises each year).
        __________________________________________________________________
