   semiarid desert grassland

                                                                Hillslopes
     __________________________________________________________________

   Hillslopes make up the landscape of much of the semiarid region of the
   Southwestern United States.  The hillslopes can be described by their
   profile shape, length, and slope.  Common hillslope shapes include
   convex, concave, straight, or complex.  Complex hillslopes are
   typically made up of several segments with various shapes.  Water
   induced soil erosion that drives hillslope evolution is impacted by
   several factors, including topography, vegetation, and soil surface
   characteristics.

   Vegetation and Bare Soil
     __________________________________________________________________

   Vegetation, such as grass, protects the soil .  A landscape view of
   seemingly uninterrupted grassland does not reveal the bare spaces
   between vegetation that provide flow paths for runoff.  A view from
   above reveals exposed, unprotected soil that is subject to erosion.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Water causes soil erosion. Soil particles detached by the impact of
   raindrops or flowing water may be transported or deposited downslope.
   Because flow rates change with time and position along the hillslope,
   soil detachment, transport, and deposition change with time and space.
   Steeper sections of hillslopes are subject to downcutting.  Eroded
   material is deposited in response to a reduction in slope.

   A Mathematical Model to Simulate Hillslope Erosion and Sediment Yield
     __________________________________________________________________

   A mathematical model has been developed by Dr. Leonard J. Lane and
   other scientists at the USDA-ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center in
   Tucson, Arizona to describe hillslope erosion processes. Given
   hillslope segment lengths, slopes, % canopy cover, % surface ground
   cover, runoff volume, and a soil erodibility value, the model will
   simulate erosion process along the hillslope and will return runoff
   volume, sediment yield, interrill detachment, rill detachment, rill
   deposition, and the mean concentration of sediment in the flow for each
   hillslope segment.

   Sediment yield equations were developed for a single plane, and were
   extended to irregular slopes by approximating the irregular slopes as a
   cascade of planes.

   Increasing sediment concentration in the downslope direction may
   indicate erosion along the hillslope. Deposition may be indicated by a
   decrease in sediment concentration in the downslope direction. Constant
   sediment concentration indicates an equilibrium.
