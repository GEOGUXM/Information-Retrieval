   Other NCI/CCR Fall Events

   October 15 - 12th Annual Frederick Capillary Electrophoresis
   Conference. Discussions of established and new approaches to capillary
   electrophoresis (CE). CE separation of small ions as well as large
   biomolecules and, in particular, CE's application in clinical,
   pharmaceutical, and biomedical research will be addressed. This
   Conference is "open" to all NIH investigators who are interested in
   this topic. To learn more, visit
   http://web.ncifcrf.gov/events/ce_conference/

   October 22 - NCI-Frederick Interdisciplinary Scientific Retreat. An
   excellent opportunity for wide-ranging and fruitful scientific exchange
   by scientists working at NCI-Frederick, this Retreat features short
   talks and poster presentations that represent the broad spectrum of
   research efforts at NCI-Frederick. This Retreat is "open" to both NCI
   principal investigators and postdoctoral fellows who work on the
   Frederick campus. For additional information, visit
   http://www.ncifcrf.gov/nciretreat/

   December 9 - Second HIV DRP Symposium: Antiviral Drug Resistance. The
   goal of this Symposium is to assemble researchers who work in diverse
   viral systems yet share a common interest in mechanisms of antiviral
   drug action and resistance. The focus will be on specific molecular
   targets, their normal structure and function, their interactions with
   antiviral drugs, and the evolutionary basis and specific mechanisms of
   viral resistance. This conference is "open" to all NIH investigators.
