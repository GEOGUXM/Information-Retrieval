   Field Experiment Data Sets at the Goddard DAAC
   MAS icon MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) Archive
   The MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) is an airborne scanning spectrometer
   that acquires high spatial resolution imagery of cloud and surface
   features from its vantage point on-board a NASA ER-2 high-altitude
   research aircraft. MAS data are helping to define, develop, and test
   algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS), a key sensor of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) program
   which will emphasize the use of remotely sensed data to monitor
   variation in environmental conditions for assessing both natural and
   human-induced global change.
   TRMM Campaign icon The TRMM Field Experiments
   Designed for TRMM Validation, this series of experiments (TEFLUN A & B,
   SCSMEX, LBA, KWAJEX and the NASA component of TOGA COARE) provide
   ground truth for use in algorithm development for the Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission (TRMM), a NASA and National Space Development Agency
   of Japan (NASDA) coordinated mission that launched the TRMM satellite
   on 28 November 1997 with a unique complement of sensors to remotely
   observe rainfall throughout the global tropics.
   SGP97 icon Southern Great Plains 99 (SGP99) Soil Hydrology Experiment
   A major goal of the SGP99 Field Experiment is the enhancement of
   techniques to interpret and utilize satellite microwave data either
   presently, or soon to be available. Subhumid Oklahoma, with its
   favorable land cover conditions for soil moisture retrieval using C, S
   and L band microwave instruments, was the campaign focus during July 8
   - 21, 1999.
   SGP97 icon Southern Great Plains 97 (SGP97) Soil Hydrology Experiment
   Held in subhumid Oklahoma, SGP97 evaluated the influence of soil
   moisture on the local surface energy budget and the influence of
   mesoscale variability in the surface energy budget on the development
   of the convective boundary layer. Includes data from low and mid-level
   aircraft instruments, satellite, surface stations and field sampling.
   TOGA icon TOGA COARE
   The Tropical Ocean Global Atmospheres/Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response
   Experiment (TOGA COARE) of 1992-93 investigated phenomena associated
   with ocean/atmosphere interaction in the western Pacific warm pool and
   includes data from ship and land based Doppler radars, buoys, low, mid
   and high level aircraft equipped with a variety of sensors, plus
   surface based instruments for in situ observations. The NASA component
   of TOGA COARE was primarily a TRMM validation campaign.
