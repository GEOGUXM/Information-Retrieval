   TUNL-ITEP Coincidence experiment

   This experiment operates by counting a small disk of material placed
   between two specially constructed germanium detectors that are
   surrounded by an NaI annulus and protected by a cosmic veto shield (not
   shown). This system achieves an extremely low background aboveground by
   requiring a multi-way coincidence while rejecting cosmic ray events.
