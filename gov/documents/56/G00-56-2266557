                     Prostate Molecular Profiling at NCI

   The Molecular Profiling (MP) group at NCI focuses on discovering the
   molecular changes in prostate cancer using a multidisciplinary team of
   physicians and scientists. Here, read how we are specifically
   addressing the issues raised under Bedside to Benchside in the
   prostate.

   In addition to the four Prostate Bedside to Benchside topics above,
   visit the 3D Prostate Molecular Model Demo, or read the Prostate
   Microreviews for in-depth background information.


   3D Prostate Molecular Model Demo: A demonstration of a novel 3D
   representation of molecular modeling, integrating clinical,
   histopathological and molecular features of prostate cancer.
   Prostate Microreviews: Reviews on specific prostate topics for the
   team's scientists and physicians to better understand each other's
   field.

   The Prostate Molecular Profiling Project could not have succeeded
   without the cooperation of a dedicated team of professionals. The NCI
   Prostate Molecular Profiling Group lists the team members who have
   contributed to this effort.
