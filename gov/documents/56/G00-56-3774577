   About Us
   Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration

   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was established within
   the Department of Transportation on January 1, 2000, pursuant to the
   Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 [Public Law No. 106-159,
   113 Stat. 1748 (December 9, 1999)]. Formerly a part of the Federal
   Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
   Administrations primary mission is to prevent commercial motor
   vehicle-related fatalities and injuries. Administration activities
   contribute to ensuring safety in motor carrier operations through
   strong enforcement of safety regulations, targeting high-risk carriers
   and commercial motor vehicle drivers; improving safety information
   systems and commercial motor vehicle technologies; strengthening
   commercial motor vehicle equipment and operating standards; and
   increasing safety awareness. To accomplish these activities, the
   Administration works with Federal, state, and local enforcement
   agencies, the motor carrier industry, labor safety interest groups, and
   others.

   Programs

   Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program

   The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program is a Federal grant program
   that provides states with financial assistance for roadside inspections
   and other commercial motor vehicle safety programs. It promotes
   detection and correction of commercial motor vehicle safety defects,
   commercial motor vehicle driver deficiencies, and unsafe motor carrier
   practices before they become contributing factors to crashes and
   hazardous materials incidents. The program also promotes the adoption
   and uniform enforcement by the states of safety rules, regulations, and
   standards compatible with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
   and Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations.

   Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement

   The Administrations compliance reviews and enforcement activities and
   the states roadside inspection activities are the principal means of
   ensuring that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and the
   Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations are enforced. Compliance and
   enforcement efforts are enhanced through the Performance and
   Registration Information Systems Management (PRISM) program, a Federal
   and state partnership to improve safety performance or remove high-risk
   carriers from the nation's highways. Through PRISM, compliance reviews
   are conducted on unsafe motor carriers and their safety performance is
   monitored and tracked. Continued poor safety performance may result in
   a Federal Operations Out-of-Service Order/unfit determination in
   conjunction with the suspension and/or revocation of vehicle
   registration privileges.

   Licensing and Insurance (L&I)

   With the closing of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the
   licensing and insurance responsibility were transferred to the Office
   of Motor Carrier and now to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
   Administration. For further information, please contact our office @
   202-358-7028 or 7029 or for status information on your
   application/authority, how to apply (see forms) you may go to our other
   web pages @ : http://fhwa-li.volpe.dot.gov/.

   Commercial Drivers License Program
   (CDL)

   The Administration develops, issues, and evaluates standards for
   testing and licensing commercial motor vehicle drivers. These standards
   require states to issue a Commercial Drivers License only after
   drivers pass knowledge and skill tests that pertain to the type of
   vehicle operated. States are audited every three years to monitor
   compliance with Federal standards; noncompliance could result in loss
   of Federal funding.

   Data and Analysis

   The Administration collects and disseminates safety data concerning
   motor carriers. Data collected by Federal safety investigators and
   state partners from roadside inspections, crashes, compliance reviews,
   and enforcement activities are indexed by carrier. This information
   provides a national perspective on carrier performance and assists in
   determining Administration and state enforcement activities and
   priorities. Combined with data from other sources (including the
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), extensive analysis is
   performed to determine trends in performance by carrier and other
   factors such as cargo, driver demographics, location, time, and type of
   incident. Based on identified trends, the Administration directs
   resources in the most efficient and effective manner to improve motor
   carrier safety.

   Research and Technology Program

   The Administration identifies, coordinates, and administers research
   and development to enhance the safety of motor carrier operations,
   commercial motor vehicles, and commercial motor vehicle drivers. The
   Administration promotes the use of information systems and advanced
   technologies to improve commercial vehicle safety, simplify government
   administrative systems, and provide savings to states and the motor
   carrier industry.

   Border and International

   The Administration supports the development of compatible motor carrier
   safety requirements and procedures throughout North America in the
   context of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It supports
   programs to improve the safety performance of motor carriers operating
   in border areas through special grants to states for enforcement
   activities and, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, it supports
   the development of state safety inspection facilities. The
   Administration participates in international technical organizations
   and committees to share best practices in motor carrier safety.

   Other

   Hazardous Materials
   . The Administration enforces regulations for the safe transportation
   of hazardous materials by highway and rules governing the manufacture
   and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles, as set forth in Chapter
   51 of Title 49 of the United States Code.

   Household Goods
   . The Administration has established a task force to identify and
   investigate those household good carriers which have exhibited a
   substantial pattern of consumer abuse. Consumer awareness/self-help
   packages are available.

   Hotline
   . The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration provides a toll-free
   hotline for reporting dangerous safety violations involving a
   commercial truck or bus: 1-888-DOT-SAFT (1-888-368-7238).
