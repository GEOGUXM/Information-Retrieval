                              Infrared Imaging

                                General Uses:

     * To remotely examine surface temperatures of objects.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Measuring temperature of hot pressings, material inside
       furnaces,and material being heated by microwaves.
     * Observing temperature gradients across molded plastic parts
       immediately after opening the mold.
     * Measuring temperatures of circuit board components during
       operation.
     * Line scan mode enables measurement of a single line at
       125microsecond intervals.

                                Test Samples:

   Test samples include any object to which an optical path transparent in
              the IR region of the spectrum can be established.

                                Limitations:

    This process measures surface temperatures only. Measurements can not
    be taken hrough glass, because it is opaque in the infarared region;
       however, arangements can be made to look through fused quartz.
     Temperature measurement can be made from 5 to 1500 degrees Celsius.
