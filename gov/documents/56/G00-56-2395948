   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   Friday, January 4, 2002

   Statement by U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans on Today's Unemployment
                                   Numbers

   Washington, DC - Today's unemployment numbers underscore the cost of
   the Senate's inaction on an economic security package. Nearly a million
   more Americans are out of work today than when President Bush first
   proposed an economic security plan in early October.

   I welcome Senator Daschle's words today, and hope they indicate that in
   this New Year, he has resolved to put more emphasis on paychecks than
   politics.

   It was heartening today to hear the Senate majority leader react to
   President Bush's priorities for our nation's economy: expanding support
   for workers who have lost their jobs, stimulating economic growth so
   they can replace their unemployment checks with paychecks, investing in
   education, opening new markets abroad for U.S. businesses, and
   implementing a strategic energy plan for our nation.

   The Administration is eager to work with the Senator, to build economic
   security for all Americans, without raising taxes.
