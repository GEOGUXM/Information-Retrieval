                                 Space Food

      Imagine going camping for over a week with several of your close
    friends. You would make sure you have plenty of food and the gear to
     cook and eat it with. The food would have to be stored properly and
    nonperishable to avoid spoilage. After finishing your meal, or at the
   end of your camping trip, you would then stow all your gear and dispose
              of your trash properly just before the ride home.

        Astronauts basically do the same thing when they go to space.
   Preparation varies with the food type. Some foods can be eaten in their
    natural form, such as brownies and fruit. Other foods require adding
   water, such as macaroni and cheese or spaghetti. Of course, an oven is
    provided in the space shuttle and the space station to heat foods to
    the proper temperature. There are no refrigerators in space, so space
   food must be stored and prepared properly to avoid spoilage, especially
                             on longer missions.


   A Russian Progress space vehicle brings food and other supplies to the
   International Space Station. John Glenn offers a sample of space food
   to President Clinton. Shuttle commander Brian Duffy sips on a space
   drink before launching on mission STS-92.

    Condiments are provided such as ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. Salt
     and pepper are available but only in a liquid form. This is because
    astronauts can't sprinkle salt and pepper on their food in space. The
    salt and pepper would simply float away. There is a danger they could
    clog air vents, contaminate equipment or get stuck in an astronaut's
                            eyes, mouth or nose.

       Astronauts eat three meals a day - breakfast, lunch and dinner.
    Nutritionists ensure the food they eat provides them with a balanced
      supply of vitamins and minerals. Calorie requirements differ for
   astronauts. For instance, a small woman would require only about 1,900
    calories a day, while a large man would require about 3,200 calories.
   There are also many types of foods an astronaut can choose from such as
    fruits, nuts, peanut butter, chicken, beef, seafood, candy, brownies,
    etc... Drinks range from coffee, tea, orange juice, fruit punches and
                                  lemonade.

   Astronaut Richard A. Searfoss, STS-90 mission commander, sorts out food
   on the mid deck of Space Shuttle Columbia. Expedition Two Commander
   Yuri Usachev prepares food in the space station's galley. Expedition
   Two Flight Engineer James Voss with two apples.

      As on Earth, space food comes in packages that must be disposed.
    Astronauts must throw their packages away in a trash compactor inside
    the space shuttle when they are done eating. Some packaging actually
    prevents food from flying away. The food packaging is designed to be
     flexible, easier to use, as well as maximize space when stowing or
                         disposing food containers.
          The Expedition One crew balance oranges on their fingers.

   Why do astronauts eat tortillas instead of bread?
