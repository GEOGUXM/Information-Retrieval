   FIDO at May 2000 Field Tests The FIDO (Field Integrated Design &
   Operations) rover is a prototype of the Athena rover that is being
   considered for the 2003 NASA Mars mission. FIDO is equipped with many
   of the elements of the Athena payload. It is used to simulate the
   complex surface operations expected of the Athena Payload, focusing on
   identification of rock targets, approaching the targets and conducting
   in-situ measurements, and drilling and verification of cores. WITS is
   the command software for the FIDO rover.

   The FIDO field test in May of 2000 was used to evaluate new rover
   operations scenarios for the potential Athena rover mission while
   utilizing Internet based operations enabled with WITS and MECS (The
   Multimission Encrypted Communication System).

   During the field test, operators used WITS and MECS to visualize
   downlink data and generate command sequences from JPL; Ithaca, New
   York; Birmingham, Alabama; Flagstaff, Arizona; St. Louis, Missouri; and
   Copenhagen, Denmark. In the operations readiness tests leading up to
   the field test, scientists Steve Squyres and Ray Arvidson and their
   colleagues from Cornell University and Washington University,
   respectively, were able to lead the tests from their remote locations.

   The field test demonstrated that WITS and MECS will enable efficient
   distributed operations in the next Mars rover mission.
