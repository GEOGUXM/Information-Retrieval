   Frequently Asked Questions

      If you still have questions, please send an email to Ask eRA at
      askera@od.nih.gov. Please continue sending technical questions to the
      Helpdesk at helpdesk@od.nih.gov.

   By what date does NIH plan to accept electronic grant applications?

      By 2003. However, mailing in a grant application in paper form will
      remain an option for many years.

   How is the eRA website managed?

      The eRA web site has adopted an enterprise content management system to
      managed its web site.

   What about all those acronyms?

      Try the glossaries in the eRA, IMPAC II, and Commons websites.
      If you still can't find it, try Help.

What are the relationships between and among eRA, IMPAC II, and NIH Commons?

   eRA (Electronic Research Administration) is the overarching initiative
   to take NIH's extramural research business fully into the electronic
   age. eRA integrates the internal NIH system (IMPAC II) and the external
   research community system (Commons). Over time, modules and
   administration of IMPAC II and Commons will merge into one, while
   others will remain distinct.

   Already Commons exchanges data with the IMPAC II system. IMPAC II is
   for NIH internal use only, whereas Commons is for the external research
   community. Still, registration is required for access to Commons
   modules, and privacy of information is protected.

What are the relevant websites?

   eRA: http://era.nih.gov
   IMPAC II (NIH staff only):
   http://odoerdb2.od.nih.gov/oer/impac/impac.htm
   NIH Commons: https://www-commons.cit.nih.gov/

   The eRA website contains information about eRA, including project
   management, business areas, scheduling, calendars, electronic
   newsletters for the NIH community and partners, and links to the NIH
   Commons and IMPAC II websites, and more.

What does IMPAC stand for?

   Information for Management, Planning, Analysis, and Coordination -- the
   original internal NIH electronic research administration system. IMPAC
   II has largely replaced the legacy IMPAC system.

Which data format does NIH prefer?

   NIH's policy is to support all electronic data formats used by the
   external research community: HTML, PDF, EDI, and XML. Clearly, the
   high-capacity datastreaming of EDI is attractive for larger research
   institutions, while the flexibility of XML makes it potentially very
   useful in the long run, though it is not yet a mature technology.

Why don't NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies all have a single grant
application form?

   The federal agencies are cooperating to develop Federal Commons as the
   common grants interface with the external research community. Federal
   Commons will employ an XML-based system to translate incoming
   electronic grant applications into formats appropriate for each agency.
   The ultimate goal is to reduce duplication of forms and effort.

   Currently, the Federal Commons site allows you to access individual
   agencies' own homepages or grant websites after deciding on a general
   topic, such as agriculture, cultural affairs or health. Once the new
   eRA website is up and running, users will be able to browse program
   announcements, submit grant proposals and check on award status of all
   applications already submitted to any federal body, all from this
   "common" site.

   The process and forms also will be standardized. For example, there
   will be a single log-on system, and both institutional and individual
   users will create a profile that can be accessed when conducting
   transactions.

   The Federal Commons portal will achieve full functionality as a single
   portal for grant information/transactions in fiscal year 2003, under
   current plans and subject to available funding.

   When the Federal Commons is fully operational, grant applications and
   reports submitted to the Federal Commons for NIH will be communicated
   to the NIH eRA Commons.
