                                   History

   Science has dictated through the years, that every accomplishment man
   has made has come from a previous accomplishment. Ideas built upon
   other ideas, through time create a new technological world. A world
   which holds answers to the many questions society has about time,
   space, and life. The cryobot is one way in which we would like to try
   and answer some of these questions. While its purpose is very unique,
   it has predecessors with similar ideas.

   Past projects from current ICE Probe team members, which will also
   contribute to the ICE probe advancement, can be seen below.
