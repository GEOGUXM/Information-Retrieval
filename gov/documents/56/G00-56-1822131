   T-DO/T-DOT Division Office Technical:
          These staff are engaged in special projects that do not readily
          fit into one of the groups. One of the projects is a fundamental
          study of the processes of hearing and in modeling the mechanisms
            associated with the workings of the auditory system, and the
            application of wavelet theory to human hearing. Some general
           issues in signal processing are also studied. A second area of
            effort is the application of theoretical science to a broad
            range of national defense issues including stockpile safety,
              asteroid interdiction and new concepts. T-DO carries out
          research in relativistic heavy ions, high-spin states in nuclei,
           asteroid interdiction, atomic and neutron physics, electronic
                  and structural materials, and nonlinear science.

   T-8 Elementary Particles and Field Theory:
           T-8 staff members do research in particle physics, both on the
          standard model of electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions,
          and on theories that go beyond that. This encompasses a program
          in computational quantum chromodynamics using lattice cutoffs to
            calculate the hadron spectrum, quark masses, and weak matrix
           elements, especially those that are required to quantitatively
             understand the experimentally observed CP violation; and a
          significant effort to elucidate the structure of theories which
             invoke extra dimensions to explain our observed universe.
            Fundamental issues of quantum field theory forms another key
           focus of T-8 research, especially in the arena of systems far
             away from equilibrium, as does the study of long distance
            structure of quantized gravity. Further efforts include the
           study of the interfaces between elementary particle, nuclear,
             and astrophysics, the emergence of classical behavior from
                underlying quantum dynamics, and the analysis of the
           controllability of quantum dynamics. Members of the group have
          also applied their competency in numerical analyses and scaling
            theory to stochastic equations for nonequilibrium dynamics,
          modern dynamical systems theory for accelerator design, and the
           study of biological systems; and have designed and implemented
             an automated distributed network for the archival and fast
                         dissemination of research results.

   T-15 Plasma Theory:
            Group T-15 studies the theory of the fourth state of matter,
           plasma, or ionized gas, after solid, liquid, and gas. Most of
             the matter in the universe is in the plasma state: flames,
             fluorescent lights, the earth's magnetosphere, the sun the
           stars, nebulae, thermonuclear explosions, plasmas confined in
          magnetic fields for magnetic fusion energy, and plasmas used for
            industrial processing. Because plasmas are ionized and carry
           electric currents, they interact strongly with electromagnetic
          fields. T-15 studies the basic properties and collective motions
             of plasmas and electromagnetic fields. A major activity is
            computer modeling and simulation of plasmas, developing and
            applying such widely-used codes as the NIMROD 3D, nonlinear
              time-dependent simulation code for magnetically confined
             plasmas; and the DCON code for rapid determination of the
          stability of axisymmetric toroidal plasmas. Numerical simulation
          of magnetized plasmas is particularly challenging because of the
           high degree of anisotropy and range of length and time scales.
           T-15 specializes in development of novel numerical methods to
                             deal with this challenge.

   T-16 Nuclear Physics:
           T-16 staff members study nuclear reaction mechanisms, nuclear
             structure, and provide nuclear data to the Laboratory and
            Nation. Current efforts include the modeling of neutron and
          charged-particle cross sections and spectra for energies up to a
               few GeV, improvement of fission theories and models of
          high-energy heavy ion reactions, developing sophisticated codes
          and libraries for transmutation and radioactivity calculations,
          relativistic heavy ion reactions, performing exact calculations
          of few-body systems, the study of chiral symmetric perturbation
           theory, the production and decay of hypernuclei, structure of
            exotic nuclei and hadrons, and experimental implications of
           proposed new fundamental physical interactions and fundamental
          symmetries and violations thereof, with an emphasis on neutrino
           physics, CP-violation and rare decays of mesons. Applications
           include nuclear weapons design, counter proliferation, fission
             and fusion reactor analysis, radiation shielding, reactor
           safety, radiotherapy, accelerator operation and space travel.
