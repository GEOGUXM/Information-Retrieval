Introduction

   The Thermal Protection Systems Expert and Material Property Database,
   or TPSX, is a personal computer- based program which serves as a
   database for advanced thermal protection material properties. TPSX
   provides an easy user interface for retrieving material property
   information in a variety of forms; both graphical and text. The primary
   purpose and advantage of TPSX is to maintain a high quality source of
   often-used thermal protection material properties in a convenient,
   easily accessible form, for distribution to government and aerospace
   industry communities.

   TPSX is produced and maintained by the engineers and scientists of the
   Thermal Protection Materials and Systems Branch (Code ASM) at NASA Ames
   Research Center. This program is the result of a project to compile,
   maintain and provide easy access to the large amount of material
   property data used by ASM in the development of thermal protection
   systems (TPS).

Program Structure

   TPSX runs on an IBM personal computer, or compatible machine, under the
   Microsoft Windows operating system. This provides an easy and familiar
   "point and click" user interface. Using drop-down menu choices a user
   can display material property information in a tabular form, graphical
   form or as a report. For example, a user can display a graph of a
   material's thermal conductivity as a function of temperature at several
   pressures. A built in units converter makes it effortless to present
   data in a variety of unit systems, such as SI or English. In addition
   there is an option to view digitized photographs and sketches of the
   materials.

   TPSX also provides a means of converting data into a form which can be
   used in existing computational analysis tools, such as finite element
   thermal and stress programs. TPSX formats the data appropriately, in
   the correct units, and outputs it to the screen or to a file on the
   computer hard disk. This file can then be included in the input to the
   analysis program.

   TPSX consists of the computer program itself and associated data files.
   These data files contain the actual property data; such as density,
   thermal conductivity, specific heat, tensile strength, etc. Additional
   data, such as a periodic table of elements and a chemical and material
   species database, are also included in TPSX. The program accesses these
   files then presents the information in the form requested by the user.

   Although TPSX was developed for use in the design of thermal protection
   systems, it is general enough to be used as a repository for any
   material property data. Users can create their own database using the
   built in database editor. The database accepts property values which
   depend on as many as three independent values. Thus, for example, it is
   possible to include thermal conductivity as a function of both
   temperature and pressure, or material strength as a function of
   temperature and orientation.

Material Databases

   TPSX comes with several material property databases.

   [NASA Ames Access] The Ames ASM database includes over 60 TPS
   materials. These include ceramic tile and flexible blanket materials
   used on the Shuttle thermal protection system. All the materials
   include a point of contact and some have digitized photographs.
   [NASA Ames Access] The JSC database was compiled by Johnson Space
   Center and includes over 130 materials.
   [NASA Ames Access] A refractory database includes over 500 materials
   compiled from a report by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
   [NASA Ames Access] A JANAF database includes properties of over 1000
   chemical species.

  System Requirements

   TPSX requires the following system hardware and software:

   [NASA Ames Access] IBM PC clone with at least a 386 CPU (TPSX has not
                      been tested on 286 or lower CPUs)
   [NASA Ames Access] High density (1.44MB) 3Â½" floppy drive
   [NASA Ames Access] Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher running in Standard
                      or Enhanced Mode
   [NASA Ames Access] At least 8 MB of system memory (RAM)
   [NASA Ames Access] Hard disk with at least 9 MB of free space
   [NASA Ames Access] VGA resolution monitor (super-VGA with 256 colors
                      strongly recommended)
   [NASA Ames Access] Windows compatible mouse strongly recommended but
                      not required

   TPSX v1.1 has also been tested successfully under Insignia Solutions'
   SoftWindows IBM-PC emulator on a UNIX X-Windows workstation and on the
   Power Mac machines. However, program performance is severely reduced on
   the Power Mac platform.

  Windows 95 & 98!

   TPSX is compatible with Windows 95/98, Windows NT Server 3.51/4.0 and
   Windows NT Workstation 3.51/4.0. Users should have no problem
   installing or running TPSX under these new operating systems.

  The Future

   Future enhancements to TPSX include: a simple 1-D thermal analysis
   module to estimate material temperatures under a given heating
   condition; a module to predict the heating conditions for atmospheric
   entry trajectories used in the design of thermal protection systems;
   and the addition of other material databases.

   A true 32-bit version of TPSX V1.1 for Windows 95 and Windows NT is
   scheduled to be released in the Fall of 1997.

  Ordering TPSX

   Beginning with Version 1.1, the TPSX program and manual will be
   distributed through this Web site. NASA controls the distribution of
   TPSX and the associated material databases and requires those who
   request it to sign a non-disclosure agreement. On this one-page form
   the user agrees not to disseminate the program or data without approval
   from NASA.

   If a NASA developed computer code is not available through COSMIC ,
   NASA Management Instruction 2210.2B will permit its distribution under
   the following conditions: 1) the user is a U.S. citizen or resident
   alien; 2) the code will be used only within the United States and not
   disclose it to third parties; 3) the user will assist NASA in the
   development of the code by reporting problems encountered and any
   modifications made; and 4) the user will place no limitations on NASA's
   use of reported modifications.

   To become a registered user of TPSX, refer to the User Registration
   Instructions.

   If you are already a registered user of TPSX Version 1.0 and would like
   to get the latest Version 1.1, go to the TPSX Version 1.1 Download Page
   and follow the instructions.
