508 Training

   The 508 Universe serves as a central hub for GSA's section 508 training
   and information resources. In it you can access each of the
   topic-specific courses that address 508 implementation as well as
   explore Web links and a glossary of 508-related terms. When you first
   visit the site, you will be asked to set up a username and password. No
   additional information is required in the registration process; you are
   not asked for any identifying or personal data. The username is used to
   track where you are in the courses so that should you choose to leave a
   course before finishing it, you can choose to "resume" when you next
   enter the Universe. This eliminates any possible security risk of using
   cookies, and no files are written to your computer.

   Enter the 508 Universe and access the available courses listed below.

     * Designing Accessible Websites
       Are you a webmaster in charge of developing or revising your
       agency's web site? Or, are you a manager who oversees the web
       development efforts of your agency? Either way, you need to know
       how the Access Board's standards for section 508 affect your site.
