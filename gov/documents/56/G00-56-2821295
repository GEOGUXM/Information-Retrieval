   Beyond SIM             [led-off.gif]

   Successful development of SIM requires that three "grand technological
   challenges" be met and overcome: (1) nanometer level control and
   stabilization of optical element positions on a lightweight flexible
   structure; (2) sub-nanometer level sensing of optical element relative
   positions over meters of separation distance; (3) overall instrument
   complexity and the implications for interferometer integration and test
   and autonomous on-orbit operation.

   The Interferometry Technology Program at JPL is addressing these grand
   challenges and other technical issues with a three-part program.

   [stabil.gif] Stabilization of Optical Pathlength on a lightweight
   flexible structure in the presence of spacecraft vibration and thermal
   distortions, in order to mainain high fringe visibility and enable
   starlight nulling (also see the 6th Microdynamics Workshop in June
   1999).

    10 nm stabilization for astrometry
    1 nm stabilization for nulling

   component relative positional parameters over meters of separation
   distance to enable microarcsecond astrometry.

    50 pm for narrow-angle astrometry
    200 pm for wide-angle astrometry
   [test.gif] Integration and Test of a complex interferometer instrument,
   its autonomous on-orbit operation and performance prediction.

    3 interferometer baselines operating together

   The fundamental feasibility of meeting these technological challenges
   has already been demonstrated and a bibliography of publications by
   members of the technology program is available.
