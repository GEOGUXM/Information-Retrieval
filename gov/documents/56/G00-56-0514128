                        MEETING RULES AND PROCEDURES:

   SPEAKER SIGN-UP & TIME LIMITS. If you wish to speak on an item, please
   fill out a "Request to Speak" form and give it to a staff person before
   the public hearing. The forms are available near the door to the
   meeting room. Time limits are indicated on the speaker sign-up forms,
   and later in this summary, and in case of questions or disputes, the
   Chairman will determine the time limits for each speaker at the
   beginning of the public hearing. Speakers on non-permit items may be
   limited to five minutes or less depending on the number wishing to be
   heard. Time limits for permit items are combined total time for all
   speakers in favor of or in opposition to the project. Written comments
   may be of any length; you are encouraged to submit detailed information
   in writing to staff for distribution to Commissioners. Please provide
   twenty copies if possible.

   SUGGESTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN MATERIALS. It is requested that
   written materials be submitted to Commission staff no later than three
   working days before the hearing. In the upper right hand corner of the
   first page of your submittal please identify the agenda item number,
   your name and your position in favor or opposition to the project.
   Please attempt to summarize your position in no more than two or three
   pages. You may attach as many exhibits as you feel are necessary.
   Please Note: While not prohibited from doing so, you are discouraged
   from submitting written materials to the Commission on the day of the
   hearing, unless they are visual aids. It is more difficult for
   Commissioners to carefully consider late material.

   NO FAXs will be accepted at the meeting site. You may be able to make
   prior arrangements with staff or a Commissioner to send a fax, but you
   will be responsible for paying the hotel or meeting site for its
   receipt.

   CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. Government Code Section 84308 requires
   Commissioners to disqualify themselves from voting on any matter if
   they have received a campaign contribution of more than $250 from an
   interested party. If you intend to speak on any hearing item, please
   indicate on your speaker slip and/or in your testimony, if you have
   made campaign contributions of more than $250 to any Commissioner
   within the last year, and if so, to which Commissioners you
   contributed.

   CONTACTS with COMMISSIONERS. New legal requirements limit
   communications with staff and commissioners. Written materials sent to
   Commissioners must be sent to staff at the same time. All
   non-procedural communications must become part of the record. For a
   summary of these requirements, please call the receptionist at (415)
   904-5200.

   PUBLIC STATEMENTS ABOUT ITEMS NOT ON THIS AGENDA. Before the lunch
   recess each day there will be time for public statements about the work
   of the Commission other than items that are pending before the
   Commission. Persons wishing to speak during this period should be sure
   to fill out a sign-up slip, and should limit the length of the
   presentation to 5 minutes or less. If this public comment period is
   inconvenient, you may submit written comments to the Commission office,
   and copies will be distributed to all Commissioners.

   WHEN WILL MY AGENDA ITEM BE HEARD? Unfortunately, no one can predict
   how quickly the Commission will complete agenda items or how many will
   be postponed to a later date. The Commission begins each session at the
   time listed on the Meeting Notice and considers each item in order,
   except in extraordinary circumstances. The Commission may consider an
   item even though the interested persons are not present.

   STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS. A written staff report & recommendation will be
   available for most items on this agenda. At the end of the agenda
   description the author's initials and a code indicating his/her
   headquarters office are identified (E=Eureka SF=San Francisco SC=Santa
   Cruz V=Ventura LB=Long Beach SD=San Diego). To encourage public
   participation, staff reports will be distributed 10 days before the
   meeting whenever possible. If you are interested in any item on this
   Meeting Notice contact the nearest Commission office to arrange for a
   copy of the staff report & recommendation to be made available to you.

   WAIVERS OF PERMIT & EMERGENCY PERMITS. The District Directors of the
   Commission's various offices will announce the Executive Director's
   decisions to waive coastal permit requirements and issuance of
   emergency permits during the "Deputy Director's Report" item at the
   beginning of each section of the agenda.

   VISUAL MATERIALS. You may use slides and other materials at the
   hearing. A slide projector & carousel will be available, and Commission
   staff can assist you in its use. All materials exhibited to the
   Commission during the hearing (slides, maps, etc) are part of the
   public record and must be kept by the Commission for 60 days after
   final Commission action on the matter. Your materials will be returned
   upon written request.

   PUBLIC & ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS. Many public records on agenda items
   will be available for inspection at the meeting, and are available at
   all other times in the Commission office. Please call our office to
   make an appointment to see any file you are interested in. If you need
   a verbatim transcript of these proceedings, there will be a court
   reporter present at the hearing. If you decide to challenge a final
   decision of the Commission in Court, please request preparation of an
   administrative record by letter to the Administrative Records Section
   at the Commission office in San Francisco, and indicate in your letter
   a description on the agenda item and the date(s) of Commission action.
   Such a record will include a transcript of the proceedings at the
   hearing.

   CLOSED SESSION. At any time during the meeting the Commission may meet
   to consider possible and pending litigation in a session closed to the
   public pursuant to attorney-client privilege and statutory exemption to
   the Open Meeting Act (Government Code Section 11126e).

   ACCESS TO HEARINGS. The hearings are wheelchair accessible. If
   accommodation for other disabilities is required, please call (415)
