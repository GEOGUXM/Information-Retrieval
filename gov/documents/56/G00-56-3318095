The California Boating and Waterways Commission

   The Boating and Waterways Commission is mandated by the Harbors and
   Navigation Code to advise the Department on all matters within its
   jurisdiction. The Commission must also consent to all boating
   facilities loans and grants proposed by the Department.

   The Commission is composed of seven members appointed by the Governor
   and confirmed by the State Senate. Each Commissioner's term runs for
   four years. The Code specifies that in making appointments to the
   Commission, the Governor shall give primary consideration to the
   geographical location of the residences of members as related to
   boating activities and harbors. One member is required to be a private
   small craft harbor owner and operator, one member must belong to a
   recognized statewide organization representing recreational boaters,
   and one member must be an officer or employee of a local law
   enforcement agency responsible for enforcing boating laws.
