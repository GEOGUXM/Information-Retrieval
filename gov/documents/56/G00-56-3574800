           Athletic Commission Donates Money to Amateur Boxing

       The Pete Suazo Professional Athletic Commission under the Utah
   Department of Commerce donated $4,806 dollars to amateur boxing in the
   state under the provisions of legislation sponsored by the late Utah
   State Senator Pete Suazo. The money donated comes from a $1 per ticket
   fee to all boxing and other unarmed combat events that took place in
   Utah between July 1st and December 1st, 2001. Senator Pete Suazo was a
   long time boxing referee and avid supporter of the sport in our state.
   This donation represents his desire to see amateur boxing continue to
   grow and prosper in Utah.
   Richard Winesoft, Chairman of the Athletic Commission said, "Senator
   Pete Suazo's passion, besides his family was amateur boxing. He was an
   avid supporter of boxing and a champion of the underdog. This money
   will help bring young men and women off the streets and into the gyms
   and give them a purpose."
   "This money will go a long way to get boxers to tournaments around the
   country and provide them with food and lodging. " commented Larry
   Fullmer, President of Utah Amateur Boxing. "The majority of the
   participants in amateur boxing don't have the means to do this
   financially."
   Other members of the Pete Suazo Professional Athletic Commission
   include: Scott Burns, Steve Lunt, Ron Yengich and Jim Young.
   Utah Amateur Boxing will hold their state tournament February 1st and
       2nd at the Marshall White Center in Ogden.
