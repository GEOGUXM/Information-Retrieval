   you to utilize the search tool GEOREF for subject/author/keyword
   searches. Once you've located the desired
   publication, contact USGS Branch of Information Services/Denver at
   (303) 202-4700 for ordering and payment.
   For recent Texas publications, fill out our request form and we will
   accommodate your request if copies are still available.
