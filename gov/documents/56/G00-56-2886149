   0600 Monday August 16 The first RHIC Beam Commissioning run finished
   this morning. Beam is next expected to be seen in RHIC in December
   1999. A brief summary of progress so far in BLUE and YELLOW rings is as
   follows:
   BLUE Beam has been efficiently injected, captured, and stored in the
   BLUE ring, with lifetimes as long as 45 minutes. Acceleration by a
   modest amount - about 1 GeV per nucleon - has been demonstrated at a
   slow ramp rate. The biggest challenge in commissioning the BLUE ring
   was the need to maneuver the closed orbit around a small number of
   apparent obstacles in the beam pipe. These obstacles will be
   investigated - and removed - when the ring is warmed up in September.
   YELLOW Thousands of turns of beam were briefly seen in the YELLOW ring,
   allowing successful RF capture. Long lifetimes have not yet been
   established, nor has acceleration been performed. No apparent obstacles
   have been found in YELLOW, in a positive contrast to BLUE. On the other
   hand, steering and second turn closure in the injection region were
   found to be more difficult than in BLUE, as also was steering through
   the YELLOW dump area. The situation will be greatly ameliorated in the
   next beam commissioning run, when we will be able to use the nominal
   injection optics with a beta function value of beta* = 10.0 meters at
   all 6 interaction points. The optics used so far had beta* = 2.9
   meters, much closer to the nominal luminosity optics with beta* = 2.0
   than to the injection optics.
