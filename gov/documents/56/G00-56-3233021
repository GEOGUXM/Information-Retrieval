   material to be copied.

   If the case is closed, the file may have been transferred to the
   Federal Records Center. A staff member can provide you with the

   that you may make arrangements for your file to be copied.

How long will it be before I may file bankruptcy again?

   Contact your attorney for information regarding when you may or may not
   file a bankruptcy petition or refer to the United States Bankruptcy
   Code.

Can you help me prepare my bankruptcy petition?

   No. The Clerk's office does not provide legal assistance of any kind.

I filed a bankruptcy case and received my discharge in 1991. A creditor now
tells me that I need a copy of my discharge - how do I get that?

   Contact the records department of the Clerk's office to receive the
   appropriate Federal Records Center information regarding the location
   of a closed bankruptcy case file.

What is the difference between a discharge and a dismissal?

   A discharge is a release of a debtor from personal liability for
   certain dischargeable debts which prohibits creditors from ever taking
   any action against the debtor to collect those debts.  Some debts are
   not dischargeable and the debtor is responsible for those debts after
   bankruptcy.  If a case is terminated for any reason before a discharge
   has been issued, that case is 'dismissed'.  For more information,
   please review The Discharge in Bankruptcy in our Informational Forms
   section or contact your attorney.

I just received a 'Discharge of Debtor' form in the mail. What is it?

   This form is indication that the debts owed by the debtor have been
   fully discharged. You may wish to retain this form in a safe place, as
   you may be asked by future creditors to provide a copy.

Can you fax a copy of my discharge to me? My creditor listing(s)?

   No. The Clerk's office does not provide facsimile copying of documents.
   You must either appear in person at the records counter of the Clerk's
   office or submit a request in writing to the appropriate Clerk's
   office.

I am a creditor in a bankruptcy case. May I fax the Court a completed proof
of claim form?

   No. The Clerk's office does not accept fax documents.

Am I listed as a creditor in case number _______ or case name ________?

   A $15.00 search fee per case may be assessed for information that is
   not readily available.

   You are welcome to come to our office(s) and access our database using
   the computer systems available in the public area free of charge to
   find information.

How far back do you keep computerized records?

   September 1, 1989 and are continuous thereafter.

   Cases open as of September 1, 1989 through cases filed as of June 30,
   1991 can be viewed in the public area on the 'NIBS' computer database.
