   Internet Applications

   EAD uses the Internet extensively to communicate and manage
   environmental information

   Environmental projects often involve multiple stakeholders and
   substantial information management and communication needs. EAD makes
   extensive use of Internet technologies because the Internet provides
   cost-effective remote access to data and services.

   EAD web sites and e-mail applications provide a variety of services and
   information to support technical program needs including:
     * Database query, reporting and updating
     * Geospatial information display and management
     * Document repositories
     * Project management services
     * E-mail based notification systems

   Application Areas

   Since 1995, EAD has developed more than 70 web sites and e-mail
   applications in every major technical area in which it is active.
   Benefits to sponsors have included greater stakeholder involvement,
   simplified management processes, cost savings, and improved technical
   products. Follow these links to learn more about EAD Internet
   applications in:
   Environmental Emergency Response
   Web-enabled maps and databases provide timely information to
   environmental emergency response efforts.
   Hazardous Waste Site Characterization and Remediation
   Field analytics and sensors, combined with web sites for data
   organization and presentation, facilitate real-time characterization
   and remediation efforts.
   Environmental Documentation and Compliance
   Customized web sites streamline environmental compliance management
   activities at federal facilities.
   Other Internet Applications

   Environmental Impact Assessment Support
   Internet applications extend the scope of public information and
   participation in the environmental impact statement (EIS) process while
   reducing program management and administration costs.

   Information about some of the Internet tools that EAD uses for
   application development is also available.
