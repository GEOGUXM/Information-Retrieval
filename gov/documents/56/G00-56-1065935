   The Visualization and Earth Science Applications (VESA) group is part
   of the Science Data Processing Systems Section (Section 388) at the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

   Efforts of the VESA group are focused on Science Data Visualization and
   Computer Graphics. JPL's mission for NASA is to explore the Solar
   System. The VESA group supports this activity by producing still and
   animated visualizations for the planetary exploration missions. The
   VESA group also performs visualization efforts for the private
   industry, other NASA centers, and other branches of the U.S.
   government.

   The VESA group operates the Digital Image Animation Laboratory (DIAL).
   The DIAL facility contains:

     * Broadcast Quality Video Equipment
     * High Definition Television (HDTV)
     * SGI , Sun , Macintosh , DEC , and NT computers
     * AGFA High End Scanner

   The VESA group has performed data visualization at JPL since the mid
   1980's. An early and well known animation produced by group is L.A. The
   Movie , a 3D perspective rendering of a flight around the Los Angeles
   (California) area starting off the coast behind Catalina Island and
   includes a brief flight up the San Andreas Fault-line. Since then the
   group has produced many such animation including flights around Mars,
   Venus, Miranda (a moon of Jupiter) and much more.
