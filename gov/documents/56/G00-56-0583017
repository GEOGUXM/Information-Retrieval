   Its never too late to
     * Fix things if theyre broken. Make plans. Don't give up. Schedule
       counseling. Take a parenting class. Have some fun.

     * Make another effort to communicate with the other parent. Keep
       trying. Learn to communicate without "pushing buttons".

     * Apologize to your children if you know you have hurt them with your
       behavior or words. Keep them out of the middle. They will love you
       for it.

     * Redirect unresolved anger by finding appropriate resources. You
       will feel better, and deserve it. So do your kids.

     * Find constructive alternatives for problem-solving. Take charge.
       Surprise yourself!

     * Forgive your former partner, and to forgive yourself. Someone wise
       once said, "Forgiveness is a gift you give to yourself."
