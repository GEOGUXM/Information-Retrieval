   VOYAGER MISSION OPERATIONS STATUS REPORT #1208,  DECEMBER 22 – DECEMBER
   28, 2001



   COMMAND TRANSMISSION & VERIFICATION OPERATIONS


   There were no Voyager 1 command operations during the period.


   Voyager 2 command operations consisted of the uplink of seven bracketed
   command loss timer resets sent on five-minute centers using 0.5 Hz
   steps on 12/27 [DOY 361/0052z].   The spacecraft received four of the
   seven commands sent.


   SEQUENCE GENERATION OPERATIONS


   Continue sequence development of CCSL B115.


   DATA RETURN OPERATIONS


   Voyager 1 Data Processing and Operations:


   There were 77.3 hours of DSN scheduled support for Voyager 1 of which
   4.0 hours were large aperture coverage. There were no real-time or
   schedule support changes during the period.


   There were two significant outages during the period both caused by
   poor weather conditions at Madrid.  The first outage of 8.3 hours
   duration was caused by a snowstorm at DSS-65 on 12/23 [DOY 357, DR
   M100431].  The second outage of 1.2 hours was attributed to poor
   weather conditions at DSS-65 on 12/24 [DOY 358, DR M100440].


   Science instrument performance was nominal for all activities during
   this period.  One frame of GS-4 data was recorded this week.  The
   AHELI1 cyclic for recording additional GS-4 data was enabled on
   November 17.  One frame of GS-4 data from this cyclic was recorded on
   December 22.  The EDR backlog is 2 days.



   Voyager 2 Data Processing and Operations:


   There were 68.2 hours of DSN scheduled support for Voyager 2 of which
   7.8 hours were large aperture coverage. There were no real-time or
   schedule support changes during the period.


   There was one significant outages of 0.6 hours duration on 12/26 [DOY
   360] due to a commercial power outage at DSS-45. [DR C100754].


   Science instrument performance was nominal for all activities during
   this period.  One frame of GS-4 data was recorded this week.  A second
   frame of GS-4 data was recorded on December 22, using the BHELI 1
   cyclic, which was enabled on July 14.  The PRA receiver recovered from
   it’s 82^nd POR event on December 24.  This event occurred between two
   station DSS-45 passes.  The EDR backlog is 3 days.



   FLIGHT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE


   Voyager 1 performance was nominal during this report period.


   Voyager 2 performance was nominal during this report period.
