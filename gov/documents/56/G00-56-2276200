   [OpsA-w.gif] Biology Department
   Brookhaven's Biology Department has an extraordinary combination of
   strengths in molecular genetics, structural biology, genomics,
   enzymology, and biotechnology. Department researchers study a diverse
   set of problems in plant, microbial, and mammalian biology. Current
   areas of investigation include DNA damage recognition and repair, plant
   and microbial genomics and proteomics, enzyme engineering, the
   regulation of gene expression, and the exploration of complex
   biological structures. See the historic achievements of this
   department. [1px-xparent.gif] [GABA-vsm.gif] Chemistry Department
   A model of an important brain chemical-- GABA, involved in the
   modulation of brain dopamine -- symbolizes the wide range of research
   conducted in the BNL Chemistry Department. GABA is important to
   Chemistry's PET studies of the human brain. The department also focuses
   on both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, studies of gas phase
   dynamics of reactive species, solar photoconversion and other
   chemistries.

   [geothermal-w.gif] Energy Sciences & Technology Department
   This image is a view of a thermally conductive cement grout for use
   with geothermal heat pumps. The Energy Sciences & Technology (ES&T)
   Department conducts basic and applied science, research and
   development, and technology implementation and deployment to support
   the DOE objectives of assuring adequate supplies of clean/affordable
   energy, reducing U.S. vulnerability to supply disruptions, advancing
   alternative and renewable energy technologies, and increasing energy
   choices, maintaining U.S. leadership in energy supply and use; and
   educating new generations of scientists. [1px-xparent.gif]

   [RFQ-w.gif] Collider-Accelerator Department
   A view of the injection system that sends protons  or heavy ions
   speeding into the ring at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).
   Proton beams accelerated in the AGS strike targets in different
   experiments, creating showers of particles that help physicists from
   BNL and around the world study the universe's tiniest components of
   matter. The Collider-Accelerator Department includes the staff who work
   to improve the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, the AGS, and the Tandem
   Van de Graaff accelerators, and the physicists who use these tools in
   their research. See the historic achievements of this department.

   [MRC-logo-w.gif] Medical Department
   The Medical Department's logo combines the traditional Aescalapius
   insignia of a staff and serpent with an atom, symbolizing the many
   advances in nuclear medicine made by BNL medical researchers. BNL
   physicians work with chemists in the Center for Imaging & Neurosciences
   to explore the human brain using medical imaging techniques based on
   medical radioisotopes. Other research projects in the Medical
   Department are aimed at developing new nuclear medicine treatments and
   diagnostic agents, producing medical isotopes for clinical use, and
   understanding and treating cancer and heart disease. See the historic
   achievements of this department. [1px-xparent.gif]

   [mat-sci-pic-j.jpg] Materials Science Department
   Major efforts of this department include the investigation of
   properties of superconducting oxides; methods of superconductor
   characterization and fabrication; the properties of advanced
   permanent-magnet materials; the synthesis of materials for advanced
   battery and fuel-cell applications; the investigation of mechanisms of
   metal passivation and localized corrosion; development and
   investigation of the properties of cementitious and glassy materials;
   and advanced methods of electron microscopy to characterize the
   nanoscale structure of advanced materials.

   [xray-microdiff-w.gif] National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)
   Department
   This image was generated at the NSLS during x-ray studies of the
   microstructure of silicon and germanium films. The NSLS provides one of
   the world's brightest continuous sources of x-ray and UV radiation for
   scientific research. This light is a beacon for more than 2,300
   scientists from BNL, academia and industry annually, who use it to shed
   light on everything from the structure of molecules to microchips.

   [nonprolif-pic.jpg] Nonproliferation & National Security
   The mission of The Nonproliferation and National Security Department is
   to carry out research and development, provide technical support, and
   build prototype systems in order to further U.S. Government initiatives
   and policies in  Nuclear materials safeguards and security, Arms
   control treaty verification, Nonproliferation of weapons of mass
   destruction, Material Protection Control and Accountability initiatives
   for nuclear materials in Russia and the NIS, and related national
   security areas.

   [g-2_part-ring-sm.gif] Physics Department
   This is a three-quarter view of the muon storage ring used in the g-2
   experiment being conducted by the Physics Department. BNL physicists
   pursue experimental and theoretical discoveries in high-energy, nuclear
   and solid-state physics, and help design and build many of the world's
   foremost physics facilities, both at Brookhaven and around the globe.

   [wafer.gif] Instrumentation Division
   A wafer of computer chips symbolizes just one aspect of the high-tech
   research and service that goes on in the Instrumentation Division.
   Besides monolithic circuit design, the division is working to create
   innovative detectors for experiments at BNL and elsewhere, and to push
   the boundaries of printed circuit board design.

   [SMD_magnet-w.gif] Superconducting Magnet Division
   The BNL Superconducting Magnet Division constructs magnets for use in
   particle accelerators such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
   Superconducting magnets which must be cooled to temperatures near
   absolute zero produce stronger magnetic fields and consume less energy
   than conventional copper wire electromagnets. Building on the magnet
   designs and construction methods developed for RHIC, this Division is
   building magnets for use in Europe's Large Hadron Collider and HERA
   accelerators. [1px-xparent.gif]

   Explores our natural environment, and turns scientific ideas into
   practical applications. The image shown is of the Free Air CO2
   Enrichment ecology research center in North Carolina, one of many built
   around the world by Brookhaven scientists to study the effect of excess
   atmospheric carbon dioxide on different ecosystems.
