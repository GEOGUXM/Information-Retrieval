   Common Criteria Evaluation & Validation Scheme
   __________________________________________________

   Project Description: The National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) have established a
   program under the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) to
   evaluate IT product conformance to international standards. The
   program, officially known as the NIAP Common Criteria Evaluation and
   Validation Scheme for IT Security (CCEVS) is a partnership between the
   public and private sectors. This program is being implemented to help
   consumers select commercial off-the-shelf information technology (IT)
   products that meet their security requirements and to help
   manufacturers of those products gain acceptance in the global
   marketplace.

   Project Objectives:
     * To meet the needs of government and industry for cost-effective
       evaluation of IT products;
     * To encourage the formation of commercial security testing
       laboratories and the development of a private sector security
       testing industry;
     * To ensure that security evaluations of IT products are performed to
       consistent standards;
     * To improve the availability of evaluated IT products.
