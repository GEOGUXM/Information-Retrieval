                         First-Principles Prediction of
                          Short-Range Order in Alloys

   Solid state alloys at high temperatures often undergo a phase
   transition to a disordered arrangement of the constituent atoms. The
   arrangement is not random, however, but may exhibit some degree of
   short-range order, i.e., the excess probability of finding certain
   pairs of atoms relative to random statistics. For the first time,
   ``state-of-the-art'' first-principles calculations including the
   effects of atomic displacements have been extended to high
   temperatures, and the resulting short-range order predicted. The
   short-range order has been predicted for a variety of transition metal
   and semiconductor alloys. The excess pair probabilities associated with
   short-range order are also a physically measurable effect, and we have
   compared our parameter-free calculations with experimental
   measurements, finding excellent agreement. Our calculations have led to
   an increased understanding of ordering properties in these alloys.

   Many transition metal alloy systems are currently being considered as a
   new class of materials for high-temperature applications. In many cases
   these applications have been limited to date, however, oftentimes due
   to a lack of fundamental understanding of the materials properties.
   Also, in many semiconductor alloys, the degree or extent of ordering is
   not even known experimentally. The current theoretical calculations
   demonstrate that ordering processes in alloys may be understood and
   even predicted (without reference to any experiment) on a fundamental,
   microscopic level. The theoretical predictions are shown to be highly
   accurate by comparing with experimental measurements for transition
   metal alloys, for which an abundance of experimental data exists. These
   calculational tools are not specific to transition metals, however,
   thus opening the door to calculations of ordering in the highly
   technologically important semiconductor alloys, where there exists very
   little or no experimental data.
