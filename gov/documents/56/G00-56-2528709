   FILE:CALPAIN.PRT REVISED: 25 AUG 1994 Calpain/Calpastatin Extraction
   and Assay 1. In a metal Waring Blendor jar,extract 10 grams muscle in 3
   times the volume of extraction buffer plus the following inhibitors:
   2mM PMSF, 6 mg/liter leupeptin and 100 mg/liter ovomucoid. Homogenize 4
   times on high for 30 secs., with 30 secs. of cooling in between bursts.
   2. Pour homogenate into centrifuge tubes. Using a rubber policeman and
   extraction buffer (~10 ml) to remove all of the homogenate. May need to
   use 2 centrifuge tubes. 3. Centrifuge in Beckman JA-17 rotor for 2 hrs
   at 17,000 rpm 4. Filter through cheesecloth/glasswool sandwich directly
   into dialysis tubing. 5. Dialyze against dialysis buffer for 18-24
   hours. 6. Remove (we pipet it) and spin as above. 7. Load on a small
   column (1.5x20 cm) packed with DEAE- sephacel and equilibrated with 1X
   elution buffer. Remove unbound proteins by washing column with 1X
   elution buffer until absorbance of the outflow at 278 nm is <.2. NOTE:
   If you want to express the data in terms of activity per mg protein
   extracted, prior to loading determine volume and protein concentration.
   8. Elute bound proteins with an increasing gradient of NaCl consisting
   of 1X+25mM NaCl to 1X+350mM NaCl(250 ml of each). Collect 140, 3 ml,
   fractions. 9. Assay for calpastatin in fractions 15-55. Sequentially
   add the followings: *1.0 ml of each fraction + sufficient volume of m-
   calpain having net activity of 0.35 (for positive control use 1.0 ml of
   1x+25 mM NaCl instead of the fraction), add 1.0 ml of assay media and
   then 100 ul of 100 mM CaCl2, vortex and then incubate at 25 C for 60
   min. Stop the reaction with 2 ml of 5% TCA (Trichloroacetic acid).
   Centrifuge for 30 min. at 2000 rpm. Read A278. Fraction having
   calpastatin activity will be clear, while those without calpastatin
   activity will be turbid due to casein hydrolysis. Pool all fraction
   having calpastatin activity and assay again as above, but this time use
   various volume and use the reading which represent 50% or greater
   inhibition to calculate total calpastatin activity. The relation
   between amount of calpastatin (i.e. µg calpastatin) and m-calpain
   inhibition activity is not linear. Let us assume you pool 15 fractions,
   positive m-calpain activity was 0.33 and 100, 200, 300 and 400 µl of
   the pooled fractions were assayed and had the following reading 0.22,
   0.15, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively. Total Calpastatin activity = (0.33
   - 0.15) x 5 (per ml) x 15 (fracxtions) x fraction volume/ 10 (per gram
   muscle) = 1.35 10. Assay for m-calpain in fractions 101-130. Use 1.0 ml
   of fractions plus 1.0 ml of assay media, add 100 ul of 100 mM CaCl2 and
   incubate at 25 C for 60 min. Stop the reaction with 2.0 ml of 5% TCA ,
   centrifuge and read as for calpastatin. 11. Assay for µ-calpain from
   the end of calpastatin + 30 fractions. Assay as for m-calpain. *
   calpain activity is only linear up to 0.45. Therefore, if fraction
   contain >0.45 reading they will need to be assayed again For further
   details see Koohmaraie, 1990. J. Anim. Sci. 68:659-665
