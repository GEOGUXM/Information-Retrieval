                          on-line training facility

   While browsing FEMA's training.fema.gov web site, FEMA may provide
   links to web pages which are not part of the FEMA web family, or
   fema.gov domain. These sites are not under FEMA control, and FEMA is
   not responsible for the information or links you may find there. FEMA
   is providing these links only as a convenience. The presence of these
   links on any FEMA website is not intended to imply FEMA endorsement of
   that site, but to provide a convenient link to relevant sites which are
   managed by other organizations, companies, or individuals.
