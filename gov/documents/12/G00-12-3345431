          Introduction -- As the trial court for bankruptcy cases and
   related proceedings filed in this District,  this court operates in
   four geographic divisions with courthouses located in Atlanta,
   Gainesville, Newnan and Rome.  We provide this web site as a service to
   those persons having an interest in cases before this court and as a
   source of general information about our operations. We hope that you
   will find it informative and useful.

           Content -- The buttons to the left are the gateways to this
   site's content. Most areas have several levels of information. For
   example, General Information includes maps and directions to each
   divisional courthouse, office hours, statistics etc. Practice

          Electronic Filing -- This court participates in a pilot project
   that enables attorneys to file pleadings electronically in certain
