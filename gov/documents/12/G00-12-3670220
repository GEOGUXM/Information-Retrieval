   Welcome to the Massachusetts Wing HQ web page.
   Massachusetts Wing proudly serves the community as the United States
   Air Force Auxiliary. Civil Air Patrol has three primary missions:
   Emergency Services, Cadet Programs, and Aerospace Education.
   Massachusetts Wing members consist of cadets (11-21 years old), and
   senior members (18+ years old). Our members come from all walks of
   life, but most have an interest in aviation, supporting the local
   communities, and/or helping our nation's youth become better citizens
   of the United States of America.
   Please take a look at our website, and learn about our program. If it
   looks interesting to you, we'd love to invite you to take a closer
   look. Check out the "How to Join" button on the left to find out how
   Civil Air Patrol can become an exciting and rewarding part of your
   life!
