     Our goal is simple: to speed miracles of medical research from the
                         laboratory to the bedside.
     - Lyndon B. Johnson, October 26, 1965, on signing Public Law 89-239

   Comments? The Regional Medical Program Archival materials span the
   entire history of the RMP beginning with the Report of the President's
   Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke , through the active
   period of program implementation, and to its termination in 1976. (See
   the chronology of Regional Medical Programs. ) In addition, materials
   from a conference held at the National Library of Medicine in December
   1991 are included.

   The archival collection includes some twenty boxes of materials. Nine
   boxes are in NLM's permanent collection, and eleven boxes have been on
   loan from the National Archives. These materials have been scanned and
   OCR'ed and can be viewed by searching the RMP archives database. The
   archival database currently contains some 1,500 indexed and scanned
   documents, representing approximately 40,000 pages.

   Supplemental materials are also available. In preparation for the 1991
   conference, interviews were conducted with key RMP figures, and a
   bibliography of the RMP was prepared. The 1991 RMP conference session
   transcripts can also be browsed. Copies of the videotaped interviews
   may be borrowed through interlibrary loan. See the RMP fact sheet for
   further information.

   Stephen Strickland's monograph, History of Regional Medical Programs,
   has been further annotated with comments by Arthur Rikli, M.D., former
   coordinator of the Missouri Regional Medical Program.

   A Photo Gallery of people, equipment and posters associated with the
   Regional Medical Programs is also available.
