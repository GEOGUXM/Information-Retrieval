   NHD Tutorial
   The NHD Tutorial Series

   Introduction to the NHD Tutorials:
   Welcome to the National Hydrography Dataset Tutorial Series. Each
   tutorial provides students with the opportunity to actively learn about
   and use NHD data. The tutorials come with sample NHD datasets and
   ArcView project files.

   The purpose of the NHD Tutorials is to acquaint users with the NHD data
   model, learn how to use NHD data in simple query-and-display
   applications, and to access and query NHD metadata.

   The NHD Tutorials are meant to be a companion to the NHD Technical
   References documentation. There is a great deal of conceptual
   information, background information, and detailed data-specific
   information on the NHD Technical References web site. Students are
   encouraged to consult digital or hard copies of the documents posted on
   the NHD Technical References site while going through each Tutorial.

   Each Tutorial should take you about 30 to 45 minutes to complete.

   Tutorial Datasets:

     The NHD datasets supplied with the NHD Tutorials are not production
     versions of the data.  While the content of each Tutorial dataset is
     substantially correct, not all production steps have been performed
     on these datasets, making them inappropriate for any use except with
     the Tutorials.

   Available and Planned Tutorials:
   Tutorial using free software:

     This tutorial is used in conjunction with ESRIs ArcExplorer Ver. 2.0
     viewing software. ArcExplorer is freeware that can be easily
     downloaded from the internet. ArcExplorer is a lightweight
     Geographic Information System (GIS) data viewer, and has certain
     limitations. For full NHD viewing and analysis of tables please
     complete the ArcView Tutorial. Consult ESRI's information for
     minimum hardware and software configuration information.

   ArcExplorer Tutorial: Viewing NHD Feature Classes
   (DRAFT)
   Purpose: Display each of the feature classes present in the sample
   dataset.
   At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
     * Display features and their feature types from the waterbody feature
       class
     * Display features and their feature types from the drain feature
       class
     * Display features from the reach feature class
     * Display features from the waterbody reach feature class
     * Display features and their feature types from the point landmark
       feature class
     * Display features and their feature types from the line landmark
       feature class
     * Display features and their feature types from the area landmark
       feature class
   _______________________________________________________________________

   There are 6 Tutorials in the NHD Tutorial Series based on ESRI's
   ArcView software:
   Tutorial Requirements:


   The NHD Tutorials were developed using ESRI's ArcView Ver. 3.0 software
       on the Windows '95 operating system. You must have ArcView Ver. 3.0
       or Ver. 3.1 installed on your PC. Consult ESRI's information for
       minimum hardware and software configuration information.
