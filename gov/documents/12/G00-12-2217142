     * 5/8/2001 - Susan E. Morgan, Ph.D. and Jenny Miller, M.A., will
       receive a Top 3 Paper Award from the Health Communication Division
       of the National Communication Association this November: Their
       paper, "Overcoming Fear with Facts: The Effect of Knowledge,
       Attitudes, and Values on Behavior and Behavioral Intentions
       Regarding Organ Donation" describes the pre-test data collected as
       part of a grant project funded by the Division of Transplantation,
       Office of Special Programs, Health Resources and Services
       Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The
       larger project is a worksite organ donation campaign conducted at
       United Parcel Service in Louisville, Kentucky and designed to
       increase knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intent regarding
       organ donation. The research manuscript reports the level of
       knowledge about organ donation and respondents' attitudes toward
       donation, then links these variables to respondents' willingness to
       sign an organ donor card and talk to their next of kin about their
       decision to donate. This manuscript is currently under review at
       the Journal of Applied Communication Research; another related
       manuscript generated from this project will appear in the journal
       Health Communication in 2002.
