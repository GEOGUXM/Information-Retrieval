     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Purpose. This Chapter defines and assigns responsibility for the
   origination, completion, distribution, and retention of National
   Weather Service (NWS) WS Form A-26, Maintenance Record. This form
   serves to:

     a. notify maintenance personnel of an equipment outage;

     b. show that the equipment has been returned to service;

     c. provide detailed information on equipment failures for analysis,
     reporting, and possible modification; and

     d. collect information on maintenance work for analysis, reporting,
     and staffing decisions.

   2. Description. The WS Form A-26 is a single page form. The front
   contains a general information section, an equipment information
   section, a parts failure information section, and a miscellaneous
   information section. The back contains codes for use by maintenance
   personnel.

   Weather Service Headquarters will provide for electronic collection of
   the information on this form. Instructions for electronic data entry
   are provided in Engineering Handbook 4 (EHB4), Engineering Management
   Reporting System.

   2.1 General Information. The general information section provides space
   for entering pertinent times, initials, response priority, and a
   description of the failure. Instructions for completing this section
   are in Appendix A and EHB-4.

   2.2 Equipment, Parts Failure, and Miscellaneous Information. These
   sections provide space for maintenance personnel to enter various
   maintenance information. Instructions for completing these sections are
   in EHB-4.

   3. Origination. Either operations or maintenance personnel may
   originate this form. Equipment users shall originate this form to
   report an equipment malfunction to maintenance personnel. Maintenance
   personnel shall originate this form according to instructions in EHB-4.
   The form provides local documentation and should be originated for all
   operational equipment/system failures.

   4. Closing. Close the form when the maintenance action for which it was
   originated is completed. Forms originated for equipment outages may be
   closed by operations personnel. Follow regional direction.

   5. Distribution. Submit all completed A-26 forms through the
   Electronics Systems Analyst (ESA) if assigned, or if none is assigned,
   send directly to the Regional Maintenance Specialist (RMS) or the Area
   Electronics Supervisor (AES), if applicable. After review, the RMS/AES
   shall keep a photocopy and send the original form(s) for reportable
   equipment to:

     Configuration Management Section, W/OSO113
     National Weather Service
     SSMC2, Room 16414
     1325 East-West Highway
     Silver Spring, Maryland 20910

   When electronic data entry is implemented, the RMS/AES need not send
   paper forms to the above address.

   6. Retention. There is no national requirement to retain local copies
   of the paper forms after the data are entered in the national data
   base. Until electronic data entry is implemented, keep a paper form for
   1 month. After electronic data entry is implemented, forms may be
   discarded after the electronic form is committed.

   7. Responsibilities. This section defines the responsibilities of
   employees regarding WS Form A-26.

   7.1 Station Manager. The station manager is responsible for the
   following.

           a. A form is originated and the maintenance staff is informed
