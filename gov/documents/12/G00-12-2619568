   FAQ
    1. Why is the SeaWiFS data restricted?
       The satellite that supports SeaWiFS is a commercial platform owned
       by OrbImage. Because this is a commercially owned and operated
       platform, NOAA must purchase data subject to a contract that
       defines the appropriate use of ocean color data derived from
       SeaWiFS. NOAA purchased data is restricted to "civil marine"
       operational use and is intended for civil authorities (federal,
       state, and local governments) for watershed management and
       monitoring. Data for research purposes may be obtained from NASA
       under a separate agreement with OrbImage.
    2. Do I need to be a 'registered' user to access ocean color products?
       No. SeaWiFS imagery purchased and processed by NOAA can be viewed
       online through this website (Browse=>Ocean Color, Browse). If you
       need access to the data (i.e., HDF files) or near real-time imagery
       (i.e., coastal management, resource monitoring) then you must
       become a registered user.
    3. How do I become a CoastWatch Ocean Color User?
       You must meet the following criteria:

    1. be a qualified NASA SeaWiFS user (Dear Colleague Letter in place)
       with a need for NRT processing/NOAA algorithms in support of NOAA
       projects
    2. be a coastal manager (local, state, federal government) with a need
       for NOAA operational data for civil marine management
    3. have an understanding of the NOAA CoastWatch SeaWiFS Data Use
       Policy

   If you meet these criteria or have additional questions, then contact
   Kent Hughes, CoastWatch Program Manager to request access. If you only
   need SeaWiFS data solely for research purposes, you should request data
   from the NASA SeaWiFS Project.

     Why do I get a "JavaScript" error when the pages load?
   This website is designed to be JavaScript 1.2 compliant. This site has
   been tested with Netscape 4+, MS Internet Explorer 4+, and Lynx.

     How do I obtain images no longer available through this site /
   register with the SAA (Satellite Active Archive)?
   Ocean color products can be browsed on this website and if the data is
   no longer available, checkboxes will be beneath the thumbnail.
   Selecting the appropriate box and pressing the "SAA" button will
   prepare an order for submission to the Satellite Active Archive. In
   order to access the SAA for ocean color products, you must first be a
   CoastWatch Ocean Color User registered with the SAA. To register,
   follow the "SAA Register" link from either the Ocean Color
   Browse/Search interface or after submitting a filelist for retrieval.

     How accurate are the wind products?
   The ocean surface wind product accuracy is dependent upon sensor and
   wind derivation methods. Check out the Product Info => Ocean Surface
   Winds link for a description of each sensors' derived wind accuracies.
