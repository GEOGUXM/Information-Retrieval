   Description of Research Project

   The goal of this project is to transform pear (Pyrus sp.) with genes
   that titleer plant growth, such as the rolC gene, in order to develop
   transgenic clones with dwarf growth habit.

   Genetic transformation differs from conventional breeding
   (hybridization) in that transformation can produce targeted
   improvements in an established variety. Hybridization of pear can be
   used to produce new varieties but cannot be used to improve existing
   varieties because hybrids are not duplicates of the original parental
   variety. While the development of new pear varieties is important for
   the future of the U.S. pear industry and to provide new exciting pears
   for the consumer, there is a need to improve the production, pest and
   disease resistance, and post-harvest quality of our current major pear
   varieties such as ‘Bartlett’, ‘Bosc’ and ‘Anjou’.

   The intent of growing dwarf pear trees is to improve production
   efficiency. The rolC gene causes overall reduced stature of the tree
   with increased branching. Smaller pear trees would be easier to
   maintain and harvest and more pears could be produced per acre because
   more trees could be planted per acre.

   The method utilized to incorporate growth-modifying genes into the pear
   genome is Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. In this method,
   wounded leaves of pear are infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens
   carrying the rolC gene. Agrobacterium tumefaciens by nature introduces
   the new gene into the DNA of the pear. Transgenic pear plants are
   regenerated from the leaf tissue under laboratory conditions. As the
   transgenic pear plants grow, they undergo a rigorous testing program to
   determine the precise effects of the transferred genes.
