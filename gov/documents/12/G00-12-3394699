   Marine Fisheries Review

   Beginning with volume 60, number 1 (1998), articles in the Marine
   Fisheries Review are available in PDF format. To view an article in PDF
   you will need the Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you have not already
   installed a viewer you can temporarily leave the National Marine
   Fisheries Service web site and download this software from the Adobe
   Home Page. This program will use approximately 2.5 megabytes of hard
   disk space. Please note that reference to trade names or commercial
   firms does not imply endorsement by the National Marine Fisheries
   Service. Also please be aware that files may be large and
   graphic-intensive and thus will be slow to display.

   Having problems viewing files? If you have previously installed Adobe
   Acrobat Reader on your computer but have problems with viewing any of
   these files, please upgrade your software by downloading the latest
   version, then try accessing the files again. Also, if you are using
   Internet Explorer as your web browser and have problems with the
   display freezing or other errors in viewing or printing, please refer
   to the technical support document "Freeze or Error in Internet Explorer
   for Windows When Viewing PDF File" on the Adobe web site at
   http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/2d7a.htm. Among other solutions,
   this document advises users to
   turn off the "Web browser integration" under "Preferences: General" in
   Acrobat Reader. If you still have problems, please e-mail us with the
   volume number and paper that you are attempting to download, the error
   message you are getting, and the browser (Netscape or IE) version and
   system (MAC OS, Win 98, etc) you're using.
