                     Important facts to know if you eat
                      the fish you catch in California

   Public Health Advisories And Guidance On Sport Fish Consumption
   Fish are nutritious and good for you to eat. But some fish you catch
   may take in toxic chemicals from the water they live in and the food
   they eat. Some of these chemicals build up in the fish - and in you -
   over time. Although the chemical levels are usually low, its a good
   idea to follow a few precautions in consuming fish, particularly if you
   eat fish often. The purpose of this brochure is to guide you to eat the
   fish you catch in ways that reduce your exposure to chemicals.

   The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) provides
   specific consumption advice in this booklet for fish taken in areas
   where high levels of chemicals have been found in fish. However,
   because contamination levels are unknown for many locations, OEHHA also
   provides general advice on how to reduce your exposure to chemicals in
   noncommercial fish, referred to as sport fish, that you or your family
   catch.

   These advisories are not intended to discourage you from eating fish
   entirely. Fish are nutritious and an excellent source of protein. The
   advisories should be followed to make your sport fish eating safer.

   OEHHA can provide more information on the advisories and the health
   effects of chemical contaminants in the fish. OEHHA also has an
   illustrated brochure giving general advice. The brochure can be
   requested in several different languages. To stay current for updates
   and to request additional information, please check the OEHHA Web site
   at www.oehha.ca.gov or contact the Pesticide and Environmental
   Toxicology Section (PETS) of OEHHA in Sacramento or Oakland at the
   address given on the back cover of this booklet.

   General Advice
   You can reduce your exposure to chemical contaminants in sport fish by
   following the recommendations below. Follow as many of them as you can
   to increase your health protection. This general advice is not meant to
   take the place of advisories for specific areas, which follow later in
   this booklet, but should be followed in addition to them. Sport fish in
   most water bodies in the state have not been evaluated for their safety
   for human consumption. This is why we strongly recommend following the
   general advice given below.

   Fishing Practices
   Chemical levels can vary from place to place. Your overall exposure to
   chemicals is likely to be lower if you fish at a variety of places
   rather than at one usual spot that might have high contamination
   levels.

   Be aware that OEHHA may issue new advisories or revise existing ones.
   Consult the Department of Fish and Game regulations booklet or check
   with OEHHA on a yearly basis to see if there are any changes that could
   affect you.

   Consumption Guidelines
   Fish Species:
   Some fish species have higher chemical levels than others in the same
   location. If possible, eat smaller amounts of several different types
   of fish rather than a large amount of one type that may be high in
   contaminants.

   Fish Size:
   Smaller fish of a species will usually have lower chemical levels than
   larger fish in the same location because some of the chemicals may
   become more concentrated in larger, older fish. It is advisable to eat
   smaller fish (of legal size) more often than larger fish.

   Fish Preparation and Consumption:
     * Eat only the fillet portions. Do not eat the guts and liver because
       chemicals usually concentrate in those parts. Also, avoid frequent
       consumption of any reproductive parts such as eggs or roe.
     * Many chemicals are stored in the fat. To reduce the levels of these
       chemicals, skin the fish when possible and trim any visible fat.
     * Use a cooking method such as baking, broiling, grilling, or
       steaming that allows the juices to drain away from the fish. The
       juices will contain chemicals in the fat and should be thrown away.
       Preparing and cooking fish in this way can remove 30 to 50 percent
       of the chemicals stored in fat. If you make stews or chowders, use
       fillet parts.
     * Raw fish may be infested by parasites. Cook fish thoroughly to
       destroy the parasites. This also helps to reduce the level of many
       chemical contaminants.

   How to prepare

   Advice for Pregnant Women

   Young children and fetuses are more sensitive to the toxic effects of
   methylmercury, the form of mercury of health concern in fish.

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for
   commercial seafood safety. FDA has issued the following advice about
   the risks of mercury in fish to pregnant women and women of
   childbearing age who may become pregnant. The FDA advises these woman
   not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. The FDA also
   advises that it is prudent for nursing mothers and young children not
   to eat these fish as well.

   The US Environmental Protection Agency has also issued national advice
   to protect against consuming mercury in fish. They recommend that women
   who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young
   children eat no more than one meal per week on noncommercial freshwater
   fish caught by family or friends.

   National advice for women and children on mercury in fish is available
   from the US Environmental Protection Agency at:
   http://www.epa.gov/ost/fish

   and the US Food and Drug administration at:
   http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/admehg.html

   Adjusting Fish Meal Size for Body Weight
   In the site-specific guidance that follows, OEHHA gives consumption
   advice in terms of meals for a given period such as a meal a week, and
   uses an eight-ounce meal size as the standard amount allowed for the
   "average" adult. The average adult weighs approximately 150 pounds
   (equivalent to 70 kg). Because you and your family members may weigh
   more or less than the average adult, you can use the chart below to
   adjust serving sizes to body weight.

   Site-Specific Consumption Recommendations
   The following guidelines apply to the specific advisories that follow:
    1. Eating sport fish in amounts slightly greater than what is
       recommended should not present a health hazard if only done
       occasionally such as eating fish caught during an annual vacation.
    2. Nursing and pregnant women and young children may be more sensitive
       to the harmful effects of some of the chemicals and should be
       particularly careful about following the advisories. Because
       contaminants take a long time to leave the body after they
       accumulate, women who plan on becoming pregnant should begin
       following the more restrictive consumption advice, a year before
       becoming pregnant. In this way, the levels of chemicals stored in
       the body can go down.
    3. The limits that follow for each species and area assume that no
       other contaminated fish is being eaten. If you consume several
       different listed species from the same area, or the same species
       from several areas, your total consumption still should not exceed
       the recommended amount. One simple approach is to just use the
       lowest recommended amount as a guideline to consumption.
    4. Just because the area where you like to fish is not included in the
       specific advisory areas that follow, it does not necessarily mean
       that it is free from chemical contamination. Sport fish in most
       parts of the state have not yet been evaluated for their safety for
       human consumption. Follow the general advice given earlier to
       protect your health.

   The specific advisories listed below are arranged generally from north
   to south.

   Lake Pillsbury (Lake County)
   Because of elevated levels of mercury, women who are pregnant or may
   become pregnant within a year, nursing mothers, and children under age
   six should not eat fish from Lake Pillsbury. Other adults and children
   age six and older may eat fish from Lake Pillsbury on an occasional,
   but not regular, basis.

   Clear Lake (Lake County) and Lake Berryessa (Napa County)
   Because of elevated mercury levels, adults should eat no more than the
   amounts indicated below per month. Women who are pregnant or may become
   pregnant, nursing mothers, and children under age six should not eat
   fish from these lakes. Children 6-15 years of age should eat no more
   than one-half the amounts indicated for adults.
