   Curriculum Frameworks and
   Instructional Resources
   Curriculum > CFIR

   Curriculum frameworks are the blueprint for implementing grade level
   content standards adopted by the California State Board of Education.
   Frameworks are developed by the Curriculum Development and Supplemental
   Materials Commission, which also reviews and recommends textbooks and
   other instructional materials to be adopted by the State Board.
