   This homepage is provided as an effort of the ADVANCE Project. The
   ADVANCE Participants (Illinois Department of Transportation [IDOT],
   Motorola, Federal Highway Administration [FHWA], the American
   Automobile Association [AAA], and the Illinois Universities
   Transportation Research Consortium [Northwestern University and the
   University of Illinois at Chicago]) in cooperation with Argonne
   National Laboratory are making all completed reports for the project
   available to those interested.

   The ADVANCE Project was launched in 1991 as a major test of a dynamic -
   in-vehicle - route guidance system in the United States. The objective
   was to determine if motorists supplied with real-time guidance would be
   given information which would help them avoid congestion and improve
   the quality of their trip. The heart of ADVANCE is the Transportation
   Information Center which receives information from a wide spectrum of
   sources, processes the information, and makes it available to vehicles.

   Using a combination of technologies including GPS positioning, wireless
   communications, CD-ROM map storage, data fusion and others, the ADVANCE
   Project provides drivers with continuously updated navigation
   directions with real-time information. As the project has developed,
   the Public/Private Participants of the ADVANCE Project have learned
   much about the technologies involved. We have also witnessed evolution
   in technology and market conditions.

   In early 1995, the Partners had created a more useful and efficient way
   to proceed with ADVANCE - Targeted Deployment. Under the Targeted
   Deployment plan, the ADVANCE Project had the following features:
     * Testing was conducted using existing Project test vehicles.
     * Vehicle guidance systems were installed in about 80 vehicles.
     * The on-road tests using volunteer drivers were conducted for 2
       weeks per driver.
     * Many aspects of the ADVANCE system were tested in a controlled
       environment.
     * The timeframe for testing was June 1 through December 15, 1995 and
       evaluation was November 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996.

   Targeted Deployment allows for a logical transition to future efforts.
   The Application Phase of ADVANCE (which continues through 1999) better
   supports the Transportation Information Center concepts being developed
   for the Gary-Chicago-Milwaukee Corridor. In de-emphasing dynamic
   guidance, ADVANCE provided a useful product while still testing many of
   the concepts of the original scope. Another important aspect of
   Targeted Deployment is a quicker turnaround on reports back to the
   industry for dynamic guideance tests. All Targeted Deployment
   Evaluation materials are available as of January 8, 1997.

   Beginning in January 1997, ADVANCE enters into a three year Application
   Phase to provide centralized travel information for the
   Gary-Chicago-Milwaukee Corridor. Further information is available at
   the Gary-Chicago-Milwaukee Project Homepage.
