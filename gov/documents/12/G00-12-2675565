  INCREASING OUR WATER-BORNE TRANSPORT PRODUCTIVITY

                                                                      Back

   The potential for cost savings and revenue increases related to
   improved accuracy and timeliness of critical information on currents
   and water levels can be significant. Consider that more than 99% of
   U.S. international commerce outside North America, by weight, valued at
   nearly $500 billion, moves by ship. So a 1% improvement in the overall
   efficiency of America's marine transportation system would translate
   into more than $2 billion in savings across our economy within a
   decade. And, in our global economy, U.S. exports are expected to grow
   from about 22% of Gross Domestic Product today to over 30% in the year
   2000.

   The rapid growth in the size of vessels means that effective use of all
   available draft and width is critical. Although the main shipping
   channels are dredged, many deep-draft ships cannot enter U.S. ports
   except near times of high water. Real-time water level and current
   information is needed for safe navigation and to permit increased
   exports by maximizing use of limited channel depths.

    To state it in concrete terms...

   Containership operations might reap as much as $6,000 to $24,000 in
   revenues for every inch of increased draft and thus cargo carried per
   trip. Real-time water-level systems have led to a tripling of coal
   exports from Philadelphia (from 1.5 to 5 million tons), an increase of
   0.5 million tons of coal exports from Baltimore in the first year of
   operation, and an increase in grain exported from Portland amounting to
   $20,000 per shipload. And the benefits are not just felt in the port
   community. Everyone benefits, from the ship owner, the crew, the port,
   dockside workers, the land-based transportation crews, all the way back
   to the mining communities providing the coal. And this increased
   efficiency makes the U.S. all the more competitive in international
   markets.

   Real-time information on currents and water levels can also avoid
   delays or optimize ship scheduling that is valued at as much as $3,000
   per hour per ship. For lack of real-time water level information there
   are lost opportunities to enter or leave port on especially favorable
   tides, or to confidently remain at dock transferring cargo. For lack of
   real-time water level and current information there may be unacceptable
   risks in transiting, docking and undocking a ship or an inability to
   complete desired maneuvers in confined waterways. And the costs cascade
   because, for example, one ship's delayed departure means another's
   delayed berthing with associated delays in the land transport and
   delivery of goods.

   In the future real-time information coupled with electronic charts has
   the benefit of increased operational time, e.g., working in poor or
   zero visibility. Having an "all-weather" ability to enter or leave port
   eliminates the extremely expensive delays associated with unplanned
   ship and hence port facility schedule changes.

   Significant returns on investment in this activity will be realized in
   the form of broad societal gain and improved transportation efficiency
