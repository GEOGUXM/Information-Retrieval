Gold-Gold Ion Collision at PHOBOS

   The figure shows the response of our Silicon Detectors to particles
   produced in collisions of two gold ions.  The green points show where
   the particles hit the silicon.

   We used similar events to measure charged particle multiplicity in
   these collisions:


   [figure4_small.jpg] The plot above shows the number of charged
   particles at mid-rapidity normalized to the number of participating
   nucleons and compared to similar results at CERN and at pp and p-anti p
   colliders. This result has been accepted by Physical Review Letters and
   is availalable here(PDF) and at the Los Alamos preprint server


   Charged Particle Multiplicity Near Mid-Rapidity in Central Au+Au
   Collisions at sqrt(s)=56 and 130 AGeV. Submitted to Physics Review
   Letters on July 19, 2000 also submitted to LANL preprint server as
