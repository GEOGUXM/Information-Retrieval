   The Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence provide a systems
   perspective for understanding performance management. They reflect
   validated, leading-edge management practices against which an
   organization can measure itself. With their acceptance nationally and
   internationally as the model for performance excellence, the Criteria
   represent a common language for communication among organizations for
   sharing best practices. The Criteria are also the basis for the Malcolm
   Baldrige National Quality Award process.
