                     Chessie the manatee is seen again!

   A Florida manatee named Chessie is perhaps the most famous and well
   traveled manatee along the US Atlantic coast.  Radio tagged and tracked
   by the US Geological Survey's Sirenia Project, he gained media fame in
   the summer of 1995 by swimming past the Chessie in navigational lock
   basin, Great Bridge, Virginia - Aug 2001. Click to enlarge mid-Atlantic
   states, through New York City, and all the way to Rhode Island, further
   than any manatee had been known to venture.  After returning to Florida
   for the winter, he again wandered north as far as Virginia where he was
   last seen in 1996.
   On August 30, 2001, Chessie was photographed at the Great Bridge Locks
   in Virginia!  Joel Scussel, civil engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers, and Rob Poyner of U.S. Facilities, Inc. were working at the
   Great Bridge Locks in Virginia when they noticed a manatee in the lock
   basin.  Because manatees are only occasionally seen this far north,
   they notified Sue Barco, a marine mammal scientist at the Virginia
   Marine Science Museum, who brought her research team to the locks.
   While the manatee waited patiently in the lock basin for the gates to
   open, Sue, Joel, and Rob watched and photographed the distinctive scar
   pattern on the manatee.  Afterwards, the gates were opened and the
   manatee continued his trip south.  The photographs were then sent to
   Cathy Beck and Amy Teague at the USGS's Sirenia Project where they used
   the manatee photo-identification catalog to match scar patterns and
   confirm his identity as Chessie!

   white center on his back, also seen in photos above and below - Oct
   1994. Click to enlarge Chessie first gained notoriety in the fall of
   1994 when he was sighted far beyond the usual range of manatees in
   Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, captured and returned by U.S. Coast Guard
   plane to Florida.  He was released into the Banana River, Brevard
   County wearing a VHF and satellite-monitored radio tag attached to a
   harmless, pliable belt around the base of his tail.  USGS Sirenia
   Project biologist Jim Reid kept track of Chessie as he moved into
   southeastern Florida, and then in the spring of 1995, as he moved
   northward into Georgia waters.  By mid-July 1995, he was again in
   Chesapeake Bay.  This time he was not captured, but Jim continued to
   follow him, using the signals emitted from Chessie's radio transmitter,
   through Delaware Bay, into salt marshes near Atlantic City, New Jersey
   and Connecticut, past the Statue of Liberty, and through Long Island
   Sound.  Chessie readied for move to Florida - Oct 1994. Click to
   enlarge Chessie stopped briefly to rest and feed along the way, but
   continued his northward movement until he reached Point Judith, Rhode
   Island on 16 August 1995.  Here he encountered cooler water and turned
   around to return to the warmer waters of Long Island Sound.  His radio
   tag broke free on 22 August in New Haven, Connecticut, but public
   sightings were received as he continued his journey south.  On 23
   September 1995 he passed through the Great Bridge Locks, then was seen
   in Florida waters near Jacksonville on 16 November 1995.
   Chessie was seen again in February 1996 near Ft. Lauderdale.  A radio
   transmitter was attached again to the belt that he still wore.  His
   movements north were tracked once more, and he crossed the
   Florida-Georgia border in mid-June.  Unfortunately, he lost his
   transmitter on 10 July near Beaufort, North Carolina.  The last time
   Chessie was seen was on 18 August 1996, swimming south past Portsmouth,
   Virginia.

   Click to enlarge Since then, several sighting reports of manatees in
   Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina have been forwarded to
   us, but none could be confirmed as Chessie.  This time, the manatee was
   positively identified as Chessie through the USGS Sirenia Project's
   manatee photo-identification catalog, a computerized database of
   photographically documented manatees.  Each manatee in the database is
   recognized by one or more unique features, most commonly the scars
   inflicted by non-lethal encounters with boats.  In 1994, Chessie was
   photographically documented prior to his release in Florida and was
   recognizable by a distinct long gray scar with several small white
   spots within this dorsal feature.  He has since acquired tail
   mutilations as well, but they are not severe.
   Our thanks to all the lock personnel, especially Joel Scussel and Rob
   Poyner, at Great Bridge Locks, and Sue Barco and the rest of the team
   from the Virginia Marine Science Museum for reporting and documenting
   this manatee sighting so well.  We are all delighted to know that
   Chessie is alive and continuing his travels!
