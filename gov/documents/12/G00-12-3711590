                               Types of Cases Adjudicated

         There are four major categories of cases that come before the Authority
         Chairman and Members for resolution:

           *    representation

           *    arbitration

           *    negotiability

           *    unfair labor practice

         FLRA Regulations, at section 2429.4, also permit the General Counsel,
         the Assistant Secretary of Labor, or the Federal Service Impasses Panel
         to refer for review and decision or general ruling any case involving a
         major policy issue that arises in a proceeding before any of them.

   Decisions of the Authority are published and are available on this
   website. If you are unable to find a particular Authority decision,
   contact the Case Control Office for assistance.

   Following issuance of a final Authority decision or order, a party can
   move for reconsideration if it can establish extraordinary
   circumstances. Motions must be filed within 10 days after service of
   the Authority's decision and must satisfy the requirements in section
   2429.17 of the Regulations.

   Any party aggrieved by an Authority decision, with the exceptions noted
   below, may institute an action for judicial review within 60 days after
   the decision issues. The Authority may also seek enforcement of its
   orders, temporary relief or restraining orders in the appropriate
   United States court of appeals. The Office of Solicitor represents the
   Authority in court proceedings.

  Representation Cases

   Applications for review of a Regional Director's Decision and Order are
   filed with the Case Control Office. Applications must be filed within
   60 days of the Decision and Order and must meet the requirements set
   out in section 2422.31 of the Regulations. Neither the filing nor
   granting of an application for review operates to stay any action
   ordered by the Regional Director unless the Authority specifically
   orders a stay.

   The Authority grants review of a Regional Director's Decision and Order
   on limited grounds and only when:

     * the Decision and Order raises an issue for which there is an
       absence of precedent

     * established law or policy warrants reconsideration

     * there is a genuine issue over which the Regional Director has
       failed to apply established law, committed a prejudicial procedural
       error, or committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a
       substantial factual matter.

   After an application is filed, the Authority may take one of several
   actions. The Authority may deny the application or it may decide not to
   undertake review. In both instances, the Regional Director's Decision
   and Order stands. When an application for review is granted, the
   Authority will either resolve the issues based on the existing record
   or request that the parties to a case provide additional briefs on
   specified issues. On occasion, the Authority will seek input from other
   interested persons. Notices describing the issues on review are
   published in the Federal Register. Announcements of Federal Register
   publications are located in the What's New section of this website.

   Decisions of the Authority on representation matters are generally not
   subject to judicial review.

  Arbitration Appeals

   Either an agency or a union may appeal an arbitrator's decision within
   30 days from the date the award is served. Exceptions to arbitration
   awards are filed with the Case Control Office and must meet the
   requirements specified in Part 2425 of the Regulations. Once properly
   filed, the Authority will review an award to determine whether the
   award is deficient because:

     * the award is contrary to any law, rule or regulation

     * the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining
       agreement

     * the award is based on a nonfact

     * the award violates public policy

     * the arbitrator denied a party a fair hearing

     * the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority

     * the award shows bias

     * the award is ambiguous, incomplete or contradictory

   The Authority will not consider exceptions to an award relating to
   actions based on unacceptable performance that are covered under 5
   U.S.C. § 4303; removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions
   in grade or pay, or furloughs of 30 days or less that are covered under
   5 U.S.C. §7512, and matters similar to those covered under 5 U.S.C. §§
   4303 and 7512 that arise under other personnel systems. Challenges to
   these actions may be taken elsewhere.

   Authority decisions involving exceptions to arbitration awards are not
   subject to judicial review, unless the decision involves an unfair
   labor practice under section 7118 of the Statute.

  Negotiability Cases

   A union may file a petition for review challenging either an agency
   head's disapproval of negotiated contract language or an agency's claim
   that bargaining proposals are contrary to law, rule or regulation.
   Petitions for review are filed with the Case Control Office and must
   meet the requirements contained in Part 2424, Subpart C of the
   Regulations. Forms and checklists are available to assist with filing
   petitions for review, statements of position and reply briefs.

   Shortly after a petition is filed, the Case Control Office contacts the
   parties in each case and schedules a Post-Petition Conference with
   representatives of each party. The representatives must be prepared and
   authorized to discuss such matters as:

     * the meaning of the proposal or provision in dispute

     * any disputed factual issues

     * negotiability dispute objections and bargaining obligation claims

     * whether the proposal or provision in dispute is also involved in an
       unfair labor practice charge, grievance or impasse procedure

   Conferences are conducted by Authority staff members. A representative
   of the Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (CADRO)
   may also be present to provide information on ADR services and offer
   settlement assistance. Following the conclusion of the Conference, a
   report is served on the parties and the filing of position statements
   commences. After the position statements have been filed, and the
   entire record is reviewed, the Authority issues a decision. The
   decision will include, as appropriate, a bargaining order, a direction
   to rescind a disapproval, a statement that a matter is bargainable at
   the election of an agency, or an order dismissing the petition for
   review.

   Further information on how to file a petition for review and whether a
   negotiability appeal is the correct forum for resolving a dispute can
   be found in the Guide to Negotiability Appeals and Filing a Case. Also,
   you may obtain a training video on negotiability appeals. Videos may be
   obtained by contacting the Case Control Office at (202) 482-6540.

  Unfair Labor Practice Cases

   The Statute sets forth many rights and obligations that are enforced
   through an unfair labor practice action. Guidance and Manuals prepared
   by the Office of General Counsel provide a great deal of information on
   those rights and obligations. If an individual employee, a union, or an
   agency believes that an unfair labor practice has been committed under
   section 7116 of the Statute, that party should contact the appropriate
   Regional Office for assistance. The Regional Offices are responsible
   for investigating and processing charges that unfair labor practices
   have been committed.

   In almost all instances, investigations of alleged unlawful conduct,
   issuance of complaints by Regional Directors and actions taken by an
   Administrative Law Judge, up to and including preparation of a
   recommended decision, occur before the Authority's involvement in an
   unfair labor practice complaint. On occasion, the Authority becomes
   involved at earlier stages of an unfair labor practice proceeding. For
   example, the Authority must approve a formal settlement agreement under
   section 2423.25 of the Regulations and it must approve a General
   Counsel request to seek temporary relief, such as a restraining order,
   pursuant to section 2423.10 of the Regulations.

   Exceptions to a recommended decision of an Administrative Law Judge
   (ALJ), must be filed with the Case Control Office and must meet the
   requirements in Section 2423.40 of the Regulations. Any exception that
   is not specifically argued is deemed to be waived. When no exceptions
   to a decision of an Administrative Law Judge are filed, the findings,
   conclusions and recommendations of the Judge become, without
   precedential significance, those of the Authority. When exceptions are
   filed, the Authority, upon review of the recommended findings and
   conclusions, issues a decision that affirms or reverses, in whole or in
   part, the decision of the Judge. In limited circumstances, the
   Authority will also render a decision in a stipulated unfair labor
   practice, without a prior decision by an Administrative Law Judge,
   where the case is transferred directly to the Authority.

   If an unfair labor practice has been committed, the Authority will
   issue an order requiring the party to cease and desist from the
   unlawful conduct and to take appropriate remedial actions. If there is
   a finding that no unfair labor practice has been committed, the
   Authority will dismiss the complaint.
