   Welcome to the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project
   (Project) home page. In July 1993, President Clinton directed the
   Forest Service to "develop a scientifically sound and ecosystem-based
   strategy for management of eastside forests." Responding to this
   direction, the project was initiated by the United States Department of
   Agriculture Forest Service and the United States Department of Interior
   Bureau of Land Management.

   The Project received more than 83,000 public comments on two Draft EIS
   documents released in June 1997. The comment period on these documents
   lasted 335 days. In response to the public comments, new scientific
   information, agency review, and direction from the Secretaries of
   Agriculture and Interior, a Supplemental Draft EIS (SDEIS) was released
   in March 2000. Approximately 525 comments were received during the
   90-day comment period. The project released a Final EIS and Proposed
   Decision in December 2000. The release of the Final EIS initiated a
   protest process that began on December 15, 2000 and ended January 16,
   2001. Seventy-four protest letters were received. A strategy is being
   worked on to conclude the project.
