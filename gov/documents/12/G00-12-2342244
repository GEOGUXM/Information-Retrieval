   Recent Law Changes
   [1882.gif] SB1308 - Allows RDA's to qualify for licensure by gaining
   experience with dentists licensed outside of California
   Past law required that an RDA gain the required 18 months of work
   experience through employment with a California-licensed dentist.
   SB1308, sponsored by the Department of Consumer Affairs at the request
   of COMDA and the Board, now allows RDA candidates to gain such
   experience with any licensed dentist in the United States.  This change
   was effective January 1, 2000.
   [1882.gif] SB2239 - Dentists - Effective January 1, 1999, this bill
   deleted the requirement that a dentist who employs a licensed RDAEF or
   RDHEF satisfy requirements of continuing education in the management
   and utilization of such auxiliaries.
   [1883.gif] AB1439 - Health Care Practitioners - Effective January 1,
   1999, this new law requires all health care practitioners, including
   dentists and auxiliaries, to disclose their name and practitioner's
   license status on a name tag while working, in at least 18-point type.
   A health care practitioner in an office, whose license is prominently
   displayed, would be able to opt not to wear such a name tag.   Also, if
   a health care practitioner is working in a setting which is not
   licensed by the State, the employing entity or agency shall have the
   discretion to make an exception from the name tag requirement for
   individual safety or therapeutic reasons.
   Legislation affecting dental auxiliaries which became effective January
   1, 1998, include the following:

   [1882.gif] RDHAP - New Licensure Category
   [1883.gif] Patient of Record - Required Dentist Examination and
   Diagnosis
   [tiny13.gif] Regulations

   Regulations are adopted by the Dental Board of California to interpret
   statutes, or make them more specific.  The regulations governing dental
   practice are in Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations,
   beginning at Section 1000.
   Many of the regulations that effect auxiliaries can be found on our
   Regulations page. (While every effort is made to assure that these are
   current, always go to the pages of the California Code of Regulations
   to guarantee the most current information.)
   Regulatory Changes Planned
   Following are some of the regulatory changes affecting dental
   auxiliaries that are being considered by either COMDA or the Board:
   [1883.gif] The Board is pursuing a change to Section 1088, which, if
   enacted, will allow RDH's to place medicaments subgingivally which do
   not later have to be removed. Currently, RDH's are only allowed to
   place liquid medicaments subgiginvally.
   Recent Regulation Changes
   Regulations that affect dental auxiliaries which have been recently
   amended and are currently in effect include:
   [1883.gif] Section 1086: Bleaching agents and temporary crowns:  RDA's
   allowed to apply and activate bleaching agents with non-laser
   light-curing devices, and to directly fabricate temporary crowns
   intra-orally.

   for bleaching trays, temporary crowns and bridges, and sports guards
   [1882.gif] Section 1077: RDA Work Experience: RDA applicants work

   Section 1085(b) and/or (c) during a majority of the experience hours.

   [1882.gif] During the past few years, regulations have also been
   changed in the following areas:
   LIGHT-CURING DEVICES:  Section 1085 -  dental assistants, and therefore
   all dental auxiliaries, are now allowed to cure restorative or
   orthodontic materials at the treatment site with a light-curing device.
   BITE REGISTRATIONS: Section 1086 -  RDA's, and therefore EF's and
   RDH's, are now allowed to take bite registrations under direct
   supervision.
   RDA EXAM: Section 1081.1 -   Candidates for the RDA practical exam can
   now be tested on any or all of ten listed procedures, which now
   includes the fabrication of temporary crowns and removal of temporary
   cement.
