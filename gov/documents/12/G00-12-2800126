   Requirement for Tropospheric Aerosol Research Program

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   The National Research Council has repeatedly called
   for major research efforts directed to tropospheric
   aerosols to...

   l Develop advanced mathematical, modeling, and
   monitoring tools to represent the relationships
   between specific sources of particulate matter and
   human exposures.
   - Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter (1998)

   l Reduce uncertainties in aerosol forcing to within
   ±15% globally and locally.

   Why a Tropospheric Aerosol Program?

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   Understanding the processes that control
   the loading, geographical distribution, and
   chemical and physical properties of
   anthropogenic atmospheric aerosols is
   central to key environmental issues
   affecting the nation's energy economy:

   lAir Quality (PM-2.5)

   l Regional Haze
   lClimate Change

   Air Quality Standards

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   New standards for particulate matter of
   Diameter < 2.5 µm (PM-2.5 standards).

   Mass loading not to exceed:
   15 µg m^-3 (annual mean)
   65 µg m^-3 (24-h, 98th percentile)

   Most impaired days:

   Improvement in visibility by one deciview per 10 (or 15) years.
   IMAGE tap19.ppt20.gif

   Decrease of one deciview corresponds to 10 % decrease in
   s[ext]

   Least impaired days:

   No worsening of visibility.

   Aerosol Influence on Climate Change

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   Tropospheric anthropogenic aerosols influence
   climate directly by scattering solar radiation and
   indirectly by modifying the microphysical and
   light scattering properties of clouds.

   Uncertainties in aerosol forcing are greatest
   source of uncertainty in climate forcing over
   the industrial period.

   Application of TAP Research

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   The same understanding of the...

   Aerosol Life Cycle...

   Processes controlling aerosol loading, composition, and
   microphysical properties and...

   Evaluated models of these processes...

   Are necessary for informed decision-making on PM-2.5,
   Regional Haze, and Climate issues.

   Objectives, Scope, and Approach of TAP

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   TAP will...

   Develop the fundamental scientific understanding required to
   construct tools for simulating the life cycle of tropospheric
   aerosols--the processes controlling their m ass loading,
   composition, and microphysical properties, al l as a function of time,
   location, and altitude.
   Represent this understanding in models, and apply and evaluate
   these models.
   Consist of closely linked field, modeling, laboratory, and theoretical
   studies focused on formation, growth, transport, and deposition.
   Work closely with other programs in DOE and in other agencies
   directed to related aerosol issues.

   Intensive Field Campaigns in TAP

   IMAGE tap19.ppt01.gif

   TAP will...

   Conduct a series of intensive field campaigns at a variety of
   representative locations.
   Focus on aerosol loading, properties, and evolution within the first
   200 km of emissions.
   Examine the dependence of aerosol evolution on the atmospheric
   chemical and photochemical environment.
   Examine the dependence of aerosol evolution on controlling

   meteorological variables, including temperature and humidity.
