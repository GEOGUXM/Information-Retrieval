    OODT, in partnership with the Interferometry Science Center (ISC) and
     Planetary Data Systems (PDS) Groups, has researched, developed, and
   implemented a closed loop information system that allows efficient data
        distribution and analysis for scientists in the Astrophysics,
      Planetary, and Space Physics disciplines. This custom-configured
