   TSP Open Season Here, Contribution Limits Increasing -
    With this open season for the Thrift Savings Plan employees can change
   the amount of their TSP contributions - or start contributing, if
   eligible. The open season for Federal civilian employees is from
   November 15, 2001 through January 31, 2002.   TSP contribution limits
   are increasing effective January 2002.  For FERS employees, the maximum
   amount of basic pay per pay period the employees can contribute will
   rise from 11 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2002. CSRS employees will
   be able to contriubute a maximum of 7 percent basic pay - up from
   6 percent in 2001.

   Also for 2002, the annual limit on employee contributions for TSP will
   be $11,000. This limit will increase each year by $1,000 until 2006,
   when it reaches $15,000. After 2006, the increase will be indexed to
   the annual cost-of-living adjustment referred to in the Tax Code.
