   Focus Areas header image

   Our Division's activities are focused into the following five areas:
     1. Cryptographic Standards and Applications
     2. Security Research / Emerging Technologies
     3. Security Management and Guidance
     4. Security Testing
     5. Outreach, Awareness and Education

   Cryptographic Standards and Applications
   Focus is on developing cryptographic methods for protecting the
   integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of information resources;
   and addresses such technical areas as: secret and public key
   cryptographic techniques, advanced authentication systems,
   cryptographic protocols and interfaces, public key certificate
   management, smart tokens, cryptographic key escrowing, and security
   architectures. Helps enable widespread implementation of cryptographic
   services in applications and the national infrastructure.
   The Security Technology Group is principally responsible for this focus
   area.
     * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
     * Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
     * Cryptographic Standards Toolkit
     * Encryption Key Recovery and S/MIME

   Security Testing
   Focus is on working with government and industry to establish more
   secure systems and networks by developing, managing and promoting
   security assessment tools, techniques, services, and supporting
   programs for testing, evaluation and validation; and addresses such
   areas as: development and maintenance of security metrics, security
   evaluation criteria and evaluation methodologies, tests and test
   methods; security-specific criteria for laboratory accreditation;
   guidance on the use of evaluated and tested products; research to
   address assurance methods and system-wide security and assessment
   methodologies; security protocol validation activities; and appropriate
   coordination with assessment-related activities of voluntary industry
   standards bodies and other assessment regimes.
   The Security Testing and Metrics Group is principally responsible for
   this focus area.
     * Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
     * National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)
     * IPSec

   Security Research / Emerging Technologies
   Focus is on research necessary to understand and enhance the security
   utility of new technologies while also working to identify and mitigate
   vulnerabilities. Addresses such technical areas as: advanced
   countermeasures such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and scanning
   tools; security testbeds, vulnerability analysis/mitigation, access
   control, incident response, active code, and Internet security.
   The Systems and Network Security Group is principally responsible for
   this focus area.
     * Authorization Management and Advanced Access Control Models
       (AM&AACM)
     * IPSec
     * Mobile Agent Intrusion Detection and Security (MAIDS)
     * Critical Infrastructure Grants Program

   Security Management and Guidance
   Focus is on developing security management guidance, addressing such
   areas as: risk management, security program management, training and
   awareness, contingency planning, personnel security, administrative
   measures, and procurement and in facilitating security and the
   implementation of such guidance in Federal agencies via management and
   operation of the Computer Security Expert Assist Team.
   The Security Management and Guidance Group is principally responsible
   for this focus area.
     * Computer Security Guidance
     * Computer Security Expert Assist Team (CSEAT)

   Outreach, Awareness and Education
   Focus is on activities to support wider awareness of the importance and
   need for IT security, promoting the understanding of IT security
   vulnerabilities and corrective measures, and in facilitating greater
   awareness of the Division's programs and projects.
   This focus area is supported by all components of the Division.
     * Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)
     * Regional Security Awareness Meetings
     * Computer Security and Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB)
     * Federal Computer Security Program Managers' Forum
     * Federal Information Systems Security Educators' Association
       (FISSEA)
