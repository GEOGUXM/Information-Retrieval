  Question What is the Youth Opportunity Movement?
   Answer  On one level, Youth Opportunity is the partnership-building
           network that helps communities access all of their resources to help
           at-risk youth. It provides the chance for every American--employers,
           individuals and young people--to reach into the community and help
           out-of-school youth succeed. It is because of this involvement at the
           grassroots level that Youth Opportunity is a movement rather than
           simply a program or initiative. On another level, the U.S. Department
           of Labor awards Youth Opportunity grants to qualifying communities.
           This seed money enables communities to establish "one-stop" service
           centers where youth can access a wide range of services. In order for
           this to be successful, partnerships must be created among government,
           businesses, schools, faith-based and civic organizations.
Question How is the Youth Opportunity Movement part of the President's
         New Markets Initiative?
 Answer  The economy is booming, and unemployment is low. However, though
         millions of Americans are enjoying economic success, not everyone is
         sharing in the prosperity. President Clinton launched his New Markets
         Initiative to expand our thriving economy into pockets of poverty and
         unemployment that remain. Our young people form a major source of human
         capital for the next century, and we cannot afford to leave this source
         untapped. Unlocking the talents of youth is good public policy. It is
         good business. And it is vital to tapping into new markets throughout
         the United States. Human capital is as critical to our success as
         investment capital. Businesses having trouble finding skilled workers
         can testify to that -- and so can disadvantaged communities.
 Question What is the mission of the Youth Opportunity Movement?
  Answer  The mission of the Youth Opportunity Movement is that all youth,
          particularly those most in need, will acquire the necessary skills and
          work experience to grow. into successful adults and explore careers,
          further education and training. Ultimately, the Youth Opportunity
          Movement is designed to offer young people particularly those most in
          need, the opportunity and the tools to compete successfully in the
          global economy of the 21st century.
 Question Why this approach?
  Answer  Research shows that an effective strategy to help at-risk youth
          find employment must address personal, societal, academic and
          professional challenges. Job training alone is not enough; in order to
          get and keep a job, young people need "hard" career-oriented skills,
          such as computer training, as well as "soft" attitudinal skills, such
          as how to nail an interview.
Question Why is a Youth Opportunity Movement needed?
 Answer  More than 15 million young people between the ages of 16 and 24
         are currently out of school, 10 million of whom have a high school
         diploma or less. These 10 million young people in particular face
         serious obstacles, because research shows that less educated youth have
         more difficulty finding employment and are more likely to experience
         social problems such as crime, drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy
         and welfare dependency.
 Question How can I get more information?
  Answer  There are many ways to get involved in the Youth Opportunity
          Movement. For more information please access the Youth Opportunity web
          site: www.yomovement.org, or call (202) 219-6871.
