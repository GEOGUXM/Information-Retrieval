   bridge which crosses into Ohio.)  Turn RIGHT onto WINCHESTER and stay
   in the left lane.  Go two blocks to 15ht St. and turn LEFT (the Ashland
   Plaza Hotel will be on your left).  Continue on 15th St. for one block
   to the intersection with GREENUP AVENUE.  You will see the Perkins
   Federal Building across the street.  Turn LEFT onto GREENUP and stay in
   the right lane.  After you pass the federal building there will be a
   parking lot on your right with spaces marked for those having business
   in the federal building. The office is not staffed full-time, so please

   Corbin
   I-75 South from Lexington to Corbin.  Take the second Corbin exit,
   which is EXIT 25.   Turn LEFT from the exit onto ROUTE 25.  Follow this
   2.5 miles to the 3rd stoplight at the intersection with MAIN STREET.
   (You can't miss this because Route 25 dead-ends into Main.)  Turn LEFT

   Corbin City Hall Building on your right.  Turn right into the parking
   lot directly adjacent to the building.  The Bankruptcy Court is located

   Frankfort
   From downtown Lexington take MAIN STREET (which is one-way) out of
   Lexington all the way to Frankfort (approximately 18 miles).  This is
   ROUTE 421 North.  At Frankfort, 421 will exit to the right and join
   ROUTE 60 at this point.  Stay on this road through 11 stoplights.

   the Civic Center Complex.)  Do not make any turns off this route.
   (421 will turn to the right at about the 9th stoplight but you should
   NOT make this turn.  Simply continue straight ahead and follow the
   stoplights.)  At the last stoplight you will pass UNDER a railroad
   overpass.  Turn LEFT here and you will merge into BROADWAY.  You will
   see The Watts Federal Building on your left next to the YMCA building.
   You will have to drive across the railroad tracks into the parking lot
   directly adjacent to the federal building.  The building address is 330
   W. Broadway. The office is not staffed full-time, so please direct any
