                              Electronic Forms

   The Government Paperwork Elimination Act sets a year 2004 deadline for
   federal agencies to convert paper forms into electronic forms. Like
   other agencies, DOC is working towards this goal. Neither Congress nor
   the White House's Office of Management and Budget have provided
   guidance on technical standards so agencies have gone their own way and
   thus various formats abound. The most popular formats are Adobe Acrobat
   PDF, Word Processing, or Text, but some agencies like GSA offer
   specialized software for managing their electronic forms.
