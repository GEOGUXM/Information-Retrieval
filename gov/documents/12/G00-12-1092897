   August 31, 1999 Dr. Martha Krebs Director Office of Science Department
   of Energy Washington, DC 20550 Dear Dr. Krebs: National Research
   Council Chair Dr. Bruce Alberts, in response to your letter requesting
   a judgement on the quality of the science in the program of the Office
   of Fusion Energy Sciences (OFES), has established the Fusion Science
   Assessment Committee (FuSAC). The committee's study will focus
   primarily on the science of magnetically confined plasmas and the
   programmatic strategy for long-term progress in this area. The
   Department of Energy's defense programs also sponsor major
   inertial-confinement research for stockpile stewardship purposes. Some
   of the plasma-science issues are common to both magnetic and inertial
   confinement, but the program structures are quite different. The
   committee does not directly address inertially confined plasmas in the
   attached interim report. The committee prepared the interim report to
   fulfill the commitment to provide OFES with some initial comments on
   the quality of the science in its program in time for inclusion in
   OFES's plans for the next year. A final report will provide a more
   comprehensive assessment and will address long-term issues facing the
   field. In response to congressional direction in 1996, OFES has shifted
   the focus of its program, emphasizing the effort to build the science
   and technological foundations for fusion energy and moving the energy
   technology development effort into the background. The redirection of
   funds into a broader range of science and technology issues, and to a
   broader community, is responsive to the report Plasma Science: From
   Fundamental Research to Technological Applications.1 The committee
   finds that this new approach is enabled by recent advances in
   experiment, diagnostics, theory, and computational modeling. FuSAC
   initiated its efforts with a meeting in mid-May 1999 that convened a
   number of experts on various aspects of the fusion research effort.
   Discussions with the experts on critical aspects of the program were
   followed by closed-session discussion by members of the committee about
   their impressions of the program. On the basis of that work, subsequent
   telephone conferences, and especially further community inputs and
   committee discussion at the July 1999 Snowmass meeting, the committee
   offers a number of observations about the science in the fusion program
   and about critical unresolved problems. These observations focus on the
   conceptual advances and the challenges in the program. The connections

   experiment, computation, and theory will be discussed in greater depth
   in the final report. The committee's final report will be based on an
   assessment of the past achievements, current strengths and weaknesses,
   and future prospects of the field. Development of the final report will
   be guided by broad questions such as: Does the program ask deep physics
   questions? What are the current role and future potential of a
   scientific predictive capability for advancing fusion energy? How does
   one guide the directions of a fusion energy science program if the
   ultimate goal is to develop a commercially viable fusion reactor? How
   can the connectivity of fusion science with other scientific
   disciplines be strengthened? What structural, programmatic, and
   institutional innovations and international initiatives might
   strengthen the scientific approach to fusion energy? FuSAC's Steering
   Group joins me in transmitting the committee's interim report to you.
   The committee members have enjoyed interacting with and learning from
   the fusion community during the past few months. We look forward to
   continuing these fruitful interactions as we prepare our final report.

   Interim Assessment FuSAC Roster May 16-19 Meeting Agenda and Attendance
   List August 31, 1999 Fusion Science Assessment Committee Interim
   Assessment The birth of modern plasma science The development of a
   practical fusion energy source remains one of the most challenging
   scientific endeavors undertaken by mankind. The early predictions of
   tabletop-scale fusion energy machines based on "back of the envelope"
   calculations very quickly confronted the reality of the plasma state as
   a complex nonlinear medium. Early plasma experiments more often than
   not ended with the plasma splattered against the walls of the
   containment vessels rather than confined within the magnetic bottle as
   intended. The production of a fusion- grade plasma at a temperature of
   100 million Kelvin required the development of the field of plasma
   science. Scientific tools had to be developed to describe plasma
   equilibrium, the balance between plasma pressure forces and the
   confining magnetic forces, and stability. Why do large-scale
   instabilities cause the plasma to break up and why do instabilities at
   small scale cause the energy to leak across the magnetic field? How do
   you heat an essentially collisionless plasma to the temperatures
   required for fusion and how do you accurately remotely diagnose the
   complex dynamics of the plasma at both large and small scales to test
   your understanding of the system? These questions and many more must be
   answered to establish the firm knowledge base required for the
   achievement of practical fusion energy production. Fundamental
   scientific insights from plasma physics and their impact on other
   scientific disciplines and industry The historical development of the
   fusion program has involved both basic physics and the applied and
   engineering sciences. Because of the explicitly applied goal of the
   fusion program, the larger scientific community can lose sight of the
   contributions the program has made to our understanding of fundamental
   physics. Basic plasma experiments elucidated the nonlinear properties
   of the plasma medium. As a consequence, a number of areas in modern
   nonlinear physics found some of their principal applications in fusion
   plasma science. In some of these cases, plasma scientists became
   leaders of these emerging fields-solitons, chaos, and stochasticity are
   noteworthy examples. Basic tools developed in the fusion program
   ranging from computer-based algebra to particle simulation techniques
   have found widespread applications in allied fields. One measure of the
   quality of a scientific field is its impact on and acceptance by other
   fields. Some examples of important topical areas that have had a broad
   impact on the broader scientific and industrial community include:
   Stability: The understanding of the complex plasma dynamics observed in
   early plasma experiments was initiated with the development of powerful
   energy principles and eigenmode techniques to explore the linear
   stability of plasma equilibria. The Board on Physics and Astronomy

   bpa@nas.edu national-academies.org/bpa wide variety of instabilities in
   plasma with an enormous range of spatial scales serves to define the
   richness of the plasma medium and the challenge to understand its
   dynamics. Predictions for the thermal pressure beyond which the plasma
   will disassemble have been confirmed in experiments in which the
   temperatures of the plasmas are in excess of those found on the surface
   of the Sun. In addition, experimental explorations have led to the
   development of methods that significantly increase the plasma pressure
   limits set by stability. Many of these stability analysis techniques
   are now essential tools not only in the field of plasma science but
   also in allied fields such as astrophysics and solar, ionospheric, and
   magnetospheric physics. Stochasticity and chaos: The effort to
   understand how the magnetic surfaces that confine hot plasma in fusion
   experiments break up led to the development of the standard map, which
   allowed the generic exploration of the onset of stochasticity.
   Understanding of the onset of stochasticity in velocity space was also
   intrinsic to modeling heating in essentially collisionless plasmas.
   Finally, senior scientists trained in the physics of plasmas developed
   the first published method for controlling chaos. Reconnection, field
   topology, and magnetic dynamos: A three-decade challenge of plasma
   physicists has been to explain the very short time scales that
   characterize the release of magnetic energy in the solar corona, in
   planetary magnetospheres (including Earth's), and in fusion
   experiments. Classical collisional dissipative processes are orders of
   magnitude too weak to explain the time scales observed. The difficulty
   lies in the extreme range in the spatial scales, from the macroscopic
   to the microscales associated with kinetic boundary layers, and in the
   necessity to include kinetic processes to provide collisionless
   dissipation. An emerging understanding based on theory, computation,
   and basic experiments is linked to the mediating role of dispersive
   waves, which act at the small scales where the "frozen-in" condition is
   broken. For the first time the predictions of energy release rates in
   fusion experiments are consistent with observations. A consequence of
   the fast release of magnetic energy associated with magnetic
   reconnection in some fusion experiments is the evolution to a minimum
   energy state where the magnetic field is partially self- generated by
   the plasma. The resulting "dynamo" action is related to magnetic dynamo
   processes in astrophysical systems such as the Sun and the planets.
   These fusion-sponsored experiments remain among the few laboratory
   demonstrations of a turbulent dynamo. Wave dynamics: The plasma state
   is unique in the rich variety of waves that are supported by the
   medium. Waves in plasmas not only appear spontaneously as a consequence
   of instabilities, but also can be generated to control plasma
   temperature and currents. Understanding how waves propagate and are
   absorbed in nearly collisionless plasma was a scientific challenge.
   Building on Landau's idea of the wave-particle resonance as a mechanism
   for collisionless dissipation, fusion scientists developed models to
   describe the absorption of high-power radio frequency waves and
   benchmarked the predictions in fusion experiments. Waves could then be
   used to engineer the phase space of particle distribution functions.
   Waves can now be excited in plasmas to generate intense current or to
   accelerate particles to high energies-a technique that can be applied
   to the next generation of high-energy accelerators. The nonlinear
   behavior of waves has also been an intrinsic component of the science
   of plasma wave dynamics, and knowledge of this phenomenon has spread
   widely to many other branches of physics. Indeed, such ubiquitous
   concepts as absolute and convective instabilities, solitons (nonlinear
   waves that persist through collisions), and parametric instabilities
   saw extensive development in the fusion context. Important industrial
   applications include the use of radio frequency technologies for plasma
   processing in semiconductor manufacturing. Finally, plasma physicists
   introduced the idea of using solitons in commercial high-speed
   communications. Turbulent transport: Understanding transport driven by
   turbulence is critical to solving such important problems as the
   accretion of matter into black holes, energy transport in the solar
   convection zone, and energy confinement in fusion experiments.
   Gradients in pressure, angular momentum, or other free energy sources
   drive small-scale turbulent flows that act to relax the gradient. This
   "anomalous transport" process should be contrasted with classical
   transport, which arises from two particle coulomb interactions in
   magnetic fusion plasmas and can include photon diffusion in
   astrophysical systems. The identification of anomalous transport in
   fusion experiments (and the corresponding theoretical work) sparked the
   recognition of its importance in space science and astrophysics, fields
   in which concepts such as anomalous transport and heat flux inhibition
   are now common language. Because of its fundamentally nonlinear and
   turbulent nature, understanding anomalous transport has been one of the
   significant scientific challenges of the fusion program. Diagnostics to
   remotely measure turbulent fluctuations as well as computer codes to
   describe the nonlinear dynamics of small-scale flows in a collisionless
   medium were developed. Experimental work in fusion has shown that
   turbulence can be spontaneously suppressed and a transport barrier
   formed, and that the mechanism was linked to the development of local
   zonal flows, which shred the vortices driving transport. The dynamics
   of this process parallels that of zonal flows in Jupiter's atmosphere.
   Outstanding problems In its preliminary discussions, the committee has
   begun to identify critical unresolved problems in fusion science. The
   following includes some examples. Turbulence and transport: Despite the
   scientific success in understanding the turbulent transport of ion
   thermal energy in magnetic containers, formidable challenges remain.
   The mechanism by which particles and electron thermal energy are lost
   from magnetic containers has not yet been clearly identified. This is a
   key issue for an energy-producing plasma, in which high-energy alpha
   particles produced during fusion deposit their energy in electrons. A
   paradox is that the electron energy-loss rate appears to be greatest in
   the core region of tokamak plasmas where theories based on
   linearization of equations for small-amplitude disturbances predict no
   linear instabilities. The source of the turbulence driving transport
   remains a mystery. The present experiments in tokamaks are in a regime
   in which magnetic field fluctuations associated with small-scale
   vortices driving transport are important, yet progress has been slow in
   developing the computational and diagnostic tools required to include
   these effects. The exploration of the role of magnetic fluctuations is
   especially critical for modeling experiments in the innovative magnetic
   containers now coming on line. Predictions of performance in proposed
   magnetic confinement experiments have traditionally been based on
   scaling laws deduced from existing and previous experiments rather than
   from first-principles theories of turbulent transport. The reliance on
   this approach over the long term, though previously grounded in
   necessity since there were no reliable theories of transport, should be
   re-evaluated in light of the new developments in theory and computation
   and the emergence of control techniques for manipulating transport.
   Finally, the role of alpha particles in turbulence and transport, which
   will be an important issue for burning plasmas, is not well understood.
   Energy density limits: The success in understanding pressure limits in
   confined plasma has been based largely on the ideal (dissipation-free)
   magnetohydrodynamic description. There is now substantial experimental
   evidence that, under some circumstances, the plasma pressure can be
   limited below these "ideal" limits by instabilities whose growth is
   facilitated by resistive or kinetic effects. Nonlinear instabilities,
   which self-sustain only when their amplitudes exceed a threshold value,
   are being studied as a possible mechanism for such limits. A major
   challenge for the field is to develop the computational tools to study
   the macroscopic nonlinear development of instabilities that constrain
   the global pressure of a system and that at the same time resolve the
   small time and space scales required to describe critical kinetic
   features. Until this challenge is met, numerical models of the
   large-scale plasma dynamics will be subject to the criticism that they
   are too primitive to fully describe the high-temperature regime of
   present and future fusion-grade plasmas. The duality of a medium that
   behaves like a continuum fluid at large scales and yet displays the
   effects of discrete particles at small scales is a recurring theme of
   plasma science. Integrated physics of self-heated plasmas: While the
   past DT tokamak experiments that produced weakly burning plasma were a
   milestone, a broad range of scientific and technological issues
   nevertheless remain to be explored in the strong self-heating regime,
   where the local energy deposited by fusion-produced alpha particles
   exceeds the energy from external sources. Key scientific questions
   concern the stability of the profiles, including transport barriers, in
   the self-heating regime. As the plasma pressure exceeds stability
   limits because of self-heating, will transport rise to balance the
   source in a benign manner or will large-scale instabilities lead to a
   loss of global confinement? Will a high density of energetic alpha
   particles destabilize waves and degrade alpha confinement so as to
   reduce the efficiency of alpha particle heating? Will helium ash
   accumulation continue to be minimal? On the positive side, will ideas
   for channeling alpha-particle energy directly into ions rather than
   electrons be successful and therefore ultimately lead to a more
   attractive fusion energy source? Conclusive answers to such questions
   will require experiments in the burning plasma regime. Summary The
   worldwide fusion energy program, with vigorous U.S. participation in
   all areas and leadership in many, has achieved much in its 40-year
   history. The fusion energy goal also has driven the development of the
   modern phase of plasma science. Plasma science, in turn, has
   contributed to many fields of science and technology during this time.
   The reorientation of the U.S. fusion program in 1996 had as its aims
   the stimulation of innovation and the strengthening of the scientific
   focus of the program. The extent to which the full promise of this
   approach has begun to be realized will be addressed in the committee's
   final report. FuSAC can say with confidence now that the technology
   needed to create, diagnose, and model sophisticated experiments on
   fusion-grade plasmas has been developed. The critical materials science
   issues of fusion energy have been scoped. The progress can be measured
   in other ways as well: The first preliminary fusion-burning experiments
   were recently completed. Scientific and engineering understanding of
   the concepts required for future fusion energy systems is being
   continually deepened. Nonetheless, the distance to the ultimate goal
   remains large. NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMMISSION ON PHYSICAL
