        MATHEMATICAL ROOTS OF THE DARTS SOFTWARE
          DARTS is a hierarchically layered software architecture rooted on a
          new approach to modeling of linked multibody systems developed by
          the authors, referred to as a spatial operator algebra. DARTS is
          therefore a model-based software architecture, in which the
          underlying mathematical model for the physical system very
          efficiently organizes the inherent system complexity into several
          layers of mathematical abstraction. The organization of the
          software architecture very closely follows that dictated by the
          mathematical model. Because this model determines the software
          architecture, every software module and computational step has a
          physical interpretation which can be obtained by examining the
          model. The physical relationships inherent in the system itself
          provide the software architecture. This features makes the software
          architecture very elegant, as this architecture is driven by an
          almost overwhelming logic determined by nature, as reflected in the
          system mathematical model. Furthermore, the system mathematical
          model used to determine the DARTS architecture is itself very
          efficiently organized by the spatial operator algebra. One
          therefore gets the best of two worlds: 1) the DARTS software
          architecture is very efficiently organized because it is
          model-driven; and 2) the model used to drive the architecture is
          very efficiently organized by the spatial operator algebra. The
          DARTS software is the embodiment of the spatial operator algebra,
          and is the spatial operator algebra reduced to practice, using the
          principles of modern software engineering. This algebra is at the
          root of the elegance and efficiency of the DARTS software.

        THE DOMAIN OF LINKED MULTIBODY SYSTEMS IS VERY LARGE
          The Spatial Operator Algebra is a new way to do the mathematics of
          arbitrary collections of rigid or deformable bodies connected
          either by physical joints or by interactive forces acting at a
          distance. This domain is huge. It includes SPACECRAFT, ROBOTS,
          VEHICLES, ANIMALS, MOLECULES, the SOLAR SYSTEM, etc. The list is
          endless. In fact, most of the objects that we perceive with our
          ordinary senses in daily life can be viewed as linked multibody
          systems. It is difficult to conceive of an ordinary object, or
          collection of objects, that cannot be viewed in this way. Other
          much smaller systems, such as molecular structures, we cannot
          experience directly with our ordinary senses. Special instruments
          nonetheless reveal their linked, multibody structure.

        THE MATHEMATICS FOR THE DYNAMICAL MOTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS IS VERY
          CHALLENGING
          Newton said f = ma, force equals mass multiplied by acceleration.
          This equation of motion has been at the root of science and
          technology for several centuries. It is a very simple equation, as
          are most fundamental laws of physics. It is easy to understand and
          use. In modern times, it is taught as early as high-school, and
          even earlier in some schools. However, as fundamental as it is,
          this equation needs further elaboration: In its simplest form, it
          only governs the dynamical behavior of a fictitious "point"
          particle in space that does not occupy any volume. Things are not
          so simple when modeling linked, multibody systems. Such systems
          differ from a "point" particle in that dynamical interactions
          between the various bodies in the multibody system must be
          accounted for. An example of such a dynamic interaction occurs when
          a spinning figure skater contracts the arms in order to change the
          speed of rotation. Another important example occurs in space, when
          pointing a gimballed camera toward a target may cause dynamic
          disturbances in the rest of the spacecraft. This interaction occurs
          even if the camera is small compared to the rest of the spacecraft.
          In some aerospace engineering circles, this type of interaction is
          known as the "tail wags dog" effect. Similar examples occur in all
          types of linked, multibody systems.
          To extend f = ma from a "point" particle to linked multibody
          systems, equations of motion must be developed that govern the
          interactive behavior of the complete system. These equations are
          typically very complex. A significant number of history's greatest
          scientists and mathematicians have made definitive contributions on
          how to develop such equations of dynamical motion. Euler, Lagrange,
          and Hamilton are among the most prominent. The science they created
          is classical mechanics, which governs the dynamical motion of most
          ordinary events when viewed at an ordinary human scale. Relativity
          and quantum mechanics were revolutions which came later.

        MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY IS OVERWHELMING EVEN FOR RELATIVELY SIMPLE
          SYSTEMS
          A simple robot with 6 articulated joints and 6 rigid links is one
          of the most common tools for robotics applications and research
          throughout the world. Fig. 1 displays the complexity of the
          corresponding equations of motion. There is an overwhelming
          proliferation of mathematical symbols and trigonometric functions
          (Sine, Cosine, etc.) of the various joint angles. There are also
          many subscripts. Counting the number of symbols is an overwhelming
          exercise, even without trying to comprehend what the symbols mean.
          There are so many trees that one cannot see the forest.

          Complexity gets even more out of hand for more complex systems.
          Some of the applications mentioned above (molecular structures,
          animals, etc.) have significantly many more degrees of freedom than
          a simple robot. Unless the equations of motion for such systems are
          organized efficiently, the mathematical complexity may be far
          beyond human capabilities.

        THE SPATIAL OPERATOR ALGEBRA ELIMINATES COMPLEXITY
          The Spatial Operator Algebra is a new approach to the mathematics
          of linked multibody systems. One of its key innovations is that it
          eliminates mathematical complexity. It reduces the number of
          symbols that a human analyst must see and understand by several
          orders of magnitude. This is done by using such spatial operators
          as f and H in Fig. 1, with each operator symbol representing up to
          10,000 more detailed arithmetical operations. Fig. 1 compares the
          extremely simple mathematical expressions prevalent in the Spatial
          Operator Algebra and the corresponding very complex expressions in
          prior approaches.
          While complexity is eliminated, no information about the system is
          lost in the Spatial Operator approach, as the spatial operators
          still contain precise information about the system. However, this
          information is organized and presented to the analyst using much
          fewer symbols.
          Complexity is reduced to what may be the absolute minimum. Even
          very complex systems require only a few spatial operator symbols.
          It is difficult to conceive how there could ever be a simpler
          mathematical representation.

            ______________________________________________________________

        COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY GROWS ONLY LINEARLY WITH THE NUMBER OF
          DEGREES OF FREEDOM
          Each spatial operator in the Spatial Operator Algebra is mechanized
          by an algorithm requiring arithmetical operations which grow only
          linearly with the number of degrees of freedom. These are known as
          "Order N" algorithms, because the number of arithmetical operations
          is of the same order as the number N of degrees of freedom. This
          means that, as system complexity grows, computational complexity
          grows only linearly. This is almost ideal. It would be absolutely
          ideal if the number of computations did not grow at all with system
          complexity, but this may not be possible. However, the Spatial
          Operator Algebra comes close to this. This is particularly true,
          because in most traditional methods, the number of arithmetical
          operations grows as the cube of the number of degrees of freedom.
          Fig. 2 shows a comparison, in terms of the number of arithmetical
          operations required, between the Order N algorithms embedded in the
          Spatial Operator Algebra and the Order N-Cube algorithms of prior
          state of the art. The Order N algorithms in the Spatial Operator
          Algebra are referred to in Fig. 2 as NEIMO, which stands for Newton
          Euler Inverse Mass Operator method.

        THE SPATIAL OPERATORS EXTEND TO 3-DIMENSIONAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS THE
          COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT DIGITAL FILTERING TECHNIQUES OF MODERN
          SIGNAL PROCESSING
          Each spatial operator in the Spatial Operator Algebra is
          implemented using a spatiallly recursive algorithm, in which the
          necessary computations are performed in a sequential series of
          steps. Each sequence starts at one end of the system and terminates
          at the other end. Many of the spatial operators, those requiring
          inversion of the system mass matrix for example, are mechanized by
          spatially recursive Kalman filtering algorithms, quite popular in
          digital filtering and signal processing. Since it was announced by
          R. E. Kalman, now at the University of Florida, in the early
          1960's, his Kalman filtering algorithm has found its way to
          countless applications in science and engineering: aerospace
          navigation, guidance and control; satellite orbit determination;
          digital image processing; stock market modeling and prediction;
          weather forecasting; etc. It has been stated in some occasions that
          a good metric to measure the relative state of advancement of a
          society is the number of Kalman filtering applications in this
          society. While this claim may have been made somewhat in jest, it
          may not be far from the truth.
          That the Kalman filter embedded in the Spatial Operator Algebra
          solves computational bottlenecks in classical mechanics is a very
          surprising scientific discovery, requiring a deep understanding of
          both classical mechanics and filtering methods.

        THE SPATIAL OPERATOR ALGEBRA EMERGES FROM A SYNTHESIS OF SEVERAL
          SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES, PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE UNRELATED
          The Spatial Operator Algebra solves problems in classical mechanics
          using a combination of powerful methods previously thought to be
          unrelated to mechanics: (1) Filtering and Prediction Methods, which
          emerged initially during World War II to address problems in
          predicting the future trajectories of missiles and other
          projectiles. N. Wiener, the father of the term Cybernetics, was
          among the most prominent founders of this scientific discipline;
          (2) Functional Analysis and Linear Operator Methods, a unifying
          mathematical framework used widely in engineering and science (for
          example in quantum mechanics); (3) Linear Control System Theory,
          which has enabled the design of digital automatic control systems
          in many space and terrestrial applications.
          Finding previously undiscovered relationships and analogies among
          areas is one of the most fundamental contributions that can be
          made. Such discoveries inevitably enhance our knowledge and
          understanding of the areas synthesized. For example, efficient
          computational techniques, which have emerged from about 50 years of
          intensive research in Filtering and Prediction Methods, can now be
          used to organize complexity and solve computational bottlenecks in
          classical mechanics. Knowledge from any given area is applied to
          previously unresolved problems in the other areas. Finding
          analogies and relationships therefore fills in gaps in our
          knowledge, and it advances knowledge in all related areas. To a
          large extent, the Spatial Operator Algebra does this.

        THE SPATIAL OPERATOR ALGEBRA LEADS TO A HIERARCHICAL SOFTWARE
          ARCHITECTURE BUILT FROM STANDARDIZED, REUSABLE MODULES
          The Spatial Operator Algebra is easily implemented using modern
          software development methods. At any given level in the hierarchy,
          the computer automatically decomposes each spatial operator into a
          set of a few more detailed operations at the next lower level in
          the hierarchy. There is a corresponding decomposition in the
          software architecture. This process of decomposition can be viewed
          as that of "smart" compilation, in the sense that the compiler is
          made smart by built-in knowledge about the system dynamical model
          embedded in the spatial operators. The software modules which
          constitute the architecture are simple, standardized, and easily
          debugged.
          Figure 3

                                     Figure 3
          Fig. 3 illustrates the software architecture. At the highest level
          (Level 1 in the figure) of abstraction, the user inputs a
          mathematical statement. This input requires that the program
          decompose the operators H, J, and K that appear at this level. This
          decomposition occurs at Level 2 in the hierarchy. At the next
          level, labeled 3 in the figure, the computer recognizes that j is
          what is referred to as a Kalman filter transition operator. This in
          turn implies that j can be mechanized using an inward Kalman
          filtering recursion, shown at Level 4, from the tip of the system
          to the base. Subsequent levels are decomposed in the same fashion.
          At the lowest level, Level 7 in the figure, are the very detailed
          coordinate transformations for reference frames attached to the
          various bodies constituting the multibody system.
          This programming approach achieves a very high level of
          abstraction. The number of symbols visible to the analyst at any
          level in the hierarchy is very small. This means that the
          corresponding computer programs are also very simple. The programs
          are modular and map to a modular software architecture. The
          programs are also to a large extent system-independent, in the
          sense that going from one system to another is easy to do. Although
          the programs are simple, computational efficiency is not lost.
          Embedded in the programs are very efficient computational
          algorithms.

        HIGH-PERFORMANCE SIMULATION FOR REAL-TIME PLANETARY SPACECRAFT
          DYNAMICS
          Real-time computer simulators which accurately predict the
          dynamical motion of an actual spacecraft in flight lead to
          significant reductions in cost during system design, development
          and testing. They also improve system performance and reliability
          during flight operations. In the early stages of a flight project,
          when the actual spacecraft to be flown may not yet exist in its
          final form, design options and trades can easily be made by
          computer simulation. For example, changing a sensor in a computer
          simulation costs much less than changing it in an actual
          spacecraft. In the final stages of design and testing, when the
          spacecraft may already be built and almost ready to be flown,
          computer simulations are used for hardware-in-the-loop testing and
          evaluation. Such hardware-in-the-loop simulations are hybrid
          systems consisting of both flight hardware (sensors, actuators,
          etc.) together with software for spacecraft dynamics. They are
          invaluable at this stage because they provide relatively
          inexpensive end-to-end testing and evaluation prior to flight.
          DARTS (Dynamics Algorithms for Real Time Simulation) is a software
          package developed by the innovators which has been adopted as a
          standard for several current and emerging JPL flight projects. It
          is an integral element of the JPL Flight System Testbed (FST) and
          PDC (Project Design Center), and it provides a cost-effective,
          rapid-prototyping tool for end-to-end system design, development
          and testing. DARTS has been adopted as a standard by the JPL
          Pathfinder and Cassini projects for hardware-in-the-loop spacecraft
          simulations. It is also being used to support Galileo mission
          operations.
          Productivity gains enabled by DARTS are as follows. The DARTS
          simulation software meets project needs through all phases of a
          project. Its reusability makes it the simulation standard for
          current and future projects. It allows exploration of a larger
          design and test space, thus reducing risks. Its high-speed
          algorithms reduce simulation time by at least an order of
          magnitude. It easily accommodates multiple spacecraft
          configurations and simulation scenarios. It also allows easy
          testing of the fault-protection subsystem by allowing insertion of
          simulated faults while the computer simulation program is running.

        ROBOTICS APPLICATIONS
          The Spatial Operator Algebra organizes very efficiently the
          mathematics and computations required by high-performance robotic
          manipulators, arm-like systems consisting of linked objects joined
          together by articulated joints. A robotic manipulator is a very
          special type of a linked, multibody system. The Spatial Operator
          Algebra ranks among the best fundamental contributions to robotics
          research in recent years. The innovators have been systematically
          using the Spatial Operator Algebra to solve a number of important
          research problems in robotics research: 1) efficient inversion of
          the manipulator mass matrix required to conduct robot dynamics
          simulation; 2) non-interacting manipulator control, in which the
          control system at each of the joints is independent of all of the
          other joints; 3) control of underactuated manipulators, in which
          not all of the degrees of freedom are actively controlled; and 4)
          dual arm manipulation in which two or more arm-like systems work
          together to move a commonly held object. These results have been
          communicated to the robotics community through publication in
          technical journals.

        LARGE SCALE MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS
          In a joint effort with Professor W. Goddard, III of the Caltech
          Chemistry Department, the Spatial Operator Algebra is being used to
          investigate the dynamics of large (~1,000,000 atom) molecular
          structures. Fig. 4 illustrates such an application. The Spatial
          Operator Algebra is being used to study: the structural and
          functional relationships of proteins and enzymes; protein folding
          mechanisms and pathways; new drug design; and design and study of
          catalysts and polymers. The fundamental technical problem being
          addressed is the global and local dynamical behavior a complex
          collection of many atoms joined together by interactive forces. The
          efficiency of the dynamics algorithms in the Spatial Operator
          Algebra enable the accurately detailed study of much larger systems
          than could be studied with previous methods. This project is being

          Challenge Grant in High-Performance Computing.

        CONCLUDING REMARKS
          The Spatial Operator Algebra is a fundamental contribution to
          engineering, science and applied mathematics. It is not only
          technically elegant, but it is also very practical in a
          "hard-nosed" engineering sense. Its primary applications to date
          have been in space vehicle dynamics (spacecraft, robots, etc.), but
          there are many more potential applications. The fundamental body of
          knowledge that the Spatial Operator Algebra represents is being
          disseminated at universities and through publications in technical
          societies. This process is gradual but unstoppable. As the Spatial
          Operator Algebra becomes more widely understood, there will be many
          more applications. Some of the contributions in it (e.g. the Kalman
