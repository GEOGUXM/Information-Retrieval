  Mission Statement

   The Central Valley Bay-Delta Branch (CVBDB) is mandated to conduct
   fisheries and wildlife research and analysis of the San Francisco bay
   and Delta and special water projects of the estuary and its
   tributaries. These special projects include the channel and aqueduct
   systems of the Delta, as well as, the natural river systems and
   extending north and south from the Delta.

   The CVBDB's mission is to gather and provide information and
   recommendations that will permit others (such as other units of the DFG
   and other agencies such as the federal Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the U.S. Bureau of
   Reclamation (USBR), the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB),
   and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR)) to develop
   procedures, policies and regulations that will protect the flora and
   fauna of the bay, Delta and adjoining tributary environments from harm,
   and that will enhance the survival of those species that are listed as
   rare, threatened or endangered.

   These recommendations are made in an atmosphere of competing interests
   for scarce resources from a variety of public and private sources.
   Water and other estuary resources are in demand by rural agriculture,
   cities, anglers, developers, environmentalists, and others. To provide
   a means of resolving demands while protecting species and habitat, a
   variety of federal and state laws, policies and regulations have been
   enacted. Federal and state laws mandate restrictions, and regulations
   relative to listed species, water policies, land development practices
   and other environmental and toxic issues.

   Many federal and state agencies have established jurisdictions
   regarding specific water and resource policies and regulations. In
   support of their jurisdictions, they carry out a variety of research
   and analyses. In order to promote cost effective, non-overlapping,
   cooperative research, an Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) has been
   established by federal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the
   member agencies. The IEP sets research priorities and funds specific
   programs in support of agency program mandates. The CVBDB chairs the
   IEP and receives contract funds from the agencies, apportioned by the
   IEP. The interagency MOU requires all CVBDB's project data to be stored
   in a common electronic format and to be available for access by the
   other IEP agencies and by the public.

   The state constitution gives the SWRCB regulatory jurisdiction over
   California's water resources, including establishment and adjudication
   of water rights. The SWRCB's Water Right Decision 1485 requires that
   most of the proposed and ongoing projects affecting the waters and
   ecosystems of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh be
   reviewed and approved by the SWRCB. The SWRCB requires biological and
   environmental studies be carried out by DWR and USBR to show possible
   and ongoing effects of their projects and to provide analysis and plans
   for mitigating or eliminating any adverse effects upon the ecosystem,
   including the fisheries. For example Decision 1485 states in part that
   the permittees (DWR and USBR) "Conduct ongoing and future monitoring
   surveys as recommended by California Department of Fish and Game and
   concurred in by the Board concerning food chain relationships and
   fisheries impacts as they are affected by CVP and SWP operations in the
   Delta and Suisun Marsh."

   Decision 1485 goes on to require that the "Permittees shall make
   available to the Board and other interested agencies upon request
   results of the above monitoring as soon as practicable following the
   month during which the monitoring was accomplished. Annual reports
   summarizing the previous calendar year's findings and detailing future
   study plans shall be submitted to the Board by January 15 of each year.
   Detailed reports containing the previous year's monitoring results
   shall be submitted by August 1 of each year." To support these
   requirements, DWR and USBR contract this work to the DFG's Central
   Valley Bay-Delta Branch. By contract, the CVBDB is required to support
   the SWRCB's research, monitoring and reporting requirements. Ninety
   percent of the CVBDB's project work/PY funding is derived from
   contracts with DWR, USBR, and to a lesser extent other agencies.

   In addition to D-1485 and the interagency MOU, the DFG is required by
   the California Endangered Species Act to provide studies in support of
   lead agency projects

     "to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by that
     state lead agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued
     existence of any endangered or threatened species. ...the department
     [DFG] shall issue a written finding based on its determination of
     whether a proposed project would jeopardize the continued existence
     of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction
     or adverse modification of habitat essential to the continued
     existence of the species. ...The department shall base its
     determination on the best available scientific information."

   In addition,

     "If jeopardy is found, the department shall determine and specify to
     the state lead agency reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent
     with conserving the species which would prevent jeopardy to the
     continued existence of the species or the destruction or adverse
     modification of the habitat essential to the continued existence of
     the species."

   If specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible the
   alternatives prescribed,...the state lead agency may approve a project
   when jeopardy is found, if in part, mitigation and enhancement measures
   as are necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse impacts are
   required, including but not limited to, live propagation,
   transplantation, and habitat acquisition, restoration and improvement.

   Almost all of the work of the Central Valley Bay-Delta Branch is under
   contract to support the above statutes, regulations and decisions. In
   support of these and related statutes and regulations the CVBDB
   presently has 32 study projects. Some projects are jointly carried out
   with other agencies. All projects have the common elements of data
   collection (sampling) recorded in the field on paper forms, key data
   entry, data analysis and report generation. In addition, some projects
   include laboratory analysis and its resulting data generation.
