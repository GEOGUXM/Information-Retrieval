   The Experimental Properties of Fluids Group has extensive capabilities
   for wide-ranging, high-accuracy fluid properties measurements. It
   performs experimental research on the thermodynamic and transport
   properties of industrially important fluids and fluid mixtures covering
   temperatures from 30 to over 700 K at pressures up to 70 MPa; the full
   composition range is covered for mixtures. State-of-the-art instruments
   are employed to measure properties such as pressure-volume-temperature
   (PVT) behavior, vapor pressure and phase equilibrium (VLE) behavior,
   heat capacity, speed of sound, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. The
   group currently has strong programs in natural gas mixtures, aqueous
   systems, and alternatives to the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants.
   The group also carries out light and neutron scattering studies of
   fluids to gain a fundamental understanding of the microstructure of
   fluids. The group has a long history of research in fluid properties,
   and over the past 35 years, has provided comprehensive measurements on
   a wide variety of fluid systems including common inorganics, cryogens,
   hydrocarbons, supercritical fluids, and aqueous systems. It works
   closely with the Theory and Modeling of Fluids Group and others to
   provide the data needed to develop comprehensive formulations of fluid
   properties.
