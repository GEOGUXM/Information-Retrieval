   Sec. 1. Preamble. On December 4, 2000, I issued Executive Order 13178
   establishing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem
   Reserve (Reserve) pursuant to my authority under the National Marine
   Sanctuaries Act, as amended by the National Marine Sanctuary Amendments
   Act of 2000 (Act). In establishing the Reserve, I set forth a number of
   conservation measures and created specific Reserve Preservation Areas
   to protect the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and
   species (resources) of the Reserve. The Act provides that no closure
   areas can become permanent without adequate notice and comment.
   Accordingly, I proposed to make permanent the Reserve Preservation
   Areas and initiated a 30-day comment period on this proposal. I also
   sought comment on the conservation measures for the Reserve. On my
   behalf, the Secretary of Commerce received the public comments and held
   seven public hearings,including six throughout Hawaii. After
   considering the comments expressed at the hearings and re- ceived in
   writing, I have determined to make permanent the Reserve Preserva- tion
   Areas with certain modifications set forth below. Further, I have modi-
   fied certain conservation measures to address concerns raised,
   particularly regarding commercial and recreational fishing within the
   Reserve. With this action, the establishment of the Reserve under the
   Act, including the con- servation measures and permanent Reserve
   Preservation Areas, is complete. The Secretary of Commerce will manage
   the Reserve pursuant to Executive Order 13178, as modified by this
   order, under the Act. The Secretary shall also initiate the process to
   designate the Reserve as a National Marine Sanctuary, as required by
   the Act. Sec. 2. Purpose. The purpose of this order is to amend
   Executive Order 13178, and to make permanent Reserve Preservation
   Areas, as modified below, to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and
   lasting protection of the resources of the Northwestern Hawaiian
   Islands. Sec. 3. Amendments to Sections 7 of Executive Order 13178. 1.
   Section 7(a)(1) of Executive Order 13178 is hereby amended by revising
   the first sentence to read as follows: ``Commercial Fishing. All
   currently existing commercial Federal fishing per- mits and current
   levels of fishing effort and take, which also includes the
   non-permitted level of trolling for pelagic species by currently
   permitted bottom fishers, as determined by the Secretary and pursuant
   to regulations in effect on December 4, 2000, shall be capped as
   follows:'' VerDate 112000 13:55 Jan 22, 2001 Jkt 194001 PO 00000 Frm

   is hereby revised to read as follows: ``(C) The annual level of
   aggregate take under all permits of any particular type of fishing may

   each permitted bottomfisher shall be that permittee's individual
   average taken over the 5 years preceding December 4, 2000, as
   determined by the Secretary, provided that the Sec- retary, in
   furtherance of the principles of the reserve, may make a one- time
   reasonable increase to the total aggregate to allow for the use of two
   Native Hawaiian bottomfishing permits; (2) All other commercial
   fishing-the annual aggregate level shall be the permittee's individual
   take in the year preceding December 4, 2000, as determined by the
