   Call for Papers

     1999 International Symposium on Space Communications and Navigation
                                Technologies
     Hosted by the Center of Excellence in Deep Space Communications and
                                 Navigation,
   the Technology Office of the Telecommunications and Mission Operations
                                 Directorate
              and the Technology and Applications Directorate,
               Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena California

           "Frontiers in Deep Space Communications and Navigation"
                   Pasadena Conference & Exhibition Center
                            Pasadena, California
                            September 21-23, 1999

   Future mission plans present numerous technical challenges in
   communications and navigation. In the next decade robotic missions to
   Mars will include an array of orbiters, landers, rovers, penetrators,
   aerobots and sample return vehicles. The need for a high level of
   connectivity to in situ instruments and the desire to precisely deliver
   and track landed elements calls for new communications and navigation
   systems concepts, such as a constellation of low altitude satellites at
   Mars. Other planetary mission plans call for penetrators and high
   resolution maps at Europa, sample return from comets and asteroids,
   aerobots and sample return missions to Venus, and. a flyby of Pluto. In
   addition, space interferometry missions have been proposed for
   detection and eventual imaging of planets around distant stars.

   Collectively, these missions will place new demands on communication
   links, both short range interspacecraft and earth-based interplanetary
   links. New technologies are required, for example, for miniature short
   range communications, autonomous navigation and control, and increased
   communications link capacity to support interplanetary data return.

   Papers are solicited on recent studies and results in advanced
   concepts, techniques and technologies in deep space communications and
   navigation. Some specific topics are: in situ communications and
   tracking networks, navigation techniques to enable autonomous formation
   flying, precision landing, aerocapture, rendezvous and docking in
   planetary orbit, and small body orbital operations, as well as ground
   and flight technologies for interplanetary communications and
   navigation, such as antennas, low noise amplifiers, transponders,
   receivers, oscillators, clocks, power amplifiers, coding, data
   compression, signal processing, optical communications, etc.

   Those interested in presenting papers are invited to submit a one page
   abstract by June 30, 1999 via this symposium web site. Submission of
   the one page abstract by hard copy is also acceptable. Send to Dr.
   James W. Layland at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove
   Drive, M/S 161/260, Pasadena, CA 91109 or FAX (818) 393-4643.
