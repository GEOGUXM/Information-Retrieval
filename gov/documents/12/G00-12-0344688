   [t.gif] he NASA Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) is a
   NASA-sponsored, collaborative project between investigators at Brigham
   Young University (BYU), JPL, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the
   National Ice Center (NIC) to develop accurately calibrated
   scatterometer-based data time series in support of climate-related
   studies of the Earth's cryosphere and biosphere.

   Originally developed to measure winds over the ocean from space,
   microwave radar scatterometers have proven applicable over a wide range
   of vegetation zones and moisture conditions including wet, dry, and
   frozen. Because the scatterometer radar signal can penetrate the
   surface, a scatterometer can observe variability in
   subsurface/subcanopy climate-related features which are driven by
   diurnal, seasonal, and interannual forcing.

   The principal repository for these datasets is Brigham Young University
   (BYU), where files are publicly available via browser or ftp. PO.DAAC
   mirrors, archives, and also distributes the data via select media.
