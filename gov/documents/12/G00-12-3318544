               "Downtown is every neighborhood's neighborhood"

                          Mayor Michael B. Coleman

   The health of a city's downtown is a reflection of the entire
   metropolitan area.  Areas of downtown Columbus have not kept pace with
   the growth of the region as a whole.  As a result, the Mayor, business,
   community and elected leaders have come together for the first time to
   create a comprehensive and strategic business plan for downtown.  This
   plan is being designed with broad-based community and business input.

   This site provides information about the entire process involved with
   creating the downtown business plan.   I encourage you to take a look
   around, and then get involved!
