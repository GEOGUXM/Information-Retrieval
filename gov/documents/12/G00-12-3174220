   Senior Investigator:
   Lewis K. Pannell
   Research:
   Determination of the structure of biologically active natural products
   isolated from plants and marine sources, with emphasis on those with
   potent anti-AIDS and anti-cancer activity. Full use is made of the
   variety of equipment available including electrospray, a high
   resolution mass spectrometer for formula determinations and
   collisionally induced dissociation for structural fragment analysis.
   Determination of the composition of modified proteins, peptides, and
   oligonucleotides, with special emphasis on post-translational
   modifications. such as disulfides and glycosylation. Samples are
   purified by HPLC and analyzed by electrospray and MALDI. Digests of
   proteins, including those isolated from gels, allow confirmation of
   protein sequence and the identification of modifications.

   A new Q-TOF II mass spectrometer has just been added to the group as a
   shared resource between five institutes. See
   http://proteome.nih.gov/shared.html for more information.
