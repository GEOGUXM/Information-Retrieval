The CBCG's research and development efforts include:

     * Supporting wet lab biology
          + Laboratory information management systems
          + Groupware
     * Analysis of biological sequences
          + Sequence analysis
          + Protein structure and function prediction
          + Large-scale genome annotation
     * Access to biological information
          + Database integration
          + Data mining
     * Modeling of gene regulation.

   We use modern software engineering tools and methods and some of the
   best hardware to accomplish our goals.
