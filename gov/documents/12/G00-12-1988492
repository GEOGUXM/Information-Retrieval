     __________________________________________________________________

   1.     Purpose. This chapter documents the National Weather Service
   (NWS) policy of encouraging and supporting the growth of the qualified
   private sector of meteorology and climatology in a manner consistent
   with the mission and responsibilities of NWS.

   2.     Policy. The following statements outline the position of the
   National Weather Service with respect to private meteorology.

       a.     NWS provides climatological, hydrological, and
   meteorological information, forecasts, and warnings for the public and
   for broad homogeneous segments of industry. NWS is charged by law to
   serve the aviation, marine, and agriculture industries.

       b.     Private sector meteorologists serve specific business and
   individuals who depend upon specialized meteorological advice which
   cannot be satisfied by authorized Government products or dissemination
   methods.

       c.     NWS will provide support as indicated in sections 3 and 4
   below to non-Government meteorologists whenever such support can be
   given within available resources, without partiality, and without
   compromise of its mission or of regulations concerning release of
   information. NWS supports the concept of private sector meteorology
   which is responsible, competent and service-oriented.

   3.     Support to Private Sector Meteorologists. Private sector
   meteorologists recognize their need for governmental weather data,
   communications, and processing facilities. Within the bounds of
   existing legislation, NWS products will be made equally available to
   any private meteorologist at no extra cost to NWS. If charges are
   required for any of this material they will be assessed on a uniform
   basis. While the private sector's reliance on NWS products is
   acknowledged, access to available data, on an equitable basis, must be
   under conditions that do not interfere with efficient operation of NWS
   offices or performance of its mission.

   NWS meteorologists will cooperate with private meteorologists to the
   extent that there is no interference with the normal performance of NWS
   duties. Impartial treatment is essential and care must be taken to see
   that NWS does not incur additional expense solely for private benefit.
   Questions about the propriety of specific cooperative activities should
   be referred, through regional headquarters, to the Director of NWS.

   4.     Meteorological Services to Business and Industry. NWS products
   regularly prepared for the general public are, of course, available to
   business and industry. In cases where the general welfare is served,
   products are routinely prepared for specific industries, e.g.,
   aviation, agriculture and forestry, marine, as well as for air
   pollution control programs.

   4.1     Specialized Services. NWS will not provide specialized services
   for business and industry when the services are currently offered by or
   can be offered by a commercial enterprise. Specialized services which
   can only be offered by NWS and for which no commercial capability
   exists, can be provided to business and industry only if appropriate
   charges are assessed in accordance with NOAA Finance Handbook, chapter
   9. Services which are regularly part of the NWS mission are not
   affected by the above conditions.

   4.2     Referrals. When NWS employees are asked to provide special
   meteorological services or products which cannot be provided in
   accordance with section 4.1, they should refer the requester to the
   American Meteorological Society, National Weather Association, National
   Council of Industrial Meteorologists, or other professional
   meteorological organizations. The advantages of using a Certified
   Consulting Meteorologist or similarly qualified individual may be
   pointed out. In unusual circumstances the requester may be referred,
   through proper channels, to NOAA's Special Assistant for Industrial
   Meteorology. These referral procedures will avoid any recommendation of
   a specific private meteorologist.

   5.     Resolution of Problems. Admittedly, these guidelines cannot
   cover all possibilities. Close coordination and cooperation are
   essential to ensure that the public receives the best possible weather
   service. Regional and local officials should arrange occasional
   meetings with non-Government meteorologists to promote an exchange of
   ideas that will be mutually beneficial. Local chapters of national
   meteorological organizations provide an excellent means for exchange of
   information and opportunities for discussion between Federal and
   private meteorologists.

   Misunderstanding may be more likely to occur where private
   meteorologists serve mass news media outlets. Proper NWS contacts with
   these private meteorologists can greatly enhance our service to the
   public. NWS relies heavily on the mass news media to distribute its
   public weather products. There is nothing to prevent the media from
   using alternate information so long as it is not attributed to the
   Government (see Section 18 U.S.C. 2074 which states that whoever
   knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or
   warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or
   warning to have been issued or published by the National Weather
   Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of
   Commerce, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined not
   more than $500 or imprisoned not more than 90 days). NWS encourages the
   media to attribute weather information to the proper source.

   If a significant problem arises in any area concerning private
   meteorology, the first step should be discussion between the
   Meteorologist in Charge (MIC) of the Weather Service Forecast Office
   (WSFO) responsible for the area affected and the private meteorologist
   concerned. Ethical behavior requires both parties to avoid public
   controversy. If this approach does not solve the problem, the MIC
   should request help from the regional headquarters, usually the
   Executive Officer. The matter should be referred to NWS Headquarters if
   it cannot be resolved at the regional level.

   6.     National Headquarters Liaison. The Special Assistant for
   Industrial Meteorology, NOAA Headquarters, provides liaison between
   NOAA and private sector meteorology. Correspondence originating within
   the NWS on matters relative to private sector relationships will be
   routed to the Special Assistant's office through the Director of NWS.
   NOAA will provide the Director of NWS with copies of correspondence
   relating to private sector meteorology as well as routine reports by
   the Special Assistant for Industrial Meteorology.

   7.     Related NOAA Policies. NOAA Policy on Industrial Meteorology
   (NOAA Directives Manual 27-11) and NOAA Policy on Radio-TV
   Dissemination (NOAA Directives Manual 27-13) are additional sources of
   information on topics covered in this chapter.
