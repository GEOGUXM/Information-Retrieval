          AMS purchases a variety of food products in support of the National
          School Lunch program and other Federal Feeding programs.  These
          purchases also help to stabilize prices in agricultural commodity
          markets by balancing supply and demand.  Fresh and processed food
          customarily purchased under these program includes fruits and
          vegetable, beef and pork, poultry and egg products, and fish.  The AMS
          website contains a wealth of information of use to those who purchase
          and sell foods for these programs. Skip link group
