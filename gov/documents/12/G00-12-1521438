   Mission Concepts

   Given the fine angular resolution requirement, we essentially have to
   abandon low earth orbits as an option where thermal environment
   management is very difficult. Following the examples set by both NGST
   and Constellation-X, we think that Generation-X should be launched to
   L2. For the purpose of discussion here, we will assume that in the next
   10 to 20 years there will not be revolutionary breakthroughs in launch
   technology. In other words, we will work with the constraints of
   currently existing launch vehicles, namely the Delta-IV-H rockets which
   can lift 7,500 kg to L2 and has a fairing size of 4.5 m in diameter and
   15 m in height.

   Instead of building a single massively deployable telescope (Gorenstein
   1998) we propose to implement the entire Generation-X observatory as 6
   identical satellites, each of which carries a fraction of the required
   total collection area. This would minimize both launch and component
   failure risks. Given the constraints of the Delta-IV-H launch vehicle,
   a natural size for each telescope would be 4.5 m in diameter which
   translates approximately into an aperture area of 15 m^2. Given rapid
   developments of various precision deployment mechanisms, it is
   reasonable to assume that in a decade or so we should be able to
   package 25 m^2 of effective area with on-orbit deployment mechanisms in
   the same volume. Figure 1 illustrates a possible packaging scheme.

   A natural focal length for the telescope would be 15 m as determined by
   the launch vehicle fairing height. Since the Constellation-X mission
   and others have been actively developing light and extensible optical
   benches, we can probably take for granted that we can have ready
   extensible optical benches for Generation-X a decade from now. To
   preserve the same f-number from Constellation-X to Generation-X, we
   would require a focal length on the order of 40 m. To achieve broader
   band coverage in energy, 100 to 150 m focal length is highly desirable.

   There are several essential technologies that will make the
   Generation-X Observatory possible. First is the X-ray mirror
   technology. There are several issues here. The first one is the weight
   problem. In order for a mirror assembly with an effective area of 25
   m^2 to fit within the mass budget of a Delta-IV-H, its mass per unit
   effective area has to be less than 120 kg/m^2 (note here that we are
   referring to the mass per unit effective area, not physical mirror
   area. In normal incidence optics, an effective area and its
   corresponding mirror area are essentially the same. In X-ray optics,
   however, the two differ by more than two orders of magnitude. For
   example, in terms of mass per unit mirror area, or mirror areal
   density, the Astro-E mirrors have only 0.4 kg/m^2, Chandra 38 to 58
   kg/m^2, and XMM-Newton 3.8 to 8.5 kg/m^2, depending on the radius of
   the mirror), assuming that the mirror assembly would take up 3,000 kg.
   This is about half that of the Astro-E telescopes, namely, 250 kg/m^2.
   Astro-E telescopes represent the state of the art circa 2000 in X-ray
   telescope mass per unit effective area. The second issue here is the
   angular resolution requirement. Astro-E telescopes have an angular
   resolution of 90" HPD (half-power-diameter), far from meeting the
   Generation-X requirement. A significant amount of investment is needed
   for improving the angular resolution of such light weight X-ray
   telescopes. On the other hand, the mirror assembly on Chandra has an
   angular resolution of 0.5" which more or less meets our requirement
   here, but its mass per unit effective area is a whopping 10,000 kg/m^2,
   a factor of 80 larger than our requirement. Table 1 lists the telescope
   characteristics of some recent X-ray mirror assemblies. They each
   represent the state of the art in their own right. What Generation-X
   requires is for us to synthesize the advantages of each of these mirror
   assemblies. The third issue is the production cost. Here again we will
   have to come up with more efficient and perhaps radically new means of
   making mirrors that should reduce the cost per unit effective area by
   an order of magnitude.

   Second is detector technology. The main challenge here is the large
   area required to cover the focal plane, given the large plate scale as
   a result of the long focal length. With a 100 m focal length, to cover
   a 30' x 30' would require 85 x 85 cm^2 of detector area. On the other
   hand, the requirement on position resolution is relatively lax. For an
   angular resolution of 0.1", the pixel size amounts to 48 mm, which can
   be easily met by existing CCD technology.

   Detector energy resolution is another important issue. Given the
   inefficient use of photons by grating spectrometers, it is extremely
   important for us to utilize non-dispersive detectors like CCDs and
   microcalorimeters. As mentioned above, CCD can certainly meet the
   position resolution requirement. Developments in CCD technology over
   the next decade or so may also enable it to meet the large area
   requirement. It would be difficult for CCDs to meet the energy
   resolution requirement. Our best hope is probably a position sensitive
   microcalorimeter which is being developed (Figueroa-Feliciano et al.
   2000). It is expected that in the next decade or so, packaging problems
   related to the calorimeter technology will be solved so as to make
   large arrays of absorbers possible.

   Third is the issue of "optical bench." By an optical bench, we do not
   necessarily mean the conventional rigid and thermally stable structure
   that connects the mirror assembly and the detector system. It is
   entirely possible, indeed, likely, that for Generation-X, we will have
   to accept some rather flexible optical bench whose function is to
   tether the mirror assembly with the detector system. Accurate relative
   attitudes and position between the mirror assembly and the detector
   system need to be monitored in real time by independent attitude
   control and monitoring systems. The "optical bench" has to be light and
   stable enough to minimize the burden of the attitude control and
   monitoring system.
   important to be able to study composition and measure redshifts
   directly from the X-ray spectrum. As such an energy resolving power of
   several hundred to one thousand should be required.
