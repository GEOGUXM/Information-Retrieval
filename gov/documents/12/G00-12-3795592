   Animal bioacoustics, often called simply bioacoustics, is the study of
   sound in non-human animals. It includes within its scope
     * animal communication and associated behavior
     * sound production anatomy and neurophysiology of animals
     * auditory capacities and auditory mechanisms of animals
     * instrumental sonar: use in population assessment, identification,
       and behavior
     * effects of human-made noise on animals

   call. Bioacousticians study the structure of its species-typical
   phonology, mechanisms of sound production and perception, and learning
   of calls within social groups. Photo courtesy of Stephen Nowicki, Duke
