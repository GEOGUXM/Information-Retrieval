   The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) is developing a coral
   reef data and information management system that will integrate
   biological data from reef ecosystem monitoring and research programs
   with interrelated chemical, biological and physical data of surrounding
   marine areas. These data include, inter alia, quantitative and
   descriptive biology of coral reef taxa and communities, including
   measurements of their occurrences, numbers, life stages, pathology,
   productivity, and nonbiological measurements, e.g., sea water
   chemistry, turbidity, temperature, salinity, currents, bio- optical
   data, and substratum features. The central database will include data
   from in situ measurements, laboratory studies, remote-sensed data, and
   digital videotapes andphotographs.

   Image of Carribean anemone The system will be used to 1) archive and
   curate historical and newly acquired data; 2) make information readily
   available to national and international partners, reef managers,
   scientists, and the public; and 3) provide a scientific basis for
   management of reefs.
   Image of Caribbean reef This web page is an introduction to NODC's work
   with data and information on coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove
   habitats. The primary emphasis is on data and data products. While a
   relational database is under development, we will make select data
   files accessible in originators' formats through this web site. Links
   are provided to other sites that contain data and data products of
   interest to the coral reef community.
   Image of reef life We encourage holders of data on these ecosystems to
   submit a copy (along with complete metadata) on computer-compatible
   media or via FTP to the NODC, where they will be preservedfor present
   and future generations. To submit comments or request more information,
   please contact the NODC coral reef team lead by clicking here or
   through the menu bar on the left of the screen. We particularly ask
   scientists for any corrections for the geographical coordinates of the
   coral reefs listed. This web site will be continually updated as data
   and information become available.
   Image of Hawaiian anemone Initial emphasis will be on U.S. coral reefs
   in Hawaii, the Pacific American Flag Islands, the Florida Keys, and
   adjacent sites (Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
   Islands). NODC plans also to acquire and make available coral reef
   ecosystem data from international sources.
