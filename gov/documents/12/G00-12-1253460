   What is FE-MAIL?

   The Commission has embarked upon an ambitious project which will help
   to inform women of initiatives and issues facing Erie County. The first
   step in this project is to create a list of women's email addresses
   (FE-MAIL).

   FE-MAIL is an information service available to women who "subscribe" by
   submitting their email addresses to the Commission. FE-MAIL subscribers
   will receive periodic emails containing announcements of upcoming
   community events and website updates. The Commission will secure the
   name of FE-MAIL subscribers and will not share or sell the addresses to
   outside groups, agencies or other FE-MAIL subscribers. See Privacy
   Policy & Code of Conduct.

   Subscribing to FE-MAIL is free.

   Signing Up With the Fe-mail

   To place your name into our FE-MAIL list, just send us an email at
   fe-mail@bflo.co.erie.ny.us.
