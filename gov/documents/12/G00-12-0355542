     NCI plans, promotes, and carries out an ambitious program of
     disease-specific research, charting its course through advice from
     expert Progress Review Groups (PRGs). The PRGs are panels of 20 to
     30 prominent members of the scientific, medical, and advocacy
     communities that assess the state of the science for a single type
     of cancer or group of closely related cancers and make
     recommendations for future research.

     Over a nine-month period, each PRG identifies gaps in our
     understanding of the diseases under study, barriers to progress, and
     key research priorities. The process culminates in the release of
     PRG findings and priorities in a comprehensive report. PRG reports
     become road maps that guide NCI and the scientific community in
     their efforts to make progress against specific types of cancer.

     NCI's extensive slate of PRGs includes breast, prostate, colorectal,
     brain, pancreatic, and lung cancers as well as groupings of cancers
     such as gynecologic cancers; leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma; kidney
     and bladder cancers; and stomach and esophageal cancers.
