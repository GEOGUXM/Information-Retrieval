   TOOL TESTING



























   Updated on: 2001-06-19

   NIST was originally selected to perform this work for three major
   reasons:
    1. NIST is a neutral organization without ties to law enforcement, so
       our objectives are purely research oriented.
    2. NIST has substantial experience in providing data that has been
       vetted and verified using several techniques.
    3. NIST has substantial experience in rigorous conformance testing of
       software.

   In addition, the RDS cross-references file hash values from several
   products that are available in the marketplace. This allows users to
   select a specific set of data from the RDS to match products that are
   being used in specific computer forensics laboratories. To our
   knowledge, the RDS does not duplicate efforts of other organizations
   since none of the products available provides more than one or two hash
   values, and none provides the SHA-1 hash value.
