                     AIRCRAFT DISINSECTION REQUIREMENTS

   Disinsection is permitted under international law in order to protect
   public health, agriculture and the environment. The World Health
   Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization
   stipulate two approaches for aircraft disinsection--either spray the
   aircraft cabin, with an aerosolized insecticide, while passengers are
   on board or treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual
   insecticide (residual method) while passengers are not on board. Panama
   and American Samoa have adopted a third method, in which aircraft are
   sprayed with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are not on
   board.

   Although the Report of the Informal Consultation on Aircraft
   Disinsection sponsored by the World Health Organization (November 6-10,
   1995) concluded that aircraft disinsection, if performed appropriately,
   would not present a risk to human health, the report also noted that
   some individuals may experience transient discomfort following aircraft
   disinsection by aerosol application.

   Although few countries now require that aircraft be disinsected, most
   countries reserve the right to do so, and, as such, could impose a
   disinsection requirement should they perceive a threat to their public
   health, agriculture or environment. Accordingly, travelers are advised
   to check with their travel agent or airline reservations agent when
   booking flights. Listed below are representatives of airlines who are
   knowledgeable on disinsection requirements:
