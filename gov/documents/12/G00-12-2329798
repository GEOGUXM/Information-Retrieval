   FSL produces a wide variety of data products useful in meteorological
   research and operations.

                              On-Line Databases

   RAOB database
          recent worldwide RAOB observations. RAOBs over North America
          from 1947-1997, assembled by FSL, are available on CD-ROM (from
          NOAA's Virtual Data System - NVDS).

   National Precipitation Data
          hourly data for the past 30 days (Java applet)

   Wind and temperature reports from commercial aircraft (ACARS) for the
          last 30 days (restricted)
          see our aircraft data page

                        Retrospective data on CD-ROM

   Hourly Precipitation Dataset (HPD)
          hourly precipitation data (HPD) from United States observing
          sites during the period 1948 to June 1998

   Radiosonde Data
          North American radiosonde data since 1946

                               Real-Time Data

   NOAA Profiler Network Real-Time Data Display
          vertical profiles of horizontal wind speed and direction

   Surface Observations
          data from METAR sites and various Mesonets throughout North
          America and Hawaii (Java applet)

   Surface Observation Quality Control Messages
          hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly text messages for various
          surface observing networks

   Real-Time Verification System (RTVS)
          real-time assessment of the quality of both human- and
          model-generated forecasts of icing, turbulence, ceiling and
          visibility, convection, and precipitation

                  Real-time and Archived Data Subscriptions

   MADIS Data Access
          FTP and LDM access to FSL real-time and archived radiosonde,
          profiler, aircraft, and surface observations (including over
          3500 mesonet stations) are available from the Meteorological
          Assimilation Data Ingest System.
