   CIP's Climate-Weather Impact Updates and related information and links.


     Since August of 1998, the CIP has produced summaries of Climate-Weather
     impacts as reported in the media, situation reports, and agency
     updates. These are archived on the website, made available in via
     e-mail, and generally updated once or twice per week. The impacts
     section of the website also contains links to various impact reporting
     sites and databases.

     NEW- In collaboration with CRED, the CIP now provides a variety of ways
     to link its current reports to contextual and historical disaster
     information. View the impact reports directly, or view the CIP's page
     to search the CRED EM-DAT disaster database to retrieve a variety of
     graphs and tables.

     (Please note, that we are currently entering previous updates into the
     CIP archive, therefore, the archive is not yet complete, but current
     updates, as well as links to other databases are available.)

   Link to information on RANET and CIP's role in the activity.
     RANET is an effort of several partners to make climate and weather
     related information more accessible throughout the world. It uses a
     variety of technologies, such as digital satellite radio, as well as
     training to accomplish its goal. The CIP is a core participant in this
     activity. From the CIP you can learn more about RANET. View its
     broadcasts as mirrored online, and participate in online discussions
     about the project.

     CIP's How-What-Where section provides short, basic answers and
     instructions to commonly asked questions about accessing, finding, and
     using the various climate and weather products provided by NOAA and
     other content providers. Many links to useful products are provided
     within each guide.

     Various climatologies and links to seasonal information.
     Climatologies illustrate the "expected" or average climate over a given
     area. These are historical perspectives determined from several years
     of data and are useful for referencing seasons. (For instance
     climatologies can help determine the typical month of most rain, the
     average monthly temperature, etc.) Climatologies should not be confused
     with forecasts or recent observations.
