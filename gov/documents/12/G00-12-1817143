   King County Assessor Scott Noble Message from the King County Assessor
   As your King County Assessor, I want you to know that we continue to
   work hard to improve the overall administration of the Assessor's
   Office. We have a loyal and hardworking staff who are here to assist
   you.

   Through our Public Information Office, you may verify the
   characteristics and appraisal methods used to determine your most
   recent assessed value. Appraisers are available to answer questions and
   make corrections when necessary. Be assured, we strive to follow
   professional standards to provide an appraisal practice of uniformity
   and fairness in assessments which takes into account differences
   between properties.

   Please remember the Assessor's duties fall within the framework of
   Washington State Law. Any changes to the assessment and tax calculation
   procedure can be made only by your state legislators. We would be happy
   to direct you to your representatives in Olympia.

   Thank you, the citizens of King County, for allowing me the challenging
   and rewarding opportunity to lead the Department of Assessments in its
   mission of public service. I look forward to your comments or
   suggestions (Please include your name and phone number so we can call
   if we have problems e-mailing you.) that will allow us to continue to
   improve customer service and responsiveness.

   Scott Noble, King County Assessor
