                      Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference
                         Moves to Montana's Big Sky

   SAN FRANCISCO â€” The United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit will
   hold its annual Judicial Conference July 15-18, 2001, at the Big Sky
   Resort, near Bozeman, Montana.
   Most of the Ninth Circuit's 300 judges and many of the lawyers who
   practice in the federal courts of the western states will be attending
   the conference, which is being held in Montana for the first time. The
   theme of the event is "Romancing the West" and a variety of speakers
   and activities focusing on the role of law in settling the West are
   planned.
   Once again, two members of the United States Supreme Court will attend
   the conference. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer are
   scheduled to participate in a "Conversation with the Justices,"
   scheduled for the final day of the event.
   Other special guests include the Hon. Fern M. Smith, Director of the
   Federal Judicial Center; the Hon. Ruth V. McGregor, an associate
   justice of the Arizona Supreme Court; and U.S. Assistant Attorney
   General Viet Dinh.
   Conference speakers include Dr. Clay S. Jenkinson, a
   nationally-recognized humanities scholar from the University of Nevada.
   Dr. Jenkinson, who is renowned for first-person interpretations of
   historical figures, will present a portrait of Meriwether Lewis,
   co-leader of the Lewis and Clark expedition, which opened the Pacific
   Northwest. The program also includes a session entitled "The Supreme
   Court in Fact and Fiction," featuring writers Brad Meltzer and Richard
   North Patterson, authors of several best-seller books of fiction about
   the courts.
   Media coverage of the conference is welcome. All general sessions are
   open to the media to promote better understanding of the work of the
   court. Advanced media registration is requested. For a media
   registration form, other information or guidelines about cameras and
   recording, please contact the above office.
   By statute, the conference is convened "for the purposes of considering
   the business of the courts and advising means of improving the
   administration of justice within (the) circuit." The 2001 conference
   was organized by an executive committee headed by Circuit Judge
   Margaret M. McKeown. The conference program committee was chaired by
   Chief District Judge Michael R. Hogan of the District of Oregon.
