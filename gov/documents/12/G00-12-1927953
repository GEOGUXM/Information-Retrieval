   In order to facilitate medical care of persons affected by
   Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), the National Human Genome Research
   Insitute is supporting a series of Web pages for professionals and
   families caring for or affected by PHS. The idea for these pages
   originated at a workshop on PHS held at the NIH in 1996. At that
   meeting, professionals and family representatives described the
   then-current knowledge about the disorder, determined clinical
   diagnostic criteria, made recommendations for medical evaluation of
   affected persons and family members, and discussed research priorities.

   The contents of this web page represent the opinions of the author,
   Leslie Biesecker, and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the
   NIH, the Pallister-Hall syndrome support group, or any other
   institution to which he is affiliated. Some of the medical data on
   links 2 and 3 are from the published workshop report and reflect the
   opinions of those authors, at the time of the workshop. Medical science
   in this area is advancing rapidly; as such, information is subject to
   change on a frequent basis. All individuals consulting these pages
   should be aware of this and other limitations to gathering medical
   information on the Web.

   Pallister-Hall information sources:
    1. Bibliography of scientific and medical papers published on
       Pallister-Hall syndrome
    2. Diagnostic criteria that physicians should consider when evaluating
       a person with suspected Pallister-Hall syndrome
    3. Recommended clinical medical evaluation of persons suspected to
       have Pallister-Hall syndrome
    4. Pallister-Hall syndrome family support group
    5. Current Research on Pallister-Hall syndrome
