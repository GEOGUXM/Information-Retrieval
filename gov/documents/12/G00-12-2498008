   Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 5 of
   157 Executive Summary This sampling plan sets out the sampling goals,
   rationale, locations, and procedures for a plan to determine the extent
   of plutonium in soil above background levels in Big Trees Park and
   identify any possible pathways by which plutonium may have reached the
   park. The public is invited to witness the sampling at Big Trees Park.
   The plan has been developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and
   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists with guidance
   from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Radiologic Health
   and Environmental Health Investigations Branches of the California
   Health Services Department (CDHS-RHB and CDHS-EHIB), and the Agency for
   Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Input from citizens and
   community organizations was also received during an over-70- day public
   comment period. Background Plutonium was discovered in Big Trees Park
   in 1993 when the EPA was checking background plutonium values in the
   vicinity of LLNL. Only one soil sample collected at one location in the
   park definitively contained plutonium at a greater concentration than
   would have been expected from global fallout alone and at about 40% of
   the EPA's level of health concern. EPA was analyzing soil in the
   Livermore area because in 1991 LLNL had reported elevated
   concentrations of plutonium in soil in the southeast quadrant of its
   Livermore Site. In 1995, LLNL in collaboration with EPA, CDHS-RHB, the
   city, the school district, the homeowners association and Tri-Valley
   Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment, collected additional soil
   samples from Big Trees Park to verify the 1993 finding. After this 1995
   sampling, the EPA concluded that the plutonium was below the
   preliminary remediation goal (PRG), presented no health hazard, and
   required no further action. A draft health consultation prepared by
   CDHS-EHIB suggested sampling the park at greater depths than those
   sampled in 1995. LLNL volunteered to do so and to work with the
   regulatory agencies to assure that public concerns were met. Big Trees
   Park Big Trees Park is a 4.23-acre public park in the city of Livermore
   administered by the Livermore Area Recreation and Park District (LARPD)
   located about 1 kilometer west of LLNL. The park was initially
   constructed in 1971 and another 1.3 acres were added July 31, 1998
   Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 6 of
   157 in 1986. The original portion of the park is triangular in shape
   and bordered by Kathy Way on the south, by the concrete-lined Arroyo
   Seco on the northeast, and Arroyo Seco Elementary School on the
   northwest. In 1970, the Arroyo Seco was rerouted and lined with
   concrete along the northern border of the park. The former channel was
   filled and is referred to in the plan as the "old channel." Lawrence
   Livermore National Laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a
   DOE-owned facility is operated by the University of California as a
   national resource of scientific, technical, and engineering
   capabilities. Historically, its mission has focused on weapons
   development and national security, but has broadened over the years to
   include energy, the environment, biomedicine, technology transfer, and
   education. The exact transport pathway of the plutonium to Big Trees
   Park at levels above those expected from global fallout is unknown. It
   is known that since the mid-1950s, LLNL released small quantities of
   plutonium to the sanitary sewer under strict DOE discharge limits. The
   sanitary sewage goes to the Livermore Water Reclamation Plant (LWRP)
   where it ends up in sludge after a period of time. During the early
   1960s to mid-1970s, sludge was available to the community for use as
   soil compost or amendment. It is hypothesized that sludge containing
   very small amounts of plutonium was used by volunteers, not the City or
   Park district, when planting trees in certain parts of the park during
   that period. Other hypotheses not supported by any previous sampling or
   monitoring data by LLNL and regulatory agencies is that there may have
   been rare air and water pathways from the Lab. Sample Collection
   Locations Test Potential Pathways The sampling plan divides collection
   locations into eight sets or areas: Grid (150 samples), Arroyo Seco
   Channel (7), Old Channel (3-18), Ornamental Trees (18), Special
   Sampling at the 1995 sample locations (60), Disked Area (4), Playing
   Field (10), and Big Trees Park eastern extension (15). Samples will be
   collected at a variety of depths, depending on the unique
   characteristics of each location. The locations, numbers of samples,
   and depths have been selected with guidance from the EPA, CDHS-RHB,
   CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR to assess the vertical and horizontal extent of
   plutonium and thereby attempt to identify the pathway by which
   plutonium reached the park. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big
   Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 7 of 157 Grid The sampling grid
   consists of four radial lines and eight perpendiculars, with the origin
   of the radials being close to Location 1 sampled in 1995. Location 1
   had the highest plutonium value in the analysis, although below the
   level of regulatory concern. Samples will be collected at the grid
   intersections at five depths between 0 and 40 centimeters. The
   rationale for any sampling grid is that it distributes the sampling
   locations randomly and precisely. The rationale for choosing a radial
   grid emanating from the area of highest known plutonium concentration
   is to determine the extent of the plutonium found above background in
   Big Trees Park. Arroyo Channel One soil sample will be taken at each of
   seven locations in the Arroyo Seco, six between LLNL and a location
   downstream of Big Trees Park and one upstream of LLNL. The samples will
   be collected at two depth intervals between 0 and 25 centimeters. Since
   the Arroyo Seco connects LLNL with Big Trees Park, it offers a
   potential water-borne pathway to the park. Analysis of these soil
   samples will evaluate the hypothesis of plutonium being transported
   down Arroyo Seco from LLNL in storm water. Old Arroyo Channel Soil
   samples will be collected from three locations in the old channel to
   further evaluate the water-borne hypothesis. If plutonium was carried
   down the arroyo before it was rerouted, then plutonium might still be
   present in the interface between the old channel bottom and the fill
   material. Sampling efforts will be directed toward finding the old
   channel and determining if it contains elevated levels of plutonium.
   Results will be used to evaluate the hypothesis of a past water pathway
   from LLNL to the park. Ornamental Trees Soil will be sampled at the
   bases of three ornamental trees. One of the pathway hypotheses is that
   plutonium arrived at Big Trees Park in processed sludge from the LWRP
   and was used as soil amendment to plant trees. There is no direct
   evidence that sludge was used as a soil amendment at Big Trees Park.
   Samples in this set will also be analyzed for Americium-241 because it
   is known that it was also released to the LWRP from LLNL. Sewage sludge
   also has a characteristic metals fingerprint, therefore samples from
   the ornamental trees set will be analyzed for heavy metals known to be
   concentrated by LWRP's water treatment procedures. July 31, 1998 Draft
   Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 8 of 157
   Special Sampling at 1995 Locations Ten locations will be sampled around
   Locations 1, 7, and 8 of the 1995 sampling. These locations will be
   resampled at six depth intervals between 0 and 85 centimeters, for a
   total of 60 samples. Resampling may resolve discrepancies in results
   reported by the three sampling laboratories in 1995 and provide data
   relevant to the three hypothetical pathways: air, water, and sludge.
   Disked Area The disked area is an open field in the northern portion of
   the school property next to Big Trees Park. Four samples will be
   collected at depths between 0-15 centimeters in order to assess
   distribution of plutonium in the park. Playing Field The playing field
   is an open grass field north of the school grounds proper. Samples at
   two locations will be collected at depths between 0 and 40 centimeters,
   for a total of ten samples. These results will provide data on the
   spatial distribution of plutonium in soil. Big Trees Park Eastern
   Extension The eastern extension of Big Trees was constructed
   approximately 15 years after Big Trees Park. Three samples will be
   collected between 0 and 40 centimeters. Location 13 from the 1995
   sampling was in this eastern extension. Resampling will resolve
   discrepancies in results reported by the three sampling laboratories in
   1995. Sampling and Handling Procedures Surface and shallow samples will
   be collected with a hand-held coring device. A drill rig with the
   capability of coring will be used to collect deeper samples. The actual
   type of coring device used will depend on actual field conditions.
   Sampling will be witnessed by staff from LLNL and at least one
   regulatory agency. It will also be documented with photographic and
   video records. The exact location of all samples will be determined
   through use of a global positioning satellite system. Every sample will
   be split into at least two portions: one for analysis and one to be
   archived. Some will be split into three or four samples depending on
   whether a field replicate and samples for ATSDR or EPA are required.
   Quality control samples will be collected at approximately 10% of the
   sample locations. Chain of custody and field July 31, 1998 Draft Final
   Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 9 of 157 tracking
   forms will be maintained for all samples. The public is invited to
   witness the sampling activity. Sample Analysis Sample analyses will be
   performed by a certified analytical laboratory. Plutonium analyses will
   be performed using a measuring device called an alpha spectrometer that
   detects that the alpha particles associated with the radioactive decay
   of plutonium. Americium-241 analysis will be performed by directly
   analyzing the soil on a gamma spectrometer. Metals (chromium, copper,
   lead, nickel and zinc) samples will be analyzed using atomic adsorption
   spectroscopy. The sample size and analytical methods have been chosen
   to ensure that the detection limit (or level of sensitivity) is low
   enough to be able to distinguish whether the samples are elevated with
   respect to the background concentration of the constituent. Responses
   to Public Comments The first draft of the Livermore Big Trees Park 1998
   Soil Sampling Plan was published April 10, 1998 and offered to the
   regulating agencies and public for comment. Organizations and private
   citizens commented for the record. Comments covered all aspects of the
   plan, but editorial quality, sampling locations and depths, history,
   analytes, and data interpretation were the categories that attracted
   the most comments. Suggestions were made that the document be more
   transparent to the lay reader, that other locations and depths be
   sampled, that more chemical elements be analyzed for, and that
   alternative methods be used to interpret the results. All of the
   comments and responses to the April 10 plan are addressed in this
   document. Supplemental Information Six appendices contain the following

   Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 11 of 157 1. Introduction
   This sampling plan describes the methodology to be used in the
   evaluation of plutonium (Pu) concentrations above background in
   Livermore's Big Trees Park. It was designed by the U.S. Department of
   Energy (DOE) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
   scientists under the direction and oversight of the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency, Region IX (EPA) and the California Department of
   Health Services - Radiologic Health Branch (CDHS-RHB), under the
   authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act (CERCLA). This plan and the associated sampling and
   analyses represent LLNL's voluntary response to community concerns
   voiced on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
   (ATSDR)/CDHS Environmental Health Investigations Branch (CDHS- EHIB)
   February 1998 draft Public Health Consultation (PHC). Elevated
   concentrations of plutonium were found in Big Trees Park in separate
   sampling events conducted by the EPA and LLNL in 1993 and 1995,
   respectively. EPA found no cause for health concerns or further action
   at that time. This sampling plan addresses Recommendation 1 of the
   draft PHC: "CDHS and ATSDR recommend further sampling of Big Trees Park
   and the Arroyo Seco Creek sediments to determine the vertical extent of
   Pu-239 contamination." In addition, the plan also sets out guidelines
   for acquiring the data to evaluate the three pathways discussed in the
   Health Consultation (i.e., sewage sludge, water-borne/arroyo
   distributions, and aerial distribution). 1.1. Background Big Trees Park
   is a Livermore Area Recreation and Park District (LARPD) park located
   approximately 1 km west of the LLNL Livermore Site (Figure 1). In 1993,
   a surface soil sample from the park revealed Pu-239+240 concentrations
   greater than those expected from global fallout from atmospheric
   weapons testing (NAREL, 1994; MacQueen, 1995). In 1991, LLNL reported
   elevated levels of plutonium in the southeastern quadrant of the LLNL
   Livermore Site (DOE, 1991). In 1993, the EPA conducted a confirmatory
   soil sampling program to reevaluate the extent of plutonium in the soil
   (EPA, 1994). In the EPA's soil sampling reevaluation, they collected a
   soil sample at Big Trees Park and analyzed it for plutonium as a
   background sample. The result for Pu-239 was 0.164 picocuries per gram
   (pCi/g), which is less than EPA's Preliminary Remediation Goal (PRG) of
   2.5 pCi/g for unrestricted residential use, but above estimated global
   July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling
   Plan Page 12 of 157 fallout concentrations. The EPA recommended that
   LLNL conduct follow-up sampling in Big Trees Park to verify the 1993
   result. LLNL developed a sampling plan with input from the LARPD, local
   government officials, home owners, local school district officials, the
   EPA, and the CDHS-RHB. The follow-up sampling was conducted in January
   1995 with oversight by the EPA and the State of California (LLNL, 1995;
   MacQueen, 1995). This sampling effort also included samples from the
   Arroyo Seco Elementary School, the bottom of Arroyo Seco, and one
   sample from a nearby apartment complex. The EPA summarized these
   plutonium investigations in a 1995 Fact Sheet (Appendix A). Scale :

   13 of 157 The 1995 sampling confirmed the 1993 EPA result, and found
   higher concentrations (ranging from approximately 0.2 to 1 pCi/g) at
   four locations around the 1993 sample location (referred to
   collectively as Location 1; Figure 2). These results established that
   there was an area where Pu-239 concentrations were above background
   concentrations expected from global fallout. Locations 7 and 8 had
   plutonium concentrations between those of Location 1 and the other 1995
   locations. Location 7 was slightly above background (~0.05 pCi/g), but
   not as high as Location 1, and Location 8 was near the upper range of
   background concentrations (0.0215 pCi/g). LLNL issued a report
   summarizing the results (LLNL, 1995), and the EPA and CDHS-RHB
   concluded that no further action was necessary based on a risk
   assessment (EPA, 1995). The 1995 samples were split and analyzed by two
   labs, Lockeed Analytical Services (LAS) and EPA National Air and
   Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL), in all cases. A third lab
   (RHB) analyzed a lesser number of samples. Results from all three
   laboratories agree at the highest concentrations, but NAREL's values
   tend to disagree with results obtained by the other two laboratories at
   lower concentrations. The discussion in the previous paragraphs is
   based on the LAS and RHB results, and not the NAREL results because it
   appears that NAREL did not count the samples long enough to obtain
   accurate results In 1997, CDHS-EHIB, working under a cooperative
   agreement with ATSDR to perform a Public Health Assessment of the LLNL
   Livermore Site, evaluated the data collected in 1993 and 1995 by EPA
   and LLNL. Their draft report stated: "ATSDR has concluded that Pu-239
   found in surface soil at Big Trees Park is below a level of health
   concern." However, the report also recommended that additional sampling
   and analyses be performed. The report was released in February 1998 at
   a CDHS/Community/ATSDR Site Team meeting. At that meeting, several
   community members expressed opinions that additional sampling should be
   performed at Big Trees Park so that the community could better
   understand the source, extent, and risk associated with the plutonium
   detected in the park. In March 1998, DOE/LLNL volunteered to collect
   additional samples in Big Trees Park to respond to community concerns.
   In April 1998, DOE/LLNL released a draft sampling plan with design
   guidance from EPA and CDHS-RHB. This draft plan was released to the
   Livermore community, the ATSDR Site Team, CDHS, EPA, the California
   Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), ATSDR, and the Bay Area
   Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) for review and comment.
   Comments on the plan were received until June 22, 1998, 71 days after
   the release of the draft. DOE/LLNL have collaborated closely with EPA
   and CDHS to ensure that all comments are adequately addressed. July 31,

   Related to this Sampling Plan LLNL's Livermore Site was added to EPA's
   National Priority List (NPL) in 1987, and DOE, EPA, DTSC, and RWQCB
   entered into a CERCLA Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) in 1988. The FFA
   identified DOE as the party responsible for the assessment and cleanup
   of soil and ground water contamination resulting from DOE activities at
   the site. EPA, DTSC, and the RWQCB are the regulatory agencies tasked
   with oversight and approval of the cleanup. ATSDR is mandated by
   Congress to investigate the past and present health effects of
   facilities on the National Priority List. These investigations include
   review of existing local public health data, facility release data, and
   environmental monitoring data. The results of the investigation of a
   facility are published in a report called a public health assessment.
   At a facility with several possible public health issues, each
   individual issue is evaluated in a document called a public health
   consultation (PHC). In both the public health assessment and the
   consultation process, ATSDR only reviews existing data. If additional
   data is needed or an action is recommended, the party responsible for
   the CERCLA site cleanup may be required to implement the actions with
   oversight and approval of the cognizant regulatory agencies (EPA and
   state and local agencies for the LLNL Livermore Site). Any actions
   undertaken are subject to the requirements of CERCLA. The current ATSDR
   public health assessment process began at LLNL in 1992, and the first
   PHC was published in draft in February 1998 (CDHS/ATSDR, 1998).
   DOE/LLNL's decision to perform additional sampling was a proactive
   response to the draft PHC recommendation that additional assessment be
   performed in Big Trees Park. This sampling plan has been prepared
   following protocols and procedures to meet strict EPA standards,
   including Quality Assurance, sampling, and analytical procedures. DTSC
   and RWQCB have delegated their authority for approval to CDHS-RHB. This
   Draft Final sampling plan is the result of discussions between LLNL,
   DOE, EPA, CDHS- RHB, CDHS-EHIB and ATSDR and input from citizens and
   community organizations. 1.3. Purpose As a result of the investigations
   undertaken to date, three hypotheses have been advanced to explain
   elevated plutonium concentrations in Big Trees Park. These are the
   water-borne/arroyo pathway hypothesis, the sludge pathway hypothesis,
   and the airborne pathway hypothesis (Section 3.1). July 31, 1998 Draft
   Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 16 of 157
   As discussions with EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR progressed, the
   following sampling plan objectives emerged: 1. Collect data intended to
   distinguish between the water-borne/arroyo pathway, the sludge pathway,
   and the airborne pathway hypotheses. 2. Assess the extent of
   contamination in terms of both surface area and vertical depth. 3.
   Collect some special purpose samples targeted at areas of interest.
   Although further risk assessment is not specified in this plan, the
   results can be used for this purpose. Results of this effort will be
   used by regulatory agencies to determine if additional action is
   warranted. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil
   Sampling Plan Page 17 of 157 2. Big Trees Park History 2.1. Physical
   Description Big Trees Park is a 4.23-acre public park located in the
   City of Livermore, about 1 km west of the LLNL Livermore Site. The park
   was initially constructed in 1971, and although it is owned by the City
   of Livermore, it is administered by the Livermore Area Recreation and
   Park District (LARPD). The chronology of events at Big Trees Park,
   beginning with the acquisition of the land by the City of Livermore is
   summarized in Table 1. A similar table of potential pertinent LLNL
   environmental impacts is presented in Appendix B. The park is
   triangular in shape (Figure 2) and is bordered on the south by Kathy
   Way, on the northeast by the concrete-lined Arroyo Seco channel, and on
   the northwest by Arroyo Seco Elementary School. The eastern corner of
   the park is located at the intersection of Charlotte Way and Kathy Way.
   A turfed playing field and an unmaintained disked area are located in
   the northern portion of the park. East from the main body of Big Trees
   Park, across Charlotte Way, is an eastern extension of Big Trees Park,
   which was constructed in 1986. This rectangular 1.3-acre extension is
   zoned for open space. The extension is bordered by the south bank of an
   unlined portion of Arroyo Seco. As discussed in Section 1.3, the three
   primary pathways to be evaluated are the water- borne/arroyo pathway,
   the sludge pathway, and the airborne pathway. The water- borne pathway
   hypothesis considers the possibility that sediments excavated from the
   arroyo, which at one time may have carried water containing plutonium,
   were spread around the park during construction. The sludge hypothesis
   considers that sewage sludge containing plutonium was used as a soil
   amendment when ornamental trees bordering the northern boundary of the
   park were planted. The airborne hypothesis considers deposition from
   resuspension or emissions. 2.2. Soil from the Arroyo The Arroyo Seco
   carries seasonal storm water runoff from the foothills on the eastern
   side of the Livermore Valley toward the west. It passes through the
   southwest corner of LLNL and continues downstream toward and along the
   northern edge of Big Trees Park. Some LLNL storm water runoff
   discharges into Arroyo Seco via the storm sewer July 31, 1998 Draft

   develops a sampling plan with the cognizant regulatory agencies and
   stakeholder input. system. The Arroyo Seco channel between LLNL and Big
   Trees Park has flowing water for relatively short periods of time
   during and shortly after significant rainfall events but is dry for
   most of the year (Lunn, 1998). Water flow can be substantial after
   major storm events, which have been more frequent the last few years
   (including the 1997- 1998 rainy season). LLNL staff have observed large
   volumes of water flowing during winter storms. Records of flood events
   in Arroyo Seco are not maintained, so definitive information about past
   overflows is not available. Flooding is rare according to
   unsubstantiated oral history. Erosion of the banks at various locations
   within the channel between LLNL and Big Trees Park has been observed.
   The degree of erosion is variable. In 1997, a portion of the channel
   between Vasco Road and Big Trees Park was realigned about five feet to
   the south. During this realignment, the affected portion of the arroyo
   channel bottom was disturbed. During residential development of the
   area in the early 1970s, a portion of the old arroyo channel was
   rerouted and lined with concrete. According to tract development
   blueprints, the old channel, which is now on the Arroyo Seco Elementary
   School grounds, was filled prior to the establishment of Big Trees Park
   in 1971. The section of the old arroyo under Charlotte Way and Kathy
   Way was filled in 1971. There is no LARPD record of when the old arroyo
   channel through the park was filled (Ingledue, 1998). CDHS-EHIB
   hypothesize that the elevated level of plutonium found in the 1995 Big
   Trees Park samples may have arrived in soil excavated from the arroyo
   during the channel realignment and later used in the park as fill
   material (CDHS, 1998). A review of the City's engineering drawings and
   the aerial photos of the park and arroyo indicate July 31, 1998 Draft
   Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 20 of 157
   that the volume of material excavated from the old arroyo was probably
   fairly small. A larger source of fill would have been available from
   the grading activities elsewhere throughout Big Trees Park and the
   development of the adjacent housing tract. Alameda County Flood Control
   and Water Conservation District Zone 7 (Zone 7) assumed title to the
   concrete-lined section of the channel in 1971, and staff report that
   essentially no maintenance has been required of this section. Zone 7
   has conducted brush and vegetation removal from the portion adjacent to
   the Big Trees Park eastern extension. 2.3. Sludge Use at Big Trees Park
   Big Trees Park is named for the large eucalyptus trees that are located
   throughout the park, the school, and Big Trees Park eastern extension.
   These trees were growing along the arroyo before the housing tract,
   school, and parks were developed. Big Trees Park was initially
   constructed between April and June 1971 (Ingledue, 1997). According to
   the LARPD terms, no imported fill or soils other than fertilizer were
   to be used in installing the irrigation system and turf. No ornamental
   trees were planted by the LARPD contractor in 1971 along the south side
   of the arroyo channel in the vicinity of the area identified in 1995 as
   being the site of elevated plutonium concentrations. Trees adjacent to
   the south side of the concrete-lined section of the arroyo can be seen
   on aerial photographs by 1975. While it is clear that the LARPD
   intended that no soil amendments be used in planting in the park,
   volunteers may have planted trees in the park along the arroyo using
   sanitary sewer sludge containing low levels of plutonium from the
   Livermore Water Reclamation Plant (LWRP) as a soil amendment July 31,

   21 of 157 3. Sampling Strategy Sampling strategy is based on choosing
   sampling locations and analytes that will provide data to satisfy the
   objectives of the sampling plan. Samples are to be collected at
   locations and depths that are believed to be unique to a particular
   pathway. 3.1. Sampling to Determine Contaminant Pathway Knowing how
   plutonium got to Big Trees Park is not only important for historical
   reasons, but also provides reassurance that the pathway is no longer
   active. As discussed in Section 1.3, two primary hypotheses have been
   identified to explain the existence of elevated plutonium
   concentrations in Big Trees Park (Location 1): the water- borne/arroyo
   pathway hypothesis and the sludge pathway hypothesis (Sections 3.1.1
   and 3.1.2, respectively). The aerial hypothesis is not a major element
   of the plan; however, some of the samples collected will aid in the
   evaluation of this hypothesis (Section 3.1.3). The sampling plan is
   summarized in Table 2. 3.1.1. Water-Borne/Arroyo Pathway One way that
   traces of low-level plutonium might have reached Big Trees Park was by
   water-borne sediments carried from LLNL down the Arroyo Seco, which
   cuts across the southwestern corner of the LLNL site. Low-level
   plutonium contamination in the southeastern portion of the Livermore
   Site was first documented by LLNL in 1983 (Buerer, 1983). The
   activities responsible for the contamination occurred between 1962 and
   1976. The possibility of water-borne mobilization of contaminated
   sediments from the southeastern portion of the site was proposed in the
   CDHS/ATSDR Public Health Consultation. 3.1.1.1. Hypothesis According to
   this hypothesis, plutonium was transported from LLNL to Big Trees Park
   by the following sequence of events: 1. Surface water containing
   plutonium-contaminated sediment from the southeastern portion of LLNL
   entered Arroyo Seco via a storm sewer outlet in the southwest corner of
   LLNL. 2. The sediment was carried downstream approximately one-third
   mile to the area of Big Trees Park and deposited when the water
   receded. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil

   Soil Sampling Plan Page 23 of 157 3. As part of the residential
   development of the area, a portion of the arroyo was rerouted into a
   concrete channel, and the banks of other parts of the arroyo were
   graded to make them less steep. 4. Excess soil from the bank
   improvements (including sediments containing plutonium left behind by
   receding water) was distributed in the park during grading operations.
   It is uncertain whether the bank improvements of Steps 3 and 4 took
   place, and if so, when and where. The arroyo was rechanneled in 1970
   (Table 1). Sample locations unique to this pathway are the arroyo
   channel bottom and the park areas nearest the arroyo. Sampling in these
   locations is described in more detail in Sections 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.1.3.
   3.1.1.2. Sampling in the Current Arroyo Channel In the draft plan,
   sampling was proposed for the arroyo banks. However, as a result of
   discussions with EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR, it was decided
   not to sample the banks, and instead take more samples at the Big Trees
   Park eastern extension. The current arroyo channel is unique to the
   water-borne/arroyo pathway, so samples will be collected in the current
   arroyo channel. 3.1.1.2.1. Sampling Rationale Substantial erosion of
   the current arroyo channel has occurred over the past few years.
   Indirect evidence for the water-borne/arroyo pathway would be obtained
   if there is evidence of plutonium-contaminated sediment in the arroyo.
   3.1.1.2.2. Sample Locations The current channel will be sampled at 7
   locations (Figure 3): * Two locations between the storm sewer outlet
   and the surveillance monitoring location to compare the results with
   historical surveillance monitoring data. * One location upstream of
   Sandia National Laboratory. * Two locations upstream of the concrete
   channel near the eastern extension of Big Trees Park. * Two locations
   downstream of the concrete channel. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore

   during negotiations among DOE/LLNL, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, EPA, and
   ATSDR. For all channel locations, the precise locations of the arroyo
   samples will be points where sediment deposition appears to be the
   greatest, within roughly ± 3 meters of the pre-selected sampling
   locations. The sampling location may be in the center of the channel,
   or to one side, depending on where the sediment deposition appears
   greatest. Final sampling location decisions will be made in the field
   at the time of sampling. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees
   Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 25 of 157 3.1.1.2.3. Sample Depths
   Upstream (east) of Vasco Road, sediment samples in the current arroyo
   will be collected at 05 cm, consistent with 1995 sampling and the
   recent LLNL surveillance monitoring (1993present). At the two locations
   downstream of Big Trees Park and the two locations near the eastern
   extension of the park, sediment samples will be collected from 0-25 cm
   to determine if older sediments may still be present that contain
   plutonium. 3.1.1.2.4. Analytes Samples will be analyzed for Pu-238 and
   Pu-239+240 to determine if this pathway is an explanation of why
   elevated plutonium has been detected at Location 1. 3.1.1.2.5. Data
   Analysis and Interpretation Data will be compared to historical
   surveillance monitoring data. If Pu-239+240 concentrations within or
   above the range of Location 1 concentrations (0.164 to 1 pCi/g) are
   observed in the arroyo channel, then the water-borne/arroyo pathway
   hypothesis is plausible. If Pu-239+240 concentrations are below the
   Location 1 range, but the average concentration is consistently above
   annual surveillance monitoring results for the arroyo, the
   water-borne/arroyo channel hypothesis is possible but additional
   pathways (air) need to be considered. 3.1.1.3. Sampling in the Old
   Arroyo Channel Another area that is unique to the water-borne/arroyo
   pathway hypothesis is the portion of the channel that was filled in
   1970 and is now under a portion of the school property. 3.1.1.3.1.
   Sampling Rationale If plutonium was in the channel sediments when the
   old arroyo was filled, sampling of the buried old arroyo channel
   sediments could provide evidence for this pathway. 3.1.1.3.2. Sample
   Locations Three locations will be sampled from the old arroyo channel.
   The number of locations and samples was determined in discussions among
   DOE/LLNL, EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR. In order to collect
   these samples, the following steps will be taken. July 31, 1998 Draft
   Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 26 of 157
   1. Locate the old arroyo channel. LLNL surveyors used the tract grading
   plan to locate the channel in May 1998. 2. Select three locations along
   the old arroyo channel to sample (Figure 4). Location distances are
   measured from the northernmost extent of the surveyed old arroyo
   channel, and depths of the former arroyo are estimated based on the
   original grading plan (Galloway and Associates)(Table 3). Legend

   reach at least 45 cm below the estimated fill/sediment boundary (Figure
   5). 4. Geologists from LLNL and the EPA will attempt to identify the
   fill/sediment boundary, based on the recovered cores. Identification is
   described in Appendix C: Field Sampling Procedures. Although the former
   channel/fill interface was apparent in a test borehole, there is no
   guarantee that the interface will be detected in the new boreholes.
   3.1.1.3.3. Sample Depth Intervals Depths to the old arroyo channel at
   the three sampling locations is presented in Table 3. If the
   fill/sediment interface is identified, a sample will be collected from
   the first 0-5 cm below the contact. If the fill sediment boundary is
   not identified, six 15-cm segments centered over the estimated depth of
   the former channel bottom will be sampled to bracket the old sediment
   layer (Figure 5). Table 3. Distances of locations and depths of samples

   of elevated plutonium at Location 1. 3.1.1.3.5. Data Analysis and
   Interpretation If Pu-239+240 concentrations within or above the range
   of Location 1 concentrations are observed in the old arroyo channel
   samples, then the water-borne/arroyo pathway hypothesis is possible.

   section of the old channel showing the original channel bed, old

   suggests that sewage sludge containing Pu-239+240 from the Livermore
   Water Reclamation Plant (LWRP) was a component of a soil amendment used
   when ornamental trees were planted in Big Trees Park along Arroyo Seco.
   The probable source of plutonium in the sludge is a release to the LLNL
   sanitary sewer. Processed sewage sludge was free to the public for use
   as a soil amendment from the early 1960s to the mid 1970s. This has
   been confirmed by interviews with LWRP staff (CDHS/ATSDR, 1998).
   According to LWRP staff, 1 to 4 years passed from the time effluent
   entered the sewage treatment system until the sludge derived from it
   was available to the public. LLNL effluent reaching the LWRP prior to
   the 1967 release may have contained plutonium, but isotopic analyses
   were not conducted prior to 1960. All releases to the LWRP were below
   applicable regulatory limits at the time. 3.1.2.1. Hypothesis According
   to this hypothesis, plutonium was transported to Big Trees Park by the
   following sequence of events: 1. Plutonium-contaminated effluent from
   LLNL reached the LWRP. 2. Contaminated sludge became available to the
   public. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil
   Sampling Plan Page 29 of 157 3. Sludge from the LWRP was used as soil
   amendment while planting ornamental trees that run parallel to the
   concrete-lined portion of Arroyo Seco along the northern edge of Big
   Trees Park. 4. While trees were being planted, some sludge could have
   been spilled on the surface, and piles of sludge may have been
   stockpiled in the park near the trees for use as the amendment.
   3.1.2.2. Sampling Rationale The sampling locations unique to this
   hypothesis are the holes, or tree wells, in which the trees were
   planted, and to a lesser extent the surface area near the trees.
   3.1.2.3. Sampling Locations A variety of approaches were considered for
   selecting which trees to sample. After discussions with EPA, CDHS-RHB,
   CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR, it was decided to select three trees thought
   likely to have been planted during the appropriate time period. Trees
   near Location 1 that contains elevated concentrations of plutonium are
   obvious candidates, and a 1975 aerial photograph indicates that trees
   are present in the vicinity of Location 1. A drill rig will be
   positioned as close to a tree as possible to collect soil samples from
   the old tree well. Logistical factors, such as the locations of limbs
   and roots, will determine the exact position of the drill rig and will
   be determined in the field at the time of sampling (Figure 6). Paired
   with each tree well location is another location at least 1 meter
   beyond the irrigation berm that surrounds each tree. The second
   location needs to be far enough away from the tree well to not have
   been affected by soil amendment possibly introduced to the subsurface
   during tree planting. Following these general guidelines, the location
   will be precisely located in the field. 3.1.2.4. Sample Depth Intervals
   At each location (both inside and outside the tree well), samples will
   be collected at three depths 045 cm, 4590 cm, and 90135 cm. The first
   two intervals are estimates of the depths of the holes that were
   probably dug to plant the trees. The deepest interval, 90-135 cm will
   provide a sample of soil that is believed to be beneath the depth of
   the tree well. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998

   an ornamental tree. 3.1.2.5. Analytes Samples will be analyzed for
   Pu-238 and Pu-239+240, Americium-241 (Am-241), and selected metals. If
   the source of the plutonium at Big Trees Park is sewage sludge, there
   may be additional chemical constituents of the sludge detectable in the
   tree well. Such constituents might indicate the presence of sludge if
   they are in quantities sufficiently above the background levels for
   these constituents in soil. Samples will be analyzed for Am-241 because
   it was reported to be a constituent of some LLNL sewer releases.
   Constituents that have been identified by the EPA as chemicals that are
   likely to be present in sewage sludge in a quantity sufficient to be
   regulated are arsenic, cadmium, July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big
   Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 31 of 157 chromium, copper,
   lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, and zinc. These metals were identified
   based on the results of a 1990 National Sewage Sludge Survey of 208
   publicly owned sewage treatment facilities in which sewage sludge
   samples were collected and analyzed for 412 analytes. Of these,
   chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc may be discernible from
   background at Big Trees Park. The metals may be in sludge at
   concentrations of 100 to 1,000 parts per million (ppm), leading to the
   possibility that they may be detected after they are mixed with soil
   (Raven, 1997; Logan et al., 1997; Scora et al., 1997). The values for
   these metals also are high enough that they should be distinguishable
   from metals present in other fertilizers. Further evidence that these
   may be appropriate metals to analyze is found in a study by Myers et
   al. (1976) of sludge from the LWRP that states: "Chemical content of
   the sludge was found to be within the normal range found in municipal
   sludges with some minor variations." They also reported concentrations
   of various chemicals and chemical compounds, among them, copper at 475
   ppm. Other elements reported would not necessarily be distinguishable
   from background (Myers et al., 1976). 3.1.2.6. Data Analysis and
   Interpretation If any pair of ornamental tree samples show that the
   sample from inside the tree well has a much greater concentration of
   Pu-239+240 than outside the tree well, then the sludge hypothesis is
   likely. Also, if the samples inside the tree well contain plutonium in
   the range of the 1995 Location 1 samples (0.2 to 1 pCi/g) and it's
   paired sample collected outside the tree well contains little or no
   Pu-239+240, this hypothesis is still likely. The presence of elevated
   concentrations of Am-241 in the tree wells will be considered further
   evidence of this pathway. Metal concentrations at levels typical of
   sewage sludge (Section 3.1.2.5) will confirm that sewage sludge was
   used and the presence of Pu-239+240 would confirm that the sludge was
   contaminated with plutonium. 3.1.3. Aerial Distribution Pathway Another
   pathway that has been suggested for transmission of plutonium to Big
   Trees Park is aerial distribution. The draft PHC suggested that there
   was evidence of aerial deposition in Big Trees Park. This pathway is
   now believed to be unlikely, based on the limited distribution of
   plutonium detected at the park to date and that historical surveillance
   monitoring data does not show aerial distribution patterns of plutonium
   above background offsite. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees
   Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 32 of 157 3.1.3.1. Hypothesis The
   hypothesis is that plutonium particles become airborne either by
   resuspension or emission, travel, and are deposited. 3.1.3.2. Sampling
   Rationale Evidence that this pathway has affected Big Trees Park would
   consist of elevated concentrations of plutonium throughout the park.
   However, samples collected in 1995 do not indicate elevated
   concentrations throughout Big Trees Park. In addition, downwind
   sampling east of LLNL does not show concentrations close to any of the
   elevated concentrations at Big Trees Park. Therefore, it is extremely
   unlikely that airborne deposition of such elevated levels would occur
   selectively in Big Trees Park (e.g., Location 1). For these reasons,
   sampling specific only to this hypothesis is not planned. However, 0-5
   cm results from locations other than Location 1 will be used to further
   evaluate this hypothesis. 3.1.3.3. Sampling Locations Samples at 0-5 cm
   from all locations will be used to evaluate this hypothesis. 3.1.3.4.
   Sample Depth Intervals Only surface samples (05 cm) will be used to
   evaluate the airborne pathway. 3.1.3.5. Analytes Samples will be
   analyzed for Pu-238 and Pu-239+240 to evaluate this hypothesis.
   3.1.3.6. Data Analysis and Interpretation After the extent of the area
   containing elevated plutonium concentrations in Location 1 has been
   established, the remainder of the locations can be compared with
   surveillance monitoring data collected upwind of LLNL. In general, if
   many sample locations with high concentration values are observed
   across the park, then the aerial pathway is possible. July 31, 1998
   Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 33 of
   157 3.2. Sampling to Determine Extent of Contamination The other goal
   of the sampling program it to determine the extent of plutonium
   contamination in the Location 1 area. This will be accomplished by
   establishing a sampling grid augmented with some special sampling, as
   discussed in Section 3.3. 3.2.1. Sampling Rationale The proposed sewage
   sludge pathway hypothesis suggests that contaminated sludge from the
   LWRP was used as a soil amendment during planting of the ornamental
   trees that run parallel to the concrete arroyo channel. In this case,
   the expected pattern of results is that elevated concentrations will be
   near the ornamental trees along the edge of the channel. Elevated
   concentrations could also be associated with (a) some spillage nearby
   during the planting, and/or (b) a small elevated area where a pile of
   sludge might have been stockpiled when it was delivered to the park.
   Spills are likely to be small, scattered, and near the trees. The five
   highest concentrations from the 1995 sampling were near the ornamental
   trees (Locations 1 and 7). Under this hypothesis, elevated plutonium
   concentrations should only be detected at the surface, or in the tree
   wells. The proposed water-borne/arroyo pathway hypothesis suggests that
   sediment from the arroyo was spread about by grading operations. This
   pathway would result in a somewhat random pattern of plutonium
   distribution both horizontally and vertically within the area that was
   graded. Plutonium would be more widespread than if it had arrived in
   soil amendments. The grading area is unknown, but would necessarily
   include Location 1. Because both hypotheses support elevated plutonium
   concentrations around Location 1, or among the ornamental trees,
   sampling to determine the extent of contamination consists of a
   grid-like array of sample locations focused around Location 1. Because
   concentrations detected in 1995 are much lower away from Location 1,
   the sampling locations are spaced closer together near Location 1
   (Figure 7). Shallow (0-5 cm) grid samples will also be used to evaluate
   the airborne pathway hypothesis. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore

   Sampling Locations The grid consists of four radial lines, the first of
   which is parallel to and next to the concrete-lined arroyo channel, and
   eight cross lines perpendicular to the channel. A total of 30 locations
   will be sampled on the grid. The sampling grid is depicted in Figure 7.
   July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling
   Plan Page 35 of 157 The first radial is next to the arroyo and under
   the ornamental trees because Locations 1 and 7 are next to the arroyo
   and under the ornamental trees (Location 1 had the highest plutonium
   concentrations in 1995, Location 7 had the next highest concentration;
   Figure 2). The radials extend beyond Location 8, because Location 8 had
   the third highest concentration. Moving south away from the arroyo,
   1995 Locations 4, 5, and 6 appear to be within the range of background,
   so the radials are spaced to include these locations, but do not go
   much further south. As noted earlier, there was some variability in
   results between the three laboratories analyzing the 1995 results.
   However, the laboratory that used the lower detection limit and had
   higher precision at low levels reported all of these as within
   background. These findings indicate sampling should be focused inside
   these bounds. During discussions with EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and
   ATSDR it was decided to add eight additional locations near Location 1
   to increase the sampling density (these are discussed in Section 3.3.1,
   Special Sampling). To facilitate spacing the sampling locations, these
   locations were also oriented perpendicular to the channel in the
   southeast corner of the park near Location 1. The purpose of the added
   locations is to ensure that the extent of contamination close to
   Location 1 is well defined. Distances to the sample locations are
   measured from a fixed reference point close to the intersection of
   Charlotte Way and Kathy Way. The first perpendicular is at a randomly
   selected distance from Location 1 to the southeast corner of the park.
   The next five perpendiculars between Location 1 moving west have a
   predetermined spacing, and a random starting point within the first 30
   feet of Location 1 (30 feet was chosen because Location 1 is about 30
   feet long). The predetermined spacings between these five
   perpendiculars are 20, 30, 45, and 60 feet, respectively. The gradually
   increasing spacing results in better coverage nearer to Location 1. The
   sample locations are presented in Table 4, as distances in feet
   relative to the reference point. Sample locations on the first radial
   are at the distances specified in Table 4, in the column headed
   "Distance along Radial 1 from reference point." From sample locations
   on the first radial, sample locations on the second, third, and fourth
   radials are at the distances specified in their respective columns in
   the table, measured perpendicular to the concrete arroyo channel. July

   Sample Depth Intervals DOE/LLNL, EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR
   agreed to sample five depth intervals: 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30
   cm, and 30-40 cm. 3.2.4. Analytes All samples will be analyzed for
   Pu-239+240 and Pu-238. Surface samples will also be analyzed for
   Am-241, because the sludge pathway hypothesis suggests that sludge may
   have been spilled on the surface, and Am-241 was a component of the
   sludge. 3.2.5. Data Analysis and Interpretation Initial data analysis
   will consist of inspecting the pattern of results and determining which
   of the expected patterns best matches the observed pattern (Section
   3.2.1). If the grid sample results indicate a well defined area with
   elevated plutonium concentrations, the distribution will be determined.
   These results would define the vertical and horizontal extent of
   contamination. Samples will be compared with historical background
   samples, as discussed in Appendix D: Background Data Summary. July 31,

   discussions among DOE/LLNL, EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR,
   special sampling efforts have been added to the previously discussed
   sets of samples: resampling of Locations 1, 7, and 8 from the 1995
   sampling; the disked area; the playing field; and the park's eastern

   Sampling Plan Page 38 of 157 3.3.1. Special Sampling of Locations 1, 7,
   and 8 The highest concentrations measured in 1995 were at Locations 1
   (0.2 to 1 pCi/g), 7 (0.05 pCi/g), and 8 (0.02 pCi/g). 3.3.1.1. Sampling
   Rationale This sampling is being performed at the request of the
   respective agencies, to more thoroughly characterize these particular
   locations. EPA expressed interest in deeper sampling at Location 1, the
   1995 1 pCi/g location. CDHS-EHIB expressed interest in deeper sampling
   at Locations 1, 7, and 8. 3.3.1.2. Sample Locations Two locations at
   Location 1 will be resampled as part of the eight special sample
   locations requested near Location 1. Locations 7 and 8 from the 1995
   sampling will be resampled. The 1995 sampling locations will be
   re-located using notes from the 1995 Field Tracking Forms, photographs,
   and video records of the 1995 sampling event. 3.3.1.3. Sample Depth
   Intervals Depth intervals will be 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and
   40-85 cm. The top five intervals are the same as the grid sample
   intervals. 3.3.1.4. Analytes All samples will be analyzed for
   Pu-239+240 and Pu-238. 3.3.1.5. Data Analysis and Interpretation
   Surface sample results can be compared with the 1995 results from these
   locations. Subsurface results will indicate the depth of contamination
   at these locations. 3.3.2. Special Sampling of Disked Area The disked
   area is an open field on the northeast corner of the school property,
   next to the park. This area is disked annually, presumably for weed
   abatement, but otherwise appears to be unmaintained. A nearby resident
   attending a DOE/LLNL-hosted July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big
   Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 39 of 157 presentation of the
   draft plan reported that children play in this area and suggested that
   the area be included in the sampling plan. 3.3.2.1. Sampling Rationale
   Because the disking process increases the resuspension of soil
   particles (especially at the time of disking), this area is of
   interest. 3.3.2.2. Sample Locations Four samples will be selected from
   locations, roughly equally spaced throughout the disked area. The
   number of samples and sample depths resulted from discussions among
   DOE/LLNL, EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR. 3.3.2.3. Sample Depth
   Interval After several years of disking, it can be reasonably assumed
   that soil has been thoroughly mixed. Therefore, the sample depth will
   be 0-15 cm which corresponds to the depth disked. 3.3.2.4. Analytes
   Samples will be analyzed for Pu-239+240 and Pu-238. 3.3.2.5. Data
   Analysis and Interpretation Because this is the first sampling of this
   area, the primary question is whether or not there are elevated levels
   of plutonium in this area. 3.3.3. Special Sampling of Playing Field The
   playing field is an open field behind the school grounds proper. It
   does not appear to be used by the school as a play area for recess, but
   it is accessible to children as they travel to and from school.
   Location 12 from 1995 was in this area, and all three analytical
   laboratories reported values well within the range of background
   concentrations. 3.3.3.1. Sampling Rationale CDHS-EHIB requested that
   this area be sampled again to increase the number of data points in
   this area. July 31, 1998 Draft Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil
   Sampling Plan Page 40 of 157 3.3.3.2. Sample Locations Two samples will
   be collected from random locations within this area. The number of
   samples and depths were the result of discussions among DOE/LLNL, EPA,
   CDHS- RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR. 3.3.3.3. Sample Depth Interval The
   depths for these samples will be the same as those taken on the grid:
   0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm. 3.3.3.4. Analytes
   Samples will be analyzed for Pu-239+240 and Pu-238. 3.3.3.5. Data
   Analysis and Interpretation If results agree with the 1995 result, then
   the absence of contamination in this area will be known with greater
   confidence. 3.3.4. Special Sampling of the Big Trees Park Eastern
   Extension The eastern extension of Big Trees Park was constructed in
   about 1986, approximately 15 years after Big Trees Park. It is adjacent
   to the arroyo, just upstream of where the arroyo enters the concrete
   channel east of Charlotte Way. Location 13 from the 1995 sampling was
   in this eastern extension. Two of three laboratories reported results
   well within the range of fallout. The third laboratory reported a
   result above background, but with a high degree of uncertainty. This
   area is believed to be within background concentrations. 3.3.4.1.
   Sampling Rationale CDHS-EHIB requested that this area be sampled again
   rather than sampling the banks of the arroyo as originally proposed.
   3.3.4.2. Sample Locations Three samples will be collected within this
   area, equally spaced along the length of this section of the park. The
   number of samples and the depths were the result of discussions among
   DOE/LLNL, EPA, CDHS-RHB, CDHS-EHIB, and ATSDR. July 31, 1998 Draft
   Final Livermore Big Trees Park 1998 Soil Sampling Plan Page 41 of 157
   3.3.4.3. Sample Depth Interval The depths for these samples will be the
   same as those used on the grid, 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm,
   and 30-40 cm. 3.3.4.4. Analytes Samples will be analyzed for Pu-239+240
   and Pu-238. 3.3.4.5. Data Analysis and Interpretation If results agree
   with the 1995 result, then the absence of contamination in this area
   will be known with greater confidence. July 31, 1998 Draft Final

   that will occur within Arroyo Seco are subject to Section 404 of the
   Clean Water Act. LLNL determined that the activities planned within the

   However, under this permit, the discharger (LLNL) must notify the RWQCB
   of the planned activity. The submission of this sampling plan to the
   CERCLA Remedial Project Managers serves as notification to RWQCB. LLNL
   will provide a courtesy notification to the San Francisco District of
   the Army Corps of Engineers. LLNL discussed the proposed sampling
   activities with Warden Joseph Powell of the C
