   [5.gif] Staple through the plastic to secure the fins. Bend the fins
   around the rocket so they are equally spaced. [rocket5.gif]

   You may want to bend the fins a bit to cause the rocket to spin as it
   flys.

   Also, hold the straw rocket below the fins as you prepare to launch.

   Try different fin shapes and colors to individualize your rocket.
