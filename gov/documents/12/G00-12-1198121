  NOAA Ship TOWNSEND CROMWELL Participates in Clean-up Efforts of Northern
                              Hawaiian Islands

   Diver helps to raise debris to the launch National Marine Fisheries
   Service (NMFS) Honolulu Laboratory scientists, officers and crew aboard
   the TOWNSEND CROMWELL and scientists and researchers from several other
   government agencies and private organizations participated in this
   year's clean-up efforts of the coral reefs around French Frigate Shoals
   and Kure Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

   The TOWNSEND CROMWELL's participation in the Marine Debris Removal
   cruises began in 1998. Since then, the CROMWELL has been involved with
   the removal of over 100,000 pounds of marine debris from the reefs of
   the remote NW Hawaiian Islands.

   Debris is lifted aboard the ship from the launch The marine debris is
   composed mostly of fishing gear, i.e. trawl nets, drift nets, long line
   as well as a variety of synthetic line. This debris is an entanglement
   hazard for the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, sea turtles and other
   marine life as well as a smothering hazard for the coral reef.

   The work involves an initial survey of an island's reef. The survey is
   accomplished using the ship's small boats, towing snorkelers on
   towboards along transect lines over the reefs. When marine debris is
   found, its position is noted and the debris is removed from the reef.
   The removal process involves snorkelers diving down to cut the debris
   out of the reef. SCUBA divers are used to remove the deeper debris. The
   removed debris is then loaded onto small boats which transport it to
   the ship. At the end of the cruise the ship returns to Honolulu with a
   full load of debris, which is incinerated by the municipal waste
   authority. A crane lowers debris into one of the trash dumpsters aboard
   the Cromwell

   Images and more description of the work can be found at the CROMWELL's
   "Student Connection" website: http://atsea.nmfs.hawaii.edu/cr0111a.htm
   NMFS also posted a press release about the project.
