   One of the strategic goals of the U.S. Department of Transportation
   (DOT) is to "Advance America's economic growth and competitiveness
   domestically and internationally through efficient and flexible
   transportation." In support of this goal, DOT spends more than $40
   billion a year on transportation related projects in virtually every
   community in the nation.
   The Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21) is infusing $217 billion into
   the economy to rebuild the Nation's surface transportation
   infrastructure. Another program, The Aviation Investment and Reform Act
   (AIR-21) will commit an additional $40 billion for modernization and
   stability of our nation's aviation systems. To protect the integrity of
   these and other transportation-related programs against fraud, waste,
   and abuse, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Department's
   criminal investigative element, has made investigating contract and
   grant fraud one of its top priorities.
   OIG has designated a national contract/grant fraud coordinator and
   regional specialists to coordinate fraud prevention, detection, and
   investigation efforts with DOT components such as the Federal Highway
   Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and Federal Aviation
   Administration. These specialists also coordinate efforts to combat
   contract and grant fraud with state DOT's and grantees that manage
   TEA-21, AIR-21, and other transportation related funds.
