  History of the Forum

   The Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics (Forum) was
   initially established in 1986, with the goal of bringing together
   Federal agencies that share a common interest in improving
   aging-related data.  The Forum has played a key role by critically
   evaluating existing data resources and limitations, stimulating new
   database development, encouraging cooperation and data sharing among
   Federal agencies, and preparing collaborative statistical reports.  In
   addition to the original three core agencies (National Institute on
   Aging, National Center for Health Statistics and Census Bureau), the
   organizing members of the Forum now include senior officials from the
   Administration on Aging, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,
   Bureau of Labor Statistics, Health Care Financing Administration,
   Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
   Planning and Evaluation in HHS, and Social Security Administration.

  Goals of the Forum

   The specific goals of the Forum are to improve both the quality and use
   of data on the aging population by:
     * widening access to information on the aging population through
       periodic publications and other means;
     * promoting communication among data producers, researchers, and
       public policymakers;
     * coordinating the development and use of statistical databases among
       federal agencies;
     * identifying information gaps and data inconsistencies;
     * investigating questions of data quality;
     * encouraging cross-national research and data collection on the
       aging population; and
     * addressing concerns regarding collection, access, and dissemination
       of data.

  Support of the Forum

   The Forum members provide funds and valuable staff time to support the
   activities of the Forum.
