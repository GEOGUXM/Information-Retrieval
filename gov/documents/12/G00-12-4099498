   Database of Mutations Causing Human X-Linked SCID

      [smalline.gif]

      X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID or X-SCID) is an
      immune disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene IL2RG, which
      encodes the common gamma chain ( [gamma.gif] c) of the lymphocyte
      receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and many other cytokines. A database
   of human XSCID mutations (IL2RGbase) has been assembled. Information on
   new mutations may be submitted online.
