RMA Continues Written Agreements for 2002

                 Risk Management Agency Program Announcement

   Washington, DC, January 15, 2002 - The Risk Management Agency today
   reaffirmed that it will continue to process written agreements for the
   2002 crop year. RMA is issuing this announcement to clarify its
   intentions.

   Written agreements are a means of providing insurance coverage in
   counties where insurance currently is not available for insurable crops
   or by adjusting the insurance offer outside the standard terms and
   conditions of the policy. Although a useful tool for handling atypical
   situations and conditions, problems have been identified in the use of
   written agreements.

   Since the deadlines for formally changing the insurance programs to
   reduce the need for written agreements has passed, RMA will continue to
   process such agreements under its current underwriting criteria for the
   2002 crop year. However, due to the identified problems, RMA will take
   such steps as necessary to ensure that the written agreements are in
   compliance with the current underwriting criteria and that requests for
   written agreements are not granted where losses show that the risk is
   excessive. For the 2003 crop year, the underwriting criteria will be
   revised as appropriate and undergo the expert review process.
