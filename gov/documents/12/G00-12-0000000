         POW-GEN3 will be an extremely flexible and versatile general purpose
         diffractometer useful for a wide range of structural studies. It can
         cover d-spacings from ~.5 Å or less to well over 10 Å in a single
         measurement, and is capable of collecting typical Rietveld statistics
         in ~20 minutes from a 0.6 cm^3 sample with a <0.1% resolution at short
         d-spacings and <1% resolution for nearly all d-spacings of interest.
         Alternatively, much of this resolution can be traded for intensity,
         making it possible to make measurements in << 20 minutes with still
         quite good resolution. The adjustable bandwidth-limiting choppers allow
         large variations in the incident wavelengths and pulse repetition rate.
         Insertable guide sections and the ability to trade resolution for
         intensity at the analysis stage allow users great latitude to optimize
         the data range, resolution, and statistical precision for each
         particular experiment.

         Previous TOF diffractometers used detector "banks" at a few angles,
         along with a broad wavelength range to produce a limited number of data
         sets of intensity vs. wavelength at these few effective scattering
         angles. A new idea due to Paolo Radaelli proposed the use of wide
         angular coverage and full 60-Hz operation to collect a single data set
         of intensity vs. angle and time-of-flight. This data can then be
         combined "appropriately" after-the-fact to produce a single data set
         with intensity as a function of d-spacing to be used in Rietveld
         refinement.

         This new data collection/analysis concept can be applied to any
         detector geometry. However, it appears optimally suited to a continuous
         detector locus, with this locus chosen to optimize the resolution as a
         function of d-spacing.

         Jason Hodges is the SNS instrument scientist responsible for the design
         and construction of the Powder Diffractometer. The High-Resolution
         General Purpose Powder Diffractometer (POW-GEN3) is a response to the
         November, 1998, Instrument Oversight Committee (IOC) request that:

           * "...the SNS should immediately begin work on the conceptual design
             for ... a third generation powder diffractometer with a resolution
             of ~1x10^-3 at 90°"
           * "The powder diffractometer design presented by the crystallography
             working group is truly a significant step forward."
           * "The design should incorporate out-of-plane detectors at 90° for
             special environments and the resolution should be less then 10^-3
             for all angles from back scattering to 90°."

         expected performance and design of the diffractometer:
