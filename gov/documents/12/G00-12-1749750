   The U.S. Geological Survey provides the Nation with reliable, impartial
   information to describe and understand the Earth. In California, these
   issues include natural hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, and the
   effects on water resources of population growth and industrial and
   agricultural development.

   The USGS Water Resources has the principal responsibility within the
   Federal Government to provide the hydrologic information and
   understanding needed by others to achieve the best use and management
   of the Nation's water resources.

   Links on this page reflect the often temporal nature of hydrologic
   conditions and issues in California. Sites linked under the heading
   "Current Hydrologic Conditions" address immediate or seasonal concerns
   that typically include floods, drought, or realtime streamflow.
   "Hydrologic Issues" links are usually tied to items which are in the
   news, such as MTBE and mercury contamination. We also include links to
   pages that provide background information for less immediate but
   significant water-related trends, such as the changes in water supply
   and storage that affect the growing population in southern California.
