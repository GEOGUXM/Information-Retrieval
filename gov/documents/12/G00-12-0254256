   The MAP Goal:

   A Detailed Picture of the Early Universe
   Simulated Cosmic Microwave Background Data from MAP
   (CMB image created from simulated data)

   The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the radiant heat
   left over from the Big Bang. It was first observed in 1965 by Arno
   Penzias and Robert Wilson at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray
   Hill, New Jersey. The properties of the radiation contain a wealth of
   information about physical conditions in the early universe and a great
   deal of effort has gone into measuring those properties since its
   discovery. This radiation (and by extension, the early universe) is
   remarkably featureless; it has virtually the same temperature in all
   directions in the sky.

   In 1992, NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite detected
   tiny fluctuations, or anisotropy, in the cosmic microwave background.
   It found, for example, one part of the sky has a temperature of 2.7251
   Kelvin (degrees above absolute zero), while another part of the sky has
   a temperature of 2.7249 Kelvin. These fluctuations are related to
   fluctuations in the density of matter in the early universe and thus
   carry information about the initial conditions for the formation of
   cosmic structures such as galaxies, clusters, and voids. COBE had an
   angular resolution of 7 degrees across the sky, 14 times larger than
   the Moon's apparent size. This made COBE sensitive only to broad
   fluctuations of large extent.

   The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) will make a map of the temperature
   fluctuations of the CMB radiation with much higher resolution,
   sensitivity, and accuracy than COBE. The new information contained in
   these finer fluctuations will shed light on several key questions in
   cosmology. By answering many of the current open questions, it will
   likely point astrophysicists towards newer and deeper questions about
   the nature of our universe.

   Earliest Picture of the Universe
   MAP will image the cosmic microwave background radiation, the radiant
   heat left over from the Big Bang.

   Parameters of the Universe
   Find out what cosmological parameters MAP will measure, and what they
   imply about our universe.

   Structure Formation in the Universe
   Why isn't the universe a smooth soup of particles? MAP will shed light
   on the process by which galaxies and other structures formed in the
   universe.

   First Objects in the Universe
   By viewing the CMB light scattered from ionized gas, MAP will more
   accurately deduce the epoch at which the first structures formed in the
   universe.
