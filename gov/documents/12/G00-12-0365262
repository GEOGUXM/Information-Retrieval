   The NIST-NOAA-Industry Workshop on Atmospheric Measures and Standards
   was held in Gaithersburg, Maryland on September 6-7, 2001 and was
   sponsored by the NIST Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory and
   the NOAA Office of Weather and Air Quality Research. These agencies,
   both within the U.S. Department of Commerce, have non-regulatory roles
   to provide fundamental technical measurements, standards, and air
   quality monitoring in support of the U.S. economy. Services include the
   provision of definitive measurement traceability mechanisms (standard
   reference materials, standard reference data, calibrations), air
   quality measurements, monitoring networks, and atmospheric models and
   forecasts. NIST and NOAA services are integral to the sound science
   needed by the Nation to effectively engage atmospheric issues.

   The atmosphere, and the measurement issues associated with the
   atmosphere, have changed since fundamental measurement needs were last
   identified decades ago. The chemical composition of the atmosphere -
   locally and globally - has been altered by new and increasing numbers
   of emission sources, new fuel formulations, and the compliance to
   regulations. Another change has been the advent of environmental
   stewardship - U.S. industry is calling for metrics of environmental
   performance in order to stimulate innovative solutions to environmental
   challenges. Additionally, emerging international issues regarding the
   atmosphere (global climate change, emissions trading, etc) will
   certainly affect global American industries. This clearly called for an
   assessment of the fundamental metrology and air quality monitoring
   needed by U.S. industry and the Nation.

   The basis for effective decisions is in the accuracy and uncertainty of
   measurements -- the first link in the long chain of environmental
   action. This involves identifying and quantifying a pollutant, and
   measuring its physical and chemical properties in the environment. The
   next step, based on measurement of the exposure-effect-risk
   relationship, allows society to determine the need to reduce the
   substance or risk in question. Finally, measurements are needed to
   monitor compliance and the effectiveness of pollution control
   requirements. The naïve faith in unqualified numbers has led
   decision-makers in industry and government to promote practices,
   policies and regulations whose justification was later seriously
   questioned, or whose implementation was eventually frustrated. The
   current Administration has voiced the need for effective policies of
   sound scientific basis that take advantage of the power of markets, so
   that taxpayers get the maximum environmental benefit from each
   environmental dollar.

   The goal of the workshop was to identify those current and future
   atmospheric issues most relevant to the U.S. economy and U.S. industry,
   and to identify the technical specifications of needed fundamental
   measurements, standards, and air quality programs that would enable the
   private and public sectors to effectively engage these issues. While
   many conferences and workshops have been convened in recent years on
   atmospheric topics, few had focused on fundamental needs, and none had
   provided a near-exclusive forum for the private sector to articulate
   their perspectives and needs. Over fifty technical specialists attended
   the one-and-a-half day workshop. The acting Director of NIST and the
   acting Administrator of NOAA delivered keynote remarks, followed by
   presentations from representatives of U.S. industry. After these, NIST
   and NOAA spokespersons presented reviews of relevant research within
   the U.S. Department of Commerce. Facilitated open discussion followed
   to pursue and explore topics such as: ·
     * Weather and air quality monitoring, modeling, and forecasting
     * Measurements and speciation of airborne particulates
     * Measurements involving photochemical oxidants · Measurements and
       speciation of airborne toxics
     * Measurements involving acid deposition
     * Evaluated data for assessing atmospheric fates and lifetimes of
       chemical species
     * Industrial response to climate change
     * Industrial response to stratospheric ozone depletion
     * Apportionment and uncertainties in emissions and inventory models
     * Measurements involving long-range transport of chemical and
       biological species
     * Linking industrial environmental performance metrics with tangible
       technical measurements

   Discussion points were captured by the facilitators. Two breakout
   sessions were then identified, focused on topics of primary interest to
   the industrial participants: 1) Measurements, Monitoring, and Standards
   for Particulate Matter and Aerosols, and 2) Measurements, Monitoring,
   and Standards for Gas Phase Emissions. The workshop ended with a
   session where all the participants had the opportunity to review the
   results of the individual breakout sessions. The raw data, findings,
   and recommendations of the report were handled and drafted by the
   facilitation team, using several feedback cycles where the participants
   could review, modify, and approve the results. The final report, with
   all participants sharing ownership, will be presented in this document.
   NIST and NOAA intend to use these results to help allocate internal
   funds and resources. Further dissemination of the results of the
   workshop will be effected through the interagency Air Quality Research
   Subcommittee of CENR, and synopses will be published in appropriate
   locations.
