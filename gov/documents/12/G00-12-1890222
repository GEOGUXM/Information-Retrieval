           Overview | Instrument Design | Fabrication | Detectors



   Electronic Engineering

   The ECT Electronics Engineering Department provides assistance to
   experimenters in the design of unique instruments for data acquisition
   and instrument control. Assistance with the installation, testing, and
   repair of existing and commercial instruments is available as well. The
   staff combines a range of expertise to provide the best solution for
   your needs. For more information, call the department manager at (630)
   252-6940 or the department office at (630) 252-6931.

   Instrument Design

      Experienced electronics and computer engineers can assist in designing
      instrumentation for control and data acquisition. Engineers use
      commercially available modules or design custom modules as appropriate
      or required. The Instrument Design Group also has personnel who design
      custom multi-layer printed circuit boards. The group is experienced
      with many bus structures, including:
        * Camac
        * Multibus
        * VME
        * VXI
        * PC (ISA, EISA, PCI)
        * Allen-Bradley PLCs

      Control computers include:
        * PCs
        * Sun
        * VAX
        * SGI
        * HP

      The engineers have programming experience in:


     * C/C++
     * Pascal
     * FORTRAN
     * EPICS/MEDM/IDL

                       * VxWorks
                       * LabVIEW
                       * Labtec Notebook/pro


   Fabrication and Instrument Services

   Skilled technicians are available to fabricate new designs and install
   hardware components. Services provided include
     * Chassis assembly
     * Fabricaion of two-sided printed circuit boards
     * Assembly of modules and printed circuit boards
     * Preventative, routine, and emergency repair work
     * Repair of electronics and computer peripherals
     * fine-pitch device capability
     * Calibration traceable to National Bureau of Standards
     * Optical and electronic microscopes for detailed work
     * Standing contracts with outside vendors for larger jobs
     * Work done ot Martin-Marietta workmanship standards
     * More stringent standards applied as customer requires


   Detector Development

   The ECT Detector Development Group designs and builds advanced detector
   systems for the scientific community inside and outside Argonne.
   Development is concentrated into two main areas: (1) building
   custom-designed, specialized detector systems not available from
   commercial sources and (2) exploring novel, promising areas of detector
   technology. Staff experience includes:
     * Nuclear instrumentation
     * High-energy physics instrumentation
     * High-resolution imaging detectors
          + CCD, amorphous silicon, and photodiode arrays
          + Infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray detection
     * Sub-nanosecond time-resolved experiments
     * Position-sensitive neutron detection
     * Instrumentation for crystallography experiments
     * Measurement and recording of temperature, acceleration, position,
       and force
