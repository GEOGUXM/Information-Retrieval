   News Release
   Make a difference! Become a King County Master Recycler Composter

   Wondering what you can do to help preserve our environment? You can
   start in your own kitchen and backyard.

   Sign up for King Countys Master Recycler Compost Program and learn how
   to protect the environment by reducing the amount of garbage generated
   and recycling wherever possible. In return for the training, program
   participants share their knowledge and skills with others by
   volunteering at least 40 hours in the community. Participants in the
   seven-week program receive approximately 40 hours of tuition-free
   training about waste prevention, recycling, home composting and
   alternatives to household hazardous waste.

   Since the program began in 1990, 467 people have received Master
   Recycler Composter training. They have gone on to volunteer nearly
   14,000 hours giving classroom presentations, staffing booths at
   community events and teaching others about composting. Participants
   have volunteered for more than 1,800 programs and events.

   The next Master Recycler Composter training will begin in March and
   include classroom sessions, field demonstrations and hands-on
   activities. Applications for the program are due Friday, March 1, 2002.

   The training sessions will be held from March 5, 2002 through April 16,
   2002 in Shoreline on Tuesday evenings from 6:30 to 9:00 PM and on four
   Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Individuals who live in King County,
   outside the City of Seattle, are eligible to apply. People with
   disabilities are encouraged to apply the training site is wheelchair
