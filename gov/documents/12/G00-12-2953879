                                  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has developed an ArcIMS web
   page template for use by all USGS web developers. This template, based
   on the ArcIMS 3.1 HTML Viewer, is designed to provide a consistent user
   interface to USGS interactive maps published on the Internet. The
   template addresses handicap accessibility (American Disabilities Act,
   Section 508) and conforms to USGS Visual Identity standards. A
   configuration utility is included so that the web developer can quickly
   and easily publish a customized interactive map.

   The template is intended for USGS web developers creating a web page
   with the following characteristics:
     * Accessible by the public
     * The map interface is a non-entry level page
     * No user information will be collected on the map interface page
     * The map interface page is not specifically designed for children
     * Uses ArcIMS map services

   Included with the template is a configuration utility allowing
   customization of the following parameters:
     * Map Title
     * Whether or not to include an overview image
     * Map services and hostnames
     * Initial geographic limits
     * Web page maintainer information in the footer
     * Local organization information in the footer
     * Colors for the banner and page elements
     * The appearance of various tools

   Choose the following links to see examples of web pages created with
   the template:
    1. Geographic Names Information System
    2. National Elevation Dataset
    3. National Elevation Dataset Data Source Index
    4. National Hydrography Dataset
    5. National Land Cover Dataset
    6. USGS Reference Layers
    7. USGS Combined Map Services
