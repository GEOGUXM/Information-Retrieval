     * 1) NEW RATE STRUCTURE FOR SERIES EE SAVINGS BONDS
            1.1) I've heard about the new savings bond rate structure.
            Does this mean that Treasury is issuing a new series of
            savings bonds?
            No. Treasury is making the familiar Series EE savings bond a
            more attractive way to save by moving to a higher rate and by
            increasing bond values every month instead of semiannually.
            1.2) Why did Treasury change the way Series EE bonds earn
            interest?
            This is the latest in a series of changes to Series EE bonds
            that will make them a more attractive way for Americans to
            save for the future.

     * 2) EFFECTIVE DATE
            2.1) When do the new rates for savings bonds take effect?
            The new way of setting rates for Series EE savings bonds takes
            effect for bonds issued on or after May 1, 1997.

     * 3) INTEREST RATE AND MATURITY
        3.1) How did Treasury set the new rate?
            Savings bonds will earn the new higher rates right from the
            start. The rate is 90 percent of the average 5-year Treasury
            market yields for the preceding six months. Treasury will
            announce a savings bond rate each May 1 and November 1. The
            rates announced each May and November are the annual rates
            that apply to bonds for that six month earning period. For
            example, the six month earning period for a bond issued in May
            is from May through October; for a bond issued in June, it's
            June through November. The rate that's announced is the rate
            bonds will earn during the 6-month earning period.
            3.2) How is interest added to savings bonds after May 1, 1997?
            New EE bonds will increase in value every month. The rate that
            Treasury announces each May and November will be applied to a
            bond for the 6-month earning period.
            3.3) How long do I have to hold my bonds to get the new rates?
            Savings bonds can be cashed in any time after 6 months. If you
            redeem a bond before 5 years, there is a 3-month interest
            penalty. See question 3.4 for more information.
            3.4) If I cash a bond during the first five years, how is the
            penalty figured?
            If you cash a bond before it is five years old, you give up
            the last three months worth of interest. For example, if you
            buy a bond in May 1997 and cash it 24 months later in May
            1999, you get your original investment back plus 21 months of
            interest. The value of the bond would be based on the
            announced rates applied over the 21 month period from May 1997
            through February 1999.
            3.5) Will I get compound interest?
            Yes. The Series EE bond interest rate is compounded
            semiannually.
            3.6) How long will my bonds earn interest?
            Series EE bonds will earn interest for 30 years. At the 30
            year mark, they reach final maturity and stop earning
            interest.
            3.7) Can I be sure my bond will reach face value?
            Yes. Series EE bonds are purchased at half their face value or
            denomination. Because EE bond interest is pegged to market
            rates that change every six months, there is no way to predict
            when a bond will reach its face value. For example, a bond
            earning an average of 5% would reach face value in 14Â½ years
            while a bond earning an average of 6% would reach face value
            in 12 years. In the unlikely event that rates are so low that
            a bond doesn't reach face value by the time it is 17 years
            old, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment to increase the
            bond's value to face value at that time.

     * 4) IMPACT ON OTHER SAVINGS BONDS YOU OWN
        4.1) What happens to the Series EE and E savings bonds I already
            own?
            Nothing. Outstanding Series EE and E bonds as well as savings
            notes issued before May 1, 1997, are not affected by these
            changes. They will continue to earn interest under the terms
            in effect before May 1, 1997.
            4.2) Are there any changes to Series HH or H bonds?
            No. Series HH bonds remain unchanged. Series HH/H bonds issued
            or entering an extended maturity period on or after March 1993
            will pay interest at a level rate of 4%.

     * 5) SAFETY OF INVESTMENT
        5.1) How safe is my investment?
            Your principal and interest are backed by the full faith and
            credit of the United States. This means that you will always
            get back your original investment and the interest it has
            earned when it comes time to redeem your bond.
