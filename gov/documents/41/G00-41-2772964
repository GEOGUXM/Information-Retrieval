    Introduction

   Few experiences match the drama of a convulsive seizure. A person
   having a severe seizure may cry out, fall to the floor unconscious,
   twitch or move uncontrollably, drool, or even lose bladder control.
   Within minutes, the attack is over, and the person regains
   consciousness but is exhausted and dazed. This is the image most people
   have when they hear the word epilepsy. However, this type of seizurea
   generalized tonic-clonic seizure*is only one kind of epilepsy. There
   are many other kinds, each with a different set of symptoms.

   Epilepsy was one of the first brain disorders to be described. It was
   mentioned in ancient Babylon more than 3,000 years ago. The strange
   behavior caused by some seizures has contributed through the ages to
   many superstitions and prejudices. The word epilepsy is derived from
   the Greek word for "attack." People once thought that those with
   epilepsy were being visited by demons or gods. However, in 400 B.C.,
   the early physician Hippocrates suggested that epilepsy was a disorder
   of the brainand we now know that he was right.

    What is Epilepsy?

   Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or
   neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. Neurons normally
   generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons, glands,
   and muscles to produce human thoughts, feelings, and actions. In
   epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed,
   causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior, or sometimes
   convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. During a
   seizure, neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second, much faster
   than the normal rate of about 80 times a second. In some people, this
   happens only occasionally; for others, it may happen up to hundreds of
   times a day.

   More than 2 million people in the United Statesabout 1 in 100have
   experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. For
   about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be
   controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. However,
   about 20 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience
   seizures even with the best available treatment. Doctors call this
   situation intractable epilepsy. Having a seizure does not necessarily
   mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more
   seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy.

   Epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or
   mental retardation. Some people with mental retardation may experience
   seizures, but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will
   develop mental impairment. Many people with epilepsy have normal or
   above-average intelligence. Famous people who are known or rumored to
   have had epilepsy include the Russian writer Dostoyevsky, the
   philosopher Socrates, the military general Napoleon, and the inventor
   of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, who established the Nobel prize. Several
   Olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. Seizures
   sometimes do cause brain damage, particularly if they are severe.
   However, most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the
   brain. Any changes that do occur are usually subtle, and it is often
   unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or
   by the underlying problem that caused the seizures.

   While epilepsy cannot currently be cured, for some people it does
   eventually go away. One study found that children with idiopathic
   epilepsy, or epilepsy with an unknown cause, had a 68 to 92 percent
   chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. The
   odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults, or for
   children with severe epilepsy syndromes, but it is nonetheless possible
   that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. This is more likely
   if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person
   has had epilepsy surgery.

    What Causes Epilepsy?

   Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. Anything that
   disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity from illness to brain
   damage to abnormal brain development can lead to seizures.

   Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an
   imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or
   some combination of these factors. Researchers believe that some people
   with epilepsy have an abnormally high level of excitatory
   neurotransmitters that increase neuronal activity, while others have an
   abnormally low level of inhibitory neurotransmitters that decrease
   neuronal activity in the brain. Either situation can result in too much
   neuronal activity and cause epilepsy. One of the most-studied
   neurotransmitters that plays a role in epilepsy is GABA, or
   gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
   Research on GABA has led to drugs that alter the amount of this
   neurotransmitter in the brain or change how the brain responds to it.
   Researchers also are studying excitatory neurotransmitters such as
   glutamate.

   In some cases, the brains attempts to repair itself after a head
   injury, stroke, or other problem may inadvertently generate abnormal
   nerve connections that lead to epilepsy. Abnormalities in brain wiring
   that occur during brain development also may disturb neuronal activity
   and lead to epilepsy.

   Research has shown that the cell membrane that surrounds each neuron
   plays an important role in epilepsy. Cell membranes are crucial for
   neurons to generate electrical impulses. For this reason, researchers
   are studying details of the membrane structure, how molecules move in
   and out of membranes, and how the cell nourishes and repairs the
   membrane. A disruption in any of these processes may lead to epilepsy.
   Studies in animals have shown that, because the brain continually
   adapts to changes in stimuli, a small change in neuronal activity, if
   repeated, may eventually lead to full-blown epilepsy. Researchers are
   investigating whether this phenomenon, called kindling, may also occur
   in humans.

   In some cases, epilepsy may result from changes in non-neuronal brain
   cells called glia. These cells regulate concentrations of chemicals in
   the brain that can affect neuronal signaling.

   About half of all seizures have no known cause. However, in other
   cases, the seizures are clearly linked to infection, trauma, or other
   identifiable problems.

   top

      Genetic Factors

   Research suggests that genetic abnormalities may be some of the most
   important factors contributing to epilepsy. Some types of epilepsy have
   been traced to an abnormality in a specific gene. Many other types of
   epilepsy tend to run in families, which suggests that genes influence
   epilepsy. Some researchers estimate that more than 500 genes could play
   a role in this disorder. However, it is increasingly clear that, for
   many forms of epilepsy, genetic abnormalities play only a partial role,
   perhaps by increasing a persons susceptibility to seizures that are
   triggered by an environmental factor.

   Several types of epilepsy have now been linked to defective genes for
   ion channels, the "gates" that control the flow of ions in and out of
   cells and regulate neuron signaling. Another gene, which is missing in
   people with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, codes for a protein called
   cystatin B. This protein regulates enzymes that break down other
   proteins. Another gene, which is altered in a severe form of epilepsy
   called LaFora disease, has been linked to a gene that helps to break
   down carbohydrates.

   While abnormal genes sometimes cause epilepsy, they also may influence
   the disorder in subtler ways. For example, one study showed that many
   people with epilepsy have an abnormally active version of a gene that
   increases resistance to drugs. This may help explain why anticonvulsant
   drugs do not work for some people. Genes also may control other aspects
   of the bodys response to medications and each persons susceptibility to
   seizures, or seizure threshold. Abnormalities in the genes that control
   neuronal migrationa critical step in brain development can lead to
   areas of misplaced or abnormally formed neurons, or dysplasia, in the
   brain that can cause epilepsy. In some cases, genes may contribute to
   development of epilepsy even in people with no family history of the
   disorder. These people may have a newly developed abnormality, or
   mutation, in an epilepsy-related gene.

   top

      Other Disorders

   In many cases, epilepsy develops as a result of brain damage from other
   disorders. For example, brain tumors, alcoholism, and Alzheimers
   disease frequently lead to epilepsy because they alter the normal
   workings of the brain. Strokes, heart attacks, and other conditions
   that deprive the brain of oxygen also can cause epilepsy in some cases.
   About 32 percent of all newly developed epilepsy in elderly people
   appears to be due to cerebrovascular disease, which reduces the supply
   of oxygen to brain cells. Meningitis, AIDS, viral encephalitis, and
   other infectious diseases can lead to epilepsy, as can hydrocephalusa
   condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain. Epilepsy also
   can result from intolerance to wheat gluten (known as celiac disease),
   or from a parasitic infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis.
   Seizures may stop once these disorders are treated successfully.
   However, the odds of becoming seizure-free after the primary disorder
   is treated are uncertain and vary depending on the type of disorder,
   the brain region that is affected, and how much brain damage occurred
   prior to treatment.

   Epilepsy is associated with a variety of developmental and metabolic
   disorders, including cerebral palsy, neurofibromatosis, pyruvate
   deficiency, tuberous sclerosis, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and autism.
   Epilepsy is just one of a set of symptoms commonly found in people with
   these disorders.

   top

      Head Injury

   In some cases, head injury can lead to seizures or epilepsy. Safety
   measures such as wearing seat belts in cars and using helmets when
   riding a motorcycle or playing competitive sports can protect people
   from epilepsy and other problems that result from head injury.

   top

      Prenatal Injury and Developmental Problems

   The developing brain is susceptible to many kinds of injury. Maternal
   infections, poor nutrition, and oxygen deficiencies are just some of
   the conditions that may take a toll on the brain of a developing baby.
   These conditions may lead to cerebral palsy, which often is associated
   with epilepsy, or they may cause epilepsy that is unrelated to any
   other disorders. About 20 percent of seizures in children are due to
   cerebral palsy or other neurological abnormalities. Abnormalities in
   genes that control development also may contribute to epilepsy.
   Advanced brain imaging has revealed that some cases of epilepsy that
   occur with no obvious cause may be associated with areas of dysplasia
   in the brain that probably develop before birth.

   top

      Poisoning

   Seizures can result from exposure to lead, carbon monoxide, and many
   other poisons. They also can result from exposure to street drugs and
   from overdoses of antidepressants and other medications.

   Seizures are often triggered by factors such as lack of sleep, alcohol
   consumption, stress, or hormonal changes associated with the menstrual
   cycle. These seizure triggers do not cause epilepsy but can provoke
   first seizures or cause breakthrough seizures in people who otherwise
   experience good seizure control with their medication. Sleep
   deprivation in particular is a universal and powerful trigger of
   seizures. For this reason, people with epilepsy should make sure to get
   enough sleep and should try to stay on a regular sleep schedule as much
   as possible. For some people, light flashing at a certain speed or the
   flicker of a computer monitor can trigger a seizure; this problem is
   called photosensitive epilepsy. Smoking cigarettes also can trigger
   seizures. The nicotine in cigarettes acts on receptors for the
   excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which increases
   neuronal firing. Seizures are not triggered by sexual activity except
   in very rare instances.

    What Are the Different Kinds of Seizures?

   Doctors have described more than 30 different types of seizures.
   Seizures are divided into two major categoriespartial seizures and
   generalized seizures. However, there are many different types of
   seizures in each of these categories.

      Partial Seizures

   Partial seizures occur in just one part of the brain. About 60 percent
   of people with epilepsy have partial seizures. These seizures are
   frequently described by the area of the brain in which they originate.
   For example, someone might be diagnosed with partial frontal lobe
   seizures.

   In a simple partial seizure, the person will remain conscious but may
   experience unusual feelings or sensations that can take many forms. The
   person may experience sudden and unexplainable feelings of joy, anger,
   sadness, or nausea. He or she also may hear, smell, taste, see, or feel
   things that are not real.

   In a complex partial seizure, the person has a change in or loss of
   consciousness. His or her consciousness may be altered, producing a
   dreamlike experience. People having a complex partial seizure may
   display strange, repetitious behaviors such as blinks, twitches, mouth
   movements, or even walking in a circle. These repetitious movements are
   called automatisms. They also may fling objects across the room or
   strike out at walls or furniture as though they are angry or afraid.
   These seizures usually last just a few seconds.

   Some people with partial seizures, especially complex partial seizures,
   may experience aurasunusual sensations that warn of an impending
   seizure. These auras are actually simple partial seizures in which the
   person maintains consciousness. The symptoms an individual person has,
   and the progression of those symptoms, tends to be stereotyped, or
   similar every time.

   The symptoms of partial seizures can easily be confused with other
   disorders. For instance, the dreamlike perceptions associated with a
   complex partial seizure may be misdiagnosed as migraine headaches,
   which also can cause a dreamlike state. The strange behavior and
   sensations caused by partial seizures also can be mistaken for symptoms
   of narcolepsy, fainting, or even mental illness. It may take many tests
   and careful monitoring by a knowledgeable physician to tell the
   difference between epilepsy and other disorders.

   top

      Generalized Seizures

   Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal neuronal activity in many
   parts of the brain. These seizures may cause loss of consciousness,
   falls, or massive muscle spasms.

   There are many kinds of generalized seizures. In absence seizures, the
   person may appear to be staring into space and/or have jerking or
   twitching muscles. These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit
   mal seizures, which is an older term. Tonic seizures cause stiffening
   of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms.
   Clonic seizures cause repeated jerking movements of muscles on both
   sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures cause jerks or twitches of the
   upper body, arms, or legs. Atonic seizures cause a loss of normal
   muscle tone. The affected person will fall down or may nod his or her
   head involuntarily. Tonic-clonic seizures cause a mixture of symptoms,
   including stiffening of the body and repeated jerks of the arms and/or
   legs as well as loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures are
   sometimes referred to by an older term: grand mal seizures.

   Not all seizures can be easily defined as either partial or
   generalized. Some people have seizures that begin as partial seizures
   but then spread to the entire brain. Other people may have both types
   of seizures but with no clear pattern.

   Societys lack of understanding about the many different types of
   seizures is one of the biggest problems for people with epilepsy.
   People who witness a non-convulsive seizure often find it difficult to
   understand that behavior which looks deliberate is not under the
   persons control. In some cases, this has led to the affected person
   being arrested, sued, or placed in a mental institution. To combat
   these problems, people everywhere need to understand the many different
   types of seizures and how they may appear.

    What Are the Different Kinds of Epilepsy?

   Just as there are many different kinds of seizures, there are many
   different kinds of epilepsy. Doctors have identified hundreds of
   different epilepsy syndromesdisorders characterized by a specific set
   of symptoms that include epilepsy. Some of these syndromes appear to be
   hereditary. For other syndromes, the cause is unknown. Epilepsy
   syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the
   brain they originate. People should discuss the implications of their
   type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of
   symptoms, the possible treatments, and the prognosis.

   People with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause
   momentary lapses of consciousness. These seizures almost always begin
   in childhood or adolescence, and they tend to run in families,
   suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene
   or genes. Some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements
   during their seizures, such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes.
   Others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are
   "out of it." Immediately after a seizure, the person can resume
   whatever he or she was doing. However, these seizures may occur so
   frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other
   situations. Childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child
   reaches puberty. Absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on
   intelligence or other brain functions.

   Psychomotor epilepsy. Psychomotor epilepsy is another term for
   recurrent partial seizures, especially seizures of the temporal lobe.
   The term psychomotor refers to the strange sensations, emotions, and
   behavior seen with these seizures.

   Temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy, or TLE, is the most
   common epilepsy syndrome with partial seizures. These seizures are
   often associated with auras. TLE often begins in childhood. Research
   has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain
   structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. The hippocampus
   is important for memory and learning. While it may take years of
   temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur, this
   finding underlines the need to treat TLE early and as effectively as
   possible.

   Frontal lobe epilepsy. Frontal lobe epilepsy usually involves a cluster
   of short seizures with a sudden onset and termination. There are many
   subtypes of frontal lobe seizures. The symptoms depend on where in the
   frontal lobe the seizures occur.

   Occipital lobe epilepsy. Occipital lobe epilepsy usually begins with
   visual hallucinations, rapid eye blinking, or other eye-related
   symptoms. Otherwise, it resembles temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy.

   The symptoms of parietal lobe epilepsy closely resemble those of other
   types of epilepsy. This may reflect the fact that parietal lobe
   seizures tend to spread to other areas of the brain.

   There are many other types of epilepsy, each with its own
   characteristic set of symptoms. Many of these, including Lennox-Gastaut
   syndrome and Rasmussens encephalitis, begin in childhood. Children with
   Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different
   types of seizures, including atonic seizures, which cause sudden falls
   and are also called drop attacks. This severe form of epilepsy can be
   very difficult to treat effectively. Rasmussens encephalitis is a
   progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual
   inflammation. It sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure
   called hemispherectomy (see the section on Surgery). Some childhood
   epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, tend to go into
   remission or stop entirely during adolescence, whereas other syndromes
   such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are usually present for life once
   they develop. Seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood. For
   example, Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II is a rare and severe progressive
   type of epilepsy that generally begins in early adulthood and leads to
   reduced muscle coordination and cognitive abilities in addition to
   seizures.

   Epilepsy syndromes that do not seem to impair cognitive functions or
   development are often described as benign. Benign epilepsy syndromes
   include benign infantile encephalopathy and benign neonatal
   convulsions. Other syndromes, such as early myoclonic encephalopathy,
   include neurological and developmental problems. However, these
   problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather
   than by the seizures. Epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or
   the persons cognitive or motor abilities get worse over time are called
   progressive epilepsy.

   Several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. The most common type of
   infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms, clusters of seizures that
   usually begin before the age of 6 months. During these seizures the
   infant may bend and cry out. Anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for
   infantile spasms, but the seizures can be treated with ACTH
   (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or prednisone.

     __________________________________________________________________

    When Are Seizures Not Epilepsy?

   While any seizure is cause for concern, having a seizure does not by
   itself mean a person has epilepsy. First seizures, febrile seizures,
   nonepileptic events, and eclampsia are examples of seizures that may
   not be associated with epilepsy.

      First Seizures

   Many people have a single seizure at some point in their lives. Often
   these seizures occur in reaction to anesthesia or a strong drug, but
   they also may be unprovoked, meaning that they occur without any
   obvious triggering factor. Unless the person has suffered brain damage
   or there is a family history of epilepsy or other neurological
   abnormalities, these single seizures usually are not followed by
   additional seizures. One recent study that followed patients for an
   average of 8 years found that only 33 percent of people have a second
   seizure within 4 years after an initial seizure. People who did not
   have a second seizure within that time remained seizure-free for the
   rest of the study. For people who did have a second seizure, the risk
   of a third seizure was about 73 percent on average by the end of 4
   years.

   When someone has experienced a first seizure, the doctor will usually
   order an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to determine what type of
   seizure the person may have had and if there are any detectable
   abnormalities in the persons brain waves. The doctor also may order
   brain scans to identify abnormalities that may be visible in the brain.
   These tests may help the doctor decide whether or not to treat the
   person with antiepileptic drugs. In some cases, drug treatment after
   the first seizure may help prevent future seizures and epilepsy.
   However, the drugs also can cause detrimental side effects, so doctors
   prescribe them only when they feel the benefits outweigh the risks.
   Evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to begin anticonvulsant
   medication once a person has had a second seizure, as the chance of
   future seizures increases significantly after this occurs.

   top

      Febrile Seizures

   Sometimes a child will have a seizure during the course of an illness
   with a high fever. These seizures are called febrile seizures (febrile
   is derived from the Latin word for "fever") and can be very alarming to
   the parents and other caregivers. In the past, doctors usually
   prescribed a course of anticonvulsant drugs following a febrile seizure
   in the hope of preventing epilepsy. However, most children who have a
   febrile seizure do not develop epilepsy, and long-term use of
   anticonvulsant drugs in children may damage the developing brain or
   cause other detrimental side effects. Experts at a 1980 consensus
   conference coordinated by the National Institutes of Health concluded
   that preventive treatment after a febrile seizure is generally not
   warranted unless certain other conditions are present: a family history
   of epilepsy, signs of nervous system impairment prior to the seizure,
   or a relatively prolonged or complicated seizure. The risk of
   subsequent non-febrile seizures is only 2 to 3 percent unless one of
   these factors is present.

   Researchers have now identified several different genes that influence
   the risk of febrile seizures in certain families. Studying these genes
   may lead to new understanding of how febrile seizures occur and perhaps
   point to ways of preventing them.

   top

      Nonepileptic Events

   Sometimes people appear to have seizures, even though their brains show
   no seizure activity. This type of phenomenon has various names,
   including nonepileptic events and pseudoseizures. Both of these terms
   essentially mean something that looks like a seizure but isnt one.
   Nonepileptic events that are psychological in origin may be referred to
   as psychogenic seizures. Psychogenic seizures may indicate dependence,
   a need for attention, avoidance of stressful situations, or specific
   psychiatric conditions. Some people with epilepsy have psychogenic
   seizures in addition to their epileptic seizures. Other people who have
   psychogenic seizures do not have epilepsy at all. Psychogenic seizures
   cannot be treated in the same way as epileptic seizures. Instead, they
   are often treated by mental health specialists.

   Other nonepileptic events may be caused by narcolepsy, Tourette
   syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and other medical conditions with
   symptoms that resemble seizures. Because symptoms of these disorders
   can look very much like epileptic seizures, they are often mistaken for
   epilepsy. Distinguishing between true epileptic seizures and
   nonepileptic events can be very difficult and requires a thorough
   medical assessment, careful monitoring, and knowledgeable health
   professionals. Improvements in brain scanning and monitoring technology
   may improve diagnosis of nonepileptic events in the future.

   top

      Eclampsia

   Eclampsia is a life-threatening condition that can develop in pregnant
   women. Its symptoms include sudden elevations of blood pressure and
   seizures. Pregnant women who develop unexpected seizures should be
   rushed to a hospital immediately. Eclampsia can be treated in a
   hospital setting and usually does not result in additional seizures or
   epilepsy once the pregnancy is over.

   top
     __________________________________________________________________

    How is Epilepsy Diagnosed?

   Doctors have developed a number of different tests to determine whether
   a person has epilepsy and, if so, what kind of seizures the person has.
   In some cases, people may have symptoms that look very much like a
   seizure but in fact are nonepileptic events caused by other disorders.
   Even doctors may not be able to tell the difference between these
   disorders and epilepsy without close observation and intensive testing.

      EEG Monitoring

   An EEG records brain waves detected by electrodes placed on the scalp.
   This is the most common diagnostic test for epilepsy and can detect
   abnormalities in the brains electrical activity. People with epilepsy
   frequently have changes in their normal pattern of brain waves, even
   when they are not experiencing a seizure. While this type of test can
   be very useful in diagnosing epilepsy, it is not foolproof. Some people
   continue to show normal brain wave patterns even after they have
   experienced a seizure. In other cases, the unusual brain waves are
   generated deep in the brain where the EEG is unable to detect them.
   Many people who do not have epilepsy also show some unusual brain
   activity on an EEG. Whenever possible, an EEG should be performed
   within 24 hours of a patients first seizure. Ideally, EEGs should be
   performed while the patient is sleeping as well as when he or she is
   awake, because brain activity during sleep is often quite different
   than at other times.

   Video monitoring is often used in conjunction with EEG to determine the
   nature of a persons seizures. It also can be used in some cases to rule
   out other disorders such as cardiac arrhythmia or narcolepsy that may
   look like epilepsy.

   In some cases, doctors may use an experimental diagnostic technique
   called a magnetoencephalogram, or MEG. MEG detects the magnetic signals
   generated by neurons to allow doctors to monitor brain activity at
   different points in the brain over time, revealing different brain
   functions. While MEG is similar in concept to EEG, it does not require
   electrodes and it can detect signals from deeper in the brain than an
   EEG.

      Brain Scans

   One of the most important ways of diagnosing epilepsy is through the
   use of brain scans. The most commonly used brain scans include CT
   (computed tomography), PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI
   (magnetic resonance imaging). CT and MRI scans reveal the structure of
   the brain, which can be useful for identifying brain tumors, cysts, and
   other structural abnormalities. PET and an adapted kind of MRI called
   functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to monitor the brains activity and
   detect abnormalities in how it works. SPECT (single photon emission
   computed tomography) is a relatively new kind of brain scan that is
   sometimes used to locate seizure foci in the brain. Doctors also are
   experimenting with brain scans called magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   (MRS) that can detect abnormalities in the brains biochemical
   processes, and with near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that can
   detect oxygen levels in brain tissue.

   top

      Medical History

   Taking a detailed medical history, including symptoms and duration of
   the seizures, is still one of the best methods available to determine
   if a person has epilepsy and what kind of seizures they have. The
   doctor will ask questions about the seizures and any past illnesses or
   other symptoms a person may have had. Since people who have suffered a
   seizure often do not remember what happened, caregivers accounts of the
   seizure are vital to this evaluation.

   top

      Blood Tests

   Doctors often take blood samples for testing, particularly when they
   are examining a child. These blood samples are often screened for
   metabolic or genetic disorders that may be associated with the
   seizures. They also may be used to check for underlying problems such
   as infections, lead poisoning, anemia, and diabetes that may be causing
   or triggering the seizures.

   top

      Developmental, Neurological, and Behavioral Tests

   Doctors often use tests devised to measure motor abilities, behavior,
   and intellectual capacity as a way to determine how the epilepsy is
   affecting that person. These tests also can provide clues about what
   kind of epilepsy the person has.

    Can Epilepsy be Prevented?

   Many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and
   bicycle helmets, putting children in car seats, and other measures that
   prevent head injury and other trauma. Prescribing medication after
   first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent
   epilepsy in some cases. Good prenatal care, including treatment of high
   blood pressure and infections during pregnancy, can prevent brain
   damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other
   neurological problems later. Treating cardiovascular disease, high
   blood pressure, infections, and other disorders that can affect the
   brain during adulthood and aging also may prevent many cases of
   epilepsy. Finally, identifying the genes for many neurological
   disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and prenatal
   diagnosis that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.

    How can Epilepsy be Treated?

   Accurate diagnosis of the type of epilepsy a person has is crucial for
   finding an effective treatment. There are many different ways to treat
   epilepsy. Currently available treatments can control seizures at least
   some of the time in about 80 percent of people with epilepsy. However,
   another 20 percent about 600,000 people with epilepsy in the United
   States have intractable seizures, and another 400,000 feel they get
   inadequate relief from available treatments. These statistics make it
   clear that improved treatments are desperately needed.

   Doctors who treat epilepsy come from many different fields of medicine.
   They include neurologists, pediatricians, pediatric neurologists,
   internists, and family physicians, as well as neurosurgeons and doctors
   called epileptologists who specialize in treating epilepsy. People who
   need specialized or intensive care for epilepsy may be treated at large
   medical centers and neurology clinics at hospitals, or by neurologists
   in private practice. Many epilepsy treatment centers are associated
   with university hospitals that perform research in addition to
   providing medical care.

   Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon
   as possible. Research suggests that medication and other treatments may
   be less successful in treating epilepsy once seizures and their
   consequences become established.

   top

      Medications

   By far the most common approach to treating epilepsy is to prescribe
   antiepileptic drugs. The first effective antiepileptic drugs were
   bromides, introduced by an English physician named Sir Charles Locock
   in 1857. He noticed that bromides had a sedative effect and seemed to
   reduce seizures in some patients. More than 20 different antiepileptic
   drugs are now on the market, all with different benefits and side
   effects. The choice of which drug to prescribe, and at what dosage,
   depends on many different factors, including the type of seizures a
   person has, the persons lifestyle and age, how frequently the seizures
   occur, and, for a woman, the likelihood that she will become pregnant.
   People with epilepsy should follow their doctors advice and share any
   concerns they may have regarding their medication.

   Doctors seeing a patient with newly developed epilepsy often prescribe
   carbamazapine, valproate, or phenytoin first, unless the epilepsy is a
   type that is known to require a different kind of treatment. For
   absence seizures, ethosuximide is often the primary treatment. Other
   commonly prescribed drugs include clonazepam, phenobarbital, and
   primidone. In recent years, a number of new drugs have become
   available. These include tiagabine, lamotrigine, gabapentin,
   topiramate, levetiracetam, felbamate, and zonisamide, as well as
   oxcarbazapine, a drug that is similar to carbamazapine but has fewer
   side effects. These new drugs may have advantages for many patients.
   Other drugs are used in combination with one of the standard drugs or
   for intractable seizures that do not respond to other medications. A
   few drugs, such as fosphenytoin, are approved for use only in hospital
   settings to treat specific problems such as status epilepticus (see
   section, "Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?"). For
   people with stereotyped recurrent severe seizures that can be easily
   recognized by the persons family, the drug diazepam is now available as
   a gel that can be administered rectally by a family member. This method
   of drug delivery may be able to stop prolonged seizures before they
   develop into status epilepticus.

   For most people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with just one
   drug at the optimal dosage. Combining medications usually amplifies
   side effects such as fatigue and decreased appetite, so doctors usually
   prescribe monotherapy, or the use of just one drug, whenever possible.
   Combinations of drugs are sometimes prescribed if monotherapy fails to
   effectively control a patients seizures.

   The number of times a person needs to take medication each day is
   usually determined by the drugs half-life, or the time it takes for
   half the drug dose to be metabolized or broken down into other
   substances in the body. Some drugs, such as phenytoin and
   phenobarbital, only need to be taken once a day, while others such as
   valproate must be taken more frequently.

   Most side effects of antiepileptic drugs are relatively minor, such as
   fatigue, dizziness, or weight gain. However, severe and
   life-threatening side effects such as allergic reactions can occur.
   Epilepsy medication also may predispose people to developing depression
   or psychoses. People with epilepsy should consult a doctor immediately
   if they develop any kind of rash while on medication, or if they find
   themselves depressed or otherwise unable to think in a rational manner.
   Other danger signs that should be discussed with a doctor immediately
   are extreme fatigue, staggering or other movement problems, and
   slurring of words. People with epilepsy should be aware that their
   epilepsy medication can interact with many other drugs in potentially
   harmful ways. For this reason, people with epilepsy should always tell
   doctors who treat them which medications they are taking. Women also
   should know that some antiepileptic drugs can interfere with the
   effectiveness of oral contraceptives, and they should discuss this
   possibility with their doctors.

   Since people can become more sensitive to medications as they age, they
   should have their blood levels of medication checked occasionally to
   see if the dose needs to be adjusted. The effects of a particular
   medication also sometimes wear off over time, leading to an increase in
   seizures if the dose is not adjusted. People should know that some
   citrus fruit, in particular grapefruit juice, may interfere with
   breakdown of many drugs. This can cause too much of the drug to build
   up in their bodies, often worsening the side effects.
   Tailoring the dosage of antiepileptic drugs

   When a person starts a new epilepsy drug, it is important to tailor the
   dosage to achieve the best results. Peoples bodies react to medications
   in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways, so it may take some
   time to find the right drug at the right dose to provide optimal
   control of seizures while minimizing side effects. A drug that has no
   effect or very bad side effects at one dose may work very well at
   another dose. Doctors will usually prescribe a low dose of the new drug
   initially and monitor blood levels of the drug to determine when the
   best possible dose has been reached.

   Generic versions are available for many antiepileptic drugs. The
   chemicals in generic drugs are exactly the same as in the brand-name
   drugs, but they may be absorbed or processed differently in the body
   because of the way they are prepared. Therefore, patients should always
   check with their doctors before switching to a generic version of their
   medication.
   Discontinuing medication

   Some doctors will advise people with epilepsy to discontinue their
   antiepileptic drugs after two years have passed without a seizure.
   Others feel it is better to wait for four to five years. Discontinuing
   medication should only be done with a doctors advice and supervision.
   It is very important to continue taking epilepsy medication for as long
   as the doctor prescribes it. People also should ask the doctor or
   pharmacist ahead of time what they should do if they miss a dose.
   Discontinuing medication without a doctors advice is one of the major
   reasons people who have been seizure-free begin having new seizures.
   Seizures that result from suddenly stopping medication can be very
   serious and can lead to status epilepticus. Furthermore, there is some
   evidence that uncontrolled seizures trigger changes in neurons that can
   make it more difficult to treat the seizures in the future.

   The chance that a person will eventually be able to discontinue
   medication varies depending on the persons age and his or her type of
   epilepsy. More than half of children who go into remission with
   medication can eventually stop their medication without having new
   seizures. One study showed that 68 percent of adults who had been
   seizure-free for 2 years before stopping medication were able to do so
   without having more seizures and 75 percent could successfully
   discontinue medication if they had been seizure-free for 3 years.
   However, the odds of successfully stopping medication are not as good
   for people with a family history of epilepsy, those who need multiple
   medications, those with partial seizures, and those who continue to
   have abnormal EEG results while on medication.

   top

      Surgery

   When seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medications, doctors
   may recommend that the person be evaluated for surgery. Most surgery
   for epilepsy is performed by teams of doctors at medical centers. To
   decide if a person may benefit from surgery, doctors consider the type
   or types of seizures he or she has. They also take into account the
   brain region involved and how important that region is for everyday
   behavior. Surgeons usually avoid operating in areas of the brain that
   are necessary for speech, language, hearing, or other important
   abilities. Doctors may perform tests such as a Wada test
   (administration of the drug amobarbitol into the carotid artery) to
   find areas of the brain that control speech and memory. They often
   monitor the patient intensively prior to surgery in order to pinpoint
   the exact location in the brain where seizures begin. They also may use
   implanted electrodes to record brain activity from the surface of the
   brain. This yields better information than an external EEG.

   A 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus conference on surgery
   for epilepsy concluded that there are three broad categories of
   epilepsy that can be treated successfully with surgery. These include
   partial seizures, seizures that begin as partial seizures before
   spreading to the rest of the brain, and unilateral multifocal epilepsy
   with infantile hemiplegia (such as Rasmussens encephalitis). Doctors
   generally recommend surgery only after patients have tried two or three
   different medications without success, or if there is an identifiable
   brain lesion a damaged or abnormally functioning area believed to cause
   the seizures.

   If a person is considered a good candidate for surgery and has seizures
   that cannot be controlled with available medication, experts generally
   agree that surgery should be performed as early as possible. It can be
   difficult for a person who has had years of seizures to fully re-adapt
   to a seizure-free life if the surgery is successful. The person may
   never have had an opportunity to develop independence and he or she may
   have had difficulties with school and work that could have been avoided
   with earlier treatment. Surgery should always be performed with support
   from rehabilitation specialists and counselors who can help the person
   deal with the many psychological, social, and employment issues he or
   she may face.

   While surgery can significantly reduce or even halt seizures for some
   people, it is important to remember that any kind of surgery carries
   some amount of risk (usually small). Surgery for epilepsy does not
   always successfully reduce seizures and it can result in cognitive or
   personality changes, even in people who are excellent candidates for
   surgery. Patients should ask their surgeon about his or her experience,
   success rates, and complication rates with the procedure they are
   considering.

   Even when surgery completely ends a persons seizures, it is important
   to continue taking seizure medication for some time to give the brain
   time to re-adapt. Doctors generally recommend medication for 2 years
   after a successful operation to avoid new seizures.
   Surgery to treat underlying conditions

   In cases where seizures are caused by a brain tumor, hydrocephalus, or
   other conditions that can be treated with surgery, doctors may operate
   to treat these underlying conditions. In many cases, once the
   underlying condition is successfully treated, a persons seizures will
   stop as well.
   Surgery to remove a seizure focus

   The most common type of surgery for epilepsy is removal of a seizure
   focus, or small area of the brain where seizures originate. This type
   of surgery, which doctors may refer to as a lobectomy or lesionectomy,
   is appropriate only for partial seizures that originate in just one
   area of the brain. In general, people have a better chance of becoming
   seizure-free after surgery if they have a small, well-defined seizure
   focus. Lobectomies have a 55-70 percent success rate when the type of
   epilepsy and the seizure focus is well-defined. The most common type of
   lobectomy is a temporal lobe resection, which is performed for people
   with temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe resection leads to a
   significant reduction or complete cessation of seizures about 70 - 90
   percent of the time.
   Multiple subpial transection

   When seizures originate in part of the brain that cannot be removed,
   surgeons may perform a procedure called a multiple subpial transection.
   In this type of operation, which was first described in 1989, surgeons
   make a series of cuts that are designed to prevent seizures from
   spreading into other parts of the brain while leaving the persons
   normal abilities intact. About 70 percent of patients who undergo a
   multiple subpial transection have satisfactory improvement in seizure
   control.
   Corpus callosotomy

   Corpus callosotomy, Corpus callosotomy, or severing the network of
   neural connections between the right and left halves, or hemispheres,
   of the brain, is done primarily in children with severe seizures that
   start in one half of the brain and spread to the other side. Corpus
   callosotomy can end drop attacks and other generalized seizures.
   However, the procedure does not stop seizures in the side of the brain
   where they originate, and these partial seizures may even increase
   after surgery.
   Hemispherectomy

   This procedure, which removes half of the brains cortex, or outer
   layer, is used only for children who have Rasmussens encephalitis or
   other severe damage to one brain hemisphere and who also have seizures
   that do not respond well to medication. While this type of surgery is
   very radical and is performed only as a last resort, children often
   recover very well from the procedure, and their seizures usually are
   greatly reduced or may cease altogether. With intense rehabilitation,
   they often recover nearly normal abilities. Since the chance of a full
   recovery is best in young children, hemispherectomy should be performed
   as early in a childs life as possible. It is almost never performed in
   children older than 13.

      Devices

   The vagus nerve stimulator was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in people with seizures that are
   not well-controlled by medication. The vagus nerve stimulator is a
   battery-powered device that is surgically implanted under the skin of
   the chest, much like a pacemaker, and is attached to the vagus nerve in
   the lower neck. This device delivers short bursts of electrical energy
   to the brain via the vagus nerve. On average, this stimulation reduces
   seizures by about 20-40 percent. Patients usually cannot stop taking
   epilepsy medication because of the stimulator, but they often
   experience fewer seizures and they may be able to reduce the dose of
   their medication. Side effects of the vagus nerve stimulator are
   generally mild, but may include ear pain, a sore throat, or nausea.
   Adjusting the amount of stimulation can usually eliminate these side
   effects. The batteries in the vagus nerve stimulator need to be
   replaced about once every 5 years; this requires a minor operation that
   can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure.

   Several new devices may become available for epilepsy in the future.
   Researchers are studying whether transcranial magnetic stimulation, a
   procedure which uses a strong magnet held outside the head to influence
   brain activity, may reduce seizures. They also hope to develop
   implantable devices that can deliver drugs to specific parts of the
   brain.

   top

      Diet

   Studies have shown that, in some cases, children may experience fewer
   seizures if they maintain a strict diet rich in fats and low in
   carbohydrates. This unusual diet, called the ketogenic diet, causes the
   body to break down fats instead of carbohydrates to survive. This
   condition is called ketosis. One study of 150 children whose seizures
   were poorly controlled by medication found that about one-fourth of the
   children had a 90 percent or better decrease in seizures with the
   ketogenic diet, and another half of the group had a 50 percent or
   better decrease in their seizures. Moreover, some children can
   discontinue the ketogenic diet after several years and remain
   seizure-free. The ketogenic diet is not easy to maintain, as it
   requires strict adherence to an unusual and limited range of foods.
   Possible side effects include retarded growth due to nutritional
   deficiency and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to
   kidney stones. People who try the ketogenic diet should seek the
   guidance of a dietician to ensure that it does not lead to serious
   nutritional deficiency.

   Researchers are not sure how ketosis inhibits seizures. One study
   showed that a byproduct of ketosis called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)
   inhibits seizures in animals. If BHB also works in humans, researchers
   may eventually be able to develop drugs that mimic the
   seizure-inhibiting effects of the ketogenic diet.

   top

      Other Treatment Strategies

   Researchers are studying whether biofeedbacka strategy in which
   individuals learn to control their own brain wavesmay be useful in
   controlling seizures. However, this type of therapy is controversial
   and most studies have shown discouraging results. Taking large doses of
   vitamins generally does not help a persons seizures and may even be
   harmful in some cases. However, a good diet and some vitamin
   supplements, particularly folic acid, may help reduce some birth
   defects and medication-related nutritional deficiencies. Use of
   non-vitamin supplements such as melatonin is controversial and can be
   risky. One study showed that melatonin may reduce seizures in some
   children, while another found that the risk of seizures increased
   measurably with melatonin. Most non-vitamin supplements such as those
   found in health food stores are not regulated by the FDA, so their true
   effects and their interactions with other drugs are largely unknown.

    How Does Epilepsy Affect Daily Life?

   Most people with epilepsy lead outwardly normal lives. Approximately 80
   percent can be significantly helped by modern therapies, and some may
   go months or years between seizures. However, epilepsy can and does
   affect daily life for people with epilepsy, their families, and their
   friends. People with severe seizures that resist treatment have, on
   average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive
   impairment, particularly if the seizures developed in early childhood.
   These impairments may be related to the underlying conditions that
   cause epilepsy or to epilepsy treatment rather than the epilepsy
   itself.

      Behavior and Emotions

   It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to
   develop behavioral and emotional problems. Sometimes these problems are
   caused by embarrassment or frustration associated with epilepsy. Other
   problems may result from bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and
   other social settings. In children, these problems can be minimized if
   parents encourage a positive outlook and independence, do not reward
   negative behavior with unusual amounts of attention, and try to stay
   attuned to their childs needs and feelings. Families must learn to
   accept and live with the seizures without blaming or resenting the
   affected person. Counseling services can help families cope with
   epilepsy in a positive manner. Epilepsy support groups also can help by
   providing a way for people with epilepsy and their family members to
   share their experiences, frustrations, and tips for coping with the
   disorder.

   People with epilepsy have an increased risk of poor self-esteem,
   depression, and suicide. These problems may be a reaction to a lack of
   understanding or discomfort about epilepsy that may result in cruelty
   or avoidance by other people. Many people with epilepsy also live with
   an ever-present fear that they will have another seizure.

   top

      Driving and Recreation

   For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their
   independence, in particular the ability to drive. Most states and the
   District of Columbia will not issue a drivers license to someone with
   epilepsy unless the person can document that they have gone a specific
   amount of time without a seizure (the waiting period varies from a few
   months to several years). Some states make exceptions for this policy
   when seizures dont impair consciousness, occur only during sleep, or
   have long auras or other warning signs that allow the person to avoid
   driving when a seizure is likely to occur. Studies show that the risk
   of having a seizure-related accident decreases as the length of time
   since the last seizure increases. One study found that the risk of
   having a seizure-related motor vehicle accident is 93 percent less in
   people who wait at least 1 year after their last seizure before
   driving, compared to people who wait for shorter intervals.

   The risk of seizures also restricts peoples recreational choices. For
   instance, people with epilepsy should not participate in sports such as
   skydiving or motor racing where a moments inattention could lead to
   injury. Other activities, such as swimming and sailing, should be done
   only with precautions and/or supervision. However, jogging, football,
   and many other sports are reasonably safe for a person with epilepsy.
   Studies to date have not shown any increase in seizures due to sports,
   although these studies have not focused on any activity in particular.
   There is some evidence that regular exercise may even improve seizure
   control in some people. Sports are often such a positive factor in life
   that it is best for the person to participate, although the person with
   epilepsy and the coach or other leader should take appropriate safety
   precautions. It is important to take steps to avoid potential
   sports-related problems such as dehydration, overexertion, and
   hypoglycemia, as these problems can increase the risk of seizures.

   top

      Education and Employment

   By law, people with epilepsy or other handicaps in the United States
   cannot be denied employment or access to any educational, recreational,
   or other activity because of their seizures. However, one survey showed
   that only about 56 percent of people with epilepsy finish high school
   and about 15 percent finish college rates much lower than those for the
   general population. The same survey found that about 25 percent of
   working-age people with epilepsy are unemployed. These numbers indicate
   that significant barriers still exist for people with epilepsy in
   school and work. Restrictions on driving limit the employment
   opportunities for many people with epilepsy, and many find it difficult
   to face the misunderstandings and social pressures they encounter in
   public situations. Antiepileptic drugs also may cause side effects that
   interfere with concentration and memory. Children with epilepsy may
   need extra time to complete schoolwork, and they sometimes may need to
   have instructions or other information repeated for them. Teachers
   should be told what to do if a child in their classroom has a seizure,
   and parents should work with the school system to find reasonable ways
   to accommodate any special needs their child may have.

   top

      Pregnancy and Motherhood

   Women with epilepsy are often concerned about whether they can become
   pregnant and have a healthy child. This is usually possible. While some
   seizure medications and some types of epilepsy may reduce a persons
   interest in sexual activity, most people with epilepsy can become
   pregnant. Moreover, women with epilepsy have a 90 percent or better
   chance of having a normal, healthy baby, and the risk of birth defects
   is only about 4-6 percent. The risk that children of parents with
   epilepsy will develop epilepsy themselves is only about 5 percent
   unless the parent has a clearly hereditary form of the disorder.
   Parents who are worried that their epilepsy may be hereditary may wish
   to consult a genetic counselor to determine what the risk might be.
   Amniocentesis and high-level ultrasound can be performed during
   pregnancy to ensure that the baby is developing normally, and a
   procedure called a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein test can be used
   for prenatal diagnosis of many conditions if a problem is suspected.

   There are several precautions women can take before and during
   pregnancy to reduce the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery.
   Women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should talk with their
   doctors to learn any special risks associated with their epilepsy and
   the medications they may be taking. Some seizure medications,
   particularly valproate, trimethadione, and phenytoin, are known to
   increase the risk of having a child with birth defects such as cleft
   palate, heart problems, or finger and toe defects. For this reason, a
   womans doctor may advise switching to other medications during
   pregnancy. Whenever possible, a woman should allow her doctor enough
   time to properly change medications, including phasing in the new
   medications and checking to determine when blood levels are stabilized,
   before she tries to become pregnant. Women should also begin prenatal
   vitamin supplements especially with folic acid, which may reduce the
   risk of some birth defects well before pregnancy. Women who discover
   that they are pregnant but have not already spoken with their doctor
   about ways to reduce the risks should do so as soon as possible.
   However, they should continue taking seizure medication as prescribed
   until that time to avoid preventable seizures. Seizures during
   pregnancy can harm the developing baby or lead to miscarriage,
   particularly if the seizures are severe. Nevertheless, many women who
   have seizures during pregnancy have normal, healthy babies.

   Women with epilepsy sometimes experience a change in their seizure
   frequency during pregnancy, even if they do not change medications.
   About 25 to 40 percent of women have an increase in their seizure
   frequency while they are pregnant, while other women may have fewer
   seizures during pregnancy. The frequency of seizures during pregnancy
   may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the womans
   increased blood volume during pregnancy, which can dilute the effect of
   medication. Women should have their blood levels of seizure medications
   monitored closely during and after pregnancy, and the medication dosage
   should be adjusted accordingly.

   Pregnant women with epilepsy should take prenatal vitamins and get
   plenty of sleep to avoid seizures caused by sleep deprivation. They
   also should take vitamin K supplements after 34 weeks of pregnancy to
   reduce the risk of a blood-clotting disorder in infants called neonatal
   coagulopathy that can result from fetal exposure to epilepsy
   medications. Finally, they should get good prenatal care, avoid
   tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, and illegal drugs, and try to avoid stress.

   Labor and delivery usually proceed normally for women with epilepsy,
   although there is a slightly increased risk of hemorrhage, eclampsia,
   premature labor, and cesarean section. Doctors can administer
   antiepileptic drugs intravenously and monitor blood levels of
   anticonvulsant medication during labor to reduce the risk that the
   labor will trigger a seizure. Babies sometimes have symptoms of
   withdrawal from the mothers seizure medication after they are born, but
   these problems wear off in a few weeks or months and usually do not
   cause serious or long-term effects. A mothers blood levels of
   anticonvulsant medication should be checked frequently after delivery
   as medication often needs to be decreased.

   Epilepsy medications need not influence a womans decision about
   breast-feeding her baby. Only minor amounts of epilepsy medications are
   secreted in breast milk; usually not enough to harm the baby and much
   less than the baby was exposed to in the womb. On rare occasions, the
   baby may become excessively drowsy or feed poorly, and these problems
   should be closely monitored. However, experts believe the benefits of
   breast-feeding outweigh the risks except in rare circumstances.

   To increase doctors understanding of how different epilepsy medications
   affect pregnancy and the chances of having a healthy baby,
   Massachusetts General Hospital has begun a nationwide registry for
   women who take antiepileptic drugs while pregnant. Women who enroll in
   this program are given educational materials on pre-conception planning
   and perinatal care and are asked to provide information about the
   health of their children (this information is kept confidential). Women
   and physicians can contact this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or
   617-726-7739 (fax: 617-724-8307).

   Women with epilepsy should be aware that some epilepsy medications can
   interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Women who wish
   to use oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy should discuss this
   with their doctors, who may be able to prescribe a different kind of
   antiepileptic medication or suggest other ways of avoiding an unplanned
   pregnancy.

    Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?

   Although most people with epilepsy lead full, active lives, they are at
   special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus
   and sudden unexplained death.

      Status Epilepticus

   Status epilepticus is a severe, life-threatening condition in which a
   person either has prolonged seizures or does not fully regain
   consciousness between seizures. The amount of time in a prolonged
   seizure that must pass before a person should be diagnosed with status
   epilepticus is a subject of debate. Many doctors now diagnose status
   epilepticus if a person has been in a prolonged seizure for 5 minutes.
   However, other doctors use more conservative definitions of this
   condition and may not diagnose status epilepticus unless the person has
   had a prolonged seizure of 10 minutes or even 30 minutes.

   Status epilepticus affects about 195,000 people each year in the United
   States and results in about 42,000 deaths. While people with epilepsy
   are at an increased risk for status epilepticus, about 60 percent of
   people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history.
   These cases often result from tumors, trauma, or other problems that
   affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening.

   While most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment, someone
   with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status
   epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. It is
   important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as
   possible. One study showed that 80 percent of people in status
   epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset
   eventually stopped having seizures, whereas only 40 percent recovered
   if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. Doctors in a
   hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different
   drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures, such as
   administering oxygen, if necessary.

   People in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive
   seizures. Instead, they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive
   seizures. This type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained
   episode of confusion or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily
   have that kind of mental impairment. While this type of episode may not
   seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus, it should still be
   treated as an emergency.

   top

      Sudden Unexplained Death

   For reasons that are poorly understood, people with epilepsy have an
   increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. This
   condition, called sudden unexplained death, can occur in people without
   epilepsy, but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. Researchers
   are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. One study
   suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk
   factor. However, it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs
   causes the sudden death, or whether people who use multiple
   anticonvulsants have a greater risk of death because they have more
   severe types of epilepsy.

    What Research Is Being Done on Epilepsy?

   While research has led to many advances in understanding and treating
   epilepsy, there are many unanswered questions about how and why
   seizures develop, how they can best be treated or prevented, and how
   they influence other brain activity and brain development. Researchers,
   many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Neurological
   Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), are studying all of these questions. They
   also are working to identify and test new drugs and other treatments
   for epilepsy and to learn how those treatments affect brain activity
   and development. NINDS Epilepsy Therapeutics Research Program studies
   potential antiepileptic drugs with the goal of enhancing treatment for
   epilepsy. Since it began in 1975, this program has screened more than
   22,000 compounds for their potential as antiepileptic drugs and has
   contributed to the development of five drugs that are now approved for
   use in the United States as well as others that are still being
   developed or tested.

   Scientists continue to study how excitatory and inhibitory
   neurotransmitters interact with brain cells to control nerve firing.
   They can apply different chemicals to cultures of neurons in laboratory
   dishes to study how those chemicals influence neuronal activity. They
   also are studying how glia and other non-neuronal cells in the brain
   contribute to seizures. This research may lead to new drugs and other
   new ways of treating seizures.

   Researchers also are working to identify genes that may influence
   epilepsy in some way. Identifying these genes can reveal the underlying
   chemical processes that influence epilepsy and point to new ways of
   preventing or treating this disorder. Researchers also can study rats
   and mice that have missing or abnormal copies of certain genes to
   determine how these genes affect normal brain development and
   resistance to damage from disease and other environmental factors.
   Researchers may soon be able to use devices called gene chips to
   determine each persons genetic makeup or to learn which genes are
   active. This information may allow doctors to prevent epilepsy or to
   predict which treatments will be most beneficial.

   Doctors are now experimenting with several new types of therapies for
   epilepsy. In one preliminary clinical trial, doctors have begun
   transplanting fetal pig neurons that produce GABA into the brains of
   patients to learn whether the cell transplants can help control
   seizures. Preliminary research suggests that stem cell transplants also
   may prove beneficial for treating epilepsy. Research showing that the
   brain undergoes subtle changes prior to a seizure has led to a
   prototype device that may be able to predict seizures up to 3 minutes
   before they begin. If this device works, it could greatly reduce the
   risk of injury from seizures by allowing people to move to a safe area
   before their seizures start. This type of device also may be hooked up
   to a treatment pump or other device that will automatically deliver an
   antiepileptic drug or an electric impulse to forestall the seizures.

   Researchers are continually improving MRI and other brain scans.
   Pre-surgical brain imaging can guide doctors to abnormal brain tissue
   and away from essential parts of the brain. Researchers also are using
   brain scans such as magnetoencephalograms (MEG) and magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and study subtle problems in the brain
   that cannot otherwise be detected. Their findings may lead to a better
   understanding of epilepsy and how it can be treated.

    How Can I Help Research on Epilepsy?

   There are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can
   help with research on this disorder. Pregnant women with epilepsy who
   are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these
   drugs affect unborn children by participating in the Antiepileptic Drug
   Pregnancy Registry, which is maintained by the Genetics and Teratology
   Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital (see section on Pregnancy and
   Motherhood). People with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid
   research by participating in the Epilepsy Gene Discovery Project, which
   is supported by the Epilepsy Foundation. This project helps to educate
   people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and
   enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene
   research. People who enroll in this project are asked to create a
   family tree showing which people in their family have or have had
   epilepsy. Researchers then examine this information to determine if the
   epilepsy is in fact hereditary, and they may invite participants to
   enroll in genetic research studies. In many cases, identifying the gene
   defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads
   researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. It also can
   provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of
   individuals in the family.

   People with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications,
   surgical techniques, and other treatments by enrolling in clinical
   trials. Information on clinical trials can be obtained from the NINDS
   as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies,
   universities, and other organizations. A person who wishes to
   participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician
   to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to
   forward all necessary medical records. While experimental therapies may
   benefit those who participate in clinical trials, patients and their
   families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some
   risks. Therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work, and in
   some cases doctors may not yet be certain that the therapies are safe.
   Patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to
   participate in a clinical trial.

   NINDS supports a number of Epilepsy Research Centers that perform a
   broad spectrum of clinical research on epilepsy. Some of the studies
   require patient volunteers. A list of these centers is available from
   the NIH Neurological Institute, which can be reached at the address and
   phone number found on the Information Resources card in the back pocket
   of this brochure.

   Patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating
   their brain to a brain bank after death. Brain banks supply researchers
   with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders. Below
   are some brain banks that accept tissue from patients with epilepsy:

    What To Do If You See Someone Having a Seizure

   If you see someone having a seizure with convulsions and/or loss of
   consciousness, heres how you can help:
    1. Roll the person on his or her side to prevent choking on any fluids
       or vomit.
    2. Cushion the persons head.
    3. Loosen any tight clothing around the neck.
    4. Keep the persons airway open. If necessary, grip the persons jaw
       gently and tilt his or her head back.
    5. Do NOT restrict the person from moving unless he or she is in
       danger.
    6. Do NOT put anything into the persons mouth, not even medicine or
       liquid. These can cause choking or damage to the persons jaw,
       tongue, or teeth. Contrary to widespread belief, people cannot
       swallow their tongues during a seizure or any other time.
    7. Remove any sharp or solid objects that the person might hit during
       the seizure.
    8. Note how long the seizure lasts and what symptoms occurred so you
       can tell a doctor or emergency personnel if necessary.
    9. Stay with the person until the seizure ends.

   top
     __________________________________________________________________

    Call 911 if:

     * The person is pregnant or has diabetes.
     * The seizure happened in water.
     * The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.
     * The person does not begin breathing again and return to
       consciousness after the seizure stops.
     * Another seizure starts before the person regains consciousness.
     * The person injures himself or herself during the seizure.
     * This is a first seizure or you think it might be. If in doubt,
       check to see if the person has a medical identification card or
       jewelry stating that he or she has epilepsy or a seizure disorder.

   After the seizure ends, the person will probably be groggy and tired.
   He or she also may have a headache and be confused or embarrassed. Be
   patient with the person and try to help him or her find a place to rest
   if he or she is tired or doesnt feel well. If necessary, offer to call
   a taxi, a friend, or a relative to help the person get home safely.

   If you see someone having a non-convulsive seizure, remember that the
   persons behavior is not intentional. The person may wander aimlessly or
   make alarming or unusual gestures. You can help by following these
   guidelines:
    1. Remove any dangerous objects from the area around the person or in
       his or her path.
    2. Dont try to stop the person from wandering unless he or she is in
       danger.
    3. Dont shake the person or shout.
    4. Stay with the person until he or she is completely alert.

    Conclusion

   Many people with epilepsy lead productive and outwardly normal lives.
   Many medical and research advances in the past two decades have led to
   a better understanding of epilepsy and seizures than ever before.
   Advanced brain scans and other techniques allow greater accuracy in
   diagnosing epilepsy and determining when a patient may be helped by
   surgery. More than 20 different medications and a variety of surgical
   techniques are now available and provide good control of seizures for
   most people with epilepsy. Other treatment options include the
   ketogenic diet and the first implantable device, the vagus nerve
   stimulator. Research on the underlying causes of epilepsy, including
   identification of genes for some forms of epilepsy and febrile
   seizures, has led to a greatly improved understanding of epilepsy that
   may lead to more effective treatments or even new ways of preventing
   epilepsy in the future.
