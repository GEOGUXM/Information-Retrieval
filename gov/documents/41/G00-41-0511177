   We have built a series of instruments to test and demonstrate imaging
   Fourier Transform interferometry as a viable astronomical
   spectrographic technique.  We evolved these visible band prototype
   imaging Fourier transform spectrograph (IFTS) instruments from other
   LLNL projects.  We have started designing and building a visible-band
   instrument and a mid-infrared instrument for use on 4-meter and
   10-meter class ground-based telescopes.  At the same time, these
   interferometers will also be used to promote IFIRS, an IFTS for Next
   Generation Space Telescope (NGST).  Our group is working in a
   collaboration, led by Prof. James Graham at UC Berkeley, performing a
   NASA pre-Phase A study for an IFTS for the NGST.

                             Theory of Operation

   The advantage of an IFTS for astronomy is that it obtains an
   interferogram for every pixel. These interferograms can be transformed
   into spectra resulting in a true datacube -- "a spectrum for every
   pixel". No field objects need to be pre-selected, no slits need to be
   placed, and co-adding all the frames of the intereferogram yields a
   deep panchromatic image. When designed properly with two cameras, no
   photons are lost -- the instrument is simultaneously an imaging camera
   and high throughput spectrograph.

   The first astronomical imaging Fourier transform spectrograph is a
   near-infrared device named BEAR at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. It
   is customarily used for high resolution spectroscopy studies of
   extended regions.

                         The Ground-Based Instrument

   Livermore has designed, built, and run an IFTS for low background
   astronomical use as a testbed for the proposed IFTS for the NGST. The
   relatively low background in the optical allows us to mimic the long
   dwell, step scan operation of the proposed infrared NGST FTS.

   The first testbed IFTS reflects our current design for IFIRS.  It is a
   four-port (two input, two output) Michelson interferometer with two 45
   degree, self-compensating beamplitters and cube-corner
   retro-reflectors. The interferometric laser metrology system was
   attached to the moving mirror's motion stage, but below the science
   interferometer beam.

                                 First Light

   This system was taken to the 1.5-m McMath-Pierce Solar Observatory
   (MPSO) in March 1999. Because our first prototype was sensitive to a
   changing gravity vector, we picked off the MPSO's horizontal focal
   plane projected onto a (de)rotating table. We collected data at one
   output port with an off-the-shelf PixelVision CCD camera with a
   1024x1024, thinned SITe chip thermoelectrically cooled to 235K. Our
   final plate scale was about 0.4 arcsec/pixel with an unvignetted field
   of about 5 arcmin.

   We presented results from two MPSO datacubes at the June 1999 meeting
   of the American Astronomical Society in Chicago. The first shows the
   IFTS as a low resolution photometer for hundreds of field stars.

   The second is a medium resolution datacube of an emission line region.
   These are the first ever visible band astronomical datacubes presented
   from an IFTS.

                                 What's Next

   Since March 1999, we have evolved the instrument once again. The new
   design will incorporate an interferometer built by Bomem, one of the
   industry partners. In addition, we are including a dispersing prism for
   higher resolution studies, and we will be using a camera on the second
   output port for common-mode rejection as well as increasing the
   throughput by a factor of two. We are planning for an engineering run
   scheduled for September 1999 at a 3.5 meter telescope.
