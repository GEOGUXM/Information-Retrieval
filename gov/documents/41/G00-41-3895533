                   ETHANOL DELEGATION RETURNS FROM MIDWEST

   SACRAMENTO -- A five-person fact-finding team from California has
   returned after a weeklong visit to ethanol-producing areas of the
   Midwest. The delegation was led by Cal/EPA Secretary Winston H. Hickox
   and included representatives of the California Resources Agency and the
   California Energy Commission.

   The group visited four ethanol plants in three states and met with
   government and industry leaders in an effort to more fully understand
   the Midwests perspective on the ethanol issue and to gather information
   on production and logistics. California faces the possibility of being
   required to use up to 900 million gallons of the fuel additive
   beginning in 2003. California will ban the use of the gasoline additive
   MTBE and must substitute another oxygenate, ethanol to meet current
   federal law. Earlier this year the U.S. EPA denied California a waiver
   of the federal oxygenate requirement.

   Last weeks national tragedy meant that some people were unable to
   participate in last weeks meetings and all participants were conscious
   of starker issues. Nonetheless most scheduled visits and meetings
   occurred. A trip to Illinois had to be cancelled.

   The group, including Secretary Hickox, Deputy Secretary Nancy Sutley,
   Resources Agency Chief of Staff James Boyd and Energy Commission
   Executive Director Steve Larson, traveled to Nebraska Monday, Sept. 10.
   It toured ethanol plants in York and Blair, Nebraska; Sioux Center,
   Iowa and Luverne, Minnesota. The delegation also met with Nebraska
   Governor Mike Johanns, the current Chair of the Governors Ethanol
   Coalition and with representatives of the ethanol and railroad
   industries. The last two plants visited are owned by farmers in Iowa,
   Minnesota and South Dakota. Representative farmers briefed the
   delegation on their views of the importance of farmer-owned
   cooperatives in the Midwest ethanol industry.

   Secretary Hickox said on returning to California, We have come back
   with a greater understanding of the Midwestern perspective and a hope
   for a cooperative solution to the current disagreement over the volume
   of ethanol that California will buy. We hope our Midwestern hosts
   understand that we have never been resistant to ethanol as a fuel
   additive, but we do have sincere reservations about the federal ethanol
   mandate.

   We were particularly impressed with the welcome we received, especially
   in the midst of a national tragedy. I hope that we will be able to work
   cooperatively with the Governors Ethanol Coalition and the ethanol
   producers we met to craft a win-win solution that will guarantee
   ethanols future in the nation and give the states currently using MTBE
   (another gasoline additive) the flexibility we need in the immediate
   future.

   I expect to stay in touch with Gov. Johannss staff in the next few
   weeks.

   Secretary Hickox is due to report to Gov. Gray Davis with
   recommendations on the ethanol issue by the end of September.
