     a) Forcing Factors
   (1) Climatic and ecological drivers: The NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use
   Change program will rely primarily on existing components of ESE and
   national and international science agencies for the development of
   historical and climatic data sets.
   (2) Socioeconomic drivers: The NASA program will investigate the human
   dimension processes directly when they are coupled to observed recent
   changes in the landscape or regional predictive models.
   b) Responses and Consequences
   (1) Land-cover conversion: The primary NASA interest is to identify the
   current distribution of land-cover types, and to track Picture from
   John Mustard's 1999 Significant Results their conversion to other
   types. The LCLUC program has a particular interest in the impacts of
   land cover and land use change on biogeochemical cycles (e.g. carbon
   and nitrogen) and the hydrological cycle.
   (2) Land-use intensification: To understand the consequences of
   intensified management of agricultural, agroforestry, and grazing
   systems, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics. To measure the
   longer-term in-situ degradation of forested ecosystems that occurs.
   (3) Land degradation in arid and semi-arid environments: To define,
   develop, and evaluate improved remote sensing measurement techniques
   and data integration methods for characterizing land degradation. The
   objective of the research is to provide scientific understanding and
   observational techniques required for improved efficiency in the
   management of both managed and unmanaged land resources.
   LCLUC researchers are encouraged to use both remote sensing and in-situ
   data, integrated with geographic information system (GIS) techniques,
   in a manner which enables improved assessments of causes of land
   degradation, vulnerability to further degradation, and the development
   of options for more sustainable land uses.
   c) Modeling and Implications
   Picture from Paul Desanker's 1999 Significant Results It is important
   to develop, parameterize, and evaluate models that couple the
   biogeochemical and biophysical dynamics of the land surface and
   atmosphere. This initiative will emphasize the development of data sets
   and techniques that use representations of the actual land-cover
   present and changes in land-cover, rather than potential natural
   vegetation. Links to other process studies in hydrometerology,
   tropospheric chemistry, and aerosol radiative forcing will be explored
   to gain a better understanding of the relationship between changes in
   land-cover, the processes that drive those changes, and biogeochemical
   and physical changes in the Earth's atmosphere and climate system. In
   addition to Picture from Paul Desanker's 1999 Significant Results
   incorporating actual land cover and land cover change in ecosystem
   process models it is important to develop models of land use change.
   Prediction of land use change based on an understanding of the
   processes involved will provide an important tool for framing land
   management questions.
   Ultimately, it will be the ability to model systems undergoing land-use
   change that will provide tools for both scientists and decision-makers
   to evaluate the potential consequences of different management
   practices, and to assess the consequences of policies that affect
   land-cover conversion.
   d) Techniques and Methods
   Close coordination is sought between this initiative and the algorithm
   development and testing which is being supported by the remote sensing
   science component of the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program, the EOS
   Interdisciplinary Science and Instrument Science Teams. The LCLUC
   Program will provide a focus for these activities and should make use
   of the global archives of high resolution satellite data acquired over
   the last twenty years for addressing land-cover and land-use change.
   Picture from Robert Kaufmann's 1999 Significant Results Of particular
   interest is the development of new techniques that focus on the use of
   new and soon-to-be-available remotely sensed data. In particular, NASA
   LCLUC is interested in exploring the potential applications of
   hyperspectral data (e.g. EO1), multi-resolution data (e.g. MODIS,
   Landsat 7, and ASTER), lidar data (e.g. VCL), and very high resolution
   satellite data (e.g. Ikonos). The LCLUC Program is interested in
   technical research oriented towards operational techniques for
   automated change detection at the regional scale, improved
   classification algorithms, and data services, in order to improve the
   state of the art with respect to documenting land-cover and land-use
   change.
   e) Transitioning Research to the Operational Domain
   The LCLUC program is developing a partnership with the Applications
   program with the NASA ESE Applications, Commercialization and Education
   (ACE) Program. The objective of this partnership will be to demonstrate
   the societal relevance of LCLUC research through collaboration with
   operational agencies and organizations in a series of operational pilot
   projects. Emphasis will be given to the Global Observation of Forest
   Cover project, an operational pilot project for the Integrated Global
   Observing Strategy (IGOS).

                      Priority Regions for Case Studies

   From http://www.graphicmaps.com/clipart.htm US and the Americas: The
   LCLUC program is supporting development of new and improved land-cover
   and land-use data for the US at regional and continental scales. In
   addition, NASA is interested in well-documented regional case studies
   that couple land-use, land-cover, atmospheric and climate data, and
   ecosystem or hydrological modeling in order to evaluate the response of
   land systems to multiple stresses. Studies that provide insight into
   the sustainability or vulnerability of the provision ecosystem goods
   and services to a combination of anthropogenic stresses, management
   regimes, and climatic variability will receive priority. Special
   attention is being given to research that improves our understanding of
   the influence of local and regional management decisions on the
   functioning of the landscape.
   From http://www.graphicmaps.com/clipart.htm Southeast Asia: A base of
   scientific investigations must be built within Asian and Southeast
   Asian countries that will assess the consequences of forest conversion
   to agriculture, the long-term, in situ degradation of the forested
   landscape, and agricultural intensification. Proposals that demonstrate
   linkages to in-country scientists and direct links to existing regional
   projects will receive priority.
   From http://www.graphicmaps.com/clipart.htm Southern and Central
   Africa: The land transformations currently going on in the dense humid
   forests, the seasonal woodlands, and savanna systems of Africa are of
   considerable interest to this program. The LCLUC regional activities
   will be developed and implemented in conjunction with existing
   international regional programs such as the USAID Central Africa
   Project for the Environment (CARPE), and the IGBP LUCC-MIOMBO project.
   Proposals that demonstrate linkages to in-country scientists and direct
   links to the host countries will receive priority.
   Russia and the Countries of the Former Soviet Union: The primary LCLUC
   efforts in this region will be to take advantage of data sets and
   studies that have been developed within the context of previous NASA
   initiatives, and to coordinate activities with those of other agencies
   with particular interests in the boreal forest. Investigations that
   focus on understanding the effects of fire, forest management and the
   carbon cycle will receive priority. Proposals that demonstrate linkages
   to in-country scientists and direct links to existing regional research
   activities projects will receive priority.
   Amazon Basin: The Amazon Basin is a key target area for NASA LCLUC
   activities. In order to tie closely to other parts of the ESE program,
   LCLUC joined in a solicitation with the NASA Terrestrial Ecology
   Program's LBA activity as part of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere
   Experiment in Amazonia (LBA).
   Semi Arid Regions: Water availability to a large part determines the
   distribution of agriculture. Changes in precipitation regimes can
   result in changes in land use. Some semi-arid regions are undergoing
   rapid social, economic or demographic changes and there is a need for a
   strong scientific underpinning to resource management. Three areas are
   of current interest to the program: Southern Russia and Central Asia
   and the Middle East.
