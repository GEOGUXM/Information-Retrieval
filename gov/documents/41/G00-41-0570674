                                  What's New?

  Web Changes

     This is where we'll announce the most recent additions to our web
     site, as well as provide notice of upcoming meetings, highlight
     recent media coverage of RTC and transportation issues in general,
     and provide you with the latest press releases RTC has issued.

     If you've visited us before and want to know what's changed, take a
     look here first.

   Public Involvement Plan [newrot.gif]
          Public involvement is a key component of the regional
          transportation decision-making process. As mandated in the
          Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), as
          well as other supporting Federal regulations, and continued in
          the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21),
          Metropolitan Planning Organizations must establish and
          periodically review and update public involvement processes. The
          process should assure early and continued public awareness of,
          and access to, the transportation decision-making process. RTC's
          Public Involvement Process was originally adopted by the
          agency's Board of Directors on July 5, 1994. An update to the
          Public Involvement Process was adopted by the RTC Board on
          October 2, 2001. RTC's Public Involvement Process plan is now
          available for review.

   Vancouver High Occupancy Vehicle Lane Project
          A morning southbound high occupancy vehicle lane is scheduled to
          open in the fall of 2001 with the completion of the I-5 widening
          project. The lane will be located on I-5 from 99th Street to
          Mill Plain Boulevard and will operate from 6 to 9 a.m. Monday
          through Friday. Please visit the Vancouver HOV Lane Project web
          page for more information.

   I-5 Transportation & Trade Partnership
          The I-5 Partnership brings together Washington and Oregon
          citizens and leaders to respond to concerns about growing
          congestion on I-5. The I-5 Partnership is looking at
          transportation needs in the I-5 corridor from I-84 in downtown
          Portland to I-205 north of Vancouver. To gather input from the
          broader public, the Task Force will host several public
          gatherings in Portland and Vancouver at key milestones in the
          process of developing the strategic plan.

   Bi-State Transportation Committee
          The Bi-State Transportation Committee has been organized to
          review all issues of bi-state significance for transportation
          and present recommended actions to JPACT and RTC. We've added a
          section to this website devoted to bringing you all the news
          from this committee.

   I-5 Bridge Repainting and Construction
          Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is busy
          reconstructing I-5 from south of Main Street to north of 78th
          Street. The latest updates are now online.
          The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has recently
          added a lot of fresh new information about both the repainting
          project on the I-5 bridge, as well as an up-to-date listing of
          projects the rest of the I-5 Corridor. Definitely worth taking a
          look at!

   Current Studies
          The I-205 Corridor Study will be looking at congestion on both
          I-205 and local streets, long traffic lines at interchanges,
          accidents, and access for local business.
          The I-5 HOV Corridor Operational Study investigated the
          feasibility and operations of a bi-state HOV facility in the I-5
          corridor. A final report and executive summary are now online.
          Also, ODOT is still conducting an HOV Test Study on I-5 south of
          the bridge.
          The SR-35 Columbia River Bridge Feasibility Study is the result
          of a local grass roots effort by a wide range of individuals who
          are interested in the near and distant future of the White
          Salmon/Bingen, Washington and Hood River, Oregon region.
          The I-5/I-205 North Corridor Study is looking at options for the
          134th/83rd to 319th segments of these freeways.

   Final Reports Now Online
          Given the widespread adoption of Adobe Portable Document Format
          (PDF), we've decided to provide complete online copies of
          reports we produce. Watch this space for more as they become
          available. Recent additions:

          + Transportation System Monitoring and Congestion Management
            Report
          + I-5 HOV Corridor Operational Study
          + Metropolitan Transportation Plan, 1999 Amendment
          + Portland/Vancouver I-5 Trade Corridor Study, Summary Report
          + Clark County High Occupancy Vehicle Study

   Traffic Counts now Downloadable
          We've bundled up nearly 500 pages of traffic count data into a
          Compiled HtmlHelp file that you may now download and run locally
          on your computer. This format (CHM) is the new standard help
          style used by Windows 98 and Windows 2000. Providing the data in
          this format will hopefully ease access restrictions for those
          with intermittant internet availability.

   Web Site Redesign
          You may have noticed a change in design here, to accompany our
          move to a new server. Please bear with us, and feel free to
          offer feedback as the entire site is updated.
          Special note to webmasters: If you previously linked to our old
          site <http://www.wa.gov/rtc>, please update your links to this
          new server <http://www.rtc.wa.gov>. Thanks!
