                          Icing Research Facilties
                        at NASA Glenn Research Center

   In order to accomplish the many, multi-disciplined tasks and goals of
   the Icing Branch, both air and ground-based facilities are required to
   research, test, and develop effective tools and products for icing
   detection and protection.
   For aerial research, the Icing Branch utilizes the capabilities of NASA
   607, a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft, located at NASA Glenn Research Center
   in Cleveland, Ohio. This aircraft has undergone many modifications to
   provide both the branch and NASA a "flying laboratory" for issues
   relating to the study of aircraft icing. Some of the capabilities of
   this research aircraft include development of icing protection systems,
   full-scale iced aircraft aerodynamic studies, software code validation
   for ground-based research, development of remote weather sensing
   technologies, natural icing physics studies, and more. If you would
   like to learn more about the Twin Otter aircraft, please follow the
   link for Icing Research Aircraft.

   For ground-based research, the Icing Branch uses the capabilties of the
   Icing Research Tunnel (IRT), also located at NASA Glenn Research
   Center. The IRT is the world's largest refrigerated wind tunnel and has
   been ensuring flight safety for icing conditions since 1944.
   The IRT is a closed-loop, refrigerated wind tunnel with a 6x9 foot test
   section. It can generate airspeeds from 25 to over 400 miles per hour.
   Models placed in the tunnel can be subjected to droplet sprays of
   varying sizes to produce the effect most natural icing conditions. To
   learn more about the tunnel, please follow the link for the Icing
   Research Tunnel.
