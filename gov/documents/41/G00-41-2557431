                        Teachers of Tomorrow Program

   What is the Teachers of Tomorrow Program?

   On May 15, 2000, the Governor signed into law an amendment to Education
   Law, chapter 62 of the Laws of 2000. This amendment provides funds to
   assist school districts in the recruitment, retention and certification
   activities necessary to increase the supply of teachers in districts
   experiencing a teacher shortage, especially those in low-performing
   schools.

   Is the Teachers of Tomorrow Program another way to obtain teacher
   certification or a means of funding education to become a teacher?

   No, the Teachers of Tomorrow Program is a recruitment and retention
   program for school districts. However, the Education Department does
   have a program for alternative routes to obtain certification.
   Information on this program can be found at www.highered.nysed.gov.
   People interested in funding should check with their college financial
   aid office.

   Who may apply for funding?

   Public school districts with a teacher shortage may apply for funding.
   Individual teachers may not apply for a New York State Education
   Department, Teachers of Tomorrow Program grant. Interested individual
   teachers may contact a local district to determine if that district is
   participating and then may apply through the local districts. Each
   individual district may determine which components they wish to
   participate in and establish procedures for teacher application.

   How may funds be used?

   Funds may be used to support activities in six different categories
   that are described below:

     Recruitment Incentive Program This section provides annual $3400
       grants for from one to four years to teachers with initial,
       provisional, professional, or permanent certification who agree to
       teach in a designated teacher shortage or subject shortage area.
     * Certification Stipends This section allows teachers with temporary
       certification, who agree to teach for at least one year in a
       teacher or subject shortage area, to receive stipends of up to
       $2000 for test preparation workshops or other coursework required
       for initial or provisional certification.

     * Summer in the City Internship Program This section enables the big
       five city school districts of New York City, Buffalo, Rochester,
       Syracuse, and Yonkers to receive funds to provide internships to
       students in Teacher Education Programs to work in Urban areas in a
       summer program. Eligible students may receive up to $2000 for the
       summer program and may be eligible for college credit. This
       internship may also qualify as required field experience for
       graduation.

     New York State Master Teacher Program This section allows school
       districts with low performing schools to use a Nationally Board
       Certified Teacher to serve as a Master Teacher in these schools.
       These Master Teachers will assist in mentoring new teachers and
       will receive an annual $10,000 stipend in addition to their regular
       salary. Master teachers may serve in a low-performing building for
       up to three years.

     Teacher Recruitment Tuition Reimbursement Program This allows
       teachers with initial or provisional certification, who agree to
       teach for at least one year in a teacher or subject shortage area,
       to be reimbursed up to $700/course, $2100/year for the cost of
       approved coursework taken towards earning permanent or professional
       certification. This award is renewable for one additional year.

     Summer Teacher Training Program This section is only applicable to
       New York City and provides for an intensive training course for
       teachers employed for the first time in NYC who have initial,
       provisional, professional or permanent certification to teach in a
       teacher or subject shortage area.

   Is the Teachers of Tomorrow Program another name for Teacher Mentoring?

   No. However, the Master Teacher component of the Teachers of Tomorrow
   Program is one type of teacher mentoring. The Master Teacher component
   is restricted to those teachers with National Board Certification and
   to districts with low performing schools where these teachers will be
   placed. The New York State Education Department does provide funds to
   districts for formalized teacher mentoring programs. For information on
   this program, you may contact Nancy Brennan in the Office of Teaching
   at (518) 474-6440 or
