   The Shoreline Management Act, ("SMA") Chapter 90.58 RCW provides for
   the management of development along the state shorelines. Local
   government has the primary responsibility for initiating the planning
   required by the SMA and administering the regulatory program consistent
   with the policy and provisions of the Act.  The Department of Ecology
   acts primarily in a supportive and review capacity with an emphasis on
   providing assistance to local government and on insuring compliance
   with the policy and provisions of the SMA.
   Local government administers and issues shoreline substantial
   development, conditional use, and variance permits. Approvals by local
   government of shoreline conditional use and variance permits must be
   reviewed by the Ecology, which then issues the final decision. Local
   government and Ecology can also issue fines under the SMA.
   The Shorelines Hearings Board hears appeals from these permit
   decisions, and from those shoreline penalties jointly issued by local
   government and Ecology, or issued by Ecology alone.  The Board is not
   affiliated with any other unit of government.
   Three of the SHB members, who also serve as the Pollution Control
   Hearings Board, are full time employees, appointed by the governor and
   confirmed by the senate. At least one member is an attorney. The three
   other members, who serve part time are: the State Land Commissioner or
   designee, a representative from the Washington State Association of
   Counties, and one from the Association of Washington Cities.
    In appeals involving a single family residence or certain structures
   serving a single family residence, the appeal may be heard by a panel
   of three board members, at least one and not more than two of whom
   shall be members of the Pollution Control Hearings Board.
