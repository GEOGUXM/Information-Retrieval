   U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS NOTICE EFFECTIVE APRIL
   1, 2001 Notice is given of the automatic adjustment of certain dollar
   amounts in the Bankruptcy Code and Official Bankruptcy Forms. On April
   1, 2001, automatic adjustments to the dollar amounts stated in various
   provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, title 11, USC, will become
   effective. These amended amounts will apply to cases filed on or after
   April 1, 2001. Theses amended dollar amounts will affect eligibility of
   a debtor to file under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, certain
   maximum values of property that a debtor may claim as exempt, the
   maximum amount of certain claims entitled to priority, the minimum
   aggregate value of claims needed to commence an involuntary bankruptcy,
   and the value of "luxury goods and services" deemed to be
   nondischargeable. In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress
   provided for the automatic adjustment of these dollar amounts at
   three-year intervals commencing April 1, 1998. The relevant provisions
   are codified in Section 104(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 USC Section
   104(b). Two of the Official Bankruptcy Forms contain reference to
   several of the affected dollar amounts. Accordingly, Official Form 6E,
   Schedule of Creditors Holding Claims Entitled to Priority, and Official
   Form 10, Proof of Claim, will be amended April 1, 2001, and will apply
   to cases filed on and after that date. The new forms and a chart
   showing the affected sections of the Bankruptcy Code are attached to
   this notice.
