      Turning to the Sea: Americas Ocean Future

      We must continue the critical dialogue that has begun and build
   together across party, regional, economic, and other interests a
   comprehensive oceans agenda for the 21st century. . . . We have to make
   this an American issue that transcends party and other philosophical
   differences, that is at the core of our own humanity and our obligation
   to our children and our grandchildren.
    President William Jefferson Clinton
   NATIONAL OCEAN REPORT:
   OCEAN POLICY AND ACTION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

   At the National Ocean Conference last year in Monterey, California,
   President Clinton directed the United States Cabinet to report back
   with recommendations for a comprehensive ocean policy to guide U.S.
   federal efforts in the 21st century. In a report presented September 2,
   1999 to Vice President Al Gore, entitled "Turning to the Sea:
   American's Ocean Future," the Cabinet recommends nearly 150 actions in
   25 key areas to protect, restore, and explore America's ocean
   resources.

   To oversee implementation of the Cabinet recommendations, the Vice
   President announced a new high-level Oceans Report Task Force. The Task
   Force will prioritize the recommendations, appoint lead agencies for
   implementation of key recommendations, and meet quarterly to review
   progress. The Task Force will be co-chaired by the Chair of the Council
   on Environmental Quality and the Deputy National Security Advisor and
   will include high-level representatives of federal agencies with
   responsibility for ocean affairs.

     "Oceans are critical, not just to our economy; not just to our food
   supply; not just to America's trade and security; but to the fabric of
     life itself. Those dark-blue waters are perhaps the single greatest
          natural treasure on God's Earth. Vice President Al Gore
