   Note: While the Court works to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of
   its online slip opinions, it does not make any warranties or
   representations regarding them. Before relying on slip opinions posted
   here, researchers therefore should independently verify the status of
   the opinions and their precedential value. The slip opinion filed with
   the Clerk of the Court is the official court document and, in the event
   of any discrepancy between the opinion filed with the Clerk and that
   made available online, the slip opinion filed with the Clerk of the
   Court controls.
