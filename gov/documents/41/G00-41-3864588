   Pachelbel Software

      This software provides a distributed training system that allows
      multiple people to develop Web-based courses that can facilitate a
      variety of learning styles. Developed at Pacific Northwest National
      Laboratory, Pachelbel has been used to create educational sites for
      personnel safety and security training and even for patients recovering
   from spinal injuries.

   Web sites created with Pachelbel allow students to progress through
   web-based classes on any subject area in a manner consistent with their
   own learning styles. If the learner prefers a graphical approach,
   Pachelbel can format the instructional material with a graphical
   navigation style and graphical examples. A student who prefers to read
   more material can have the graphics suppressed. If the learner likes to
   progress step by step through a process, Pachelbel can provide the
   information in complete courses and lessons. Learners can also hunt and
   peck at the information, searching for a keyword or topic. At every
   point, Pachelbel tracks who the user is, where they currently are in
   the system, and what pages they have visited.

   Pachelbel allows content developers, such as teachers, to write and
   present information with little or no knowledge of how to create and
   manage a Web site.

   With funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
   Pachelbel technology was used to develop a web-based learning program
   for the that allows patients recovering from spinal cord injuries to
   learn about their injuries and access personal assistance and
   counseling information after leaving the hospital. The Washington
   University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mo., used Pachelbel to
   develop the Rehabilitation Learning Center for at-home rehabilitation
   assistance. The online learning environment uses the Pachelbel
   architecture to provide training and reference materials to patients
   working from a personal computer.

   Status: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is exploring licensing
   opportunities as well as creating customized versions to suit specific
   needs.
