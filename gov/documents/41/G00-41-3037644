                             City Council Duties
     __________________________________________________________________

   City Council is the nine-member legislative body for the City of
   Rochester. Five members are elected at-large to represent the entire
   city, while four are elected to represent the four Council districts:
   Northeast, Northwest, South, and east. All Council members serve
   four-year terms. The five at-large representatives are elected at one
   time and the four district representatives are elected two years later.

   Under our Mayor-Council form of government, Rochester has a directly
   elected Mayor to administer the municipal government and a City Council
   to carry out the legislative function.

   One of Council's main duties is the enactment of the City's annual
   budget. Council sets fiscal policies and approves all spending, whether
   for operations (e.g., salaries) or capital items such as major
   equipment purchases, street repairs, or other public improvements.

   The regulation of land use, including the creation and amendment of
   zoning laws, is another significant Council responsibility.

   While most of the proposed laws which come before Council are referred
   by the Administration, Council may also initiate legislation itself.
   Council members will often propose new programs at the suggestion of
   City residents.

   Council members also respond annually to thousands of constituent
   requests, filling a crucial oversight role in the delivery of basic
   City services to the public.

   In addition to these duties, the Council makes decisions regarding the
   fo llowing:
     * Dividing City into election districts
     * Approving City real estate transactions
     * Issuing municipal bonds
     * Approving fees and charges, such as taxicab reates
     * Creating Special Assessment Districts
     * Adopting Home RUle Messages involving State enabling legislation
     * Confirming City Department heads and volunteer members of City
       Boarfds and Commissions
     * Conducting an annual independent audit of the City's finances
     * Investigation all City departments, with access to all records,
       compelling testimony, and issuing subpeonas

Council Committees

   The Council President, chosen by the nine members for a two-year term,
   assigns legislation to one of the Council's five standing Committees:
   Finance and Law; Housing and Community Development; Jobs and Economic
   Development; Parks, Public Works, and the Environment; and Public
   Safety/Public Service.

   The primary function of these Committees is to review all proposed
   legislation and to recommend adoption, consideration or rejection by
   the entire Council, either as written or with amendments. Committees
   generally meet on the Thursday before each regular Council Meeting.
   Call (716) 428-7538 for specific times and dates of individual
   Committee Meetings. The five Committees are as follows:
