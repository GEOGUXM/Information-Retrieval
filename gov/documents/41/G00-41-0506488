     "In the last 30 years, inland flooding has been responsible for more
     than half the deaths associated with tropical cyclones in the United
     States."

                                                              Ed Rappaport

  Consider the following:

   When it comes to hurricanes, wind speeds do not tell the whole story.
   Hurricanes produce storm surges, tornadoes, and often the most deadly
   of all -- inland flooding.

   While storm surge is always a potential threat, more people have died
   from inland flooding in the last 30 years. Intense rainfall is not
   directly related to the wind speed of tropical cyclones. In fact, some
   of the greatest rainfall amounts occur from weaker storms that drift
   slowly or stall over an area.

   Inland flooding can be a major threat to communities hundreds of miles
   from the coast as intense rain falls from these huge tropical air
   masses.

   The United States has a significant hurricane problem. More than 60% of
   our NationÂ¹s population live in coastal states from Maine to Texas,
   Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

   Hurricane Floyd (1999) brought intense rains and record flooding to the
   Eastern U.S. Of the 56 people who perished, 50 drowned due to inland
   flooding.

   Tropical Storm Alberto (1994) drifted over the Southeast United States
   and produced torrential rainfall. More than 21 inches of rain fell at
   Americus, Georgia. Thirty-three people drowned. Damages exceeded $750
   million.

   Tropical Storm Claudette (1979) brought 45 inches of rain to an area
   near Alvin, Texas, contributing to more than $600 million in damages.

   Hurricane Agnes (1972) produced floods in the Northeast United States
   which contributed to 122 deaths and $6.4 billion in damages. Long after
   the winds from Hurricane Diane (1955) subsided, the storm brought
   inland flooding to Pennsylvania, New York, and New England contributing
   to nearly 200 deaths and $4.2 billion in damages.

   So, the next time you hear hurricane -- think inland flooding!

  What can you do?

     * When you hear hurricane, think inland flooding.
     * Determine whether you live in a potential flood zone.
     * If advised to evacuate, do so immediately.
     * Keep abreast of road conditions through the news media.
     * Move to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water.
       Develop a flood emergency action plan with your community leaders.
