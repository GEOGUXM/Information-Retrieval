  INTRODUCTION

   Heavy surf and rains severely eroded beaches and fragile sea cliffs
   along the coast of San Mateo County, California during the severe
   winter storms of 1982-83, the last El Niño climatic event. During that
   storm season, the main coastal highway was damaged and closed for a
   considerable period of time by landslides, and many buildings were
   damaged or threatened by sea-cliff retreat and slope failure.

   In the Spring of 1983, the USGS photographed the San Mateo County coast
   from the air and on the ground to document the cliff erosion and
   structural damage caused by the severe winter storms. Much of the
   resultant data set was published in a general article on coastal
   erosion in San Mateo County (Lajoie and Mathieson, 1985), but the
   complete data set was never published as a separate document.

   The purpose of this report is to present the complete data set in a
   useful format prior to the potentially damaging storms of the predicted
   1997-98 El Niño storm season. This information should prove useful to
   coastal residents, and to local emergency-response agencies, as a guide
   to potential erosion hazards along the San Mateo County Coast.

  COASTAL STABILITY MAP

   Segments of the San Mateo County coast are classified as stable and
   unstable based on the inherent resistance of the exposed rocks to wave
   erosion and slope failure (see coastal stability map). The stable
   coastal segments in the northern part of the county are backed by
   resistant granitic rocks, which form high bluffs (maps 5 and 6) to low
   cliffs (map 7). The stable coastal segments in the southern part of the
   county (maps 20 to 24) are backed by resistent sedimentary rocks that
   form low cliffs. Coastal segments of intermediate stability are backed
   by moderately resistent sedimentary rocks that form high bluffs (maps 4
   and 16) and low-to-high cliffs (maps 7 to 9, 12 to 18, 25, and 26).

   Unstable coastal segments are backed by weakly indurated or highly
   fractured sedimentary rocks that form high bluffs (maps 1 to 2, and 8),
   weakly indurated terrace deposits that form low cliffs (maps 3, 4, 6,
   7, 9 to 12, and 23 to 25), and loose beach and dune sand that forms
   spits and low cliffs (maps 4, 9, 10, 19, and 23 to 25). Along much of
   the San Mateo County coast, fragile terrace and loose dune deposits
   overlie resistent to moderately resistent bedrock. In those areas the
   base of the cliff is stable and the upper part is unstable. If the
   cliff is sufficiently high that wave surge does not erode the terrace
   deposits exposed in the upper part of the cliff face, that coastal
   segment is classified as stable (maps 7, and 18 to 23).

  CRITICAL EROSION MAP

   Critical erosion is here defined as any coastal erosion that threatens
   or damages man-made structures. Cliff erosion that does not threaten or
   damage man-made structures is not classified as critical, even though
   it might be severe. Most critical coastal erosion occurs in the
   northern part of San Mateo County where development is much denser than
   in the southern part (see critical erosion map).

  COASTAL EROSION MAPS

   Notes describing the moderate to severe coastal erosion in San Mateo
   County during the 1982-83 El Niño are compiled on twenty-six page-sized
   maps at a scale of 1:12,000 (see coastal erosion index map). The bases
   for these maps are enlarged portions of the 7 USGS 7.5' topographic
   quadrangles that cover the coastal area of San Mateo County (see
   coastal erosion and geology index maps). Notes describing critical
   erosion are colored red, and those describing noncritical erosion are
   colored black. The areas of critical erosion are summarized separately
   on a smaller-scale map (see critical erosion map).

  COASTAL GEOLOGY MAPS

   The erosion information presented on the coastal erosion maps is placed
   in a geologic context on twenty-six coastal geology maps using the same
   bases as the coastal erosion maps (see coastal geology index map). The
   geology maps generalize coastal morphology and geology by means of
   schematic cross sections. Natural coastal processes such as cliff
   erosion, slope failure, wave erosion, landslides, block falls, debris
   slides, and cave collapse are illustrated diagrammatically on the cross
   sections. Ultimately, wave erosion is the primary or initiating erosive
   process along the San Mateo County coast. Waves erode the base of the
   sea cliffs or coastal bluffs, thus oversteepening and destabilizing the
   slopes above. Landslides, debris slides, and block falls are secondary
   erosive agents that move loosened rock material down the slopes to the
   beaches below, where the material is eventually eroded away by wave
   activity. Along most of the San Mateo County coast groundwater that
   seeps from the cliff face softens and loosens even otherwise resistent
   bedrock material, thus contributing to the erosional process.

  COASTAL HAZARDS

   Basically, there are no natural hazards; there are just natural
   processes such as coastal erosion, slope failure, and flooding. Man
   creates hazards when ignoring the potential adverse impacts of these
   processes. Most of the erosion hazards along the coast of San Mateo
   County are of this nature. Buildings and roads were placed directly on
   exposed beaches (map 5), directly on active landslides (map 8), or too
   close to the edge of rapidly retreating sea cliffs (map 3) and
   landslide scarps (map 2).

   Furthermore, man often creates hazards in previously stable areas by
   altering the natural environment in such a way that erosional processes
   are initiated or greatly accelerated. For example, at Thornton Beach
   (map 1) surface runoff from a broad slope was concentrated into small
   drains that failed during the heavy rains of 1982-83. As a consequence,
   a deep ravine was eroded below one drain, destroying part of a road.
   Nearby, a landslide was formed below a second failed drain. That
   landslide dropped 7 meters in the winter of 1982-83, cutting two
   streets and damaging several houses; some of the houses were eventually
   moved to prevent destruction. To the south in Pacifica (map 3), another
   inadequate drain failed, resulting in severe gully erosion that led to
   destruction of the southern end of a riprap seawall protecting a
   mobile-home park. The breach in the seawall focused wave energy behind
   the remaining part of the wall, which was then completely destroyed.
   The fragile sea cliff previously protected by the wall was cut back 10
   to 15 meters, destroying several mobile-home pads. Farther south, just
   north of Devils Slide (map 5) and at Martini Creek (maps 5 and 6),
   failed drains beneath road fills completely destroyed sections of
   Highway 1, resulting in extended road closure. At Half Moon Bay (maps 9
   and 10), a rubble-mound breakwater built in 1959-60 focussed wave
   energy at low, previously stable cliffs, resulting in sustained cliff
   erosion, which threatens Highway 1 to this day (Mathieson, Lajoie, and
   Hamilton, 1997). Surprisingly, the 1982-83 increment of erosion at this
   site, though significant, was not unusually large.

   The coastal-erosion hazards and damage documented in this report could
   have been avoided or minimized by recognizing the nature of the active
   coastal processes, establishing their rates and planning set-backs and
   restrictive zones accordingly. Determining the rates of incremental
   processes (such as coastal erosion), however, is often difficult owing
   mainly to the short historical record. Also, rates of sea-cliff retreat
   usually vary drastically with time. A section of sea cliff might not
   erode for years or even decades and might therefore appear stable, but
   eventually a large storm might cut deeply into the cliff face. This
   sequence of events actually occurred on the north side of Mori Point
   (map 4), where a high beach berm built up over several decades
   protected low, fragile cliffs from wave attack. A building constructed
   close to the cliff edge survived many years unscathed, but heavy surf
   in the winter of 1982-83 stripped the protective beach and cut the
   cliff back about 20 meters, destroying the building. Unprotected, the
   cliff was again cut back 7 meters by just moderate surf in the winter
   of 1983-84. The beach berm at that site might again rebuild and provide
   protection for the cliff for another few decades. However, in the
   future the erosive phase of the cycle will probably be repeated.

  SUMMARY

   The erosional effects and resultant coastal hazards of the severe
   1982-83 El Niño winter storms documented in this report should be a
   reasonable guide to what might be expected along the coast of San Mateo
   County in the coming winter, if the predicted El Niño event occurs at
   full intensity. Hopefully, the data set will prove useful to coastal
   residents and various county agencies in preparing for the coming
   storms.
