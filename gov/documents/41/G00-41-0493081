   Assateague Isand, Worcester County, MD Assateague Island is a barrier
   island on Maryland's Atlantic coast. This is a view of northern
   Assateague Island, looking north toward Ocean City, Maryland. The gray
   roads and parking lots are part of Maryland's popular Assateague State
   Park. The island forms a barrier between the Atlantic Ocean and
   Worcester County. In terms of geologic time, barrier islands are
   ephemeral features; dynamic testaments to the inexorable rise of the
   ocean. Sea levels along the Atlantic coast have been rising for
   thousands of years and will continue to rise until the beginning of a
   new ice age. As the ocean rises these islands are pushed westward
   toward the mainland by waves and currents.

   The eastward-curving hook of sand in the center of the photo is the
   northern tip of Assateague, which ends at the Ocean City Inlet. North
   of this point, the southern end of Fenwick Island and Ocean City can be
   seen through the haze. Notice how the tip of Assateague is greatly
   offset to the west of Fenwick Island. The stabilization of Ocean City
   Inlet in the 1930's has starved northern Assateague beaches of sand,
   accelerating the westward migration of the island.

   For information on Assateague and other coastal parks follow this link
   to Maryland Seashore National and State Parks. Check out our "Need for
   Sand in Ocean City", "Offshore Sand Resources" and "Resource Assessment
   of Atlantic Coast Area" pages for related topics.

   Several publications describing the geology of the region are available
   for download in Adobe Acrobat format on our Internet publications
   pages.
