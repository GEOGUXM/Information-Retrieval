   The ITS Deployment Analysis System (IDAS) is software developed by the
   Federal Highway Administration that can be used in planning for
   Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) deployments. State, regional,
   and local planners can use IDAS to estimate the benefits and costs of
   ITS investments which are either alternatives to or enhancements of
   traditional highway and transit infrastructure. IDAS can currently
   predict relative costs and benefits for more than 60 types of ITS
   investments. Practitioners will find a number of useful features that
   enhance ITS planning.
