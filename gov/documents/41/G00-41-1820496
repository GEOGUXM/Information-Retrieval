      How to Have Federal Taxes Withheld from Your Social Security Benefit

     Although you're not required to have federal taxes withheld from your
     Social Security benefit, you may find that easier than paying lump-sum
     payments out of your pocket.

     To have your taxes withheld, you must:
      1. Complete IRS Form W-4V (Voluntary Withholding Request).
         Note: This form is in Adobe Portable Document Format. If you do not
         already have the Adobe Acrobat Reader software, please see our
         instructions on how to access a Portable Document file.
      2. Select what percentage of your monthly benefit amount you want
         withheld either 7%, 10%, 15% or 27%.
         Only these percentages can be used. Flat dollar amounts are not
         acceptable.
      3. After you've made your selection, sign and return the form to your
         local Social Security office by mail or in person.
         To get the address of your local Social Security office, click here
         or call 1-800-772-1213.

     If you want to know how much a particular percentage is equal to in
     dollars, call us at 1-800-772-1213.

     However, if you have questions about your tax liability or want to
     request a Form W-4V, call IRS at 1-800-829-3676. You can also obtain a
     copy of this form by clicking here.

     Each time you want to change your withholding (or stop the
     withholding), complete the form and send it to Social Security.
