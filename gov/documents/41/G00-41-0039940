  [world.gif] Contributions at Many Levels: A Summary

   [bluebar.gif]

   The Aeronomy Laboratory contributes to all steps of the process that
   leads to fundamental science in the service of humankind:

   [world.gif] making landmark scientific discoveries
     * discovering the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole
     * understanding the processes that determine the quality of the air
       we breathe
     * studying how the atmosphere's chemistry and physics might influence
       the climate of the Earth
     * extending wind and precipitation measurements in the tropical
       Pacific, to better understand and better predict El Ni√±o

   [world.gif] participating in the periodic international efforts that
   assess the "state of the science" on the topics of ozone depletion,
   climate change, and air quality
     * playing leading roles in the coordination, preparation, and review
       of the World Meteorological Organization/United Nations Environment
       Programme scientific assessments of ozone depletion
     * playing leading roles in the preparation and review of the
       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments
     * playing leading roles in the planning, preparation, and review of
       the North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone
       scientific assessment of surface-level ozone

   [world.gif] providing scientific input to national and international
   policymakers
     * responding to requests for scientific information and briefings
       from state and federal government leaders
     * serving as science advisor to the U.S. delegation at meeting of the
       United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
     * serving as scientific consultant for the United Nations Environment
       Programme during Meetings of the Parties to the United Nations
       Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer

   [world.gif] providing the scientific basis for decisions made in
   industry
     * evaluating the "ozone friendliness" of proposed new substitutes for
       chlorofluorocarbons, before expensive development costs are
       incurred by private industry
     * determining the climate impacts of human-made substances with
       commercial or industrial applications

   [world.gif] public education on the science of environmental issues
   that affect society
     * teaching undergraduate or graduate students at the university or
       one-time specialized courses
     * preparing materials for use by the general public and in schools
     * making presentations at schools, science festivals, and community
       group meetings
     * responding to individual requests for information
