[flagrule.gif]

Internship

   The Special Committee on Aging has established a competitive paid
   internship program that provides a vital educational experience. The
   Committee has tailored the internship program to college students who
   have specific interests in aging issues.

   An internship with the Committee is an opportunity to learn the
   dynamics of Capitol Hill and the legislative process. Ideal candidates
   should possess the abilities to communicate effectively and to conduct
   extensive research. As part of the educational experience, interns will
   attend Congressional hearings plus observe speeches on the Senate
   floor. Also, interns may attend classes offered by the Congressional
   Research Service.
   Availability

   Internships are available in the fall, spring, and summer semesters and
   last about four months. Depending upon your college or university's
   rules for internship programs, course credit may apply to this
   internship. Due to the competitive selection process, it is recommended
   that prospective candidates apply as early as possible.

   Fall Semester - June 1
