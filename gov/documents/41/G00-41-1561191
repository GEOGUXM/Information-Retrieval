                               UTC Background

   The University Transportation Centers (UTC) program, initiated in 1987
   under the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act,
   authorized the establishment and operation of transportation centers in
   each of the 10 standard federal regions. The Intermodal Surface
   Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) reauthorized the UTCs for
   an additional six years and added four national centers and six
   University Research institutes (URI). The mission of the 14 UTCs was to
   advance U.S. expertise and technology transfer. The six URIs each had a
   specific transportation research and development mandate.
