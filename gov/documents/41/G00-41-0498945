   The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) is the
   automated weather information communication, processing, and display
   system of the National Weather Service (NWS).  Its state-of-the-art
   technology and computational capabilities perform interactive
   processing, display, and automated analysis of weather conditions as
   they occur.  Consequently, AWIPS is the key integrating component of
   NWS's overall modernization program.  AWIPS provides other
   organizations, such as the Air Weather Service and the Federal Aviation
   Administration, with a variety of automated weather information
   communications and processing services as well.
