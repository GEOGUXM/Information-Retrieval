   States Activities

      State Industries of the Future
      Broadening the Reach of National Priorities

      The State Industries of the Future program delivers the accomplishments
      of the national Industries of the Future strategy to the local level.
      The idea is not to recreate national efforts, but rather to expand
      these opportunities to a larger number of partners and reach smaller
      businesses and manufacturers that were not initially involved in the
      IOF effort. The program brings together industry, academia, and state
      agencies to address the important issues confronting industry in the
      state. These public-private coalitions facilitate industry solutions
      locally and enhance economic development.

      Solicitations

      Solicitations

      OIT awards cost-shared funding for R&D projects through a competitive
      solicitation process. Projects are performed by collaborative
      partnerships and must address industry-specified priorities. In this
      way, OIT maintains a balanced portfolio of R&D projects that will help
      realize national goals for energy and the environment.
