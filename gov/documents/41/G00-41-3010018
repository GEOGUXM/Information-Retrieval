   SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROGRAM IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CATALOG [contents.gif]
   [previous.gif] [next.gif]

   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government's
   primary agency for the support of biomedical research. Within its
   Institutes and Centers,  the NIH employs approximately 14,800 people
   including 900 tenured faculty and nearly 3,000 postdoctoral fellows
   with either medical, dental, or graduate degrees.

   Successful applicants will join one of our research laboratories for a
   minimum of eight weeks between late May and August. Some flexibility in
   scheduling exists to accommodate individual student needs. Start dates
   are determined by the selecting officials and other institute staff.

   At the end of the summer, students are strongly encouraged to
   participate in the Summer Research Program Poster Day. This provides an
   opportunity for students to present their work before the NIH
   scientific community. Students are also expected to participate in
   meetings and seminars in their individual laboratories. In addition,
   with permission from their preceptors, students may also attend formal
   lectures and symposia which are listed in the weekly "NIH Calendar of
   Events."

   Living Arrangements

   Although housing is not available on the NIH campus, program staff will
   assist students in locating housing in the community. Several area
   colleges rent dormitory rooms to students during the summer months.
   Information on housing is sent to students upon their selection to the
   program.  Students are responsible for making their own travel and
   living arrangements.

   For students participating in programs at the National Institute of
   Aging's Gerontology Research Center, housing in Baltimore may be
   available in the house staff apartments at  the Hopkins Bayview Medical
   Center. This facility is located about 10 minutes from the Johns
   Hopkins Hospital, 15 minutes from downtown Baltimore and the hospital
   at the University of Maryland.

   Citizenship Requirements

   Students must be either United States citizens or permanent residents
   of the United States. Permanent residents will be asked to submit a
   copy of their alien registration card upon selection.

   Eligibility

   At the time of application students must be currently enrolled at least
   half-time in an accredited U.S. high school, college, or graduate
   school. High School students should be at least 16 years of age prior
   to June 1.

   Academic Programs Available to Students

   The NIH Library, located in the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center,
   provides a central facility for the scientific, medical,
   administrative, and support staff engaged in NIH research programs. In
   addition to the usual library services, the NIH Library provides
   translating services and on-line access to the medical literature data
   banks of the National Library of Medicine, which is also located on the
   NIH campus. Small research libraries are available in most
   laboratories, and have access to electronic searching.

   Financial Support

   Students in NIH summer research programs are supported through a
   variety of mechanisms including the Intramural Research Training Award
   (IRTA), the Cancer Research Training Award (CRTA) and the Student
   Employment Program (STEP).  The selected mechanism is at the discretion
   of the individual Institute or Center and some financial disparities
   may exist.  Support may range from $1,100 for high school students
   before graduation to $2,400 per month for those students with three or
   more years of graduate school.   Students are responsible for their own
   travel and housing expenses.
   Transportation

   The Metro (subway) stop (Medical Center) and bus stops located on the
   NIH campus permit easy access from nearby areas in Maryland, Virginia
   and Washington, D.C.

   Parking
   Parking for vehicles on the NIH main campus in Bethesda is limited.
   Consequently, participants in NIH summer programs are authorized to
   park their vehicles only at satellite parking facilities that are
   located in Rockville and downtown Bethesda.  Shuttle bus service is
   available from these facilities to buildings on the main campus.

   Cultural and Recreational Opportunities

   The NIH is located just 20 minutes from downtown Washington, where
   cultural and recreational opportunities are abound. The Kennedy Center
   for the Performing Arts offers the National Symphony Orchestra, ballet,
   opera, and drama, and Wolf Trap Farm Park stages musical and theatrical
   events in the summer. A stay in the nation's capital offers an
   opportunity to visit the city's historical sites and national monuments
   and to observe national politics close at hand. Nearby parks offer
   hiking, camping, bicycling, canoeing, and rock climbing. About a hour
   from the NIH campus in Bethesda is Baltimore's Inner Harbor, aquarium,
   museums, theater, libraries, and Orioles Park at Camden Yards as well
   as other cultural institutions which offer varied extracurricular
   attractions.
