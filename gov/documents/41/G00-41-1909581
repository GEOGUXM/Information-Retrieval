   The Long Beach Camera, perched high atop city hall in downtown Long
   Beach, is on 24 hours per day and points at the Pacific Ocean.

   The camera is a dedicated Panasonic camera linked to NBC4 over a
   fiber-optic line running through Pacific Bell's Southern California
   fiber network. The camera generally points toward the Southwest,
   although it is often repositioned for use on the air. At NBC4, the feed
   is moved from the routing room into a Pentium II server running Windows
   NT and WebCam32 Image Server. The image is "live" meaning that it
   updates every time you load the page.
