   On June 5 and 6, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory will open its doors to
   the public. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.

   The JPL Archives will have an exhibit entitled "Venus Revealed" in the
   lobby of the JPL Library, Building 111. It includes images of Venus
   from several different missions, including Mariner Venus-Mercury 1973
   and Magellan.

   A video entitled "From the Arroyo to Deep Space: The First 50 Years of
   JPL" will also be shown continuously in the lobby.
