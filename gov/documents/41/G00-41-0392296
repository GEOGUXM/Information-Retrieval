   Russia's Volga River is the largest river system in Europe, draining
   over 1.3 million square kilometers of catchment area into the Caspian
   Sea. The brackish Caspian is Earth's largest landlocked water body, and
   its isolation from the world's oceans has enabled the preservation of
   several unique animal and plant species. The Volga provides most of the
   Caspian's fresh water and nutrients, and also discharges large amounts
   of sediment and industrial waste into the relatively shallow northern
   part of the sea. These images of the region were captured by the
   Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on October 5, 2001, during Terra
   orbit 9567. Each image represents an area of approximately 275
   kilometers x 376 kilometers.

   The left-hand image is from MISR's nadir (vertical-viewing) camera, and
   shows how light is reflected at red, green, and blue wavelengths. The
   right-hand image is a false color composite of red-band imagery from
   MISR's 60-degree backward, nadir, and 60-degree forward-viewing
   cameras, displayed as red, green, and blue, respectively. Here, color
   variations indicate how light is reflected at different angles of view.
   Water appears blue in the right-hand image, for example, because sun
   glitter makes smooth, wet surfaces look brighter at the forward
   camera's view angle. The rougher-textured vegetated wetlands near the
   coast exhibit preferential backscattering, and consequently appear
   reddish. A small cloud near the center of the delta separates into red,
   green, and blue components due to geometric parallax associated with
   its elevation above the surface.

   Other notable features within the images include several linear
   features located near the Volga Delta shoreline. These long, thin lines
   are artificially maintained shipping channels, dredged to depths of at
   least 2 meters. The crescent-shaped Kulaly Island, also known as Seal
   Island, is visible near the right-hand edge of the images.

   MISR was built and is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
   Pasadena, CA, for NASA's Office of Earth Science, Washington, DC. The
   Terra satellite is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
   Greenbelt, MD. JPL is a division of the California Institute of
   Technology.
