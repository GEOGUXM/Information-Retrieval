                           Acting Assistant Inspector General for Investigations

   We are responsible for investigating possible wrongdoing involving
   organizations or individuals that receive awards from, conduct business
   with, or work with the Foundation. In investigating these allegations
   we assess their seriousness and recommend proportionate action. When
   appropriate, the results of these investigations are referred to the
   Department of Justice or other prosecutorial authorities for criminal
   prosecution or civil litigation, or to the Foundation for
   administrative resolution.

   The Civil/Criminal Investigations section is responsible for
   investigating violations of criminal statutes or regulations involving
   NSF employees, grantees, contractors, and other individuals conducting
   business with NSF. The results of these investigations are referred to
   federal, state, or local authorities for criminal prosecution or civil
   litigation, or to NSF's Office of the Director for administrative
   resolution.
