   1. Introduction. This chapter assigns responsibilities and provides
   guidelines for preparing and disseminating marine weather warnings,
   advisories, and forecasts for the oceanic areas of the United States
   (U.S.) and for those high seas areas that the U.S. has assumed
   international forecast and warning responsibility. Except for those
   procedures or practices that are mandatory (denoted by the word
   "shall"), National Weather Service (NWS) regions may adapt the
   guidelines of this chapter to more specific operating instructions. See
   Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter D-07 for a general
   discussion of the policy and structure of the marine weather services
   programs. Other closely related WSOM chapters are: D-52, Marine
   Services for the Great Lakes; C-43, Coastal Flooding; C-40, Severe
   Local Storm Warnings; C-41, Hurricane Warnings; and C-44,
   Non-Precipitation Hazards.

   2. Definitions. (See also WSOM Chapters C-40 and C-41)

   Basic Marine Area: Specific, defined over-water areas contained in the
   various Coastal Marine Forecasts. These are the equivalent of "zones"
   in the public forecast program. All Basic Marine Areas are listed in
   appendix A.

   Coastal Waters: The marine area, including bays, harbors, and sounds,
   from a line approximating the mean high water mark (average height of
   high water over a 19-year period) along the mainland or near-shore
   islands out to as much as 100 nautical miles (NM), as specified in
   appendix A.

   Combined Seas: Generally referred to as "SEAS." The combination or
   interaction of wind waves and swell. In some prediction techniques, its
   height is the square root of the sum of the squares of the wind wave
   and swell heights. It is generally equal to the height of the swell
   plus 1/3 the height of the wind waves.

   Complex Gale/Storm: In the High Seas Forecast, an area for which
   gale/storm force winds are forecast or are occurring but for which no
   single center is the principal generator of these winds.

   Continental Shelf (CONSHELF):The zone bordering a continent and
   extending to a depth, usually around 100 fathoms (600 feet), from which
   there is a steep descent toward greater depth.
     __________________________________________________________________




   Continental Slope: The area of descent from the edge of the continental
   shelf into
   greater depth.

   Contractions: The following are approved for use in all marine forecast
   texts.

   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): The standard international time
   reference based on the time at 0E longitude (Greenwich meridian).

   County Warning Area: Those counties assigned to a specific NWS office
   for warning and weather distribution purposes as described in WSOM
   Chapter C-47.

   Developing Gale/Storm: In the High Seas Forecast, a headline used in
   the warnings section to indicate that gale/storm force winds are not
   now occurring but are expected before the end of the forecast period.

   Fathom: Unit of depth in the ocean equal to 6 feet (ft).

   Fetch: The marine area in which waves are generated by winds having an
   approximately constant direction and speed.

   Freezing Spray: An accumulation of freezing water droplets on a vessel
   caused by some appropriate combination of cold sea water, wind, cold
   air temperature, and vessel movement.
     __________________________________________________________________




   Gale Warning: A warning of sustained winds in the range 34 to 47 knots
   (KT) inclusive either predicted or occurring not associated with
   tropical cyclones.

   Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS): An internationally
   agreed upon communications system for distributing safety information,
   including weather warnings and forecasts, to mariners.

   Gust: A rapid fluctuation of wind speed with variations of 10 KT or
   more between peaks and lulls.

   High Seas: The major oceans of the world including, for NWS purposes,
   the coastal and offshore areas. Areas of responsibility for the United
   States are determined by international agreements under the auspices of
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Specific NWS office
   responsibilities are noted in appendix A.

   Hurricane Warning: A warning for sustained winds of 64 KT or greater
   either predicted or occurring associated with a tropical cyclone.

   Knot: Unit of speed used in navigation, equal to 1 NM per hour or about
   1.15 statute miles per hour.

   Marine Weather Statement: A product to provide mariners with details on
   significant or potentially hazardous conditions not otherwise covered
   in existing marine warnings and forecasts.

   Nautical Mile: Unit of distance used in marine navigation, equal to
   approximately 1.15 statute miles (length of 1 minute of latitude).

   Navigational Telex (Navtex): One part of the GMDSS system for
   automatically disseminating safety information, including weather
   warnings and forecasts, in text form via medium frequency radio to
   mariners within approximately 200 NM of shore.

   Offshore Waters: That portion of the oceans, gulfs, and seas beyond the
   coastal waters extending to a specified distance from the coastline, to
   a specified depth contour, or covering an area defined by specific
   latitude and longitude points. NWS areas of responsibility for these
   are included in appendix A.

   Predominant Wind: The predominant wind is the wind that, in the
   forecaster's judgement, generates (or is expected to generate) the
   local component of the significant sea conditions across the forecast
   area.

   SafetyNET: A satellite based part of the GMDSS system for automatically
   disseminating safety information, including weather warnings and
   forecasts, to mariners almost anywhere on the world's oceans.

   Severe Local Storm Warning: A warning of severe thunderstorms or
   tornadoes. In this chapter, it primarily refers to those warnings
   affecting adjoining coastal land and water areas.

   Significant Wave Height: The average height (trough to crest) of the
   one-third highest waves. An experienced observer will most frequently
   report heights equivalent to the average of the highest one-third of
   all waves observed.

   Small Craft Advisory: An advisory in coastal waters for winds from
   approximately 18 to 33 KT inclusive (lower limit may vary by Region) or
   for sea conditions, either predicted or occurring, that are considered
   potentially hazardous to small boats. There is no legal definition for
   "small craft."

   Special Marine Warning: A severe local storm warning affecting coastal
   water areas, or a warning of potentially hazardous weather conditions
   usually of short duration (2 hours or less) and producing wind speeds
   of 34 KT or more that is not adequately covered by existing marine
   warnings.

   Storm Warning: A warning of sustained winds of 48 KT or more, either
   predicted or occurring, not associated with tropical cyclones.

   Sustained Wind: The wind speed obtained by averaging observed values
   over a period of at least 1 minute.

   Swell: Wind-generated waves that have traveled out of their generating
   area. Swells characteristically exhibit smoother, more regular and
   uniform crests and a longer period than wind waves.

   Tropical Cyclone: A non-frontal, warm-core, low pressure system of
   synoptic scale, developing over tropical or subtropical waters and
   having a definite organized circulation.

   Tropical Storm Warning: A warning of sustained winds from 34 to 63 KT
   inclusive either predicted or occurring, associated with tropical
   cyclones.

   Waterspout: A rotating column of air, usually pendant from a cumulus or
   cumulonimbus cloud, that forms over water and whose circulation extends
   to the surface.

   Wave Spectrum: The distribution of wave energy with respect to wave
   frequency or period. Wave spectra assist in differentiating between
   wind waves and swells.

   Wind Waves: Local, short period waves generated from the action of wind
   on the water surface (as opposed to swell).

                  Terminology Used in NWS Marine Forecasts

   Seas: Used to describe the combination or interaction of wind waves and
   swells (combined seas) in which the separate components are not
   distinguished. This includes the case when swells are negligible or are
   not considered in describing sea state.

   Swell: Used when the forecaster determines that this wave type is
   present or will occur.

   Wind Waves: May be referred to as WAVES. Used to describe local
   wind-generated waves of short wave period and duration. Used when
   swells are described in the forecast.

   3.Organizational Responsibilities.

   3.1 National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH)). Overall
   responsibility for the marine weather service program rests with the
   Assistant Administrator for Weather Services. Staff assistance is
   provided by the Director, Office of Meteorology, with the Chief, Marine
   and Applied Services Branch, serving as principal advisor.

   3.2 Regional Headquarters. Regional Headquarters shall:

               a. Operate, monitor, and maintain the marine weather
   services program within their areas of                   responsibility
   and provide Regional guidelines and instructions to field offices, as
   required.

               b. Maintain liaison with maritime interests and appropriate
   U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)                   District Headquarters, with
     __________________________________________________________________

   particular attention to marine weather information requirements and
   dissemination.

           c. Interact with NWSH and other National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)              line offices in planning
   improved ocean services.

   3.3 National Meteorological Center (NMC). NMC, including the Ocean
   Products Center, is the central data processing facility and is
   responsible for the issuance of Pacific and Atlantic High Seas
   Forecasts (see appendix A), marine analysis charts, marine
   interpretation messages, forecast discussions, and other forecast
   guidance. This is generally accomplished by forecasters assigned to the
   Marine Forecast Branch (MFB) of the Meteorological Operations Division.
   In addition, the NOAA/Navy Joint Ice Center (JIC) processes global ice
   data and is responsible for the issuance of ice forecast guidance for
   northern latitudes.

   3.4 National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC). NSSFC is
   responsible for national severe local storm monitoring. The NSSFC
   maintains a continuous watch on the possibility of severe local storm
   development in the conterminous United States including adjoining
   coastal waters and the Great Lakes. Severe thunderstorm and tornado
   watches affecting coastal counties and adjoining waters are issued,
   canceled, and coordinated by NSSFC and are used by local offices to
   alert and warn the marine public.

   3.5 Hurricane Centers. Tropical cyclone forecasting responsibility is
   divided between the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Miami and the
   Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), Honolulu. (CPHC is activated
   whenever tropical cyclones exist within its area of responsibility
   between the dateline and 140E west longitude.) See WSOM Chapter C-41
   for information on tropical cyclone advisories and for information on
   storm surge and coastal flood forecasts issued in conjunction with
   those advisories. In addition to warnings and forecasts, these
   hurricane centers provide satellite interpretation and discussions,
   tropical storm classifications, and other guidance for their areas of
   responsibility. Also, NHC and Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO)
   Honolulu issue High Seas Forecasts for tropical and subtropical areas
   for which the United States has responsibility (see appendix A).

   3.6 Weather Service Forecast Offices (WSFO). WSFOs are responsible for
   issuing, disseminating, and coordinating marine advisories, warnings,
   forecasts, and statements for their areas of responsibility as listed
   in appendix A. See WSOM Chapter C-43 for responsibilities relating to
   coastal flooding. WSFO forecasters should have a good knowledge of the
   marine activities within their areas of responsibility to develop
   forecast procedures that address user requirements. WSFOs shall also:

       a. Operate, monitor, and maintain the marine weather service
   program within their responsible areas and provide local guidelines and
   instructions to NWS Offices (WSO) within their management areas as
   required.

       b. Maintain liaison with USCG District and local offices with
   emphasis on marine weather dissemination, user feedback, etc.

       c. Hold periodic marine user liaison meetings with representatives
   of the marine community (including the state Sea Grant office) to
   discuss service requirements, effectiveness, and participation in the
   Mariner Report (MAREP) program.

       d. Interact with other local NOAA agencies in planning improved
   ocean services and forward recommendations to Regional Headquarters.

       e. Maintain liaison with the NMC Marine Forecast Branch on ongoing
   marine forecast problems, user feedback, etc.

   3.7 Weather Service Offices (WSO). WSOs are responsible for the prompt
   dissemination of applicable products received from the WSFO. Coastal
   WSOs also maintain a watch over their coastal and other nearby waters
   and harbors and issue Special Marine Warnings (SMW) and Marine Weather
   Statements (MWS) as appropriate. See WSOM Chapter C-43 for
   responsibilities related to coastal flooding. Where authorized by the
   Regional Headquarters, WSOs may issue adaptive Local Marine Forecasts.
   Coastal WSOs should also maintain liaison with local USCG stations and
   marine interests and aid the WSFO and Region in planning improved
   marine services.

   Primary responsibility for the issuance of coastal marine advisories
   and warnings (other than severe local storms for which the WSO has
   prime warning responsibility) rests with the WSFO. However, if a local
   weather situation requires issuance or change of an advisory or
   warning, and the appropriate action has not been taken by the assigned
   WSFO, the local WSO should immediately contact the WSFO. If the WSFO
   cannot be reached, or when immediate action is required for the safety
   of life and property, the WSO should issue or change the advisories or
   warnings as required and disseminate them according to procedures
   established by their Region. The responsible WSFO shall be contacted as
   soon as possible.

   3.8 Coastal Service Offices (NWSFO/NWSO). In this chapter NWSFO/NWSO
   will refer to coastal WSFOs and WSOs with WSR-88D Doppler radars that
   have been commissioned for use in supporting operational services. Upon
   this commissioning, these offices will assume only SMW responsibility
   for areas extending out to approximately 100 NM (or to applicable
   international boundaries) from their coastline as shown in appendix B.
   All other warning and forecast responsibilities, as noted in Sections
   3.6 and 3.7 above and as listed in appendix A, will remain unchanged.

   As the individual WSR-88D radars are commissioned, the Regions shall
   adjust coastal landmarks between adjacent offices for proper
   demarcation of SMW responsibility relative to new land-based warning
   areas for severe local storms. At the same time, the Regions shall
   transfer responsibility for SMWs and any local adaptive marine
   forecasts from non WSR-88D coastal WSOs to appropriate NWSFOs/NWSOs.
   Basic forecast and long-fuse warning responsibilities for the areas
   listed in appendix B will be implemented in accordance with procedures
   described in the National Marine Services Transition Plan.

   3.9 Coordination. The model output guidance supplied to all NWS offices
   is the initial basis for forecast coordination. In addition, each NWS
   office having coastal, offshore, or high seas responsibilities shall
   ensure that it has available the warnings and forecasts issued by other
   offices for adjoining or overlapping areas.

   It is vital that forecasters coordinate with other appropriate offices
   and/or applicable national center(s) in order to maintain product
   consistency. This is especially true when differences of opinion or
   other discrepancies occur. In general. the forecaster deviating
   significantly from guidance shall take the initiative to begin
   coordination. Likewise, the national center shall initiate coordination
   with appropriate field offices when important information becomes
   available or significant changes occur.

   When needed, coordination shall begin as soon as possible. However,
   this may be delayed until after product issuance, at the forecaster's
   discretion, if time is critical.

   The following criteria provide guidelines for coordination to ensure
   that information across forecast boundaries is as consistent and
   uniform as possible.

       a. Generally, when there is a significant difference between
   existing or expected advisories/warnings between adjoining

   forecast areas. The term "significant" will depend on forecaster
   judgment. For example, a 50 KT storm warning forecast for a coastal
   area bordering one with an 80 KT storm warning may be considered
   significant, while a 35 KT gale bordering a 30 KT small craft advisory
   may not be so considered.

       b. Major synoptic scale features over a very large area of ocean
   that will likely lead to issuance of warnings by several offices.

       c. Issuance/cancellation or upgrading/downgrading of gale or storm
   warnings that may require similar action for areas adjoining that
   office's area of responsibility.

   4. Coastal Marine Forecasts (Product Identifier CWF). Coastal Marine
   Forecasts are designed to serve the needs of the widest variety of
   maritime activities. Coastal waters traffic ranges from numerous small
   and weather-sensitive craft, many of which do not venture far from
   land, to the largest ocean-going vessels. Another important activity is
   the offshore energy industry that includes mobile drill ships and fixed
   platforms.

   4.1 Areas of Responsibility. Appendix A lists responsibilities for
   operations prior to the reconfiguration of coastal areas, while
   appendix B lists responsibilities after reconfiguration.

   4.2 Forecast Issuance Times and Periods. Except for the Alaska Region,
   Coastal Marine Forecasts shall be issued four times a day. Due to the
   huge areas involved, Alaska coastal forecasts are issued twice a day
   with intermediate updates as required. All forecasts shall extend out
   36 or 48 hours from issuance time (the equivalent of 3 or 4 periods)
   and include a brief outlook extending from the end of the last forecast
   period out to five days. (Regions may authorize the issuance of a 48
   hour forecast to coincide with the public forecast times.)

   For these forecasts, the issuance times should be identical to or very
   close to the beginning effective time of the forecast. The issuance
   time shall be listed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the
   communications header, while the beginning effective time, listed in
   the mass media header, shall be given in local time.

                Region
   Beginning   Effective  Times  (UTC)

   Eastern/Southern*           0330         0930       1530       2130
   Western                     0430         1030       1630       2230
   Alaska                        -               1200           -         0000
   Pacific                     0400         1000       1600        2200

   *Note: During Eastern Daylight Time, effective times for Miami and San
   Juan are one hour earlier.

   The day of the week, rather than tomorrow, tomorrow night, etc., shall
   be used to describe forecast periods for the day(s) after forecast
   issuance (for example, a forecast issued Sunday evening would include:
   TONIGHT, MON, MON NIGHT, etc.).

   4.3 Forecast Content and Format. The coastal mariner receives weather
   information mainly by voice radio broadcasts. To increase user
   comprehension, the forecast should be concise describing only
   predominant conditions. Excessive use of numbers and directions should
   be avoided because marine radio reception may be marginal and listener
   retention of these items is low. Also, too much detail, although
   accurate, can be confusing.

   For clarity and conciseness, the marine forecaster may subdivide a
   Basic Marine Area into two or more parts within the body of the
   forecast to describe large differences (e.g., NORTHERN HALF, SOUTHERN
   HALF; WATERS WITHIN 5 NM OF SHORE, OPEN WATERS; etc.). If geographical
   reference points are used in the subdivision, they should be well
   known.

   When weather and sea conditions are expected to be homogeneous across
   two or more Basic Marine Areas for which an office is responsible,
   these should be combined for brevity. However, one Basic Marine Area
   shall not be combined with just a part of another.

   A period format shall be used, except in Alaska, to describe conditions
   for each major time segment in the 36 (or 48) hour forecast period
   (preceded by a dot and followed by 3 dots), i.e., .TODAY...,
   .TONIGHT..., .MON..., etc. Time segments beyond the first period may be
   combined to produce a more concise text when conditions in each period
   are expected to be similar (e.g., .TONIGHT AND MON..., .TUE, TUE NIGHT,
   AND WED..., etc.).

   Appropriate UGC shall be used for each Basic Marine Area and for the
   outlook portion of the Coastal Marine Forecast.

   The UGC is in the form SSZNNN-DDHHMM- or SSZNNN>NNN-DDHHMM- where:

           SS = two letter state identifier
           Z   = an indicator noting that an area designator follows
           NNN = a three digit code specifically defining a Basic
               Marine Area for an individual state
           > = code separator between first and last NNN when Basic
               Marine Areas are combined
           - = code separator/end of address

   DDHHMM- = Scheduled expiration time (day, hour, and minute in UTC) of
   current product. This                           coincides with the next
   scheduled issuance time of this product.

   Coastal forecasts shall be composed according to one of the following
   formats: (for detailed instructions on headings, generic codes, etc.,
   see the latest communication handbooks and WSOM Chapter C-63).

   (1) Coastal Marine Forecast for only a single Basic Marine Area:

   The general forecast area heading preceding the Synopsis is a general
   description of the area. The above format can also have two variations
   for combining or subdividing the Basic Marine Areas following the
   Synopsis:

       (a) When Basic Marine Areas are combined, NNN>NNN is used and each
   Basic Marine Area is listed in the heading.

       (b) If a Basic Marine Area is divided into 2 or more sub-areas,
   each sub-area and associated headline and text follow the Basic Marine
   Area/UGC heading

   The following example illustrates the possibility of a Coastal Marine
   Forecast with individual, combined, and subdivided Basic Marine Areas:

   4.3.1 Synopsis. The synopsis provides a verbal picture of the weather
   patterns producing the conditions described in the body of the
   forecast. It should describe the dominant surface weather features
   through the 36 (or 48) hour forecast period relative to the forecast
   area and to the surrounding region. The description should identify
   major weather systems and their strength, trend, movement, and location
   by the end of the forecast period. The synopsis should be as brief as
   possible using terminology that is simple and understandable.

     .SYNOPSIS...A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 400 NM SE OF ADAK WILL MOVE
     TO 375 NM NE OF ADAK BY SAT AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT SOUTH FROM THE
     LOW WILL EXTEND FROM THE PRIBILOFS TO NEAR COLD BAY AND SOUTHWARD
     SAT AFTERNOON.

   4.3.2 Headline. The headline draws the mariner's attention to hazardous
   conditions described in the forecast. The forecast shall include
   appropriate headlines for small craft advisories, gale warnings, storm
   warnings, severe local storm watches, tropical cyclone watches and
   warnings, coastal flood watches and warnings, and heavy surf advisories
   affecting coastal waters. Other conditions (e.g., freezing spray, low
   [1 NM or less visibilities, dangerous sea ice, low water, or winter
   storm watches and warnings) affecting coastal waters may be headlined
   at the forecaster's discretion. See Sections 7, 9, and 12; and WSOM
   Chapters C-40, C-41, C-42, C-43, and C-44.

   4.3.3 Forecast Text. The forecast should normally describe expected
   winds, sea conditions, significant weather, and visibility, (usually in
   that order), for three 12-hour periods. (This may be expanded to
   include a fourth period at Regional discretion.) The first period of
   any forecast sequence shall not be combined with any other period. The
   order of parameters may be adjusted to emphasize important conditions.
   Information on freezing spray should be added, if significant.

   The Regions should specify certain bays, harbors, inland waters, and
   estuaries for which sea state need not be included in forecasts if
   complexities in these areas such as fetch, water depth, currents, etc.,
   make wave forecasts impractical.

   4.3.4 Outlook. The outlook is general and should be geared to the more
   threatening wind conditions. Because of the large climatological
   differences, no set of criteria could adequately cover the entire
   United States. Therefore, local managers and the Regions should provide
   guidance as to what is considered significant in their areas. If
   threatening conditions are not anticipated, the outlook should indicate
   this (e.g., GALE FORCE WINDS NOT EXPECTED or WINDS BELOW 20 KT.)

   The period covered by the outlook extends from the last period of the
   forecast out to five days. The outlook may be divided if conditions
   within the area are expected to be significantly different.

   When tropical cyclones are indicated, all other weather conditions for
   the affected areas shall be excluded. This is to be done recognizing
   that outlooks extending to five days are not available from the
   National Hurricane Center (NHC). In these cases, the outlook should
   refer users to the latest tropical storm or hurricane advisory or
   outlook.

   .OUTLOOK FOR SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST ALASKA FROM CAPE SUCKLING TO
   BALL POINT...SAT NIGHT THROUGH TUE...SW ALASKA COAST, ALASKA PANHANDLE,
   AND SOUTHCENTRAL ALASKA..WINDS GREATER THAN 30 KT THROUGH SUN.

   4.3.5 Forecast Parameters and Description. The following are guidelines
   to describe conditions that predominate in the area over a forecast
   period. However, forecasters can indicate changes within a period by
   using the terms "SHIFTING," "BECOMING," "BUILDING," etc.

   The Regions may develop more specific guidelines and procedures
   regarding the wording and quantities used to describe wind speed, sea
   height, significant weather, and visibility for best comprehension by
   mariners. A major consideration is not to sacrifice user understanding
   for procedural convenience.

   4.3.5.1 Wind (sustained)

                   a. Direction should be to eight points of the compass.

   The term VARIABLE or the suffix LY may be used at 15 KT or less in
   areas where topography is a major factor or as specified by the
   Regions. In general, only one direction should be used; such phrases as
   "N TO NE WINDS" should be avoided.

                   b. Speed in knots. Speeds should normally be rounded to
   the nearest 5 KT to avoid implying a precision greater than is possible
   to forecast. Winds below 15 KT (or as designated by the Regions) may be
   described as 15 KT OR LESS or LESS THAN 15 KT.

                   c. A single wind speed value should be used to
   represent the predominant sustainedwind speed for the forecast area and
   period (e.g., E WIND 25 KT). However, 5 or 10 KT ranges may be used to
   describe unusual situations. This would be more common for winds of 20
   KT or less where ranges could account for frictional, topographic, and
   stability effects.

                   d. The forecast area or time period may be subdivided
   to resolve significant discontinuities in the predominant wind field
   (e.g., frontal boundaries) considered important to mariners.

                   e. Wind gusts may be added if the forecaster considers
   them significant.

   4.3.5.2 Sea Conditions

                   a. Terminology as given in Section 2 shall be used. If
   swell is given in the forecast, include the direction from which the
   swell is coming to eight points of the compass.

                   b. Height to the nearest foot. The quantity being
   forecast is significant wave height (see definitions - Section 2).
   Efforts should be made to apprise mariners of the fact that the
   forecast height is the average of waves they are likely to observe and
   experience and that it is impossible to predict the less frequent
   occurrence of waves two or more times the forecast height.

                   c. A single value should be used as the variability of
   the sea is accounted for by forecasting significant wave height.

   However, a small (up to 3 feet) range of sea heights may be used to
   describe unusual situations.

                   d. The forecast area or time period may be subdivided
   to resolve significant differences in the wave field considered
   important to mariners. This includes bays and inland waters.

                   e. Numerical guidance and wave measurements from data
   buoys express significant wave height as defined in Section 2.
   Subjective wave observations from shipboard observers should be
   evaluated for their representativeness since waves look much higher to
   an observer from a small boat than from a large ship. The observer's
   accuracy is also affected by darkness, visibility, ship's course and
   speed relative to wave direction, etc.

                   f. Significant wave heights from buoys are for overall
   sea state without regard to origin (wind waves or swell). Determination
   of the components is best made by evaluating the spectral wave
   observations (distribution of wave energy with period) transmitted on
   NWS circuits in addition to the conventional buoy observations.

                   g. Descriptive terms such as choppy, moderate, rough,
   etc., shall not be used to describe sea heights in unprotected, open
   waters due to different interpretations for a wide range of vessels and
   variations in user seamanship. However, in protected waters used mainly
   by recreational boaters, small craft are sensitive to small variations
   of sea height produced by local winds. In these areas, descriptive
   terms may be used in lieu of sea heights if the forecaster believes
   this provides a better understanding of potential hazards and there is
   a common interpretation of these terms by forecasters and users.

   Examples:

   WIND WAVES 3 FT IN PROTECTED WATERS AND 8 FT FURTHER OFFSHORE

   SEAS 6 FT AHEAD OF FRONT AND 10 FT BEHIND THE FRONT

   W SWELL 8 FT BUILDING TO 15 FT BY TONIGHT

   4.3.5.3 Significant Weather. Emphasis shall be placed on thunderstorm
   activity since this may produce locally hazardous winds and seas.
   Include information on significant precipitation and obstructions to
   vision based on available data and guidance. Sky cover is not needed.
   Precipitation probability terms "CHANCE", "OCCASIONAL", etc., may be
   used if they make the forecast more useful.

   4.3.5.4 Visibility. Visibility may be included if there is a reliable
   basis for it in terms of available observations or guidance or if there
   is a proven forecast technique. In such cases, visibility should be
   mentioned when it is forecast to be 1 NM or less. The Regions may
   specify other thresholds based on local requirements. In the absence of
   data, guidance, or reliable techniques, the mention of obstruction to
   vision and some indication as to its areal coverage is sufficient. A
   qualitative description of visibility (e.g., fair, poor) should not be
   used because of possible misinterpretation.

   Examples:

   PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING DISSIPATING BY AFTERNOON

   VSBY 1 NM OR LESS IN WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG TONIGHT

   4.3.5.5 Coastal flooding. Based on available data and guidance, include
   information on coastal flooding, minor tidal overflow, heavy surf, and
   tidal anomalies. See WSOM Chapter C-43 for more details on procedures
   for coastal flooding.

   Example:

   ...GALE WARNING IN EFFECT...
   ...COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT...

   .TODAY...E WINDS 35 KT. SEAS 10 FT. COASTAL FLOODING AND SOME SHORELINE
   EROSION THIS MORNING WITH TIDES ABOUT 2 FT ABOVE TIDE TABLE VALUES.
   .TONIGHT...Text
   .THU...Text

   4.3.5.6 Icing. Freezing precipitation and freezing spray are of
   particular concern to mariners in colder regions of the country.
   Especially on small vessels, icing can cause serious handling problems
   leading to instability and capsizing. The mariner shall be alerted
   whenever available data on wind, air and sea temperature, humidity, and
   wave activity suggest the likelihood of ice accretion on exposed
   surfaces. Because ice accumulation rates are ultimately dependent on
   individual ship characteristics and operating conditions, only the
   following terms shall be used:

       (a) Freezing Spray (accretion rates less than 2 centimeters per
   hour)
       (b) Heavy Freezing Spray (accretion rates equal to or greater than
   2 centimeters per hour)

   4.3.5.7 Air Temperatures. Air temperatures may be included only if they
   are forecast to be at or below freezing and if the forecaster considers
   this information to be significant. They are generally, but not
   necessarily, associated with icing conditions. When included, air
   temperatures should be given in general terms.

   Examples:

   WIND NE 30 KT WITH FREQUENT GUSTS THROUGH TONIGHT. SEAS 15 FT. FREEZING
   SPRAY WITH LOWS IN THE 20S.

   N WINDS 45 KT. SEAS 20 FT. HEAVY FREEZING SPRAY WITH TEMPERATURES IN
   THE 20S.

   4.3.5.8 Sea Ice. The primary occurrence of sea ice is in Alaskan
   waters. Sea ice information is prepared by WSFO Anchorage and issued as
   separate advisories, forecasts, and charts in addition to Coastal
   Marine Forecasts. Alaska Region develops techniques and procedures for
   sea ice forecasts and utilizes products issued by the JIC as guidance.
   To the extent data and guidance are available, including USCG reports,
   general ice information should be included in forecasts for
   mid-Atlantic and New England coastal areas if conditions are expected
   to have an adverse effect on navigational safety.

   Example: (Part of a forecast for Chesapeake Bay)

   .TONIGHT...WIND NW 15 KT. SEAS LESS THAN 2 FT. ICE
   GRADUALLY INCREASING IN THE BALTIMORE HARBOR AREA.

   5. Local Marine Forecast. Safety precautions are critical in major port
   and harbor areas where large ships intermingle with smaller commercial
   and recreational vessels. To enhance the safety of mariners, the
   Regions may authorize individual NWS offices to issue Local Marine
   Forecasts for such areas. These forecasts may be appended to the
   Coastal Marine Forecast for the surrounding Basic Marine Area, may be
   appended to the associated public forecast, or may stand alone.
   However, a Local Marine Forecast should not be appended to a product to
   which another forecast has already been added. NWS Headquarters will
   designate separate UGCs for each Local Marine Forecast area.

   Local Marine Forecasts cover two or three forecast periods and should
   contain advisory/warning headlines, wind, sea state, and significant
   weather as described in Section 4. However, Regions may allow
   individual element forecasts for special cases such as the Columbia
   River Bar. Emphasis should be given to conditions where poor visibility
   or severe local storms may impact the mariners. An outlook to 5 days,
   adapted from the Coastal Marine Forecast, shall be included if the
   Local Marine Forecast is appended to the public forecast or is issued
   as a stand alone product.

   In general, tide information should not be included in such products.
   The NWS does not forecast tides, and we must not give the impression
   that we do. (This is not to be confused with storm surge forecasts
   which the NWS does produce and disseminate.)

   Amendment criteria will be as given in Section 8. Regions may authorize
   local managers to expand these criteria based on local requirements. If
   the Local Marine Forecast is appended to another product, the entire
   package shall be transmitted when any individual part is updated to
   ensure that all products are available to users.

   The Regions shall determine the areas for which Local Marine Forecasts
   are issued by considering the traffic density, navigation patterns, the
   availability of timely observations in the area, and the variability of
   weather conditions with respect to the adjacent CMF area.

   Examples:

   6.Offshore Forecasts (Product Identifier OFF). Offshore waters
   forecasts are designed to serve users who operate far from shore,
   usually requiring a day or more of sailing to and from port.
   These users are mainly commercial fishermen and merchant shipping and,
   to a lesser extent, government and research vessels and large
   recreational craft.

   Offshore fishing fleets are at sea for days or weeks at a time. Time
   for travel between home port and the fishing grounds is considerable,
   often a day or more. Costs for fuel, supplies, and maintenance are very
   high. Merchant ships and fishing craft are often buffeted by synoptic
   scale storms that they cannot outrun and their maneuverability may be
   limited by type of vessel and other traffic. As a result, offshore
   users require information for a larger area and a longer warning lead
   time to aid in planning a voyage, making go/no-go decisions, or
   changing operations while at sea.

   6.1 Areas of Responsibility. Responsibility for offshore waters are
   assigned to the offices listed in Appendix A for operations prior to
   reconfiguration of marine responsibilities. With the reconfiguration
   and expansion of Coastal Marine Forecast areas out to 100 NM during
   modernization (see appendix B), NMC and NHC will assume forecast
   responsibility for most Offshore Forecast areas. Because of the
   predominant storm tracks and the geography involved, the Alaska Region
   will continue issuing Offshore Forecasts for the Bering Sea and Gulf of
   Alaska, while WSFO Honolulu will continue issuing Offshore Forecasts
   for the area around Hawaii. Coordination with offices issuing High Seas
   Forecasts is required to ensure product consistency for overlapping
   areas.

   6.2 Forecast Issuance Times and Periods. These are generally the same
   as for Coastal Marine Forecasts (see Section 4.2).

                     Region
   Beginning     Effective    Times    (UTC)

   6.3 Forecast Content and Format. Product format is becoming more and
   more critical as communications become automated (see Section 13). This
   is especially true for the Offshore Forecasts.

   These communications constraints require that forecasters ensure that
   Offshore Forecasts are carefully and concisely composed.

   Guidelines regarding quantities, directions, period format, and other
   details for coastal waters (Section 4.3) also apply to Offshore
   Forecasts. However, UGCs are not included in Offshore Forecasts. The
   forecast may be segmented as necessary (eastern half, northern third,
   or latitude/longitude boundaries, etc.) if there are important
   differences in expected conditions.

   Except in the Pacific Region where they are a part of the high seas
   product, Offshore Forecasts shall be composed according to the
   following format: (For details on headings, turn-on and turn-off codes,
   etc., see the latest communication handbooks.)

   Example:

   TTAA00 (4 letter WMO ID) DATE TIME (UTC)

   ...HEADLINE (if necessary)...(See Section 7)

   Forecast text for three periods after issuance time.

   In cases where offshore waters are usually subdivided into separate
   forecasts, each sub-area should be denoted by a header providing a
   general description of the area.

   6.3.1 Synopsis. The synopsis for the Offshore Forecast is similar in
   content to the synopsis in the Coastal Marine Forecast (see Section
   4.3.1). The main difference is that it describes weather patterns
   affecting a larger area. It should also include information on features
   further upstream that may affect the offshore waters within the 36 hour
   forecast period. For example, a low starting to develop well beyond the
   offshore area is of interest in the offshore synopsis but may be
   premature to discuss in the coastal waters synopsis.

   Example:

   .SYNOPSIS...A 1028 MB HIGH 550 NM W OF POINT CONCEPTION AND AN
   ASSOCIATED RIDGE TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL REMAIN STATIONARY THROUGH
   FRI. AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE JUST OFF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST WILL
   REMAIN IN PLACE BUT WILL DISSIPATE BY FRI.

   6.3.2 Headline. General instructions given in 4.3.2 apply. However, in
   Offshore Forecasts, only gale, storm, tropical storm, or hurricane
   warnings shall be headlined.

   6.3.3 Forecast Text. See Section 4.3.3. Exception, Offshore Forecasts
   do not use UGCs.

   6.3.4 Outlook. The outlook for the Offshore Forecast is similar in
   content to the outlook described in Section 4.3.4. It may be divided if
   trends for two or more different areas are expected to be significantly
   different.

   Example:

   .OUTLOOK FRI NIGHT THROUGH MON...SOUTH HALF...WINDS GREATER
   THAN 40 KT FRI NIGHT. OTHERWISE...GALE FORCE OR STRONGER
   WINDS ARE NOT EXPECTED.

   6.3.5 Forecast Parameters and Description. Discussion of winds, seas,
   significant weather, visibility, and icing shall follow guidelines
   similar to Coastal Marine Forecasts (see Section 4.3.5), with the
   following exceptions:

   Wind. Specific wind speeds need not be given below 20 KT. Statements
   such as, 20 KT OR LESS, UP TO 20 KT, LESS THAN 20 KT may be used
   instead. (Regions, with WSH concurrence, may designate other thresholds
   to account for climatological differences.)

   Seas. If seas are expected to be below 5 ft, statements such as, 5 FT
   OR LESS, UP TO 5 FT, etc. may be used. (Regions, with NWSH concurrence,
   may designate other thresholds to account for oceanographic
   differences.)

   Significant Weather. Precipitation, thunderstorms, and obstructions to
   vision should be included if they are expected to significantly affect
   marine operations (e.g., very low [1 NM or less] visibility, effect on
   cargo, on-deck activities, etc.).

   7. Marine Advisories and Warnings Included in Coastal and Offshore
   Forecasts. Advisories and warnings as described in Sections 4.3.2 and
   6.3.2 shall be headlined in the forecast. This helps to focus the
   mariner's attention on conditions described in t
