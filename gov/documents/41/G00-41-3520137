     Mayfield, Ky., native heads Space Station science efforts at NASAs
     Marshall Space Flight Center

     As each Space Shuttle flight to the International Space Station
     delivers or retrieves science experiments, Rex Geveden knows another
     step forward in scientific research is being made.

     For almost a year, the Mayfield, Ky., native has been manager of the
     Microgravity Science and Applications Department in the Science
     Directorate at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
     Ala.

     Geveden supervises more than 350 scientists, engineers, project
     managers and support personnel responsible for development of both
     ground-based, and space-flight, science experiments 혰 including
     science experiments on the International Space Station.

     Were responsible for many of the microgravity science experiments
     that go to the Space Station, Geveden said. Microgravity refers to
     the unique condition of near-weightlessness created as the Space
     Shuttle or Space Station orbits Earth.

     A variety of science experiments are being conducted on the Space
     Station that could lead to advances in the fields of biomedical
     research and development of new materials for use on Earth.

     These experiments also could advance human knowledge of the space
     environment.

     The work we are doing is really the dominating reason for the Space
     Station, Geveden said. Its an orbiting laboratory. Im very proud to
     be a part of it.

     When the Shuttle returned from the STS-105 Mission 7A.1 to the Space
     Station in August, it brought home an experiment that not only
     Geveden is interested in, but students and teachers from elementary,
     middle and high schools in Alabama, California and Tennessee.

     Working side-by-side with university and NASA scientists, the
     students mixed and loaded about 100 of the 500 biological protein
     samples that flew in the Enhanced Gaseous Nitrogen Dewar 혰 a
     vacuum-jacketed container similar to a thermos bottle that stores
     the samples.

     The protein samples are used to grow biological crystals in space.
     Protein crystals grown in space often are of higher quality than
     those grown on Earth and can better show scientists how these
     substances perform critical functions in our bodies, and in animals
     and plants. This knowledge is an important tool for biochemists
     designing medicines.

     Marshalls Microgravity Research Program Office and the Office of
     Biological and Physical Research at NASA Headquarters in Washington,
     D.C., sponsored the dewar experiment.

     For Geveden, the experiment is but one of about 200 research
     activities under his management.

     Geveden began his NASA career at Marshall in 1990, serving in
     increasingly responsible positions. These included chief engineer
     for the Waves in Space Plasmas Experiment; project manager for the
     Optical Transient Detector and Lightning Imaging Sensor 혰 a small,
     highly sophisticated system which, from Earth orbit, helped build
     the worlds first global map of lightning; and spacecraft and systems
     manager of Gravity Probe-B, which will test two key areas of
     Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.

     Geveden graduated from Mayfields Lowes High School, now part of
     Graves County High School, in 1979. He earned a bachelors degree in
     engineering physics and a masters degree in physics from Murray
     State University in Murray, Ky., in 1983 and 1984 respectively. He
     has completed numerous executive and management-level training
     courses, including graduating from the Program Management School at
     Defense Systems Management College in Fort Belvoir, Va., in 1995.

     Geveden is the recipient of a NASA Certificate of Appreciation and
     Space Act Award, as well as the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal 혰
     the highest medal NASA awards to employees.

     Working for NASA has turned out to be a dream job for me, Geveden
     said.

      Geveden is married to the former Gail Reddick of Bardwell, Ky., and
     they live in Madison, Ala. They have two teen-age children.

     In addition to managing science experiments conducted on the Space
     Station and exploring new rocket technology, the Marshall Center is
     NASAs lead center for space transportation and manages all of the
     propulsion elements that carry the Space Shuttle from launch to
     orbit.
