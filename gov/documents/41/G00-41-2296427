Private Sponsors

   California law has dictated that no state funds shall be used in the
   development or implementation of this program and that all costs must
   be funded through private donations.  Since 1997, private companies and
   individuals have donated over $250,000 to this program.  Without their
   dedicated efforts and gracious generosity this exchange could never
   take place.   The Foundation would like to offer their deepest
   appreciation and gratitude to those that make this program possible:
