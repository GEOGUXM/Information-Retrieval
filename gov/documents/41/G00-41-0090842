     ITC RELEASES SECOND ANNUAL REPORT ON U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH
                             SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

   The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) today released U.S. Trade
   and Investment with Sub-Saharan Africa, the second report in a series
   of five intended to assist the President in developing a comprehensive
   trade and development policy for the countries of Africa.

   The ITC, an independent, nonpartisan, factfinding federal agency,
   conducted the investigation for the United States Trade Representative
   (USTR). As requested, the ITC's study is limited to the 48 countries of
   sub-Saharan Africa. The current report provides an update for 2000 on
   U.S.-Africa trade and investment flows in major sectors; an
   identification of major developments in U.S. trade and economic policy
   and commercial activities that significantly affect bilateral trade and
   investment with the region; information on changing trade and economic
   activities within individual countries; and an update on progress in
   regional integration in Africa. The report also contains an economic
   profile for each of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In addition,
   the ITC posts updated data from the report periodically on the ITC
   website. Data on quarterly U.S. trade with sub-Saharan African
   countries as well as sectoral trade with those countries can be
   accessed at www.usitc.gov/tradereports/africa/. The website contains
   trade data relating to the new African Growth and Opportunity Act
   (AGOA).

   Following are some highlights of the report:

     * In 2000, a very large increase in U.S. imports from, and a small
       increase in exports to, sub- Saharan Africa resulted in a 97.8
       percent increase in the long-standing U.S. trade deficit with the
       region. The 2000 deficit measured $16.7 billion, with much of its
       increase due to an 88 percent increase in U.S. imports of oil and
       energy-related products. Excluding trade in petroleum, the U.S.
       trade deficit with the region increased by 134 percent from $1.6
       billion in 1999 to $3.8 billion in 2000.
     * U.S. merchandise exports to sub-Saharan Africa increased from $5.3
       billion in 1999 to $5.6 billion in 2000. The largest U.S. exports
       to sub-Saharan Africa were transportation equipment (32.4 percent
       share), electronic products (12.6 percent), agricultural products
       (13.8 percent), and chemicals and related products (12.8 percent).
       The largest increases in U.S. exports to the region were in
       transportation equipment ($101 million) and chemicals and related
       products ($99.6 million). U.S exports of electronic products to the
       region decreased by $64.6 million in 2000.
     * Total U.S. merchandise imports from the region increased 61.5
       percent to $22.2 billion. This increase was mainly due to a $7
       billion (87.7 percent) increase in U.S. imports of energy-related
       products from the region. Nigeria alone contributed $5 billion to
       the increase in U.S. imports with a 134 percent increase in sales
       of Nigerian oil and energy-related products to the United States.
     * Major U.S. import sectors from the region include energy-related
       products (67.6 percent share), minerals and metals (14.4 percent),
       and chemical and related products (6.5 percent). Total U.S. imports
       from the region increased in all major categories, with the
       exception of footwear, transportation equipment, and miscellaneous
       manufactures.
     * Imports from sub-Saharan Africa that entered the United States
       under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) increased by 45.2
       percent in 2000 to $3.9 billion. The largest share of GSP imports
       from the region came from Angola (72.4 percent share, or $2.8
       billion) in part due to a measure implemented in 1997 that made
       crude oil imports from least developed beneficiary countries
       GSP-eligible. Angola especially benefitted from this change. In
       2000, GSP imports also increased 29.8 percent from South Africa and
       52.7 percent from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC).
     * The first U.S. imports the AGOA were in January 2001. During the
       first half of 2001, the U.S. imports covered under AGOA totaled $3
       billion. The principal suppliers under AGOA were Nigeria ($2.3
       billion), Gabon ($448.5 million), and South Africa ($135.5
       million). Other AGOA suppliers imports in the first half 2001
       included Ghana ($18.9 million), Cameroon ($16.2 million), and Kenya
       ($16.1 million).
     * U.S. imports under AGOA consisted primarily of energy-related
       products. U.S. imports of energy-related products during the first
       half 2001 totaled $2.8 billion, 94.2 percent of the AGOA total. The
       remaining AGOA imports consisted of much smaller quantities of
       textiles and apparel, minerals and metals, agricultural products,
       transportation equipment, and footwear.
     * U.S. direct investment flows to the region totaled $77 million in
       2000, or less than 0.1 percent of total U.S. direct investment
       abroad. In 2000, U.S. direct investment flows to sub-Saharan Africa
       decreased by 92.3 percent. The decline is mainly due to a 91.6
       percent decrease in flows to South Africa, and a 73.9 percent
       decrease in flows to Nigeria. The largest recipients of U.S. direct
       investment in sub-Saharan Africa in 2000 were Angola (32.5 percent)
       and South Africa (20.7 percent). U.S. holdings are principally in
       the petroleum sector in Angola and Nigeria, and in the mining and
       manufacturing sector in South Africa.

   U.S. Trade and Investment with Sub-Saharan Africa (Investigation No.
   332-415, USITC Publication 3476, December 2001) will be available on
   the ITC's Internet server at www.usitc.gov. A printed copy may be

   ITC general factfinding investigations, such as this one, cover matters
   related to tariffs or trade, and are generally conducted at the request
   of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Senate Committee on Finance or
   the House Committee on Ways and Means. The resulting reports convey the
   Commission's objective findings and independent analyses on the
   subjects investigated. The Commission makes no recommendations on
   policy or other matters in its general factfinding reports. Upon
   completion of each investigation, the ITC submits its findings and
   analyses to the requestor. General factfinding investigation reports
   are subsequently released to the public, unless they are classified by
   the requestor for national security reasons.
