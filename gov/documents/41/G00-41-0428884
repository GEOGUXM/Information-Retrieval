    Grant Information

   [dprbalbl.jpg]

   Pest Management Grants
   Applied Research Grants and Demonstration Grants

     [new.gif] Request for Proposals 2001-2002
     Announced July 14, 2001. Proposals are due October 4, 2001.

   The Pest Management Grants program provides funding to public and
   private entities interested in investigating and developing innovative
   pest management practices that will lead to adoption of reduced-risk
   pest management systems. The intent of the program is to encourage
   voluntary group efforts to develop pest management practices that
   reduce pesticide risks, through local and regional demonstration and
   applied research projects. Emphasis is placed on projects that can be
   implemented and clearly demonstrate reduced-risk.
   [dprbalbl.jpg] Pest Management Alliance Program
   Evaluations and Alliance

     [new.gif] Request for Proposals 2001-2002
     Announced July 14, 2001. Evaluation proposals are due
     September 13, 2001. Alliance proposals are due November 1, 2001.

   The Pest Management Alliance program provides funding to address
   important pest management issues on a statewide scale. The Alliance is
   devoted to reducing pesticide risks, while at the same time,
   establishing a dialogue between the Department of Pesticide Regulation
   and the regulated community. Commodity groups, trade associations, and
   others are encouraged to submit proposals to address priority areas of
   concern such as finding alternatives to highly toxic pesticides,
   protecting surface and ground water quality, developing IPM policy for
   public schools and other public buildings, and dealing with pesticide
   problems in urban situations.
   [dprbalbl.jpg] Pest Management Alliance Program Review
   Request for Proposals
   The Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) is seeking to establish a
   contract with an independent party to conduct a detailed review of the
   procedures and implementation of the Pest Management Alliance Program.
   The Pest Management Alliance Program, in existence for four years,
   provides funding to address important pest management issues on a
   statewide scale. A timely review of the program, with particular
   attention to the Alliance request for proposal (RFP) process, program
   success, the role of the DPR contract manager, data management, and
   ways to attract new Alliance teams, is warranted. The overriding
   concern is whether the Alliance program is encouraging successful,
   sustainable changes in pesticide use practices that benefit human
   health and the environment.
