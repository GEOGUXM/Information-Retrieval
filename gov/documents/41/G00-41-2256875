   La Jolla Laboratory

   The La Jolla Laboratory is the largest of the Southwest Fisheries
   Science Center's laboratories and is its headquarters. The laboratory
   is located on the campus of the University of California San Diego,
   next to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Research at the La
   Jolla Laboratory is organized within three divisions:
     * Fisheries Resources Division - Assesses the biomass of valuable
       coastal pelagic fish stocks and evaluates biological and
       environmental factors that affect their distribution, abundance,
       and survival. The division also conducts basic fishery analysis and
       stock assessment research on tropical and temperate tunas,
       billfishes, and sharks. The work is in support of the U.S.
       commitment to international management of tuna fisheries and the
       regional management of fisheries for billfish and other large
       pelagic species.

     * Protected Resources Division - Promotes and conducts research that
       contributes to the conservation and management of U.S. and
       international populations of marine mammals and their critical
       habitats. Provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the
       Endangered Species Act guide the divisionÂ’s activities, which
       include monitoring the abundance of pinniped and cetacean stocks
       and sea turtles, assessing and helping to minimize the impact of
       fishing operations and other human activities on these populations,
       determining stock structure and population dynamics, and conducting
       research on "dolphin-safe" tuna fishing methods.

     * Antarctic Ecosystem Research Group - Manages the U.S. Antarctic
       Marine Living Resources Program, which provides information for
       U.S. policy on the management and conservation of Antarctic living
       resources and supports U.S. participation in international efforts
       to protect the Antarctic and its marine life. Research is directed
       toward gathering ecological and biological information to prevent
       overexploitation of finfish and krill and to protect seal, penguin,
       and pelagic seabird populations off the northernmost tip of the
       Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia.

   Laboratory features
   The La Jolla Laboratory is located on a cliff top overlooking the
   Pacific Ocean and consists of a cluster of modern buildings arranged
   around a central courtyard. Scientists' offices, laboratories, a
   3,500-square-foot seawater experimental aquarium, mechanical and
   electronic workshops, and extensive computer and data communication
   facilities enable the scientists and staff to carry out their research
   mission. The Laboratory's library contains more than 15,000 books and
   bound volumes on marine biology, fisheries, and oceanography and is
   enhanced and supplemented by the extensive libraries at the nearby
   University of California San Diego and the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography.

   Cooperating agencies
   Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Several La Jolla Laboratory staff
   members have received research appointments to the Scripps faculty as
   adjunct professors and research associates. Scripps graduate students
   also receive training and research opportunities at the La Jolla
   Laboratory.

   Joint Institute for Marine Observations. JIMO was established in 1991
   through a cooperative agreement between the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography. The primary objective of JIMO is to foster
   interdisciplinary research into the marine physical, biological, and
   geochemical systems important to climate and global change. This
   includes fostering research into effects of climate change on fish
   stocks and other marine biological populations.

   Joint Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research. A special research
   relationship exists with  JIMAR, a NOAA-University of Hawaii
   cooperative institute. This arrangement established in 1977 promotes
   formal interaction between the university and the Southwest Fisheries
   Science Center's Honolulu Laboratory, including visiting scientist
   programs and facilitation of funding of research with the university.

   California Department of Fish and Game.The department collaborates with
   the La Jolla Laboratory and Scripps Institution of Oceanography in
   research on coastal marine mammals and management of fisheries,
   particularly transboundary stocks such as the northern anchovy, and in
   the preparation of fishery stock assessments.  As a result of their
   joint program called the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries
   Investigations or CalCOFI, the the biology and oceanography of a huge
   area of the Pacific Ocean off California and Baja California, Mexico,
   is perhaps the best ecologically understood of any comparable body of
   water in the world.

   Instituto Nacional de la Pesca. Scientists at the La Jolla Laboratory
   have developed a scientific collaboration known as MEXUS-Pacifico with
   the National Fisheries Institute of Mexico. The cooperative research
   program studies shared fish stocks, marine mammals, and Pacific sea
   turtles.

   International Commissions. The La Jolla Laboratory also conducts
   research in support of the U.S. commitments to the Commission for the
   Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Inter-American
   Tropical Tuna Commission, and the International Commission for the
   Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
