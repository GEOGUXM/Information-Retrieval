                            Repeal of gas tax exemption
                  would be a disaster for Washington’s farmers



   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   January 21, 2002

                                                   FOR INTERVIEWS CONTACT:
                                           Sen. Mike Hewitt (360) 786-7630
                                            Sen. Bob Morton (360) 786-7612
                                         Sen. Larry Sheahan (360) 786-7620


   Powerful central Puget Sound legislators are threatening to repeal the
   fuel tax exemption for dyed diesel fuel used in off-road farm
   machinery.

   According to the Washington State Department of Revenue, if the
   Legislature repeals the exemptions for “non-highway uses of fuel,”
   which includes dyed fuel, the state would raise $1,467,000 in new
   revenue for 2002.

   The current fuel tax rate in Washington is 23 cents per gallon.
   Currently, farmers pay no fuel tax on dyed diesel, but they do pay
   sales tax of about 9 cents per gallon.  If the dyed fuel gas tax
   exemption were removed, farmers would have to pay fuel tax on every
   gallon of dyed diesel they use.

   The impact of this increase on the average farmer would be immense. For
   example, let’s assume an average 2,000-acre farm uses 3.5 gallons of
   diesel per acre per year based on a three-year crop rotation. This one
   tax increase would cost a farmer at least $980 and perhaps as much as
   $1,610 extra per year, depending on whether or not he’s also paying
   sales tax on that diesel.  Either way, this is a substantial increase
   that most farmers simply cannot afford.

   Washington State’s 18^th amendment requires that most fuel taxes
   collected be used for roads and bridges. Farmers should not be forced
   to pay road taxes on equipment that rarely uses the roads.

   The farm economy is in a deep recession. Grain prices remain low, while
   costs of fertilizers, pesticides, equipment and government regulations
   continue to escalate. Exemptions on fuel taxes were put in place to
   give farmers a chance to compete in a global economy. Removing an
   exemption is nothing but a tax increase, and our agricultural economy
   cannot survive any more tax increases.

    Every legislator who cares about the survival of agriculture in
   Washington should fight this ill-advised plan to remove the exemption
   on "off-road uses" of fuel.
