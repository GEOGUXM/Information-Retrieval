   The Laboratory is in Berkeley on the hillside directly above the campus
   of the University of California at Berkeley. Our address is 1 Cyclotron
   Road, Berkeley CA 94720.

   To make the Lab easily accessible, the Lab has its own shuttle service
   that takes people around the site and to downtown Berkeley and the BART
   station there. Parking spaces are difficult to find here and you will
   need to prearrange for a parking permit from the person you are
   visiting.

San Francisco Airport to the Lab By Car

   Take U.S. Route 101 North from the airport -- towards San Francisco.
   Keep going until the junction with I-80. Take I-80 east (toward East
   Bay or Oakland). Cross the Bay Bridge, staying in left lanes. After
   crossing the bridge, follow I-80 towards Berkeley and Sacramento. About
   four miles later, take the University Avenue exit on your right, and
   take the left-hand branch of the exit ramp onto University Avenue.
   Proceed up University Avenue for two miles until you reach Oxford
   Street. Go left on Oxford and then several blocks later, right on
   Hearst Avenue. Head straight up Hearst which, above the campus, climbs
   steeply and makes a horseshoe turn before arriving at the main gate at
   the Lab. Alternatively, you may enter the Lab via the Strawberry Gate
   (see map above).

   Parking can be difficult to find here and you'll need to prearrange for
   a parking pass through the person you are visiting. As an alternative
   to driving here, you can park nearby in downtown Berkeley and take the
   Lab shuttle here. To do that, as you come into Berkeley eastbound on
   University Avenue, take a right onto Shattuck Avenue. Four blocks
   later, go right onto Kittredge Street where you'll find a parking
   garage at 2020 Kittredge. Our shuttle bus pickup is one block to the
   north, stopping on the north side of Center Street at its intersection
   with Shattuck Avenue. Travel time is somewhat over an hour.

San Francisco Airport to the Lab by Commercial Shuttle Bus

   A number of shuttle van companies provide service from the San
   Francisco airport. Some travel directly to your particular point of
   destination. Others drop off their passengers at central points in the
   East Bay. The airport website has more specific information on "ground
   transport."

San Francisco to the Lab by BART

   Much easier than traveling by car. Allow yourself 50 minutes for the
   entire trip from downtown San Francisco. Go to any of the BART
   stations. Purchase a ticket for $5.30 (the cost of a round-trip between
   downtown SF and Berkeley as of October 2000). Get on the Richmond line.
   Take the Richmond line to the downtown Berkeley exit -- not the North
   Berkeley exit, and not the Ashby exit, just the Berkeley exit. Get off
   at the Berkeley exit, go up to the street level, and find our shuttle
   bus stop. It is on the north side of Center Street at its intersection
   with Shattuck Avenue next to the bank automatic teller machine. You can
   then take the shuttle bus to the Lab; see the directions for using our
   shuttle.

   More information about BART, including an interactive map of the system
   and its schedules, is available on the Web.

Downtown San Francisco to the Lab by Car

   (See the two maps at the top of this file).
   Find an on-ramp to I-80 going east (toward East Bay or Oakland). Cross
   the Bay Bridge, staying in left lanes and follow I-80 towards Berkeley
   and Sacramento. About four miles after crossing the bridge, take the
   University Avenue exit on your right, and take the left-hand branch of
   the exit onto University Avenue. Proceed up University Avenue for two
   miles until you reach Oxford Street. Go left on Oxford and then several
   blocks later, right on Hearst Avenue. Head straight up Hearst which,
   above the campus, climbs steeply and makes a horseshoe turn before
   arriving at the main gate at the Lab. Alternatively, you may enter the
   Lab via the Strawberry Gate (see map above).

   north, stopping on the north side of Center Street at its intersection
   with Shattuck Avenue. Travel time is an hour or more.

Oakland International Airport to the Lab by Car

   (See the two maps at the top of this file).
   From the airport, take Hegenberger Road, following the signs along
   Hegenberger to I-880 northbound toward Oakland and Berkeley. On I-880,
   as you approach the skyline of downtown Oakland, get in one of the left
   hand lanes and take I-80 eastbound to Berkeley.

   About four miles later, take the University Avenue exit on your right,
   and take the left-hand branch of the exit ramp onto University Avenue.
   Proceed up University Avenue for two miles until you reach Oxford
   Street. Go left on Oxford and then several blocks later, right on
   Hearst Avenue. Head straight up Hearst which, above the campus, climbs
   steeply and makes a horseshoe turn before arriving at the main gate at
   the Lab. Alternatively, you may enter the Lab via the Strawberry Gate

   with Shattuck Avenue. Travel time requires at least 35 minutes.

Oakland International Airport to the Lab by Commercial Shuttle

   A number of private firms provide shuttle service from the Oakland
   International Airport. More information is available here.

Oakland International Airport to the Lab By BART

   A special shuttle bus, the Oakland-AirBART shuttle, runs between the
   Oakland Airport and BART about every 10 minutes. Take it to BART where
   you get on a train on the Richmond line. Take the Richmond line to the
   downtown Berkeley exit -- not the North Berkeley exit, and not the
   Ashby exit, just the Berkeley exit. Get off at the Berkeley exit, go up
   to the street level, and find the Lab's shuttle bus stop. It is on the
   north side of Center Street at its intersection with Shattuck Avenue
   next to the bank automatic teller machine. You can then take our
   shuttle bus to the Lab. See the directions for using our shuttle.

   More information about BART, including an interactive map of the system
   and its schedules, is available on the Web.

BART to Berkeley

   Get on the Richmond line. Take the Richmond line to the downtown
   Berkeley exit -- not the North Berkeley exit, and not the Ashby exit,
   just the Berkeley exit. Get off at the Berkeley exit, go up to the
   street level, and find the Lab's shuttle bus stop. It is on the north
   side of Center Street at its intersection with Shattuck Avenue next to
   the bank automatic teller machine. You can then take the shuttle bus to
   the Lab; see the directions for using the Lab's shuttle.

   More information about BART, including an interactive map of the system
   and its schedules, is available on the Web.

The Lab's Shuttle Bus

   The Laboratory provides onsite shuttle service (see the map and
   schedule of the on-site shuttle service) for its 130-acre site in the
   Berkeley Hills as well as off-site service from the Lab to nearby
   areas.

   On weekdays, the Lab provides free off-site shuttle service for
   visitors and employees alike. The principal off-site shuttle operates
   from 6:30 a.m. to 6:50 p.m. Buses run every ten minutes up until 5:50
   p.m. when they run at 20 minute intervals. For details, see the map and
   schedule of the off-site shuttle service.

   The off-site shuttle service starts at the main Lab shuttle bus stop at
   Building 65, and travels along the perimeter of the University of
   California at Berkeley campus to the Berkeley BART station, and back to
   the Lab. Another off-site shuttle provides express service to and from
   the Rockridge BART station at select commute hours.

   You can be picked up by the shuttle at any of the designated stops,
   where you'll find a sign indicating a Berkeley Lab bus stop. A useful
   stop for many people is the one in front of the Berkeley BART station,
   which is located on Center Street at the northwest corner of Shattuck
   Avenue and Center Street. Just get onto the shuttle like everyone else:
   If the driver asks you for identification, just say that you are a
   guest of a Lab activity. Once at the Lab, the shuttle stops at the main
   Lab shuttle bus stop at Building 65, where you can catch an onsite bus
   to anywhere at the Lab.
