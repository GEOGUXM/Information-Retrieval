     CONGRESSMAN SHERWOOD BOEHLERT (R-NY)
     STATEMENT ON NIST ANNIVERSARY
     March 6, 2001
     ____________________________________________________________________

     It's a delight and a privilege to join with you this evening to
     celebrate the 100th birthday of the National Institute of Standards
     and Technology. And I have to say that the timing of this event is
     auspicious for me, in particular. It's great to be assuming the
     chairmanship of the House Science Committee as NIST is celebrating
     its centenary because the existence of NIST is concrete proof that
     Congress can get some things right when it comes to science and
     technology policy.

     Establishing NIST was one of the very first and one of the most
     important actions Congress took at the dawn of the 201h Century -- a
     century that was to see technology and standardization change our
     world as never before. And we are still reaping the rewards of that
     foresight as we begin the 21st Century.

     I have to note, though, that while NIST is richly deserving of
     tonight's gala; the festivities are a little out of character for
     NIST, which from the start has gone about its business in an
     unassuming, even inconspicuous way. Even the law that created the
     laboratory didn't have a name -- it was known by the rather plain
     and workaday designation, "the Act of March 3, 1901" -- a date that
     has lived in neither infamy nor fame, a date that no schoolchild has
     been forced to memorize.

     Given NIST's "nose-to-the-grindstone" work ethic, its stream of
     consistent productivity without fanfare, its focus on the essential
     but largely invisible foundations of modem technology, one might
     think that a good title for a history of NIST's first century would
     be "One Hundred Years of Solitude."

     But how extraordinarily misleading that would be --- because the
     actual secret of NIST's success has been its "partnerships" --
     partnerships with the private sector, partnerships with other
     federal agencies and laboratories, partnerships with state and local
     Governments. NIST is well known to the people who keep our economy
     healthy, and it's NIST's ability to work with just about anybody
     that has kept it fresh, vital and valuable as fundamental a key to
     American prosperity as it was the day it was created.

     NIST is a worthy and needed partner because its mission is
     problem-solving. NIST was established to help bring rationality to
     the profusion of standards that were afflicting the United States at
     the turn of the last century -- a profusion that could have tragic
     consequences when, for example, major fires could not be
     extinguished because of varying standards for hoses and hydrants.
     And that problem-solving ethos has been maintained to this very day
     -- whether NIST is probing abstruse questions about the molecular
     structure of ceramics, or helping to ensure the security of our
     computers, or providing guidance to a small manufacturer on how to
     update his operations through the Manufacturing Extension Program.

     And we also still draw on NIST's expertise to solve problems that
     are endemic to the economy as a whole -- with the Advanced
     Technology Program, for example, which has helped a wide variety of
     companies pass through the so-called "valley of death" that can
     prevent good research ideas from becoming good processes or
     products.

     But tonight's focus is not on the past -- although NIST's record of
     accomplishment provides plenty of cause for celebration. We're
     really here to make a down payment on the future by showing all the
     current and former directors and staff at NIST how grateful we are
     for their dedication, their imagination and their insight. Working
     steadily and fruitfully outside the limelight, they have enabled our
     nation's reputation for technological progress to shine.

     Now it's hard to know what the technology of tomorrow will look
     like. History is littered with embarrassingly misguided predictions
     -- a few of them even uttered in hearings before the House Science
     Committee. But I think it's safe to say that, whatever the
     technology of the future is, NIST will have played a role in its
     creation, enhancement or propagation.

     So I want again to thank everyone who has made NIST a success and to
     pledge to all of you that I will do my best to ensure that NIST
     continues to set the standard for what a federal lab should be.
     Thank you.
