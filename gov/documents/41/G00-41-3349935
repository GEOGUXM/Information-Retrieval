   Objectives for a Major Next Step Magnetic Fusion Experiment Explore and
   understand the strong non-linear coupling that is fundamental to
   fusion-dominated plasma behavior (self-organization) * Energy and
   particle transport (extend confinement predictability) * Macroscopic
   stability ( -limit, wall stabilization, NTMs) * Wave-particle
   interactions (fast alpha particle driven effects) * Plasma boundary
   (density limit, power and particle flow) * Test/Develop techniques to
   control and optimize fusion-dominated plasmas. * Sustain
   fusion-dominated plasmas - high-power-density exhaust of plasma
   particles and energy, alpha ash exhaust, study effects of profile
   evolution due to alpha heating on macro stability, transport barriers
   and energetic particle modes. * Explore and understand various advanced
   operating modes and configurations in fusion-dominated plasmas to
   provide generic knowledge for fusion and non-fusion plasma science, and
   to provide a foundation for attractive fusion applications. Advanced

   and Needs * Most are the same as for ITER-FEAT! * Differences arise due
   to: * Double null divertor - higher , shorter path to divertor, neutral
   stability point no asymmetric alpha ripple loss region, ( B/B = 0.3%) *
   Lower density relative to nGW, higher density relative to NBI, RF,
   neutrals * All metal PFCs, esp. W divertor targets, * No neutral beam
   heating * Specific Interests (requests) * Core Confinement (H-Mode and
   close relatives) * Understand requirements for enhanced H-modes at
   n/nGW 0.6 - 0.7 * Compare SN DN or nearly DN ; maybe more than
   triangularity * Extend global studies/analysis H = H( , n/nGW, n(0)/) *
   H-mode power threshold for DN, hysteresis, H = f(P -Pth) * Pedestal
   height/width as SN DN; elms as SN DN * Rotation as SN DN * Expand
   H-Mode data base for ICRF only plasmas * Demonstration discharges and
   similarity studies * Density Profile Peaking -
   expectations/requirements? FIRE Issues and Needs (p.2) * Internal
   Transport Barriers (AT Modes) * Access to ATs with: RF heated, q95 ~

   impurity in core and "tritium" retention * Consistency of partially
   detached divertor with good E and He removal * Models and improved
   designs for extending lifetime (Elms/disruptions) * Plasma Termination
   and Halo Currents * Does DN neutral zone reduce force or frequency of
   disruptions? * Develop early warning, mitigation and recovery
   techniques * Finite- effects * stabilization of NTMs using LHCD ( '
   modification) * elms for enhanced confinement modes * TAE, EPM studies
   in DD with beams and RF * Diagnostic development - high priority needs
   to added in a future meeting Summary * The FIRE "Pre-Conceptual" design
   point has been chosen to be a "stepping stone" between the physics
   accessible with present experiments and the physics required for the
   ARIES vision of magnetic fusion energy. * A compact high field tokamak,
   like FIRE, has the potential: * address the important burning plasma
   issues, * most of the advanced tokamak issues and, * begin to study the
   strong non-linear coupling between BP and AT under quasi-stationary
   conditions in a $1B class facility. * Some areas that need additional
   work to realize this potential include: * Consider data base as a
   Library not just collection of statistical points * Understand physics
   behind enhanced confinement regimes * Compare DN relative to SN -
   confinement, stability, divertor, etc * Understand high density/low
   density aspects of FIRE, and to future * Develop better disruption
   control/mitigation techniques. * Others from this workshop!! Timetable

   the alpha-dominated burning plasma issues for 15 years. * Compact
   High-Field Tokamak Burning Plasma Experiment(s) would be a natural
   extension of the ongoing "advanced" tokamak program and could begin
   alpha- dominated experiments by ~ 10 years. * More than one high gain
   burning plasma facility is needed in the world program. * The
   information "exists now" to make a technical assessment, and decision
   on MFE burning plasma experiments for the next decade. Recent Events *
   Energy Authorization Bill (HR 4) passed by the House on August 1, 2001
   directs DOE to submit a plan for a U.S. Burning Plasma Experiment to
   Congress by July 2004. In addition, DOE may also develop a plan for
   United States participation in an international burning plasma
   experiment for the same purpose,.... * Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory
   Committee (FESAC) endorses recommendations of FESAC Burning Plasma
   Panel on August 2. * National Research Council is preparing a proposal
   to review burning plasma physics as required by HR 4 and recommended by
   FESAC. * Preparations are beginning for a Snowmass Summer Study 2002

   Sciences Summer Study 8-19 July 2002 The 2002 Fusion Summer Study will
   be a forum for the critical assessment of major next-steps in the
   fusion energy sciences program, and will provide crucial community
   input to the long range planning activities undertaken by the DOE and
   the FESAC. It will be an ideal place for a broad community of
   scientists to examine goals and proposed initiatives in burning plasma
   science in magnetic fusion energy and integrated research experiments
   in inertial fusion energy. This meeting is open to every member of the
   fusion energy science community and significant international
   participation is encouraged. Program Committee Co-Chairs: Roger
   Bangerter, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Gerald Navratil,
   Columbia University Ned Sauthoff, Princeton University Objectives of
   the Fusion Summer Study: 1) Review scientific issues in burning plasmas
   to establish the basis for following two objectives. Address the
   relation of burning plasma in tokamaks to innovative MFE confinement
   concepts and ignition in IFE to integrated research facilities. 2)
   Provide a forum for critical discussion and review of proposed MFE
   burning plasma experiments (e.g. IGNITOR, FIRE, and ITER) and assess
   the scientific and technological research opportunities and prospective
   benefits of these approaches to the study of burning plasmas. 3)
   Provide a forum for the IFE community to present plans for prospective
   integrated research facilities, assess present status of the technical
   base for each, and establish a timetable and technical progress
   necessary to proceed for each. Background The 2002 Summer Study will
   build on earlier planning activity at the 1999 Fusion Summer Study and
   the scientific assessments at the UFA sponsored Burning Plasma Science
   Workshops (Austin, Dec 2000; San Diego, May 2001). The scientific views
   of the participants developed during the Summer Study preparation
   activities and during the 2002 Summer Study itself, will provide
   critical fusion community input to the decision process of FESAC and
   DOE in 2002-2003, and to the review of burning plasma science by the
   National Academy of Sciences called for by FESAC and Energy Legislation
   which was passed by the House of Representatives [H. R. 4]. Output of
   the Fusion Summer Study: An executive summary based on summary reports
   from each of the working groups will be prepared as well as a
   comprehensive proceedings of plenary and contributed presentations.
