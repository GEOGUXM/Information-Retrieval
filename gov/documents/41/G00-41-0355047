   DOT Mentoring

                      THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION'S

                       MAY 26, 1998 ALL EMPLOYEE MEMO
     __________________________________________________________________

   Several months ago, I announced that we would be establishing a
   Departmental mentoring program to provide employees an opportunity to
   have a mentor from any organization within the Department. I am excited
   about this revitalized DOT-wide program and believe it will truly
   foster the ONE DOT concept by creating opportunities for us to learn
   from one another, grow together, and become the ONE DOT as envisioned
   in our Strategic Plan.

   I encourage all employees, both headquarters and field, to take the
   time to understand the benefits of this program. By participating as a
   mentor, you can pass on your experience, knowledge, and commitment to
   excellence. Mentees can learn how to be the best they can be. Please
   note that under this Departmental mentoring program, field employees
   are not limited to having a mentor in a specific location. In fact,
   experience has shown that successful mentoring relationships are
   possible in differing locations. Within the next few weeks, you will
   receive information on how to choose a mentor by reviewing the data
   base of mentors. Additional information on the program is available
   from your servicing personnel office and will soon be accessible from
   the DOT home page.

   All headquarters employees are invited to attend a kickoff reception on
   June 4, 1998, in the Nassif Building, Room 2230, from 10:00 a.m. to
   12:00 p.m. to learn more about how to participate either as a mentee or
   mentor. Headquarters mentors, who have already signed up for the
   program, are invited to attend to greet and meet employees interested
   in becoming mentees and possibly some mentor/mentee matching can take
   place. For those of you in the field, we plan to have this event
   videotaped and made available to the regions so that similar events can
   be held in various filed locations.

   I strongly believe if we are to succeed in fulfilling our vision of the
   ONE DOT that will carry us forward into the 21st century, it will
   require the resources of a motivated, knowledgeable work force focused
   on growth and development. Partnerships between mentors and mentees can
   help us accomplish just that. Opportunity is knocking -- all you need
   to do is open the mentoring program door. Let's invest in each other
   and help to make DOT the best place to work.
