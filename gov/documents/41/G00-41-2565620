                   MUSEUM EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

   As a service to the public, the New York State Museum offers a variety
   of educational programming for schools and educational groups. Such
   groups may register for Instructor-guided programs or self-guided
   visits.

   In addition, the Museum offers a number of Professional Development
   Workshops. These programs assist education professionals in finding
   ways to use Museum resources in designing curriculum of their own.
