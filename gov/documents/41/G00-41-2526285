   OSM Seal Tree hunt [tree72.gif] A new round has begun
   Toolbar3.gif

   The Office of Surface Mining is examining methods that would enhance
   post mining land use plans that promote the planting of trees on active
   and abandoned surface coal mines. Benefits of reforestation include:
   improving wildlife habitat and recreation opportunities, restoration of
   clean water resources, erosion prevention, creation of new economies
   based on forest products, and an aid to offset carbon emissions.

   We have placed 20 trees like the one above, throughout the Office of
   Surface Mining web site. If you are the first person to find all the
   trees we will send you a 20th Anniversary of the Surface Mining Law
   commemorative mouse pad.

   Here's how to it works:
    1. When you find a tree, click on it and you will go to a page where
       you can register your tree.
    2. You will have to provide a name (your "handle" used for the tree
       hunt), and your e-mail address^1 so we can contact you if your the
       first person to find all the trees.
    3. Once you have registered your "handle" for the tree hunt you can
       check the status of the hunt and see how many trees you and every
       one else has found.
    4. We will be repeating the tree hunt, so if you don't win this time
       stop back and try again. And remember, the number of trees has been
       increased and now there are 20 trees to find in this round...hint,
       don't forget to look at the bottom of the pages.
    5. Good luck!!!

   1. The E-mail address is only being collected for the purpose of
   notifying the first person that finds all the trees. The file
   containing the addresses will be destroyed at the end of each round of
   the tree hunt.
