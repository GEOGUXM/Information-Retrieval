    On the morning of 28 May, 1998, a malicious user from hanoi-fw.vnn.vn
   deleted approximately 600 EMLIB database entries. Messages were sent to
   the owners of the records indicating that the records had been deleted.
          As can be imagined, this caused quite a bit of confusion.

   As a result of this malicious action, the automatic deletion mechanism
       has been turned off, and deletion actions must now be performed
                        manually by the EMLIB staff.

               Thanks for your patience during this incident,
                            emstaff, 9 June 1998
