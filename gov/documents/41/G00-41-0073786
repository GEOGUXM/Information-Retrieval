   Project Summary
   click for larger image click for larger image Coastal and island
   forests on the Caribbean coast of Honduras suffered direct impacts due
   to the passage of Hurricane Mitch (October 27 - 29 1998). The hurricane
   lingered in the vicinity of the island of Guanaja for several days; as
   a result of prolonged high-intensity winds (up to 150 mph) the island
   lost most of its pine trees (left image) due to defoliation and
   uprooting. Local communities and businesses (right image) were also
   destroyed. The island also lost almost all of its mangroves due to a
   combination of wind and wave shear as well as prolonged flooding
   stress.
   Forests on the island of Roatan were also damaged from the high winds
   associated with the passage of the hurricane. Forests on the mainland
   also received impacts, although to a lesser degree.
   Coastal forests represent a very important ecosystem, offering many
   valuable environmental and economic services such as aquifer recharge,
   flood protection, shoreline protection, carbon storage, timber and
   habitat for native, endangered and commercially-important animal
   species. The value of these services makes it important to manage
   coastal forests for long-term sustainability.
   The documentation of impacts to coastal forests due to Hurricane Mitch
   provides an important reference to evaluate recovery and restoration.
   The ability to predict future storm-related impacts is also an
   important tool for managing natural resources in this zone, by
   identifying areas of high sensitivity or areas where restoration may be
   more critical.. Tropical storms and hurricanes will continue to
   threaten the coast of Honduras, and the ability to predict impacts to
   the coastal environment will help natural resource managers and
   decision-makers elaborate plans for the successful sustainable
   management of the natural resources therein.
   Objectives
   1) To document post-hurricane damage to coastal forests and shoreline
   vegetation in the Bay Islands and along the north coast of Honduras.
   2) To correlate damage expression and extent of downed and defoliated
   forest resources in relation to Hurricane Mitch storm path and wind
   fields.
   3) To calibrate a hurricane wind simulation model (HURASIM) to the
   damage to coastal forests and shoreline vegetation in the Bay Islands
   and along the north coast of Honduras.
   Approach
    A. Aerial videography click for larger image
          + Low-altitude video capture of damage to coastal forests and
            shoreline vegetation:
          + Bay Islands, Honduras
          + Roat√°n - eastern end shoreline
          + Guanaja - shoreline and interior slope
          + North Coast, Honduras mainland
          + La Ceiba to Mosquito Coast - shoreline
    B. Image analysis
          + Forest Type and Density
          + Windfall Angles by Tree and Scene
          + Tree Heights and Diameters
          + Greenness Index: Percent Canopy Recovery
          + Damage Class Assessment
    C. Damage correlation
          + Critical Wind Speed Relations
          + Forest Type Susceptibility
          + Effect of Orographic Sheltering
          + Critical Wind Angle Assessment
          + Correlation with Simulated Wind Angle
          + Wind Funneling Effects of Landform
    D. HURASIM model
          + Tracks hurricane movement and circulation
          + Predicts site-specific wind speed profiles
          + Derives site-specific wind angles
          + Creates composite maps of hurricane force
