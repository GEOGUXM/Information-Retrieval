   [tinybluebutton.gif] Two more Circulating Recombinant Forms have been
   named: CRF13_cpx, consisting of subtypes A, E, G, J, U, and CRF14_BG.
   Their mosaic pattern can be found on the CRF page. November 26, 2001.

               [tinybluebutton.gif] Frequently asked questions

    Search interfaces:
    [tinybluebutton.gif] HIV-MAP: retrieve sequences by accession number,
    gene, subtype and country. With this interface, sequences can be
    aligned during the retrieval, and smaller regions can be clipped out.
    [tinybluebutton.gif] DBSearch: retrieve sequences based on all HIV
    database search fields and added information.

    Programs and tools:
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Tools for working with sequences: Gapstrip,
    Motifscan, Primalign, Epilign, HXB2 Numbering, SeqPublish, HIV-BLAST
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Programs for sequence analysis: RIP
    (Recombination), SNAP (Syn-Nonsyn), VESPA (Signature patterns),
    Hypermut, PCOORD, and more...
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Other programs for analysis of HMA data and
    optical density data
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Links to external programs: phylogenetics,
    recombination, subtyping, multiple alignment, sequence submission
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Tutorials on subtype and CRF nomenclature,
    sequence quality control and tree building

    Alignments:
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Complete alignments of all genes (nt and aa) and
    complete genomes (nt only)
    [tinybluebutton.gif] Subtype reference alignments for use in trees,
    subtype comparisons and recombination research
