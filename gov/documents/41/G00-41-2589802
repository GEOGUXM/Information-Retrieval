   The INEEL has implemented a program to contribute to the victims of the
                                 tragic events of Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001.

            INEEL's CARE committee is working through a grant from Bechtel
   Foundation to significantly increase donations made by INEEL employees.
     The Foundation is offering a 2:1 match for all employee contributions
     to New York City Public Private Initiatives, Inc., a nonprofit agency
          assisting the families of rescue workers lost at the World Trade
                                                                   Center.

   A number of community activities are sponsored by the INEEL to help
   people understand more about our work. For over a half-century the
   INEEL has put science to work, addressing some of the nation's most
   pressing environmental, energy, and nuclear technology challenges. This
   heritage of service is building a reputation for Idaho and the INEEL as
   the home of science and engineering solutions. Given the INEEL's rising
   national prominence as a science and research center there is genuine
   interest by many people to learn more about the research and operations
   work performed at the Laboratory. We invite you to learn more about the
   INEEL through the following opportunities.

   INEEL Tours. Our tours program offers guided excursions to the site
   where visitors have the opportunity to increase their knowledge on
   INEEL facilities, operations, history, ecology and many other topics.
   Tours can be tailored to your group and can cover many areas of
   interest, including science and engineering research, archeological and
   cultural topics, the historic impacts of the INEEL as a nuclear
   research facility, and wildlife and ecosystem management.

   In the year 2000, INEEL conducted 176 tours for 2,395 visitors, and
   made 205 presentations. Tours can be arranged through Communications.
   To schedule a tour, or for further tour information, contact:

   INEEL Speakers. Our speakers bureau provides presentations to schools,
   business and civic organizations. A variety of topics are available
   including an overview of the INEEL, new technologies, cultural
   resources, careers and many other subjects. We invite you to contact us
   and schedule a speaker.

   INEEL Contribution Opportunities. INEEL offers a variety of
   opportunities for grants and donations to nonprofit organizations.
   Donations may be requested from the INEEL Community Assistance and
   Resource for Employees (CARE) Committee, or the INEEL Annual Grant
   Committee. Contribution requests must focus on health and human
   services, education, community development, youth, civic affairs, or
   culture and the arts. Employees are also encouraged to apply for Team
   INEEL projects through the CARE Committee. Additional information is
   available by contacting:

   Volunteering. Our employees and their families are part of the fabric
   of eastern Idaho. The INEEL's diverse workforce, community economic
   development programs, educational outreach and economic impact, both
   locally and statewide, are a welcome part of everyday living for many
   communities. Team INEEL is an employee-driven volunteer program
   supporting causes in the communities where INEEL employees live.

   Generosity and involvement typify INEEL workers and their families, as
   evidenced by the significant number of hours they spend in volunteer
   activities of all kinds. Laboratory employees and their families
   volunteer 1.5 million hours annually in support of religious
   organizations, schools, and a variety of youth, civic, and political
   associations so important to the communities within which they live. It
   works out to about 208 hours of volunteer service to these different
   causes from each of the INEELs 7,467 households.

   In addition to their contributions of time, employees report making
   charitable contributions that total nearly $20 million annually. That
   is an average annual contribution of $2,590 per household.
