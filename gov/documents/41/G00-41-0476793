   [clearspc.gif] Cantor Introduces Congressional Safety and Security
   Council for the Seventh District of Virginia

   Richmond, VA, Nov. 27— Today, Congressman Eric Cantor (R-Virginia)
   introduced the Congressional Safety and Security Council for the
   Seventh District of Virginia. (Click here for the full text of Cantor's
   prepared remarks.)  Members of the council represent local and state
   government and the private sector. Cantor was joined by many of the 26
   members of the council today to announce this unprecedented effort to
   bring together the private and public sectors, including the federal
   level, with a focus on shoring up safety in Virginia's Seventh
   District.

   In response to Governor Tom Ridge’s mission as Director of Homeland
   Security to coordinate a national strategy to safeguard America against
   terrorism, the mission of the council is to identify threats to
   potential local targets of terrorism, including public and private
   venues. Cantor and members of the council will develop recommendations
   for how to guard against identifiable targets in the Seventh District.

   Cantor said, "America has changed since the terrorist attacks on
   September 11, but our resolve as a nation and as a people remains
   strong. We have formed this Congressional Safety and Security Council
   to fulfill our responsibilities at the local level to keep our
   communities safe."

   "It has become clear that America’s response to terrorism cannot just
   rest at the federal level – the only way we can effectively combat
   terrorism is to engage citizens at every level. The federal government
   must work hand-in-hand with local and state governments," Cantor added.

   Early next year, the Congressional Safety and Security Council will
   release a public report detailing the council’s recommendations for
   ways to guard against the terrorism targets and vulnerabilities that
   have been identified in the Seventh District.

   The Honorable Richard Glover, Chairman of the Henrico County Board of
   Supervisors, will serve as Chairman of the Congressional Safety and
   Security Council, and Mr. Johnny Johnson of Market Place Holdings will
   serve as Vice-Chairman of the council.
