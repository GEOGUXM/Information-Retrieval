         A Day At the Races with the Washington Horse Racing Commission

     Horse racing is one of the most regulated forms of wagering available
     to the public. There are many safeguards and checks in place to
     maintain the integrity of the sport. It is a time-consuming job for
     each and every employee of the Washington Horse Racing Commission
     (WHRC).
     Even before the sun comes up and the first horse has stepped on the
     track the WHRC employees have begun their daily routine.
     We invite you to take a "behind the scenes" tour of a day at the
     racetrack.
