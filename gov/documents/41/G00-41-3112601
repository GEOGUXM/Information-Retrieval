   Do You Fish or Dive the Tortugas? Here's Some Important Information You
   Should Know: Rules implementing the Florida Keys National Marine
   Sanctuary's Tortugas Ecological Reserve became fully effective July 1,
   2001. The Tortugas Ecological Reserve consists of two sections:
   Tortugas North and Tortugas South. Tortugas North includes 91 square
   nautical miles of federal and state waters to the west and north of Dry
   Tortugas National Park. Tortugas South encompasses 60 square nautical
   miles southwest of Dry Tortugas National Park that includes Riley's
   Hump. The chart on the back of this page shows the reserve boundaries.
   The new regulations prohibit: Taking, disturbing or injuring any dead
   or living organism; fishing; and touching living or dead coral
   Discharge or deposit of any material except cooling water or engine
   exhaust Anchoring Mooring by vessels more than 100 feet in length
   overall Tortugas North Vessels may enter Tortugas North without an
   access permit only if they remain in continuous transit with fishing
   gear stowed (not available for immediate use). Visitors wishing to stop
   in Tortugas North or tie up to mooring buoys must obtain a free,
   no-paperwork permit by calling the Key West or Marathon offices of the
   Sanctuary. Diving and snorkeling are permitted. The Sanctuary has
   installed twelve mooring buoys in Tortugas North. Anchoring is
   prohibited. Drift diving is permitted, but vessels must obtain an
   access permit. Tortugas South Vessels may only enter Tortugas South if
   they remain in continuous transit with fishing gear stowed (not
   available for immediate use). Diving and snorkeling are prohibited. Not
   available for immediate use means that gear is not readily accessible,
   for example, it is stowed unbaited in a cabin, locker, rod holder, or
   similar storage area, or is securely covered and lashed to a deck or
   bulkhead. The regulations also expand Sanctuary boundaries to
   incorporate all the waters of the reserve, and general Sanctuary-wide
   regulations apply. Have questions or need an access permit for Tortugas
   North? Call the Sanctuary offices: Key West 305/292-0311 Marathon
