                             The St. Lawrence -
                     Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project

   Spanning the U.S.-Canadian border at Massena, New York, is an
   international hydroelectric facility that produces some of the cleanest
   and cheapest power in North America. The U.S. portion of this project
   is the St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project; on the
   Canadian side is the Robert H. Saunders Generating Station.

   The heart of this project, which generated first power in 1958, is the
   Robert Moses-Robert H. Saunders Power Dam, built cooperatively by the
   New York Power Authority and Ontario Hydro. The dam's 32
   turbine-generators are divided equally by the international border and
   are operated independently by the two utilities. The Power Authority's
   16 generating units can produce more than 900,000 kilowatts of
   electricity, more than enough to light a city the size of Washington,
   D.C., which has a population of 607,000!

   But the St. Lawrence-FDR project is much more than that. The entire
   project stretches over the St. Lawrence River Valley for 37 miles,
   within the Towns of Lisbon, Waddington, Louisville and Massena and the
   Village of Waddington. It includes two control structuresthe Iroquois
   and Long Sault damsupstream, along with almost 11 miles of dikes that
   help keep the St. Lawrence River within its banks. And we've built
   thousands of acres of parkland along the river for recreational
   enjoyment and wildlife preservation.

   The economic benefits of St. Lawrence-FDR are far-reaching. More than
   half of the project's output supplies local industries that employ
   thousands of New York's North Country residents. These industries are
   the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), General Motors Corporation (GM
   Powertrain) and Reynolds Metals Company. The project's hydroelectric
   power is also sold to upstate private utilities for resale without
   profit to residential and farm consumers, to public service entities in
   the New York City and Niagara Falls regions and to seven neighboring
   states under the terms of the project's federal license.

   We also operate an admission-free Visitors Center that sits atop the
   power dam. Treat yourself to energy-related exhibits, artwork depicting
   the history of the region and a panoramic view of the project and
   surrounding area. More than 4.7 million visitors have toured the center
   since it opened in 1959. Other area attractions include campgrounds,
   picnic areas and boating and fishing opportunities we've provided as
   part of our power project.

   Would you like to see the St. Lawrence Seaway up close? Built at the
   same time as our power project, the Seaway's Wiley-Dondero Ship
   Channel, with its Eisenhower and Snell locks, bypasses the
   Moses-Saunders dam as it moves cargo ships between the Great Lakes and
   the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, the entrance road to our visitors center
   takes drivers right under the navigation canal as giant ocean-going
   vessels pass by overhead!

   The 50-year federal license that allowed the Power Authority to build
   and operate the St. Lawrence-FDR project expires in 2003. A relicensing
   process, aimed at securing federal and state approvals to continue
   project operations, is now in full swing. The public is invited and
   encouraged to participate.
