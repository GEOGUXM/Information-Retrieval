     Dear California Senior:

     California is facing a major energy challenge. We can all help reduce
     consumption and improve energy efficiency. While California continues
     to experience electrical shortages and rolling blackouts, Governor
     Davis and leaders of the California Legislature are working with
     utilities, energy generators, and consumer groups to forge a long-term
     solution to this problem. In the short run, California's consumers and
   businesses can work to reduce electricity usage and use energy more
   efficiently.

   In all State of California agencies, we've implemented a plan to reduce
   consumption by a minimum of 8 percent. During critical power shortages,
   State agencies are conserving 20 percent. The Governor also has asked
   all Californians to reduce their electricity use by at least 8 percent.

   California has the power of nearly 35 million people and the sixth
   largest economy in the world. By implementing a few simple
   energy-saving measures, we can avoid shortages, lower energy bills, and
   have a major impact on the availability of power.

   We're asking you to flex your power. Each of us has an important role
   to play right now.
     * Cool off with fans instead of air conditioning. Keep your house at
       78 degrees or higher when you're home. Set your thermostat to 85
       degrees or off when you're away. Before increasing the temperature
       in your house, be sure to check with your doctor if you have health
       concerns.
     * Reduce energy use during peak hours. Help prevent rolling blackouts
       by using large appliances, such as washing machines and
       dishwashers, after 7 p.m.
     * One fridge is enough. You can save $150 or more a year just by
       unplugging your second refrigerator.
     * Don't light an empty room. Compact fluorescent bulbs save a lot.
       Turning out the lights saves event more. Don't forget to turn off
       computers and other electronic equipment when you're not using
       them.
     * If you reduce your electricity use by 20%, you may be eligible for
       a 20% credit on your summer electric bills. Contact your local
       utility for more information.
       If you need help paying your utility bills, call the California
       Department of Community Services and Development at: (800) 433-4327
       to see if you qualify for the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program,
       or www.csd.ca.gov/LIHEAP.htm. You may also want to check into
       special billing programs that are available to spread out payment
       of your utility bills throughout the year.
       If you have questions or need assistance, call the Department of
       Consumer Affairs Energy hotline at (800) YOURPWR or (800) 968-7797.
       For more energy saving tips, you can link directly to the State's
       "My California" Web portal at www.ca.gov.
       Taken together, each of these small steps add up. Each of us can
       make a dramatic difference during this energy crunch. Thanks for
       doing your part.
       Yours truly,

       California Department of Consumer Affairs
