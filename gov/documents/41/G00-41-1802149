   Operating Principles

      eRA's operating principles guide NIH in planning, implementing, and
      resolving issues for developing the system. eRA's project principles
      and any future changes to them are reviewed by the eRA Steering
      Committee and ratified by the IT Board of Governors.
       1. The research community will be involved in planning, prioritizing,
          and implementing eRA, which is therefore defined by its users and
          built for their requirements.
       2. Long-range plans will include participation of eRA's partners so
          that IT systems of NIH, IMPAC II, Commons, and Federal Commons are
          fully interoperable.
       3. Project information will be communicated as completely as possible
          to all appropriate parties.
       4. eRA will adhere to iterative, modular software development with
          maximum reuse of components and preference for off-the-shelf
          products, seeking out the best new technologies and practices from
          any source.
       5. Technologies and processes will meet all reasonable special needs
          of eRA partners.
       6. All data will be secure, high quality, and available.
