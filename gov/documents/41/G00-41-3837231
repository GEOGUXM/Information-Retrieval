 Subject: On October 5, 2001, Governor Davis signed Senate Bill 837
          (Scott) (Statutes of 2001, Chapter 585). SB 837 amends Education Code
          Section 44300 relating to the issuance of emergency permits. The bill
          specifies the policies and practices a district must undertake when
          conducting a diligent search for suitable credentialed teachers. It
          also gives the Commission authorization to deny a district's request
          for emergency permits when a district does not conduct a diligent
          search. The bill contained an urgency clause; consequently it became
          effective October 5, 2001. A detailed review of the specific
          requirements, changes and the new Declaration of Need (CL-500 - PDF -)
          are outlined in this Coded Correspondence.
