    The South Pole Observatory was established at the geographical south
     pole at 2837 m above sea level in 1957 as part of the International
       Geophysical Year. The National Science Foundation provides the
     infrastructure for the NOAA/CMDL scientific operations including a
      state of the art science building named the Atmospheric Research
    Observatory opened in 1996. Two CMDL observatory staff spend one year
       tours of duty at the station which includes a 9 month period of
                    isolation and six months of darkness.
    The South Pole Observatory (SPO) is one of four atmospheric baseline
   observatories for NOAA's Climate Monitoring and Diagnositics Laboratory
   (CMDL).  The Atmospheric Research Observatory (ARO) was built by NSF in
    1997 to house current atmospheric research and replaced NOAA's Clean
   Air Facility in operation from 1977 to 1997.  Atmospheric data has been
     collected from South Pole since the International Geophysical Year
    (IGY), 1957 - 1958.  Follow the next few pages for information about
                the science, life, and history at South Pole.
