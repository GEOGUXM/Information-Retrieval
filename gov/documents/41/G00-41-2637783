   Space and Atmospheric Sciences (NIS-1)

      Deputy Group Leader

      NIS-1 supports the DOE's mission to verify nuclear test ban treaties by
      developing technologies capable of detecting clandestine nuclear tests
      and by monitoring nuclear weapons proliferation activities. We are
      DOE's experts in nuclear weapons effects in the atmosphere and space,
      an expertise needed to support our treaty verification programs. NIS-1
      has significant capability in designing, integrating, and analyzing
      data from space-based sensors.

      NIS-1 monitors the atmosphere and near-earth space for possible nuclear
      tests with satellite-borne particle and radio-frequency detectors. The
      techniques under development to detect proliferation activities use
      neural networks, buried power line detection methods, krypton/xenon and
      tritium detectors, and neutron spectrometry. We also apply some of
      these techniques to the ground-based detection and characterization of
      nuclear materials for nonproliferation purposes.
