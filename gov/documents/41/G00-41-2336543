                                    ESI Maps

   A main objective of spill response in the United States, after
   protecting human life, is to reduce the environmental consequences of
   both spills and cleanup efforts. To do this, it's necessary to identify
   vulnerable coastal locations before a spill happens, so that protection
   priorities can be established and cleanup strategies identified

   To meet this need, NOAA OR&R researchers, working with colleagues in
   State and Federal governments, have produced Environmental Sensitivity
   Index (ESI) maps. An example section from an ESI map appears below.

   Graphic: Example ESI map - 24K GIF ESI maps serve as quick references
   for oil and chemical spill responders and coastal zone managers. They
   contain three kinds of information:
     * Shorelines are color-coded to indicate their sensitivity to oiling.
     * Sensitive biological resources, such as seabird colonies and marine
       mammal hauling grounds, are depicted by special symbols on the
       maps.
     * ESI maps also show sensitive human-use resources, such as water
       intakes, marinas, and swimming beaches.

   Project scientists have created collections of ESI maps, called ESI
   atlases, for most coastal areas in the US, including Alaska, Hawaii,
   the Great Lakes, and the Trust Territories. Each atlas includes
     * a set of maps.
     * pages of additional information about the biological resources and
       other features shown on the maps.

   To learn more about ESI maps and the information they contain, view a
   sample map and other products, try an online exercise, or view more
   technical ESI references, including the metadata for many ESI atlases.

   ESI maps are available in print and electronic formats. Our Product
   Ordering page and list of available ESI atlases show which atlases are
   available, in which formats.

Project Status

   Starting in 1995 with the outer coast of California, ESI project
   members began using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce
   updated ESI maps that are higher in quality and can be more readily
   reproduced. Using a GIS also has made it possible to distribute ESI
   information in a variety of digital formats as well as as paper maps.
   Each of NOAA's ESI mapping efforts is a cooperative effort with the
   primary State response agency, other State and Federal agencies, and
   industry.
