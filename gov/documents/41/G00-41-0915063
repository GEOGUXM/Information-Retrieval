     FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of
     regulations than those covering "conventional" foods and drug
     products (prescription and Over-the-Counter). Under the Dietary
     Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the dietary
     supplement manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that a dietary
     supplement is safe before it is marketed. FDA is responsible for
     taking action against any unsafe dietary supplement product after it
     reaches the market. Generally, manufacturers do not need to register
     with FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling dietary
     supplements. Manufacturers must make sure that product label
     information is truthful and not misleading.

     FDA's post-marketing responsibilities include monitoring safety,
     e.g. voluntary dietary supplement adverse event reporting, and
     product information, such as labeling, claims, package inserts, and
     accompanying literature. The Federal Trade Commission regulates
     dietary supplement advertising.
