   Town of Blacksburg Municipal Building

   The Town Of Blacksburg has been organized under the Council-Manager
   form of government since 1962. Town Council is the legislative body of
   the Town and is empowered by the Town Charter to make Town policy
   decisions. Council members, including the Mayor, are elected at large
   for four-year staggering terms.

   The Town presently has six operating departments: Finance, Parks and
   Recreation, Planning and Engineering, Police, Public Works, and
   Transit. Each department has a Director or Manager who is responsible
   to the Town Manager.

   Blacksburg is fortunate to have an active and involved citizenry.
   Citizen participation in town government is particularly evident in the
   many advisory groups appointed by the Town Council. Citizens interested
   in serving on a board or commission are encouraged to contact Donna
   Boone-Caldwell, Town Clerk at (540) 961-1147.
