   Welcome to the Kennedy Space Center's online Space Shuttle resource.
   From this page we have provided access to a variety of information
   relating to the Space Shuttle, one of the most durable, reliable, and
   versatile vehicles ever built. You'll also find updates on upcoming
   Space Shuttle missions and astronaut crews, Shuttle processing, and
   up-to-the-minute launch coverage. Ever wanted to tour those highly
   restricted areas at NASA? Be sure to visit Fun Space where you can
   simulate a Shuttle launch and more.
