   Securing Network Infrastructure: Routers

   A comprehensive network security policy should take into consideration
   routers, which are the specialized computing devices that manage
   information flow between networks and the Internet. By taking advantage
   of improperly configured systems, insecure administrative practices, or
   software vulnerabilities, even an apprentice hacker can co-opt a router
   and use it in an attack. The Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT)
   Coordination Center has reported a rise in intruder's compromising
   routers.

   Intruders may target routers in several ways. By reconfiguring the
   router, network traffic can be misdirected or cut off. A flooding
   denial-of-service (DoS) attack performed on a boundary router can block
   legitimate Internet service. Other attacks include crashing a router
   and then masquerading as the disabled device, thus enabling the
   attacker to read, send, and receive network data.

   Victims of an attack can range far beyond the targeted router's
   immediate network. A hijacked router can be utilized by a malicious
   intruder as a platform for scanning other networks or for performing
   flooding attacks against other hosts on the Internet. There have been
   reports of malicious individuals assembling networks consisting of
   hundreds of hacked routers. Such a network could potentially be used to
   launch a devastating DOS attack.

   The following points will minimize the risk of an organization's router
   being successfully compromised and utilized in attacks:
     * Ensure all routers are included in the corporate information
       security policy.
     * Conduct regular security audits of routers to ensure policy
       adherence.
     * Change the vendor-supplied default administrative passwords on all
       routers.
     * Enable encrypted administrative communications to the router if
       possible, and limit the addresses allowed to establish a connection
       to the device.
     * Apply updates to eliminate known vulnerabilities in the router's
       operating system.

   Hacker how-to guides and software exploits for certain router
   vulnerabilities are already available in the computer underground.
   Based on past experience, one can expect a greater distribution of
   software tools that offer automated vulnerability discovery and attack
   capability against routers in the future.

   Several on-line resources can assist administrators in securing their
   routers.

   Evolution of Malicious Code During 2001: Increasing Role of Worms and
   Malicious Code Packages with Multiple Capabilities

   Technical professionals have noted a significant new development in
   malicious code trends. This trend is the rise in prominence of worms
   (self-propagating malicious code) in the "top ten" list reported
   monthly by major computer security and anti-virus vendors. Computer
   viruses, had, until recent years dominated the "top ten."

   Tracking the trend
   Three worms emerged during 1999 on the top ten "infectors" list. By the
   beginning of 2000, computer viruses and worms each accounted for
   approximately half of the list. The number of worms rose to eight of
   the top ten "infectors" by the end of 2000, and this pattern continued
   into 2001. In July and August 2001, it was observed that worms
   accounted for all of the top ten malicious code attacks.

   Worms as the "weapon of choice" for computer attacks
   Articles by security and anti-virus technical professionals often
   disagree on specific details in discussing malicious code complexities.
   The differences include different views on the severity of individual
   malicious code attacks compared to those of other attacks, and on how
   to rank specific attacks within the overall scope of attacks.
   Additionally, several technical professionals have referred to the
   increase of malicious code attacks incorporating worm attributes as
   worms becoming the "weapon of choice" for computer attacks during 2001.

   Increased capabilities of malicious code packages have resulted in more
   devastating impacts.
   Several other trends were also noted in 2001. Most significantly, is
   the incorporation of the capabilities of worms, Trojan horses
   (backdoors), and viruses in a single package. Malicious code attacks
   during 2001 also included techniques for propagating more rapidly than
   ever before. The brief interval between the Code Red worm and the
   release of Nimda worm continued the long-established trend of malicious
   code packages being modified based on "lessons learned" from previous
   attacks. This resulted in a more advanced malicious code package.
   Initial analysis of the "VBS/Mass-Mailing Worm, W32/Goner.A" that
   appeared on or about December 4, 2001 is in progress and we are
   currently evaluating the degree to which the "Goner" worm may
   incorporate capabilities not emphasized in earlier packages.
   Many technical professionals believe that the increasingly difficult
   challenges presented by malicious code will continue to be an emerging
   trend. However, aggressive and up to date security practices and
   policies can mitigate such impacts. While new defensive approaches are
   being developed to deal with the increasingly powerful, fast spreading
   malicious code attacks, immediate attention by system administrators is
   needed.

   Telecommunications - Information Sharing and Analysis Center

   Purpose: The Telecommunications - Information Sharing and Analysis
   Center (Telecom-ISAC) is a function under the National Coordinating
   Center for Telecommunications (NCC). The Telecom-ISAC mission is to
   facilitate voluntary collaboration and information sharing among
   Government and industry ISAC members in support of Executive Order
   12472 and the critical infrastructure protection goals of Presidential
   Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63). The Telecom-ISAC will gather and
   analyze "all hazards" information on vulnerabilities, threats,
   intrusions, and anomalies in order to avert or mitigate impact upon the
   telecommunications infrastructure. Information will be sanitized and
   disseminated in accordance with Information Sharing Agreements
   established by the Telecom-ISAC Participants.

   Background: In accordance with PDD-63 and The National Plan for
   Information Systems Protection, the NCC established the Telecom-ISAC on
   March 01, 2000 in support of two goals outlined in the National Plan.
   The first is the establishment of the U.S. Government as a "model for
   information security," while the second is the development of a
   private-public partnership to defend the national telecommunications
   infrastructure. Although the concept of the ISAC was new, the NCC has
   been a central hub for sharing critical national security / emergency
   preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications information between Government
   and industry since 1984. The NCC -- established in 1984 based on a
   recommendation to the President by the National Security
   Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Â– to coordinate
   telecommunications restoration and to provision during national
   disasters through Government/industry cooperation on a 24-hour basis.

   Highlights:
     * The Telecom-ISAC is the only ISAC currently established to have
       both Government and industry members.
     * The Telecom-ISAC builds on the history of cooperation and
       established trust relationships among the NCC members.
     * Government representation: Departments of State, Defense and
       Commerce; the General Services Administration; the Federal
       Communications Commission; and the Federal Emergency Management
       Agency.
     * Industry representation: AT&T, Avici, BellSouth, Boeing, Cisco
       Systems, Computer Sciences Corporation, EDS, ITT Industries,
       Lockheed Martin, Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks, Qwest
       Communications, Raytheon, SBC, Science Applications International
       Corporation, Sprint, TRW, the United States Telecom Association,
       Verizon Communications, and WorldCom.
     * Full participation in the Telecom-ISAC is also open to companies
       that provide network services, equipment, or software to the
       communications and information sector, or Government NS/EP users.
       Potential participants include commercial local exchange carriers
       (CLECs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs), vendors, software
       providers, federal, state, and local agencies.
