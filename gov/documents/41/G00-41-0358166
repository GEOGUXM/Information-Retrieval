     Water from this scenic reservoir powers the turbines of the Raccoon
     Mountain Pumped Storage Plant near Chattanooga, Tennessee.






   The Mountaintop Marvel

   Scorned at the outset as a scheme worthy of Rube Goldberg, TVAs
   pumped-storage generating plant inside Raccoon Mountain became one of
   the engineering wonders of the Tennessee Valley.

   Raccoon Mountains four Allis-Chalmers turbine-pump hybrids occupy a
   space the size of a football field carved out of solid limestone.

   Steep Raccoon Mountain, located along the eastern fringe of the rocky
   Cumberland Plateau, has always been a remote place, sparsely settled
   and hard to get to even though its only six miles west of Chattanooga,
   Tennessee, as the crow flies. Downstream from the city, even the mighty
   Tennessee River takes a sharp hairpin turn northward to avoid this big
   bulk of limestone and pine.

   Unchanging as the mountain looks, its not the same as it was 30 years
   ago. On top of it is something that didnt exist when Cherokee hunters
   stalked bear and wildcat there in times past: a man-made lake holding
   about 60 million cubic yards of water.

   And deep below the lake, hundreds of feet down in the dark heart of
   Raccoon Mountain, are elevators, lighted tunnels, and huge pieces of
   heavy machinery. Its not the underworld home of the spirit people of
   Cherokee legend, nor the lair of some crazed James Bond villain. Its
   TVAs Raccoon Mountain Pumped Storage Plant, whose unassuming name
   belies the fact that its one of the engineering marvels of the 1970s.
   There is nothing else like it in the Valley.


                                                            [racoon2.jpg]
    The power plant in the heart of Raccoon Mountain under construction in
                                                                the 1970s.

   TVA started speculating about the project as early as 1961, seeking a
   way to deal with the Valleys burgeoning demand for power. Almost
   everyone had electricity, and many people were buying air conditioners
   and dishwashers and televisions for the first time. It was soon
   apparent that demand would not only continue to increase but also
   fluctuate wildly.

   Although the use of electricity was typically much greater in the
   daytime than at night, most generators produced power at a constant
   rate. TVA engineers searched for a way to store energy so that they
   could call on it when demand rose. One way of doing this was to pump
   additional water into the reservoir behind a dam and hold its potential
   energy there until it was needed.

   During the 1950s, TVA had experimented with the idea on a smaller scale
   at Hiwassee Dam in North Carolina. There it employed an
   energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand
   hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. On that
   relatively modest scale, the idea seemed to work.

   The Hiwassee experiment inspired TVAs engineers to dream bigger. What
   if water could be pumped not just to the top of a dam, but to a
   reservoir on top of a mountain? And what if a long drainpipe could
   funnel the water down, say, 1,000 feet to a powerhouse far below?

   Most agencies would have dismissed the idea, calling it wild-eyed and
   impractical. Indeed, when the Kennedy administration suggested a
   feasibility study of pumped-storage systems in 1961, the response was
   underwhelming. A waste of the taxpayers money, groused
   Representative James Haley, a member of the presidents own party.
   Walter Rogers, chairman of the House Irrigation and Reclamation
   Subcommittee and himself a sponsor of the study, termed the idea a
   Rube Goldberg invention.

   But TVA found funding and put its engineers to work. Careful studies of
   the Raccoon Mountain site suggested that such a project would be very
   difficult, but not impossible. A small lake would be hollowed out on
   the mountaintop and sealed by a huge 8,500-foot-long dam. In a
   subterranean pumphouse, four great turbines would generate electricity
   from the plummeting water. Then, during times of low power demand,
   theyd be shifted into reverse and would pump the water back up to the
   top of the mountain at a rate of seven million gallons a minute.

   During times of high demand for electricity, water is released from the
   Raccoon Mountain reservoir to generate power. When demand is low the
   generating turbines are reversed to pump water back to the top of the
   mountain.

   Throughout the 1960s TVA engineers fine-tuned the idea, using models
   built at the agencys lab in Norris, Tennessee. Finally, in February
   1970, the TVA Board gave the go-ahead. Construction began that summer.

   More than 1,000 workers labored at Raccoon Mountain during the next
   several years, excavating 10 million cubic yards of earth to build the
   lake, digging 12,000 feet of subterranean tunnels, carving a space the
   size of a football field out of solid limestone, and installing four
   huge Allis-Chalmers pump turbines. Over 10 million cubic yards of fill
   was used to construct the mountaintop dam; its the largest rock-fill
   dam ever built by TVA.

   In 1974, the National Society of Professional Engineers named the work
   at Raccoon Mountain one of Americas most outstanding engineering
   projects. When completed, the plant would be the largest water-storage
   facility of its kind in the world.

   The project took longer than expected. Originally scheduled for
   completion in 1973, it wasnt finished until 1979, at a cost of just
   over 300 million dollars. But it worked well beyond all expectations.
   The storage reservoir gives the Raccoon Mountain plant a tremendous
   amount of flexibility to balance the load and supply on the TVA system.
   The power used for pumping provides needed load during low-demand hours
   while providing power during peak-demand hours. The plant is also able
   to change power output very rapidly, thus matching load and supply as
   well as providing a back-up power source throughout the day.

   With its 1.6 million kilowatts of capacity, the Raccoon Mountain Pumped
   Storage Plant generates 14 times more power than nearby Chickamauga
   Dam, and it is a major factor in the efficient, reliable operation of
   the entire TVA power system.

   It has done that every day for almost a quarter of a century and, in
   the wake of the plants current modernization and upgrade in capacity,
   it will continue to do it for years to come.
