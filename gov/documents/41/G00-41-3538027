   applicable to each entry and carry the sum to two decimal places
   without rounding. Students in ungraded classes should be counted as
   grades K-3 if under 9 years of age, as grades 4-6 if ages 9 through 12

   students by grade grouping (K-3, 4-6 or 7-12), school of placement
   (district-operated or other public school) and residency status
   (resident or nonresident). If the number of students reported at these
   entries is greater than 25% of the total number of students receiving
   special education services or programs for 60% or more of the school
   day in both integrated and non-integrated classroom settings, please
   describe those integrated special education services being provided in

   eligible for the integrated settings weighting. However, if students
   with disabilities from your school district receive 60% or more of
   their special education services in a BOCES operated general education
   classroom setting with nondisabled students, they should be reported at
   Entries 25-27. In such cases, if the number of students reported is
   greater than 10% of the total number of students receiving special
   education services or programs for 60% or more of the school day in
   both BOCES operated integrated and BOCES operated non-integrated
   classroom settings, please describe those integrated special education
