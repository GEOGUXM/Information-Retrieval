Cosmic Signal Simulations

  Fast-Spherical Harmonic Transform:

          We need to generate a large number of full sky realizations
          starting from a known spherical harmonic coefficient spectrum.
          T(pixel) = Sum on L, Sum on M (-L, L) a_{LM} Y_{LM}(pixel)
          We have fast code that calculates the a_{LM} for each theory and
          set of input parameters. The problem is to generate maps. This
          requires calculating the (real) spherical harmonic functions'
          numerical value at each pixel. We have been able to do this
          readily out to L = 40 for a map with 6144 pixels at a reasonable
          speed. Using this technique to get L = 360 and 100,000 pixels
          takes days to compute.

          Our goal is to generate a 4 million pixel maps from a power
          spectrum coefficients covering L =1,2000 (roughly 8 million
          functions to be calculated, since M goes -L,L) using a fast
          algorithm so that we can do this for thousands of realizations.

          This can be related to the inverse of the problem - discussed
          below as spectral analysis - of estimating the power spectrum
          from the map except in spectral analysis we plan to average over
          M.

          A recemt paper by Muciaccia, Natoli, and Vittorio (
          (astro-ph/9703084) ) develops a fast algorithm breaking the
          issue into two one dimensional problems: (1) a fast Fourier
          transform over longitude and (2) Legendre polynomial evaluation
          in latitude. The paper claims success with the algorithm and
          indicate that the next step is to implement it on parallel
          processors.

          Another approach to fast spherical harmonic transform, similar
          in approach to the fast Fourier transform has been given by
          Healy, Rockmore, and Moore. We have copies of this paper for
          student use. "FFTs for the 2-Sphere - Improvements and
          Variations" (1996) & "An FFT for the 2-sphere and Applications",
          Proc of ICASSP-96 Volume 3, pp. 1323-1326.

  Fast Pixelization Routines:

          We have a set of pixelization routines for finding the pixel
          number for a given direction and direction for a given pixel
          number. We also have routines for finding nearest neighbors
          pixels. The spherical harmonics have a high degree of symmetry
          and this could be exploited with a suitable symmetry in the
          pixel scheme and the basic routine is sufficiently simple for
          parallelization. Sa pixelization scheme and making those
          routines fast is a potential project.

Sky Signal Simulation Framework:

          This effort is to provide a simulated map of the sky for a given
          input frequency and instrument antenna response. It is the sum
          of the following seven signals extrapolated/interpolated to the
          given frequency and the convolved with the instrument antenna
          response.

  Cosmic Signal

          - the problem just above - the need for a fast spherical
          harmonic evaluation

  Foregrounds 1: Clusters of Galaxies

  Foregrounds 2: Extragalactic Sources

          We have generated lists of extragalactic sources containing
          their angular position and signal flux level. The issue is to be
          able to convolve with antenna response function and place signal
          level in the map.

          S = Integral of G(theta,phi) Signal

          where theta and phi are the angles of the pixel from the source
          and G(theta,phi) is the antenna/instrument response. There are
          10,000 sources to be convolved and added into 4 million pixels
          for each of the various antenna gain functions.

          One approach past brute force is to search for only those
          sources near to the pixel and thus of significant signal level.

  Foregrounds 3: Galactic Synchrotron Emission

          We have template maps at a given frequency and resolution.

  Foregrounds 4: Galactic Free-Free Emission

          We have only a model of this emission.

  Foregrounds 5: Galactic Dust Emission

          Doug Finkbeiner has developed a high-quality, high-resolution
          dust map based upon two satellite missions (IRAS & COBE). This
          map exists at one wavelength and must be extrapolated.

  Foregrounds 6: Planets and Solar System Artifacts

          Similar problem to the extragalactic sources but the planets and
          large asteroids of interest move noticeably. There is the issue
          of parallax and distance to the object of interest Thus one
          needs to set up an approach to handling the ephemeris for their
          positions.

Measured Signal Simulation Framework:

          Take the sky signal and simulate the experiment, i.e. the
          response of the instrument during the data taking.

  Instrument Noise:

          relatively easy Gaussian and 1/f

  Scan pattern on the sky

          - need to generate quickly hundreds of millions of observations
          - simulate scan and determine pizel number and add in instrument
          performance. This is relative good candidate for parallelizing.
          Some instruments have multiple independent elements in the focal
          plane and the scan several hours apart is basically independent
          of the previous scanning.

Data Processing of Observations:

          Take the (simulated or actual) signal and generate time-ordered,
          cleaned and calibrated data.

  Large Data Set Handling

  Unpack data stream, check for errors

  Merge Pointing and relevant information to create complete data stream

  Remove baseline and calibrate for amplitude (gain)

  Data Quality Checking and Flagging

Map Generation from Observations:

          Take the time-ordered, clean calibrated signal and generate a
          sky map.

  Large sparse matrix inversion or iteration procedure

  Maximum entropy approach

Algorithm Development and Implementation

  Separate and recover cosmological signal, foregrounds, and instrumental
  effects

  Fast-Spherical Harmonic Transform:

  Maxtix Manipulation and Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Problem

  Spectral Analysis

          - e.g. direct spherical Fourier Transform:
          one example is estimating spherical power spectrum from
          spherical map.

Monte Carlo Simulations

  speed, reliability, parallel processing

          We need to generate more than a million events per day.
          Currently one workstation using old (GEANT-based) code can do
          one event per day. We are partly through the development of code
          to do this more quickly and need it implemented on a parallel
          processor. The current status of the software development is
          briefly outlined on the Kilometer-scale Neutrino Detector
          Physics and Software Status Page

  Add new neutrino and other physics to simulation software

          shower.
