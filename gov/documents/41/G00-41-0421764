                  State orders former Yakima resident to repay over $209,000
                  in fraud case

   The state has ordered a former Yakima resident to pay back more than
   $209,000 after an investigation showed that he collected workers'
   compensation benefits illegally for over nine years.

   The Department of Labor and Industries ordered Jesus Nunez Vargas —
   currently living in Mexico — to repay $139,625 in benefits collected
   fraudulently from July 30, 1990, through September 14, 1999. State law
   allows for an additional 50 percent penalty, bringing the repayment
   order to $209,437.

   Vargas, 60, was receiving workers' compensation benefits for a
   September 10, 1988, on-the-job injury he sustained while working as a
   meat cutter for Washington Beef Inc. in Toppenish.

   An investigation showed that Vargas had been working in orchards for
   several different employers under an assumed name, Jesus Nunez, while
   he was receiving workers' compensation disability benefits from the
   department. Vargas submitted documentation to the department stating
   that he was not working and was eligible for disability benefits.

   Labor and Industries manages the state's workers' compensation system.
   It provides coverage for more than 163,000 employers and 1.9 million
   workers. The agency is committed to eliminating fraud. Anyone who
   suspects fraudulent activity may report it anonymously online at
   www.lni.wa.gov/fraud, or by calling L&I's toll free-number,
   1-888-811-5974.
