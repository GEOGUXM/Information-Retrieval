   HAND DELIVERED January, 3, 2002

   Honorable Dennis Hastert, Speaker
   United States House of Representatives
   H-232 Capitol Building,
   Washington D.C. 20515 Honorable Robert C. Byrd, President Pro Tempore
   United States Senate
   S-237 Capitol Building,
   Washington, D.C. 20510

   Gentlemen:

   Pursuant to Section 304(b)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act
   of 1995 ("CAA") (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1),) on November 14, 2001 I forwarded
   to your offices a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPR") for substantive
   regulations to implement section 4(c)(4) of the Veterans Employment
   Opportunities Act of 1998 ("VEOA"), Pub. L. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3186,
   codified at 2 U.S.C. 1316(a), as applied to covered employees of the
   House of Representatives, the Senate, and certain Congressional
   instrumentalities. This NPR was published in the Congressional Record
   on December 6, 2001 at pages S12539-S12551.

   The NPR also provided, in accordance with section 304(b)(2) of the CAA
   (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(2), a 30 day period in which interested parties may
   submit to this Office written comments on the proposed substantive
   regulations. Thus, the comment period is currently scheduled to end on
   January 5, 2002.

   The Office of Compliance has received requests to extend the comment
   period, and has determined that there is good cause for granting an
   extension. Therefore, the time for submitting written comments to the
   NPR will be extended to the close of business on February 6, 2002.

   Such written comments (an original and 10 copies) are to be submitted
   to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, Room
   LA-200, John Adams Building, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C.
   20540-1999.

   In order to provide adequate notice to the public, the Board
   respectfully requests that this Notice of Extension of Time be
   published in the Congressional Record immediately upon the reconvening
   of the Second Session of the 107^th Congress on January 23, 2002.

   Sincerely,

   Susan S. Robfogel, Chair
   Board of Directors
