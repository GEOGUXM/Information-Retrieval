Welcome to the
USGS Flagstaff Field Center
Web Site

   [sandbar_t.gif]

   Our top level pages are designed to be viewed with a browser with TABLE
   capabilities; NON-TABLE versions are available for most top level
   pages. These pages will look best with the most up-to-date browser
   versions, e.g., at least version 3.0 of either Netscape or Internet
   Explorer.

   In our pages you can explore various USGS Flagstaff resources as well
   as learn about the type of projects we do at the Flagstaff Field
   Center.

   Select the item of interest by selecting its sandstone button on the
   left-hand side of the page. New content will be added from time to
   time, so check back with us.

   There are navigational menus at the top of most upper level pages. The
   light colored buttons (text links) provide access to general web page
   services. The sandstone buttons on the left let you move easily from
   one topic to another.

   The index button at the top leads to a page which outlines the link
   structure of the Flagstaff pages. All links are hot so that one can
   quickly jump directly to a desired page instead of navigating through
   the pages.
