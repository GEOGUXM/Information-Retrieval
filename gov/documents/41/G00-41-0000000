   The NASA Technical Standards Program Website provides a "One-Stop Shop"
   to:

   The Agencywide Full-Text Technical Standards System (NASA Access Only)
   NASA employees and NASA contractors within the [nasa.gov] domain are
       provided access to Full-text Technical Standards Products,
       including NASA Preferred Technical Standards, used by and of
       interest to NASA-either via electronic on-line access and download,
       or 36-hour or less hard copy delivery to the 14 NASA Facilities.
       The website provides access, relative to applicable NASA Preferred
       Technical Standards Products, to specific Lessons Learned/Best
       Practices/Application Notes with associated standards products to
       share knowledge and understanding gained by experience, mitigate
       risk through better integration of Agency knowledge, and assist in
       making better decisions for missions and the Agency. NASA user
       access requires initial registration, and logon is required each
       time the user accesses the website. To Register Click "NASA Access
       (Login Required)" to register and/or log on to the website. To
       access the Document Library Search page, click on "Agencywide
       Full-Text Technical Standards System." For assistance in your
       search, click on "Query Help."

   Public Access permits users to view the NASA Preferred Technical
   Standards index, with the capability to download free of charge the
   NASA-Developed Standards Products, Consultative Committee for Space
   Data Systems (CCSDS) standards, and Department of Defense (DoD)
   Standards Products. Public user access also requires registration and
   logon. To access the Document Library Search page, click on "NASA
   Preferred Technical Standards Products." For assistance in your search,
   click on "Query Help." (NASA and Public Access)

   Features: For explanation of additional features, such as document
   status, NASA status, document revision base date and date of latest
   change, number of pages in the document, number of NASA accesses since
   June 2001, designation if there is a Lesson Learned/Best Practice
   and/or Application Note to the document, see "Query Help" from the
   Document Library Search screen. (NASA and Public Access)

   The Standards Update Notification System (SUNS) (NASA Access Only)
   The SUNS, currently in beta testing, is a tool to provide management,
       engineering/science research and development staff members, NASA
       contractors, and other organizations and personnel with
       notification when standards have been changed. Program/Project
       Managers are responsible for the review of changes, identification
       of any associated risks and the impact on the Program/Project, and
       implementation as determined necessary from the analysis of the
       change to any Technical Standards Product being used by the
       Program/Project (in-house and via contract).

   The Document Management System (DMS) (NASA Access Only)
   The DMS provides capability to:
     * Submit proposals to develop NASA Technical Standards Products,
       adopt existing non-Government or other Government (non-NASA)
       Technical Standards, and convert Center-Developed Standards to NASA
       Preferred Technical Standards for review, recommendation, and
       approval.
     * Critique standards in development by Topic Working Groups and
       provide status of work in progress.
     * Review, submit comments, disposition comments, and concur/nonconcur
       with NASA-Developed or Converted Technical Standards and other
       Government Standards and non-Government Voluntary Consensus
       Standards proposed for adoption by NASA. (under development).

   NASA Participation in Technical Standards Developing Organizations
   (NASA Access Only)

   NASA participates in Standards Developing Organizations (including full
       involvement in discussions and technical debates, registering
       opinions, voting in accordance with the procedures of the Voluntary
       Consensus Standards body) when Agency support clearly furthers the
       Agency's missions, authorities, and priorities and is consistent
       with budget resources and the public's interest. NASA participation
       information, Standards Developing Organization committee
       information, and NASA Working Group information may be viewed from
       this link. Additions, deletions, and updates to this data are also
       made here.

   Links to Standards Developing Organizations (NASA and Public Access)
   provides information about individual Standards Developing
   Organizations via their websites.

   Links to Lessons Learned/Best Practices (NASA and Public Access)
   provide access to information from various engineering databases that
   may be of value relative to the use and interpretation of Technical
   Standards.

   An "Overview" of the NASA Technical Standards Program and "Supporting
   Documents" for the Program and its activities are accessible from the
   website. (NASA and Public Access)

   "Feedback" is provided for the NASA and Public user to submit
   questions, compliments, recommendations for website changes,
   complaints, and observations to the NASA Technical Standards Program
   Office. The website is Version Controlled by the Website Change Board
   established by the NASA Technical Standards Program Manager and is
   composed of NASA and USA Information Systems, Inc., personnel.
