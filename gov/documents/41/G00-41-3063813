   I. Background

       The ITS Deployment Program was established by the Transportation
   Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21)(Public Law 105-178, 112 Stat.
   107, (1998)). The ITS Deployment Program described in sections
   5001(a)(6) and (c)(4) of TEA-21 encompasses the ITS Integration Program
   and the Commercial Vehicle Intelligent Transportation System
   Infrastructure Deployment Program (Commercial Vehicle ITS Deployment
   Program). Section 5208 of the TEA-21 establishes the ITS Integration
   Program to accelerate the integration and interoperability of
   intelligent transportation systems in metropolitan and rural areas.
   Section 5209 of the TEA-21 establishes the Commercial Vehicle ITS
   Deployment Program to deploy intelligent transportation systems that
   improve the safety and productivity of commercial vehicles and drivers,
   and to reduce costs associated with commercial vehicle operations and
   Federal and State commercial vehicle regulatory requirements.

       For FY 2003, the ITS Integration Program provides $85,000,000 in
   Federal ITS funding for the integration of multi-modal ITS components
   in metropolitan areas, rural areas, or in statewide, multi-State, or
   multi-city settings. In FY 2003, the Commercial Vehicle ITS Deployment
   Program provides $35,500,000 in Federal ITS funding to improve the
   safety and productivity of commercial vehicles and drivers, and reduce
   costs associated with commercial vehicle operation and regulatory
   requirements.

   II. Purpose of the ITS Deployment Program

       Section 5208 establishes the ITS Integration Program to accelerate
   the integration and interoperability of intelligent transportation
   systems in metropolitan and rural areas. (emphasis added) Additionally,
   section 5208(a) states that projects selected for funding, through
   competitive solicitation, will serve as models to improve
   transportation efficiency, promote safety (including safe freight
   movement), increase traffic flow (including the flow of intermodal
   travel at ports of entry), reduce emissions of air pollutants, improve
   traveler information, enhance alternative transportation modes, build
   on existing intelligent transportation system projects, or promote
   tourism.

       Section 5209 of the TEA-21 establishes the Commercial Vehicle ITS
   Deployment Program to improve the safety and productivity of commercial
   motor vehicles and drivers; and reduce the costs associated with
   commercial vehicle operations and Federal and State commercial vehicle
   regulatory requirements.

       According to section 5209(b), the purpose of the Commercial Vehicle
   ITS Deployment Program is to advance the technological capability and
   promote the development of intelligent transportation system
   applications to commercial vehicle operations, including commercial
   vehicle, commercial driver, and carrier-specific information systems.

   III. Solicitation Intent

       Recent events have focused attention on the need to ensure the
   security of our nation's transportation system. ITS technologies offer
   the opportunity to significantly improve transportation security in
   several ways. First, innovative surveillance technologies and
   applications offer the potential to monitor critical infrastructure
   elements. These critical elements include critical bridges and tunnels,
   key subway stations or multi-modal facilities, multi-modal freight
   facilities, and highway or transit operations centers. The technology
   monitoring may continuously determine the status of these elements,
   identify potential risks to these critical elements, and immediately
   report any changes in the status of these critical elements. Second,
   these same surveillance systems may be used to better monitor
   operations on the surface transportation systems to improve the ability
   to identify security related incidents and better locate those
   incidents and to assure safe operations during more routing operations.
   Third, ITS technologies may provide for improved coordinated responses
   to these same incidents through improved traffic management, traveler
   information, transit system management, and/or public safety
   coordination. Fourth, ITS technologies may ensure the secure operation
   of commercial motor vehicles, their drivers, and their cargo. Fifth,
   improved communication networks and systems may help to better identify
   high risk commercial vehicles or drivers.

       For these reasons, the FHWA has determined that there is a critical
   need to focus the FY 2003 ITS Deployment Program on the application of
   ITS technologies that enhance the security of surface transportation
   systems. The objective is to provide incentive monies for the
   deployment and/or integration of ITS for the express purpose of
   enhancing the security of our surface transportation systems.

   IV. Criteria for Participation in the ITS Deployment Program

       Section 5208 of TEA-21 states that projects selected for ITS
   Integration Program funding shall:

       1. Contribute to national deployment goals and objectives outlined
   in the National ITS Program Plan; (Note that a synopsis of the National
   ITS Program Plan can be downloaded from the ITS Electronic Document
   Library (EDL) at http://www.its.dot.gov. The EDL number is 3845.)

       2. Demonstrate a strong commitment to cooperation among agencies,
   jurisdictions, and the private sector, as evidenced by signed memoranda
   of understanding (MOUs) that clearly define the responsibilities and
   relations of all parties to a partnership arrangement, including
   institutional relationships and financial agreements needed to support
   integrated deployment;

       3. Encourage private sector involvement and financial commitment,
   to the maximum extent practicable, through innovative financial
   arrangements, especially public-private partnerships, including
   arrangements that generate revenue to offset public investment costs;

       4. Demonstrate commitment to a comprehensive plan of fully
   integrated ITS deployment in accordance with the national ITS
   architecture and standards and protocols;

       5. Be part of approved plans and programs developed under
   applicable statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes
   and applicable State air quality implementation plans, as appropriate,
   at the time at which Federal ITS funds are sought;

       6. Minimize the relative percentage and amount of Federal ITS
   funding to total project costs;

       7. Ensure continued, long-term operations and maintenance without
   continued reliance on Federal ITS funding as evidenced by documented
   evidence of fiscal capacity and commitment from anticipated public and
   private sources;

       8. Demonstrate technical capacity for effective operations and
   maintenance or commitment to acquiring necessary skills;

       9. Mitigate any adverse impacts on bicycle and pedestrian
   transportation and safety;

       10. In the case of a rural area, meet other safety, mobility,
   geographic and regional diversity, or economic development criteria; or

       11. Encourage multi-state cooperation and corridor development.

       Section 5209 of TEA-21 states that projects selected for Commercial
   Vehicle ITS Deployment Program funding shall:

       1. Encourage multistate cooperation on corridor development;

       2. Improve the safety of commercial vehicle operation and increase
   the efficiency of regulatory inspection processes to reduce
   administrative burdens by advancing technology to facilitate
   inspections and generally increase the effectiveness of enforcement
   efforts;

       3. Advance electronic processing of registration information,
   driver licensing information, fuel tax information, inspection and
   crash data, and other safety information and promote communication of
   the information among the States; or

       4. Enhance the safe passage of commercial vehicles across the
   United States and across international borders.

   V. Limitations on Funding for the ITS Deployment Program

       Federal funding authority for the ITS Deployment Program comes from
   section 5001(a)(6) of the TEA-21. The preliminary applications
   requested through this solicitation will be for funds that are
   anticipated to be appropriated for FY 2003. Requests for more detailed
   proposals from qualified applicants will depend on, and be shaped by,
   the availability of funds for this program in FY 2003.

       Section 5208 of the TEA-21 requires that for metropolitan area ITS
   Integration Program projects, funding shall be used primarily for
   activities necessary to integrate ITS infrastructure elements that are
   either deployed (legacy systems) or will be deployed with other sources
   of funds. The purchase or construction of hardware is not considered an
   integration activity, and should utilize other sources of funds. For
   projects outside of metropolitan areas (i.e., statewide or rural
   areas), the TEA-21 states that funding may be used for integration
   purposes, as well as for limited deployment of ITS infrastructure
   components to support integration.

       Section 5208 projects of various sizes are eligible. However, the
   TEA-21 directs that awards shall be limited to $15 million in a single
   metropolitan area, and $2 million in a single rural area. No more than
   $35 million shall be awarded within a State. Of the available funding,
   not less than 10 percent will be available for non-metropolitan areas.

       Section 5209 of the TEA-21 does not limit the use of Commercial
   Vehicle ITS Deployment Program funding for integration versus
   deployment nor does it limit the amount of funding that can be awarded
   to any region or State. The proposed project should support the goals
   of the Commercial Vehicle ITS Deployment Program, as outlined in
   section 5209.

   VI. Federal Share of Project Costs

       The Federal share of the cost of ITS Deployment Program projects
   shall not exceed 50 percent. Additionally, the total Federal share of
   the cost of a project payable from all eligible sources shall not
   exceed 80 percent. The remaining 20 percent of the project cost must be
   from non-federally derived funding sources. This 20 percent of the
   project cost must consist of either cash, substantial equipment
   contributions that are wholly utilized as an integral part of the
   project, or personnel services dedicated full-time to the proposed
   integrated deployment for a substantial period, as long as such
   personnel are not otherwise supported with Federal funds. The
   non-federally derived funding may come from State, local government, or
   private sector partners.

       Funds provided in addition to the required 20 percent minimum may
   come from a variety of funding sources, and may include the value of
   federally-supported projects directly associated with the integration
   project. Note that funding identified to support continued operations,
   maintenance, and management of the system will not be considered as
   part of the partnership's cost-share contribution.

   VII. Evaluation of Benefits

   Independent Evaluations

       The FHWA may conduct with non-project funds, independent
   evaluations of the benefits resulting from specific projects proposed
   for funding under the ITS Deployment Program. The decision to evaluate
   the benefits of a specific project will be made on a case-by-case
   basis, reflecting the information needs of the FHWA. Independent
   evaluations will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines,
   provisions, and evaluation funding levels as directed by the TEA-21 and
   as reflected in the TEA-21 Evaluation Guidelines, which can be found at
   the following Internet site,
   http://www.its.dot.gov/EVAL/evalguidelines.html. The application shall
   explicitly state that if selected for independent evaluations, the
   proposed project shall cooperate with the independent evaluators and
   participate in evaluation planning and progress review meetings to
   ensure a mutually acceptable, successful implementation of the
   independent evaluation.

   Local Evaluations

       To ensure sound management practice, each project shall perform a
   local evaluation funded from project or other resources. The
   application shall explicitly state that the proposed project will
   develop a Local Evaluation Report. The report shall include a general
   overall assessment of the project, other specific evaluation products,
   or activities as appropriate, and an executive summary.

   VIII. Instructions to ITS Deployment Program Applicants

       A preliminary application to participate in the ITS Deployment
   Program shall contain the following information:

       1. An identification of the project partners and other key
   stakeholders in the proposed project. The proposed partnership should
   demonstrate, and provide evidence of, a strong commitment to
   cooperation among agencies, jurisdictions, and, as appropriate, the
   private sector. Partnerships that include a public safety agency (or
   agencies) and/or a transit agency (or agencies) are strongly
   encouraged. For the purposes of this application, MOUs or other formal
   partnership agreements are not required at this time, but copies of
   existing MOUs or other partnership agreements should be included with
   the preliminary application.

       2. A very brief listing of existing and planned ITS deployments,
   and a short description of the project that is proposed for funding to
   support surface transportation security. The description should clearly
   identify and describe the security function(s) that will be provided
   and demonstrate a strong commitment to cooperation among agencies,
   jurisdictions, and as appropriate, the private sector, on both
   long-range ITS planning and investment decisions, and short-range
   operation and management issues. Project proposals should also discuss
   the degree to which long-term and or day-to-day safety of the surface
   transportation system will be enhanced, if any. Any other potential
   operational or other benefits of the proposed project should also be
   described.

       Note: The FHWA has determined that deployment of Commercial Vehicle
   Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) in a State would enhance
   transportation security and therefore applications under section 5209
   that propose to advance the deployment of CVISN will be considered.

       3. For each of the TEA-21 selection criteria listed above in
   section IV, Criteria for Participation in the ITS Deployment Program,
   an assessment of how the proposed project addresses the criteria. Any
   criteria that are not applicable to the project should be so
   identified.

       4. A brief financial summary that includes:

       (a). Project cost;

       (b). Matching funds and sources; and

       (c). How long term operations and maintenance will be supported.

       Preliminary applications to determine qualifications for
   participation in the ITS Deployment Program may be submitted by
   partnerships representing large or small metropolitan areas, regional
   areas, rural areas, statewide or multi-State regions. The proposed
   projects should meet documented local or State needs, focus on the
   integration of ITS technologies, and strengthen institutional ties
   across jurisdictions, modes, and operating agencies.

       Because this is a preliminary application, we request that the
   package not exceed 15 pages in length, including the title page,
   tables, maps, appendices, abstracts, and other supporting materials. A
   page is defined as one side of an 8½ by 11 inch paper, with a type font
   no smaller than 12 point.

       Ten copies, plus an electronic copy, in Microsoft Word format,
   shall be submitted to the FHWA, ITS Joint Program Office, HOIT, 400
   Seventh St., SW., Room 3416, Washington, DC 20590. The cover sheet or
   front page of the preliminary application shall include the name,
   address, and phone number of an individual to whom correspondence and
   questions about the preliminary application package may be directed.
   The application and its contents shall be non-proprietary.

   IX. Selection Criteria

       Applicants must submit acceptable preliminary application packages
   that provide sound evidence that the proposed partnership can
   successfully meet the objectives of the ITS Deployment Program.

       The following criteria, in order of importance, will be used in
   selecting areas for participation in the ITS Deployment Program.

       1. Partnerships. The proposed partnership demonstrates and provides
   historic evidence of a strong commitment to cooperation among agencies,
   jurisdictions, and, as appropriate, the private sector.

       2. Technical Approach. The Technical Approach must address how the
   proposed deployment and integration of intelligent transportation
