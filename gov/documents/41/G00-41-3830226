   Sediment Transport Group Home Page

      Welcome to our web site. We provide engineering services for USGS
      investigators interested in sediment transport studies. We develop new
      techniques, maintain a pool of high quality oceanographic
      instrumentation, and we plan, manage and execute field work. We work in
      estuarine, coastal and continental shelf regions, deploying
      oceanographic moorings and tripods at depths from 3 to 3000 meters.

      Here you will find information on our ongoing projects, desciptions of
      our instrumentation, techniques and publications, links to our online
      data and other pertinient resources.

      What's New - January 2001
        * This entire site! Please feel free to explore and learn about us.
        * The latest version of the ADCP toolbox is much more elaborate and
          it's documented

      Who we are

      What we are working on

      In April-May of 2001 we will be active on all three US coasts at once.
      As we have over the past decade, we will continue to maintain our
      instrumentation near the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority's new
      sewage outfall pipe for Boston. We will conduct an ADCP survey from
      both a ship and remotely operated vehicle in the Gulf of Mexico and we
      will assist Orange County, California, with the installation of a
      permanent mooring and with a seasonal array of instrumentation to study
      local soliton waves.

      About our Equipment Pool

      We maintain a pool of regularly used instrumentation and marine
      equipment for physical oceanographic field work. Members of the pool
      include the USGS Woods Hole Field Center, National Marine FIsheries
      Office in Woods Hole and USGS Menlo Park Office.

      Feel free to browse our catalog of instrumentation, mooring components
      and tripods.
