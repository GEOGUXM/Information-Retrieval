   Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit and researchers at the
   University of Nevada at Reno recently completed an assessment of
   channel conditions and wildlife habitat in the riparian corridors of 15
   river-side areas in the Lake Tahoe Basin. This study was funded in part
   by the California Tahoe Conservancy. The study produced several sets of
   geographic data for each of the riparian corridors. Those data are now
   available for download.
