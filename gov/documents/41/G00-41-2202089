      USGS is responsible for fulfilling the Nation's needs for reliable,
      impartial scientific information to describe and understand the Earth.
      The USGS Caribbean District was established in 1958 to monitor and
      enhance water resources in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

      The primary mission of the USGS Caribbean District is to collect,
      compile, analyze, and distribute hydrologic information to promote best
      use and management of water resources for the benefit of the people and
      the natural environment. This water-resource monitoring and
      investigation program is carried out in cooperation with many local and
      federal agencies. The program includes studies that focus on surface-
      and ground-water availability and water quality, stream-sediment
      concentration, and sedimentation rates in reservoirs.

      The Caribbean District collects and compiles:
        * water level and discharge data at 100 stream-gaging stations,
        * suspended sediment-discharge records for 40 streamflow stations,
        * water-level records for 18 reservoirs,
        * water-quality records for 16 stream-gaging stations, 42 ungaged
          stream sites, 11 lake sites, 2 lagoons, and 1 bay,
        * ground-water-level records for 107 observation wells. These data
          are collected at stations established and maintained by the
          Caribbean District at selected locations throughout Puerto Rico and
          the U.S. Virgin Islands,
        * rainfall records at 132 stations (104 of these rain gages are
          located at surface -water stations), and
        * meteorological records (wind speed and direction, sun intensity,
          evaporation potential) at 5 stations.

      This information is compiled and distributed annually by the Caribbean
      District in a USGS Hydrologic Data Report series which, starting with
      water year 1999, is available on the internet.

      In addition to monitoring and assessment of water resources, the
      Caribbean District conducts a variety of other natural resource and
      natural hazard investigations, including landslide vulnerability
      studies, environmental assessments, and development of Geographic
      Information System products. The Caribbean District plays a key
      emergency management and assessment role during hurricanes and major
      tropical storms. The Caribbean District is a major contributor in
      efforts to rebuild infrastructure and enhance technical capacity for
      local government agencies charged with water resources and flood hazard
      monitoring in Central America, following the destruction caused by
      Hurricane Mitch in December 1997. The Caribbean District regularly
      provides educational material to teachers and students.

      More than 175 hydrologic investigations have been conducted in Puerto
      Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands since 1958. These water-resources
      investigations have resulted in the publication of more than 500
      reports, maps, articles, and abstracts. These investigations provide
      essential information to address questions and concerns about
      water-resource issues in the region. Additionally, some of the
      investigations provide information on national scale hydrologic
      problems.

      The USGS Caribbean District office is located in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.
      Eighty scientists, technicians, and support staff are employed at the
      Caribbean District office in the San Juan area.
