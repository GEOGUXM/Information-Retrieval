     The Space Environment Center provides real-time monitoring and
     forecasting of solar and geophysical events, conducts research in
     solar-terrestrial physics, and develops techniques for forecasting
     solar and geophysical disturbances. SEC's Space Weather Operations
     Center is jointly operated by NOAA and the U.S. Air Force and is the
     national and world warning center for disturbances that can affect
     people and equipment working in the space environment.
