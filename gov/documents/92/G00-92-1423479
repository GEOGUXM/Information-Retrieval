   January 20, 2001 ushers in a new Presidential Administration. This
   helpful transition directory has everything -- agency mission
   statements, organization charts, and strategic plans, employment
   information, travel rules, legal and ethical standards. Most everyone
   knows IRS and VA, but what about AARCC, ABMC, and ACF? Thankfully for
   newcomers and old hands alike, it has a full list of government
   acronyms and abbreviations.

   Truckers and bus drivers get online to save time and lives on America's
   roads in one of the government's most impressive and effective uses of
   the internet.
