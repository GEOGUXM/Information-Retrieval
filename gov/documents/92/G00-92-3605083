    Field Spectrometers

   We are currently using two ASD FR (0.4 - 2.5 micron) field
   spectrometers to measure samples and provide for in situ calibration of
   surface reflectance for terrestrial imaging spectroscopy studies. They
   also serve as laboratory spectrometers when rapid spectra are needed.
   In calibrating standards in the field, we usually obtain hundreds of
   spectra at a site and average them to provide an average spectrum
   similar to what the remote sensing instruments measure. We find that no
   field instrument can have the quality of a stable laboratory instrument
   because of temperature drifts and rapidly changing atmospheric
   absorptions. Thus we also obtain field samples which we measure on our
   laboratory instruments to confirm spectral details and to provide
   information for removing artifacts from the field data. This two step
   approach is our best assurance of precise spectra.
