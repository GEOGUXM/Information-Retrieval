                      Emergency Alert System Handbooks

   The Enforcement Bureau is proud to make the 2001 edition of the
   Emergency Alert System AM, FM, TV and Cable Handbooks available.

   The Handbooks are here in Adobe Acrobat format so that when you look at
   them on your screen or print them out on your printer they will look
   identical to the FCC's original version regardless of the computer
   platform, operating system, browser, or fonts that you may be using.

   To view the Handbooks you must have Acrobat Reader software installed
   on your computer and configured as a "helper" or "plug-in" application
   in your browser. If not, you need to download, install, and configure
   the free Adobe Acrobat Reader Software . If you already have the Reader
   installed and configured, you can go ahead and view the Handbooks now:
     * AM & FM Handbook
     * TV Handbook
     * Cable Handbook
