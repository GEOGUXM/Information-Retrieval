     __________________________________________________________________

   1.     Background. Procedures issued by NOAA require proposed
   organizational changes to be submitted by Assistant Administrators to
   the NOAA Office of Administration. The requirements are contained in
   NOAA administrative Order 200-7, Organization Management. Further
   information on organization management is found in the Department
   Organization Order series.

   2.     NWS Office Responsibilities.

   2.1     Initiating Units. Units initiating an organizational change are
   responsible for developing proposals, including all supporting
   documentation as noted in section 3.4. Reorganizations of varying
   degrees require different supporting documentation. Initiating units
   should notify and coordinate proposal development with the Management
   and Budget Office (MB), and the appropriate Offices of Meteorology
   (OM), Hydrology (OH), Systems Operations (060), and Systems Development
   (0SD) early in the process to determine documentation requirements,
   thereby achieving desired objectives in a timely and effective fashion.

   2.2     Reviewing Offices. OM, OH, OSO, and 06D shall review
   organizational change Proposals for their respect areas.

   MB provides consultation, analysis, and procedural assistance to line
   managers. In this capacity, MB coordinates and reviews the current and
   proposed organization and management structures and the assignment of
   functions and authorities within operating units. MB also obtains
   necessary legal and administrative approvals position proposals.

   MB reviews proposals for possible congressional concerns and personnel
   and budgetary issues such as:

       a.     reorganization or realignment which may result from
   technological

       b.     retitling of units;

       c.     transfer of functions;

       d.     any organizational change which has an impact on employees
   and requires union notification, such as: revisions in operating
   policies which affect employees; geographic relocation of employees;
   closing of facilities; reductions-in-force (RIF); and furloughs - W50M
   Chapter A-12 provides specific guidance regarding office hours of
   operation;

       e.     position management/classification;

       g.     possible necessity for reprogramming of  funds: and

       h.     other related issues which influence management decisions.

   3.     General Policy. Any proposal to change the organization which
   establishes, consolidates, abolishes, or alters the status or
   configuration of operating units in the National Weather Service (NW5)
   shall be appropriately submitted through CM, OH, 060, and finally MB.
   Proposals shall be prepared for signature of the Assistant
   Administrator for Weather Services (AA/WS) as the approving and/or
   requesting official.

   Uniformity, consistency, and standardization of NWS policies and
   procedures is sought throughout the NWS. When deviations from the
   standard are pro posed or when several regions and/or more than one
   Administrative Support Center are involved in the change, initiating
   units shall provide substantial justification and rationale to support
   the organizational change.

   3.1     Approvals. Any proposal covered in this chapter requires
   approval of the AA/WS. Subsequent reviews and approval may be necessary
   at NOAA/DOC levels. Informal discussions of such changes, although they
   may be accepted conceptually, do not constitute approval of that
   proposed change. Proposals do not receive final approval until all
   NWS/NOAA/DOC requirements and clearance procedures have been satisfied.
   MB is the focal point for coordinating and securing all approvals
   required for instituting organizational changes.

   3.2     Approval Time Periods. A minimum of 25 days will normally be
   required to notify Congress and the union of an organizational change
   before official implementation can take place. This period may be
   longer should Congress or the union require further explanation and/or
   negotiation. Longer notification periods may also be required by law to
   effect specific actions, e.g., in RIF situations, each employee
   selected for release is entitled to a written notice at least 30 days,
   and not more than 90 days, prior to the effective date.

   Since proposals vary in scope and detail, the initiating organizational
   unit shall coordinate its preparation with MB during the early
   formulation stages of the proposal. Early consultation assures closer
   coordination between all concerned parties, thereby, increasing the
   opportunity to explore alternatives through which desired objectives
   may be achieved in a timely and effective manner.

   3.3     Informal "Acting" Implementation. Organizational changes may be
   informally implemented before the new and associated positions have
   been officially approved. Acting managers and supervisors are
   designated and employees are told to begin reporting through a new
   chain of command. However, official personnel and fiscal records
   continue to reflect the old structure. Serious problems often arise
   from the implementation of an "acting" organization and management
   structure, particularly in the areas of delegated authority, selection
   of personnel for key positions, and performance evaluations. Legal
   problems can also result just from the timing and/or wording of the
   notice of implementation.

   Therefore, prior to enacting proposals on an "acting" basis, all
   written and verbal notices of informal implementation shall receive MB
   clearance. However, this does not preclude consultation with your
   servicing Personnel Division for advice and assistance in proposal
   development.

   3.4     Supporting Documentation. At a minimum, supporting
   documentation shall include the following basic information.

   3.4.1     Nature of the Organizational Change.  The proposal shall give
   a comprehensive description of all aspects of the proposed change. This
   information must fully cover the events and conditions which establish
   the need for the change and present a clear picture of the associated
   functional requirements.

   3.4.2     Justification.  The proposal shall discuss each element of
   the organizational change from the standpoint of what will be achieved
   in increased operational effectiveness in relation to the associated
   resource requirements in section 3.4.3.

   3.4.3     Impact on Budgetary and Staffing Requirements. The proposal
   shall cover in detail all changes in resource requirements including,
   as appropriate, complete information on budgetary requirements for the
   current and next fiscal year. In addition, if the proposal includes the
   reprogramming of funds, contemplates the geographic transfer of
   employees, RIF's, or furloughs, the proposal may require a draft
   statement of reprogramming actions. Call MB if there is a question
   whether a written notice is required.

       a.     Supply current and proposed organizational staffing
   patterns, each showing classification (e.g., OS/GM, series, grades,
   organizational title of positions), incumbents in each affected
   organizational entity, and type of appointments. Parenthetically note
   the total number of part-time and full-time permanent positions. In the
   event of a reorganization, indicate where positions have come from by
   listing the current organizational code for each position on the pro
   posed staffing pattern. Show positions which are currently vacant. (See
   exhibits J-93-1 & J-93-2.)

       b.     Discuss the projected impact the change will have on
   staffing and the specific positions and/or individual employees that
   will be affected, i.e., creation and abolishment of positions, RIF's,
   furloughs, , separations, relocations, and transfers.

       c.     The supervisory ratio should be at least six employees to
   one supervisor (6:1). If this ratio cannot be reached, provide a
   statement explaining the c:

       d.     Indicate proposed key personnel assignments, including any
   contemplated changes involving Senior Executive Service, scientific and
   professional (5 USC 3104), supergrade positions, and/or other positions
   requiring counterpart clearances (see section 3.5.1).

       e.     Furnish a statement discussing the actions and approaches
   which have been taken and considered to mitigate adverse consequences
   of an organizational change. If there is no projected impact on
   personnel resources or no need for reprogramming action, the proposal
   shall state that no such requirement exist.

   3.4.4     Organizational Charts. Supply current and proposed
   organizational charts showing reporting channels. Indicate the number
   of positions located in each organizational unit. (A "To/From" diagram
   is helpful in illustrating and comparing the former structure versus
   the proposed new one. See exhibits J-93-4 & J-93-5.)

   3.4.5     Facilities. Describe the impact of the change on facilities
   requirements.

   3.4.6     Implementation Timing. Give desired dates for implementation.
   Consideration should be given to approval time periods as mentioned in
   section 3.2.

   3.4.7     Functional Statements. Furnish proposed functional statements
   describing unit responsibilities and relationships.

   In the past, functional statements have been written in a style in
   which less than complete sentences were used; sentences began with
   verbs. NOAA has requested future functional statements to be written in
   complete sentences.

   3.4.8     Administrative Documents. Submit Standard Form 52's, position
   descriptions, and other supporting information for key positions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3.5     Personnel Clearances. Restrictions have been imposed on the
   number and types of "administrative" positions permitted in the NWS.
   Counterpart clearances are required when adding "administrative"
   positions at or above the grade 13 level which do not currently exist
   of when changing grades of existing positions. final approval to
   reorganization proposals will not be received until key and heavily
   impacted positions will delay approval of a proposal.

   3.5.1     Scrutinized Positions. In addition to the positions
   specifically mentioned in section 3.4.3.d, the positions listed below
   will receive closer examination and may require counterpart clearances.
   Justification must be furnished to substantiate establishing these
   positions.

       a.     All deputy positions

       b.     All program analyst positions (GS-345)

       c.     All administrative support positions locate* in units where
   the preponderance of  functions is administrative (staff) in nature in
   contrast: to program support positions which are classified in
   administrative series, i.e., GS-301, 343, 345.

       d.     All assistant to... positions

       e.     All team/project leader positions

       f.     Grade 15, and potential 15's

       h.     supervisors of five employees or less (excluding MIC/OlC)

       i.     Executive/administrative officers (non-technical)

       j.     Grade 13 and above in the following series:

     GS-301
     GS-341
     GS-343
     GS-345
     GS-505
     GS-560
     GS-1102
     GS-1106
