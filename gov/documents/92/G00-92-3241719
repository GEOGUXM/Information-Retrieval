   The meeting was held on December 9, 1999 at 2201 G. Street NW,
   Washington, D.C. on the campus of The George Washington University
   (Room 108, Funger Hall). Due to technical limitations of the faciltity,
   the audio quality of portions of the recording is marginal. For this we
   apologize. The CSB intends to post an official transcript of the
   meeting on this web site later this month.

   format. Depending on your internet connection, these files may take a
   long time to download due to their large size. We are in the process of

   available the week of 12/13/99.
