   We do not maintain staff to respond to questions on how to locate
   certain city, State or Federal services or information.  If you cannot
   find what you are looking for, we suggest you first try the following:

   Search the City of Chicago:  http://www.cityofchicago.org/Subject.html

   Check out Find-It! State of Illinois:  http://findit.sos.state.il.us/

   These sites have extensive listings of departments and agencies as well
   as Subject Search capabilities.  This is where we always start when we
   get inquiries.

   If you are still stuck, you can contact us and we will try to see what
   we can find for you as time permits, but please be patient as this
   service is staffed by volunteers.
