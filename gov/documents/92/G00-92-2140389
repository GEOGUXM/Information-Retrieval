   The City of Flagstaff's Boards and Commissions

   Want to get involved? The members of the City Council are committed to
   a tradition of citizen involvement in municipal government where open
   communication is welcomed and encouraged. The City's boards,
   commissions, and committees were created to foster public participation
   and input and to encourage Flagstaff citizens to take an active role in
   city government.

   All City board and commission members must be residents of Flagstaff at
   the time of their appointment and for the full duration of their term
   in office. Appointments are approved at public meetings and individuals
   are selected solely at the discretion of the City Council. The members
   of the City's boards and commissions, and most committee members, are
   appointed by the City Council to three-year terms, unless an
   appointment is made for the balance of a member's term due to that
   member's resignation or disqualification from office, or a different
   term length is set by state law.

   If you are interested in serving on a City board or commission, please
   download an application form. You may also view a list of vacancies
   online. Completed application forms are to be mailed to: City Clerk's
   Office, 211 W. Aspen, Flagstaff, AZ 86001. For additional information,
   call: (520) 779-7607.
