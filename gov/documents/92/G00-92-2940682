   PNNL Security and Privacy Notice

      This web site is part of a Federal computer system used to accomplish
      Federal functions. The Department of Energy monitors this web site for
      security purposes to ensure it remains available to all users and to
      protect information in the system. By accessing this web site, you are
      expressly consenting to these monitoring activities.

      Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features, to use
      the system for other than intended purposes, to deny service to
      authorized users, to access, obtain, alter, damage, or destroy
      information, or otherwise to interfere with the system or its operation
      are prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law
      enforcement authorities and result in criminal prosecution under the
      Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-474) and the National
      Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-294),
      (18 U.S.C. 1030), or other applicable criminal laws.

   Privacy Notice

      We collect no personal information about you without your knowledge
      when you visit this site, although you may choose to provide this
      information to us in specific instances. However, we do collect and
      store certain information automatically:
        * the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the domain from which you
          access the Internet (e.g., 123.456.789.012), whether yours
          individually or provided as a proxy by your Internet Service
          Provider (ISP)
        * the date and time you access our site
        * the pages you visit (recorded by the text and graphics files that
          compose that page)
        * the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly
          to our site.

      We use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to
      visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least
      interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the
      site's technical design specifications and identifying system
      performance or problem areas.

      This information is NOT shared with anyone beyond the support staff for
      this web site, except when required by law enforcement investigation,
      and is used only as a source of anonymous statistical information.

      times when your message is forwarded, as e-mail, to other employees who
      may be better able to help you. Except as required by authorized law
      enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with outside
