   ONLINE LICENSE VERIFICATION

   Psychiatric Technicians License Verification

   Vocational Nurses License Verification

   This online license verification feature permits consumers, employers
   and licensees to check on the status of psychiatric technician and
   vocational nurse licenses online.

   Important Notice - Please Read

   In order for a licensed vocational nurse or psychiatric technician to
   legally practice in the State of California, a current, active license
   is required. Licensees cannot practice if the license expiration date
   has passed, or with a license that is on "inactive status"

   To determine if a license is expired or inactive, you must click on the
   licensee's name and view the individual license record. (See License
   Status Definitions Below).

   The system allows the user to search by name or license number, and
   provides the name, license number, expiration date, county of residence
   and license status, as well as any post-licensure certification such as
   blood withdrawal or intraveneous therapy.

   The license verification system does not include enforcement actions
   for Psychiatric Technicians (PT) at this time. The PT enforcement
   action portion of the system is being developed and should be available
   in the near future. In the meantime, all enforcement actions taken by
   the Board since July 1, 1996 are available on the Disciplinary Action
   Index Page. Contact the Board's Enforcement Unit at (916) 263-7827 for
   more information about enforcement actions taken against a specific
   licensee.

   To search for a licensee:
     * Enter the first or last name in the fields provided.
     * The county, as a second criteria will narrow down the search and
       help bring up the information quicker.
     * If entering the license number in the field provided, do not enter
       the prefix (VN or PT) for a license number.
     * Enter numbers only.
