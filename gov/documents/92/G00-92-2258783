   Introduction

   The Meteorological Applications Branch conducts research to increase
   the understanding of synoptic-scale and mesoscale weather systems.
   Scientists develop and improve conceptual and diagnostic models of the
   atmosphere using data from conventional instruments and new
   state-of-the-art sensors. Many research results are applicable to
   operational weather forecasting. In addition, the branch provides
   access to several sources of in-situ data.

   Objectives

   The Meteorological Applications Branch performs diagnostic studies of
   weather related phenomena, including clear-air turbulence, winter
   snowstorms, downslope windstorms, atmospheric soundings, and mesoscale
   convective systems. The diagnostic tools that are developed are
   applicable to observed fields and model grid point data, and they
   utilize statistical methods, fundamental dynamical relationships, and
   derived parameters that relate to unobserved variables. These studies
   often result in products of value to forecasters and are transferred to
   the National Weather Service. Additionally, the research-quality
   datasets that are assembled to support the branch's activities are also
   shared with other NOAA laboratories and NWS research groups.

   Areas of Research

   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Developing stratospheric platforms on shear-directed balloons, to meet
   NOAA's environmental observing and monitoring mission in the new
   century.
   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Developing, testing, and verifying numerical weather model computer
   code and parameterizations for forecasting variables of special
   interest to aviation. One product of particular interest provides
   Turbulence Forecasts, now based on data from FSL's RUC-2 model.
   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Understanding the dynamics and improving the forecasting of hourly
   precipitation during wintertime and the convective season.
   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Understanding the dynamics and improving the forecasting of high-winds
   and wind shear.

   In-situ Data

   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Precipitation Data from several thousand automated sensors that report
   hourly and daily over the continental United States.
   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Upper Air Sounding Data for the past several months from sites in North
   America.
   [BD14795_.GIF]

   Data from Commercial Aircraft including winds and temperature, as well
   as experimental turbulence and water vapor.
