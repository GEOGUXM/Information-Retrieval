   NDE VALIDATION CENTER

   The NDE Validation Center was established by the Federal Highway
   Administration in 1998. The objective of the NDEVC is to improve the
   state of the practice for highway bridge inspection. The Center is
   designed to act as a resource for state transportation agencies,
   industry, and academia concerned with the development and testing of
   innovative nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies. NDEVC provides
   state highway agencies with independent evaluation and validation of
   NDE technologies, develops new NDE technologies, and provides technical
   assistance to states exploring the use of these advanced technologies.

   The NDE Validation Center utilizes a series of unique resources to
   evaluate and assess the factors affecting the reliability and
   performance of NDE systems.

   The Validation Center is located at the Turner-Fairbank Highway
   Research Center in McLean, Virginia. To supplement the capabilities of
   the NDE laboratory facilities, a series of field-test bridges located
   in Northern Virginia and southern Pennsylvania are utilized to conduct
   field studies. In addition, a collection of component test specimens
   are used in various test programs.
