   The Sustainable Seas Expeditions is a five-year project of underwater
   exploration and discovery of the marine world with special emphasis on
   the national marine sanctuaries of the United States. The expeditions
   are the brain child of Dr. Sylvia Earle, scholar and
   Explorer-In-Residence of the National Geographic Society. Led by Dr.
   Earle, the expeditions are a project of the National Geographic Society
   in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) and other government agencies, industry, and private
   institutions, made possible by a grant from the Richard and Rhoda
   Goldman Fund.
