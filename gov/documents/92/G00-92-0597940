   [gnball.gif] POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATES   [pdficon.gif]

   The Atmospheric Sciences Division at Brookhaven National Laboratory has
   the following openings for postdoctoral research associates.
   Candidates should be within three years of receipt of the Ph.D. degree.

   1.  Improve representation of atmospheric particle formation and
   aerosol evolution in  3-D regional-to-global scale chemical
   transformation models.  The position requires a strong knowledge in
   atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric physics, aerosol science, and/or
   meteorology and a strong interest in applying advanced computational
   methods, such as highly parallel computing, to atmospheric modeling.
   The position will require ingenuity and independence in translating
   process-level understanding into efficient computer-based algorithms
   suitable for application in the model.  Contact: S. E. Schwartz,
   ses@bnl.gov, 631-344-3100.

   2.  Develop and implement new methods for measurement of atmospheric
   trace species for deployment both at surface sites and on aircraft.
   The measurements will be used to examine the mechanisms of
   aerosol/oxidant formation in the lower troposphere. The position will
   involve both laboratory and field studies.  Training and experience in
   the development/deployment of advanced trace gas/aerosol
   instrumentation are required.  Experience and expertise in deriving
   process level understanding from field data are desirable.    Contact:
   P. Daum, phdaum@bnl.gov, 631-344-7283.

   3.  Investigate the mechanisms governing the transformation and
   distribution of photo-oxidants and particulate matter in the
   atmosphere.  The research will involve instrument development, field
   measurements, and data interpretation.  Training in atmospheric
   chemistry, analytical chemistry, aerosol science or instrumentation is
   required.  Experience in GC, LC and MS will be a plus.  Contact: Y.-N.
   Lee, ynlee@bnl.gov, 631-344-3294

   For further information please contact the investigators above or Dr.
   Peter Daum, phdaum@bnl.gov, Head, Atmospheric Sciences Division,
