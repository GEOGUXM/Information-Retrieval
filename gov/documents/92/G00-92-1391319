   Investigation of the Sintering Process Using Non-contact
   Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers James C. Foley and David K.
   Rehbein Ames Laboratory In-situ characterizations of green state part
   density and sintering state have long been desired in the powder metal
   community. Recent advances in non-contact electromagnetic acoustic
   transducer (EMAT) technology have enabled in-situ monitoring of
   acoustic amplitude and velocity as sintering proceeds. Samples were
   made from elemental powders of Al (99.99%), Al (99.7%), Ag, (99.99%),
   Cu (99.99%) and Fe (99.9%). The powders were pressed in a uniaxial die
   and examined with acoustic waves for changes in velocity and amplitude
   during sintering for the samples containing Al, Ag, and Cu. The changes
   in acoustic properties were correlated with sample microstructures and
   mechanical properties. Evolution of a series of reverberating echoes
   during sintering is shown to provide information on the state of
   sintering, changes in sintering kinetics as well as having the
   potential for detection of interior flaws. This work is funded by a
   laboratory directed research and development grant and by DOE-BES under
   contract no.W- 7405-Eng-82.
