   Research Projects

   An Airborne Remote Sensing Platform of The Helsinki University of
   Technology.  In 1994 Helsinki University of Technology acquired a Short
   SC7 Skyvan turboprop aircraft to be modified to carry remote sensing
   instruments. As the aircraft is originally designed to carry heavy and
   space consuming cargo, a modification program was implemented to make
   the aircraft feasible for remote sensing operations.

   AIRBORNE MINIATURE PLATFORMS TASK DESCRIPTION Conventional aerial
   photography, airborne geophysics, and remote sensing techniques are too
   expensive to use when characterizing a small waste site, or when
   repeated flyovers are desired. The purpose of this project is to
   demonstrate that in such cases a radio-controlled airplane or
   helicopter can be used to collect high-quality data, quickly and
   cheaply. http://iridium.nttc.edu/env/CMST/CMST_ch2.4.html

   In an effort to accelerate the growth of commercial remote sensing in
   the national interest, NASA has created a number of mechanisms designed
   to promote greater awareness among industry firms of the remote sensing
   potential and to provide basic training in the commercial application
   of the technology. Among the mechanisms is the Visiting Investigator
   Program (VIP), managed by Stennis Space Center.

   New NASA Field Campaign Sees the Forest for the Satellite
   Something different is "growing" in the Harvard Forest in central
   Massachusetts. Researchers and their instruments have spread throughout
   the forest in an effort to check the accuracy of land maps generated
   from NASA satellite data. These maps provide valuable information about
   the Earth's land surface and different types of ecological communities.
   Scientists are gathering at the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological
   Research (LTER) site in Petersham, Mass., through August 8 to further
   improve land maps created from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectrometer) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer) sensors
   aboard NASA's Terra satellite.
   The intensive campaign includes field, tower and aircraft measurements
   and involves two teams from Boston University (BU), the University of
   Arizona, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the umbrella of the
   MODIS Land Team, and the "BigFoot project." These teams are being
   hosted by Harvard Forest LTER through collaboration with Steve Wofsy,
   Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Chemistry, Harvard
   University.
   The BigFoot project, funded by NASA, works in collaboration with the
   MODIS Land Team to analyze the landscape features of areas centered
   around existing "flux towers," or towers with sensors that collect data
   on the relationship between ecological communities, climate and the
   atmosphere.
   Based on field campaigns, the MODIS Land Team and the BigFoot project
   will use different methods to gather and create datasets of the land
   that will then be developed into maps. Field data, Landsat satellite
   imagery and various geophysical statistics and models of ecosystem
   processes are all combined to create new maps. These new maps will then
   be correlated to the resolution (500m and 1km) of the MODIS and MISR
   data maps for comparison. By doing so, not only can various land and
   air methods be checked against each other to see which are most
   accurate, but the satellite maps themselves can be checked against
   other methods of gathering the same information.
   During this campaign, the science teams will take detailed measurements
   of the temperate broadleaf ecological community at the Harvard Forest
   from the land and by air. The data will be compiled, integrated and
   then compared with MODIS and MISR.
   "These land and aircraft measurements will be combined to produce a
   high resolution product which can then be compared with a corresponding
   MODIS product," said Jeff Morisette, MODIS Land Team Validation
   Coordinator. "Both the field data and the satellites produce the same
   end product. They're trying to get the same information but are using
   different modes of getting there. Comparing the two helps us understand
   the uncertainty in the satellite-derived products"
