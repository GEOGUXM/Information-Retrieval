   Search Tips
      At its simplest, a query can be just a word or a phrase. But with the
      tips on this page, you can expand the focus of your query to give you
      more complete results. These tips will get you started with basic query
      language and acquaint you with the full power of Microsoft Index
      Server.
        * Look for words with the same prefix. For example, in your query
          form type key* to find key, keying, keyhole, keyboard, and so on.

        * Search for all forms of a word. For example, in the form type
          sink** to find sink, sinking, sank, and sunk.

        * Search with the keyword NEAR, rather than AND, for words close to
          each other. For example, both of these queries, system and manager
          and system near manager, look for the words system and manager on
          the same page. But with NEAR, the returned pages are ranked in
          order of proximity: The closer together the words are, the higher
          the rank of that page.

        * Refine your queries with the AND NOT keywords to exclude certain
          text from your search. For example, if you want to find all
          instances of surfing but not surfing the Net, write the following
          query:
          surfing AND NOT the Net

        * Add the OR keyword to find all instances of either one word or
          another, for example: Abbott OR Costello
          This query finds all pages that mention Abbott or Costello or both.
        * Put quotation marks around keywords if you want Index Server to
          take them literally. For instance, if you type the following query:
          "system near manager"
          Index Server will literally look for the complete phrase system
          near manager. But if you type the same query without the quotation
          marks:
          system near manager
          Index Server searches all documents for the words system and
          manager.

      These hints will get you started, but for more complex queries and more
      examples, see the Query Language page.
