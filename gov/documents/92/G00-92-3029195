   Office of Governor Gary Locke
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - December 11, 2001

   Locke lauds Washington Competitiveness Council, lays out transportation
   plan
   SEATTLE — Gov. Gary Locke today accepted the report from his special
   panel on Washington’s economic competitiveness, saying he would pursue
   many of its ideas to make the state a better place to do business –
   starting with a renewed attempt to build a transportation system for
   the 21st century.
   “My competitiveness council’s number one recommendation is that we fix
   our transportation mess and I intend to pursue that recommendation with
   every tool at my disposal,” the governor declared.
   Locke used the occasion to release his transportation improvement
   package to the 2002 Legislature, which calls for spending $8.5 billion
   over 10 years to unclog highway chokepoints and make other badly-needed
   system improvements. The plan, which would allow regions to raise
   additional funds for transportation needs, calls for a phased-in 9
   cents per gallon gas tax increase and other fee increases. The 2001
   Legislature failed to act on the governor’s previous transportation
   proposal.
   The package also would create more than 20,000 jobs to help stimulate
   Washington’s economy.
   “The council recognizes that our economy eventually will stall without
   a major transportation overhaul and it also recognizes that this
   package will begin to create nearly 20,000 jobs at a time when our
   state desperately needs them,” Locke said.
   The Washington Competitiveness Council, convened by the governor last
   summer, includes leaders in business, labor and government. Along with
   an improved transportation system, the council issued many
   recommendations to make Washington an attractive place in which to do
   business.
   Locke thanked the council for its hard work and thoughtful
   recommendations. He said he will support many of the recommendations
   and as a first step, he will:
     * Support long-term funding for the Community Economic Revitalization
       Board, which helps regions of the state attract new business by
       funding roads, sewers and other vital infrastructure.
     * Take steps to eliminate the state’s regulatory red tape to help
       businesses and citizens get development and other permits in a
       timely manner. Regulations still would protect citizens and the
       environment as intended.
     * Assign Paul Isaki (formerly the governor’s chief of staff) as
       special assistant for business and regulatory reform. Among other
       responsibilities, Isaki will focus on streamlining environmental
       regulations and permitting processes.
     * Pledge to find ways to address Washington’s growing demand for
       clean and plentiful water, including funding for more water storage
       and further reform of state water law.
     * Clarify and reform certain tax laws, including clarifying the law
       on the business and occupation (B&O) tax deduction of investment
       income and reforming municipal taxation to eliminate the
       possibility of double-taxation of businesses by local governments.
     * Continue his efforts, as funding allows, to promote the development
       and integration of high-technology commerce, research institutions
       and the higher education system.
