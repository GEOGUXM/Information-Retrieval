     Wildlife & Inland Fisheries Division - Fisheries Program (FPB) GIS Unit

   Overview:

   Fisheries Programs Branch (FPB) plans, initiates, coordinates, and
   conducts investigations, and research and development projects dealing
   with inland (freshwater) fisheries. The FPB works with the regional
   managers and divisional staff to develop standards and procedures for
   regional fisheries programs. These include fish planting schedules and
   protocols, disease control efforts, experimental management, research
   and investigations, habitat improvement, and regional support-programs.
   FPB also coordinates the Department?s fish health functions including
   the diagnoses, treatment, and prevention of hatchery fish and wild fish
   disease problems.
   Mission:
   The mission of FPB is to coordinate with other branches and regions to
   manage fishery resources, and provide for diverse angling
   opportunities, appreciation, and other public uses of inland fish
   resources throughout the State. It also includes collection and
   assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of inland
   fish populations to determine the need for regulations; monitoring the
   effect of those regulations; and the preparation and coordination of
   fishery management planning and development of plans. FPB?s portion of
   inland fisheries management includes three broad categories of animals
   relating to inland sport fishing, and native and non-native species
   management:
     * Resident (nonanadromous) trout and inland (land locked) salmon;
     * Steelhead trout;
     * Warmwater game fishes.

   Other aspects of inland fisheries management including habitat
   restoration, land and water use issues, nongame fish species, and
   amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates are coordinated by the
   functions within the Habitat Conservation Division.

   GIS Services:
     * Provide spatial data regarding current and historical trout and
       inland salmon distribution;
     * Mapping of fish disease occurrences;
     * Provide spatial data for analysis of fish stocking relative to
       native amphibian habitat;
     * Mapping of regulated sport fishing waters;
     * Database development, maintenance, and distribution regarding
       fisheries related programs.
