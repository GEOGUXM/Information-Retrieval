   CONFERENCES/WORKSHOPS

                                   Education gif


      ORI supports conference/workshops each year that are related to
      research misconduct and research integrity. The conferences/workshops
      pursue the following objectives:
        * promote research integrity and the responsible conduct of research,
        * facilitate effective responses to allegations of scientific
          misconduct,
        * prevent research misconduct, and
        * foster compliance with pertinent federal regulations.

   Some workshops primarily transfer information to assist institutions in
   handling allegations of scientific misconduct and comply with the
   regulation. Other workshops are catalytic in that they raise issues for
   discussion.  Most workshops are held in collaboration with research
   institutions, scientific societies, and professional organizations.
