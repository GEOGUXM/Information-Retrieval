                                  overview
    Improved nutrition has been a key goal of all modern societies. Sound
    nutrition frees a nation and its people to pursue goals that improve
    the human condition. A healthy and well-nourished population is more
   productive and able to focus its energies on the provision of goods and
        services associated with a highly developed society. In 1900,
        households relied primarily on local food production, and the
   predominant nutritional problems were low caloric intake and inadequate
     intakes of certain vitamins and minerals. Today, a hallmark of the
       American agricultural system is that consumers enjoy year-round
   abundance of nutritious and affordable foods. With prosperity, however,
                   comes new challenges. More overview...

   Food Assistance and Nutrition Research Program, Final Report: Fiscal
   2001 ActivitiesProvides an overview of FANRP's research themes,
   principles, and activities and describes the objectives of individual
   research projects.

   Examining the Well-Being of ChildrenA series of articles discuss the
   well-being of America's children, children's diet quality, the problem
    of overweight children in America, foodborne disease among children,
   the economics of breastfeeding, and food assistance programs that help
                        children and their families.

      Welfare Reform and Food AssistanceA recent issue of FoodReview is
    devoted to the topic of welfare reform and food assistance. Articles
    discuss the contribution of a strong economy and welfare reform to a
    drop in food stamp rolls, food stamp participation rates in rural and
   urban areas, food stamp participation and food security, and the effect
              of the WIC program on childrens nutrient intake.

       Understanding the Dynamics of Produce Markets: Consumption and
       Consolidation GrowRetail groceries and food wholesalers have
    consolidated. Produce sellers are concerned about the competitiveness
    of produce markets, with fewer buyers for their products and with new
     marketing and trade practices. Also see the chapter on ERS produce
        markets project in the Food Market Structures Briefing Room.

                            recommended readings
     America's Eating Habits: Changes and ConsequencesThis compendium
     provides different perspectives on nutrition problems in the United
    States. Healthier diets might prevent $71 billion per year in medical
    costs, lost productivity, and the cost of premature deaths associated
                           with these conditions.

     Away-From-Home Foods Increasingly Important to Quality of American
   DietFoods prepared away from home have lower nutritional quality than
        foods prepared at home. Therefore, the trend toward increased
      consumption of food away from home could present a challenge for
        Americans to improve the nutritional quality of their diets.

     The Changing Food Assistance Landscape: The Food Stamp Program in a
   Post-Welfare Reform EnvironmentThis report focuses on the economywide
   effects of reduced food stamp benefits and eligibility restrictions on
      food production, consumption, nutrition, and farm income. Program
       changes have important implications for the demand for food and
   increase the prominence of the Food Stamp Program as a cyclical social
                                 safety net.
