     __________________________________________________________________

   The ICER Biostatistics Unit is on the forefront of statistical
   methodology for health services research.  Our primary role is to work
   with ICER investigators throughout the entire research process, from
   project inception to manuscript publication.  We have implemented a
   variety of standardized data collection and data management procedures
   to enhance overall project quality.

   We continually strive to develop and utilize innovative information
   technologies to improve data quality and overall project efficiency.
   We also perform top-quality statistical analyses and collaborate with
   ICER investigators on manuscript preparation.  Additionally, ICER Ph.D.
   statisticians maintain active research portfolios in several areas of
   statistical methodology, including robust regression techniques and
   methods for longitudinal and incomplete data.
