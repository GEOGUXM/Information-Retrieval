   What is Share-In-Savings?
     * Special contracting and funding strategy:
          + little or no "upfront" funding;
          + payment from the savings or revenue;
          + INTERdependence with industry;
          + strongly resembles incentive contracting.
     * 90-99% of risk on contractor;
     * Payment made only AFTER substantial results are achieved;
     * Pay only for results--not just effort.

   What is the legal authority?

   The authority to conduct share in savings contracting is in Section
   5311 of the Clinger Cohen Act or the NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
   FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996

   In accordance with that authority:

          SEC. 5311. SHARE-IN-SAVINGS PILOT PROGRAM. (a) Requirement.--The
          Administrator may authorize the heads of two executive agencies
          to carry out a pilot program to test the feasibility of-- (1)
          contracting on a competitive basis with a private sector source
          to provide the Federal Government with an information technology
          solution for improving mission-related or administrative
          processes of the Federal Government; and (2) paying the private
          sector source an amount equal to a portion of the savings
          derived by the Federal Government from any improvements in
          mission-related processes and administrative processes that
          result from implementation of the solution. (b)
          Limitations.--The head of an executive agency authorized to
          carry out the pilot program may, under the pilot program, carry
          out one project and enter into not more than five contracts for
          the project. (c) Selection of Projects.--The projects shall be
          selected by the Administrator, in consultation with the
          Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory
          Affairs.

   There is debate among the legal community as to whether this pilot
   authority is the ONLY authority under which one can conduct Share in
   Savings contracting. Some agencies have used a variation of an
   incentive contract under FAR Part 16 to justify paying contractors
   based on the realization of future savings or revenue.

   Contact Ken.Buck@gsa.gov for more assistance with these legal issues.

   What is GSA's role?

   In January 1999, Congress asked GSA to play a leadership role in
   developing and institutionalizing the share in savings concept
   governmentwide. In response, FTS has established a program office to
   assist prospective customers with:
     * identifying "right" opportunities
     * developing business case
     * developing statement of work
     * developing and validating baselines
     * conducting the procurement
          + ANSWER and Milllenia (existing GWACs)
     * Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) during performance
     * Coordinating with Hill/OMB

   To reach the Executive Director of this office, contact
   Ken.Buck@gsa.gov or Linda.Wilkinson@gsa.gov.

   Partnership with the Council for Excellence in Government - "Success
   Stories and Future Federal Opportunities"

   The Council for Excellence in Government's Technology Consortium has
   teamed up with the General Service Administration's Federal Technology
   Service (FTS) to help federal agencies create "win-win" partnerships
   through innovative, value-based information technology (IT)
   contracting.

   Successfully implemented in state and local governments, this
   unconventional method of contracting has yielded better government
   services at less cost to the taxpayer. With value-based contracting,
   private sector contractors have provided up-front funds for capital
   investment, recovering those costs through savings realized after
   systems are installed.

   The Consortium and GSA have launched a nine-month project to bring this
   innovative funding technique to federal IT contracting by:
     * Identifying where value-based IT contracting has been successful
       and why;
     * Illuminating the lessons learned from those cases, specifically as
       those lessons can support innovation at the federal level;
     * Developing a clear strategy to remove any barriers that prevent
       implementation;
     * Identifying high ready federal programs where the concept can be
       applied; and
     * Holding a series of conversations among federal officials and
       private sector contractors to encourage them to consider
       value-based contracting in cases where is likely to generate
       significant results.

   The cases will be ready for public consumption by October 2000. A
   governmentwide conference will be held in January 2001 to present and
   discuss the results.
