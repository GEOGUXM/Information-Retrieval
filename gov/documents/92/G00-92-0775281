   Wide Web (WWW) have become an integral component of the provision of
   NASA information to academia, industry, and the public, and as an
   enabling set of technologies for the internal NASA information
   technology environment. This document provides a set of web "Best
   Practices" (WBP) for all NASA entities engaged in the development and
   maintenance of World Wide Web resources. The Best Practices defined in
   this document are applicable to all NASA Enterprises, Centers, and
   project and program offices and have been created under the auspices of
   the NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO). This Best Practices document
   is organized into the following chapters: 1. Site Design 2. Page Design
   3. Site Accountability 4. Site Security 5. Accessibility 6. Web
   Marketing 7. Site Search 8. Authoring Tools These Best Practices
   facilitate consistent, reliable, and efficient deployment of WWW
   services throughout the Agency. These criteria should be viewed as
   baseline recommendations. References to applicable government and NASA
   policies and standards are included to highlight "requirements." This
   document will continue to be reviewed and revised by the NASA WWW
   community. 5 Introduction Transmitting information to NASA partners,
   the academic community, industry and the public is a fundamental
   component of the NASA charter. The Internet and the World Wide Web
   (WWW) are integral elements in this task. These technologies also serve
   as a core piece of the internal information technology (IT)
   infrastructure on which NASA relies to carry out its mission. In this
   context, the set of technologies, content, processes, and policies that
   support the delivery of WWW-based services should be viewed as a
   significant part of the NASA environment and approached with the same
   commitment to excellence as all other NASA activities. Purpose of Best
   Practices Guidelines The Best Practices outlined in this document serve
   as a guideline to all NASA entities engaged in the development and
   maintenance of WWW resources. These guidelines facilitate consistent,
   reliable, and efficient deployment of WWW services throughout the
   Agency. These criteria should be viewed as baseline recommendations.
   References to applicable government and NASA policies and standards are
   included to emphasize "requirements." These best practices will
   continue to be reviewed and revised by the NASA WWW community. The
   current document and associated information is available at:
   http://nasa-wbp.larc.nasa.gov/ Scope The guidelines defined in this
   document are applicable to all NASA Enterprises, Centers, and project
   and program offices. These guidelines are created and maintained under
   the auspices of the NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO). Guideline
   Reviews As the technology and government policy evolve, these
   guidelines will be reviewed by a NASA agency team on an annual basis.
   The review date is displayed on the title page of the document.

   1.0 Site Design This chapter describes high-level site design aspects,
   often referred to as information architecture . The two most important
   factors in site design are: 1. To identify the main goals and
   objectives of the site in order to effectively communicate its purpose.
   2. To identify the target audience in order to understand the
   motivations, goals, behaviors, and technical requirements of that
   target audience. To meet the intended audiences' goals, you must
   develop a specific purpose and articulate this to the intended
   audience, either explicitly or implicitly. By identifying primary goals
   and objectives, you can identify the site's content and its
   organization. A clear goal statement should be included in the
   content-possibly as an overview of the site's contents. The site design
   should accommodate its goals and priorities. For example, does a site
   give priority to publishing recent developments, such as the NASA Home
   Page (http://www.nasa.gov) or to providing access to catalogs of
   information, such as the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) Web
   Site (http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/)? If the main purpose of the site is
   to publish recent developments, you need to allocate space within the
   design for new material and for easy updates. If the context does not
   require frequent updates, but encompasses extensive data holdings, then
   you need to focus on structure and network capacity. Determine How Your
   Audience Will Use the Site To communicate effectively with the intended
   audience, you must understand their motivations for visiting a site and
   their behavior in navigating and using the information. A clear
   understanding of how the target audience will use a site helps you
   determine what content, level of detail, format, and navigational aids
   you should employ. An intranet site, for example, accommodates an
   internal audience by providing well- organized content that is quickly
   accessed. A public site, on the other hand, must draw users into the
   site by stating the site's purpose and preview of the site's contents.
   Many studies have been done to determine NASA's target audience. As a
   result, we know that the Agency has a very broad, but also segmented,
   audience divided into five groups: 1. General Public and mass media:
   These audiences typically have some general knowledge of NASA's
   missions and accomplishments. 7 2. Research communities beyond NASA:
   industry, scientific and technical press: These audiences typically
   possess in-depth knowledge about specific subjects. 3. Government
   groups such as Congress, the Presidential Administration, and other
   agencies: These audiences have varying levels of familiarity with NASA
   subject matter. 4. Internal: Primary focus may be on a Center, a
   project, or small organizational group. 5. Academia: Teachers,
   administrators and students. Recently this group has become a much
   higher priority for both the Federal Government Administration and
   NASA. NASA employees who are primarily interested in reaching these
   groups must bear in mind that educational material needs to be tied to
   public education curricula. Employees should work with their Centers'
   educational outreach groups to ensure that web sites meet these needs.

   es/agency_policy.html 1.1 Structure and Site Organization 1.1.1
   Information Architecture Information architecture refers to how
   information is structured to accommodate the audience and the site's
   purpose. Information architecture is determined by how users will
   browse and navigate the site. Information architecture determines the
   site's usability. The features you must consider include the following:
   * Browse How the user browses your site determines the user's
   "experience" of the site. Some sites provide little distinct
   organizational flow, but rather offer materials in a "find and seek"
   approach. Browsing is facilitated by providing several methods of
   accessing the information: organizing content in alphabetical order, by
   keyword categories and/or table of contents. Letting the user
   "discover" the site's elements is well suited to children's materials
   on an outreach site, where the user might be exploring and discovering
   concepts. 8 * Classification Some sites are based on a standard
   taxonomy (or classification). For example, a NASA site might use the
   NASA Thesaurus for its taxonomy. Large sites with diverse content can
   be structured by categories, providing various subject headings to
   encompass the variety of topics. A well-known example of this type of
   structure is the Yahoo site http://www.yahoo.com. * Cluster Clustering
   different aspects of a central idea or element is useful for a small
   site with a very specific focus (for example, car buying: costs,
   locations, financing, service). * Flowchart To show steps in a
   sequential order or a process use a flow diagram; for example, show the
   steps in how to paint a car: sanding> primer coat> final top coat. *
   Hierarchical Hierarchical order presents information in main categories
   and subcategories that are structured vertically. This organizational
   pattern is used for sites with dense information content. * Navigation
   Pointers Navigation pointers like labeled buttons, descriptive links,
   highlighted terms help users navigate the site. Present clusters of
   information with clear pointers either as text or as graphic pointers
   to lead the user to each area. The information is logically grouped
   into chunks and identified with descriptive labels and icons. 1.1.2
   Guidelines for Various Structural Formats The two most common
   structural formats are hierarchical structure and classification
   structure. Guidelines for using each follow: Hierarchical Structures
   (also known as tree structures) * For practicality and efficiency,
   analyze the functional and aesthetic aspects of the site. * For a
   directory structure provide a balance of topics; avoid too few choices
   or too many choices at each menu level. The number of primary levels
   can be concise and relevant by presenting original versus re-purposed
   content. * The hierarchy should represent some logical division of the
   overall content, keeping important information toward the top.
   Establish a hierarchy of importance and divide
   pages/information/content into logical units. Use the hierarchy to show
   relationships among topics. 9 * To determine the effectiveness of your
   organization, use a metric that counts the number of mouse clicks
   necessary to locate information. Most experts suggest the depth should
   be between one and three clicks. Classification Structures * Use a
   consistent vocabulary that reflects the classification structure. *
   Develop a structure based on a well-established, standard
   classification scheme; example schemes include the * NASA Thesaurus *
   Engineering Information (EI) Classification Codes * Mathematics Subject
   Classification * Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) * Plan for
   additional information clusters as the site grows. Review the structure
   of your subject headings and subheadings to ensure future site
   "extensibility." By planning a site for growth, users become familiar
   with your organizational structure and therefore are not confused when
   the site grows. * Avoid general or heterogeneous subject areas. Include
   descriptive subheadings. References: * "Net Profit in a Post Modem

   Thesaurus http://www.sti.nasa.gov/thes1.htm 1.2 Site Navigation A
   well-designed site simplifies the task of locating information and
   facilitates the user's ability to move from one page to another. The
   architecture of the site provides the users a means of identifying
   their current location in the site's space and provides navigation
   tools to guide them from one location to another. To assist users in
   navigating through a site's content, follow these guidelines:
   Navigation should be easily learned and should remain consistent
   throughout the site. * Make your navigation scheme transparent to your
   users. Users will not spend the time to learn a complicated scheme.
   Remember you have only one chance to make a good first impression. * Be
   consistent in the placement and design of navigation elements. Users
   expect that navigation buttons and bars be displayed in the same place
   on every page. Consistency builds the users' trust and enhances the
   quality of the experience. Provide visual context * Visual techniques
   like templates and style sheets, and items such as last updated or
   modified date stamps, provide important clues so users know where they
   are in the site. Include a "Home" button on each page, giving users
   quick access the site's top- level information. Minimize reliance on
   browser navigational buttons * Create site-specific navigational links
   on each web page so users can intuit where they are in the site
   regardless of their entry point. * Do not confuse users by changing
   expected browser behaviors. For instance, if they expect the browser's
   back button to take them to the previous page, don't break this rule
   without a good reason. 11 Provide clear visual messages and labels *
   Interface design is about visual guidance. How navigation options are
   presented is closely tied to how usable they are. If these options are
   hidden, difficult to find, or look too much like text or are otherwise
   visually confusing, your users will have trouble navigating the site. *
   When selecting labels, use terminology familiar to your users. Insider
   jargon is a barrier to clear communication. Good labeling is based on
   common sense and user sensitivity. Provide a search mechanism * Sites
   should provide some type of search interface or site index to help
   users quickly access information that may be located deep within the
   site. More information on local site search is available in Chapter 7,
   Site Search. References: * NCSA TRG Review of Web Styleguides

   Navigation: Designing the User Experience, Jennifer Fleming 1.3 File
   Formats and Data Coding 1.3.1 File Format Types The file formats used
   on a web site have to satisfy the often-conflicting demands of design,
   function, and user needs. The primary criterion for selecting file
   formats should be whether the target audience can easily use a specific
   file format. For publicly accessible sites, select file formats that
   are widely available and commonly supported by most popular web
   browsers across all major platforms. Fortunately, the number of file
   formats directly handled by most web browsers is constantly growing.
   Interchangeable and downloadable file formats * Provide a choice of
   formats so users can find a file format compatible with their software.
   Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), Rich Text Format (RTF), Microsoft
   Word, Excel, or GIF and JPEG are commonly used formats. In closed 12
   communities, such as intranets, you have greater control over the
   applications available at the desktop, and additional file formats may
   be supported, e.g., Informed Manager or Microsoft Project. However, be
   aware of the Center's baseline software suite, and avoid formats that
   are not supported by the Center's information technology group. Also be
   aware that delivering the same information in multiple formats can
   increase maintenance and increase the possibility of information being
   out of sync. Formats requiring special viewers (or "plug-ins") *
   Plug-ins, like a player or special viewer, are required to ensure some
   files display properly. For example, files saved in the QuickTime,
   RealAudio, or Shockwave Flash formats can be viewed on players that are
   shipped and installed with the latest versions of Netscape and Internet
   Explorer for both the Mac and PC platforms. For the widest public
   access to your site, select file formats that are widely supported by
   the popular web browsers. * Your web pages should be viewable even if
   the plug-in is not installed. A good practice is to provide a link to
   the plug-in download page. For information critical to understanding or
   navigating the site, provide the same information in an alternative
   format, such as text. Users become frustrated when a NASA site requires
   the installation of plug-ins or other software that the users need to
   install before they can access information. 1.3.2 Coding and
   Programming Languages HTML Content on the web is manipulated by
   computer codes ranging from the very simple such as HTML to the complex
   such as Java. Different browsers and different versions of the same
   browser may not support different forms of content and language in a
   consistent manner. For example, earlier versions of HTML did a poor job
   of implementing frames; however, now that frames are a part of the HTML
   4.0 standard, any 4.0-compliant browser must implement them, so
   cross-browser compatibility will be less of an issue. Cascading Style
   Sheets Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are another example of a feature
   that is not yet mature. CSS standards are changing and their various
   style properties never seem to work the same on all browsers.
   Nevertheless, as the Internet moves away from HTML toward XHTML,
   tomorrow's web developer will need to learn how to use CSS, since
   today's formatting tags won't work with XHTML. 13 JavaScript JavaScript
   is not considered a programming language but one form of code that is
   widely used on the web. Most browsers support JavaScript 1.l, and if
   the code is written well, the script won't fail when viewed on most
   browsers. The more complex the language, the more important that you
   know how to write good code. Equally important is testing the
   compatibility of your code on different platforms and browsers. You can
   develop complex content through simple, robust HTML coding that is read
   by various browser versions and platforms. However complex coding
   depends on your mission, your skills, your audience, and your free
   time. References: * World Wide Web Consortium http://www.w3.org/ * MSDN

   Maintainability 1.4.1 The Art of Reuse Content must be developed for
   reuse to reduce total site maintenance. This can be done in several
   ways: * Use short, readable HTML documents; this will aid in locating
   problems and making corrections as the content evolves. * Format your
   HTML code with indents and blank lines separating sections so that it
   is easy to read. Be consistent in your formatting so that changes can
   be incorporated quickly and easily updated by someone. The comment tag
   is also useful when labeling sections of an HTML file. * Provide a
   diagram of site architecture and keep it updated. This diagram helps
   you remember where documents are stored if you have not worked on an
   individual site in some time. A diagram is a useful tool to pass on to
   14 another person, who may be assigned to maintain the site. * Store
   frequently used content components like images, headers, footers, etc.
   in shared, centralized locations, rather than replicating the same
   content in multiple locations on the server. This practice reduces
   duplicate maintenance for similar components and conserves disk space
   as well as reduces download time. * Date your pages individually, and
   edit the date every time a change is made. * Use global templates/style
   sheets or server-side includes to reduce the number of files that need
   to be maintained. * Avoid using browser-dependent features that require
   two or more versions of HTML code. 1.4.2 Links Links within a web site
   are probably the single largest maintenance issue and often the
   greatest source of frustration for users. To minimize invalid or broken
   links, follow these practices: * Strike a balance between the number of
   links offered and the quality of those links. The greater the number of
   links, the greater the probability that someone will move a target
   document and break a link. * Do not move documents or change uniform
   resource locators (URLs) too often. Frequent changes increase the
   possibility of broken links or breaking bookmarks that visitors have
   made to a site. * If the site must be moved then post a pointer page at
   the old URL, or use server-side redirects to send the user to the new
   site. A pointer page notifies the user that the site has moved to a new
   URL, gives the location of the URL, and provides a direct link to the
   new page location. Generally pointer pages remain at the old site for
   approximately 3 to 6 months. The second option, server-side redirects,
   is configured within the web server and redirects the user to the new
   site while bypassing the old site altogether. This alleviates a stop at
   the old site, as required by a pointer page. However, sometimes users
   do not realize they have been redirected to another URL, and they will
   not bookmark or modify their site link to the new location. * Use
   relative URLs links instead of absolute links between pages within a
   site will simplify the administrative aspect of relocating the content,
   15 should that be necessary. * Use some form of automation, such as
   Momspider or Linkbot, whenever possible to identify broken links that
   will inevitably occur. Some text editors include link validation in
   their tool suite. Plan site checks on a regular basis that are part of
   a maintenance schedule. 1.4.3 Automation Even when care has been taken
   to minimize site maintenance manual checks may not be enough to ensure
   proper care of the site. The best way to effectively maintain a site is
   to use automation to assist in identifying problems and in creating
   content. * Link validation : Rather than attempting to manually scan
   hundreds and even thousands of documents for broken links, use a link
   validation tool, and run these tools at regular intervals to identify
   and report broken links. * HTML validation : Use these tools to
   identify HTML coding errors or HTML features that may not be supported
   by all browsers. These tools should be used before site release and
   periodically according to your maintenance schedule. * When practical,
   use automation to generate content based on selected inputs, thereby
   minimizing the potential for human error. Obviously, sites that
   generate their content automatically from databases or other data
   sources eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of page and site
   maintenance; only the information stored in the database needs to be
   maintained. Keep in mind, however, that to have a database site set up
   can be expensive and is usually not cost effective for small sites or
   for sites that do not require frequent changes. 1.4.4 Feedback Despite
   all attempts to ensure that links are accurate, errors will occur. Make
   sure that users can send feedback to site personnel so these problems
   can be corrected. 1.4.5 Variable Data Users return to a site looking
   for fresh content. To generate return visits, change your site as often
   as possible within the boundaries of your time and budget. However,
   make changes that won't confuse your users. it easy for users to
   identify changes. 16 For sites that contain static information, avoid
   using data that will soon be outdated. For example, rather than state
   "the software was developed five years ago," state "the software was
   developed in 1995." References: * The Sev Guide to Web Design:

   The NASA Integrated Information Technology Architecture (NIITA)
   document is an evolving document that establishes a set of goals and
   guidelines that provide a blueprint for NASA IT service providers and,
   as such, defines a common, vendor-independent framework for design,
   integration and implementation of IT systems. In this document it
   states that, "NASA has ... embraced the use of the World-Wide-Web (WWW)
   Browser as a `universal' client and can be considered a leader in the
   use of WWW clients and servers for the dissemination and retrieval of
   information." The NIITA document also states that, "NASA has
   thoughtfully considered the idea of an `intranet' and what it means for
   the Agency and the industry-at-large. The general consensus within the
   Agency is that an intranet is the structured use of the open, scalable
   technologies of the Internet (such as those listed in the preceding
   paragraph) to do the work of an Enterprise in a secure and reliable
   manner." 17 * Although the NIITA does not provide specific guidance
   with respect to web site design, it does define a set of basic
   principles that would generally apply: * All IT system design must be
   customer driven. * IT solutions should demonstrate a commitment to a
   standards-based, modular design. * IT solutions should utilize stable,
   commercially available solutions if at all possible. * IT solutions
   should leverage existing IT investment. * Design objectives should give
   preference to general-use solutions. * Design objectives should give
   preference to a simpler IT infrastructure that anticipates multiple,
   and emerging, end-user devices. References: * NASA-STD-2814

   While site design focuses on issues that affect an entire site, web
   page design focuses on issues specific to individual pages or sections
   of pages. Web page design incorporates all areas of web development,
   ranging from organizing the flow of content for the user to creating
   the graphic design, multimedia and programming-all enhancing the user's
   experience. 2.1 Logical vs. Physical Markup A well-designed page helps
   users locate information and facilitates the users' ability to move
   from one page to another. While page layout is a key factor in
   accomplishing this goal, simple and intuitive navigation plays a key
   role in enhancing usability. Use logical markup in favor of physical
   markup. * HTML includes tags for both logical and physical markup.
   Logical markup specifies the nature of a piece of text: such as a
   heading, a paragraph, an important word, a book title. Physical markup
   specifies how the text will look on screen: large font, bold face,
   italics. Whenever possible, use logical markup instead of physical
   markup to let the browser choose how to display the specified text.
   Sometimes the desired appearance (e.g., boldface) may not be available
   in a particular browser (e.g., on a character terminal or
   text-to-speech reader). In addition, the logical elements are generally
   more meaningful for parsing of the document. Declaring that something
   is a level 1 heading will be more useful than saying it is in bold,
   courier, and a 24-pt. font. The number of logical markup tags is
   presently limited, but XML (eXtensible Markup Language) will allow
   authors to invent their own tags and, in combination with style sheets,
   specify their preferred appearance. A good introduction to XML is
   available at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/intro.asp Design
   tip: You may someday need to dissect the structure of all your pages by
   machine rather than by a browser. This activity will be easier if the
   structure is logical and clear. 2.2 Create a Consistent Look Maintain a
   consistent appearance and navigation style throughout the web site.
   Consistency helps users identify your site, realize when they've left
   it, and navigate it 19 successfully. Elements that should be consistent
   on each page include the overall structure, colors, backgrounds,
   headers, footers, sidebars, and navigation cues. Maintaining
   consistency is easier with careful planning, server-side includes,
   templates, scripts, and style sheets, etc., which will be discussed
   later in this section. Design tip: Although from a hierarchical
   perspective, you may view your site as starting from the home page,
   many users will enter your site through a link to an intermediate page.
   Users should be able to immediately identify your site and recognize
   subsequent pages that are part of it. 2.2.1 Structure Use logical
   divisions consistently. * Each document comprises headings, text
   paragraphs, lists, tables, and other logical divisions. Using these
   elements consistently on all pages is the first step toward a uniform
   look. 2.2.2 Colors Use black text on default or solid white background.
   * Each browser has a default set of colors that are used for the page
   backgrounds and text. Typically the page has a gray or white
   background, black text, blue hypertext links that have not been
   visited, and purple for visited links. Pages with white backgrounds
   have been found to be the easiest to read. White background color in
   the HTML tags displays best on the greatest number of browsers. Some
   browsers allow the page author to modify default colors; it is tempting
   to give a document or site a unique look by doing so. However, finding
   color combinations that are readable on all monitors can be difficult.
   Changing the visited/unvisited colors may confuse viewers. If you do
   change the background color, specify text colors that do not conflict
   with the reader's default Color choice is an important consideration
   when attempting to create a site that will be accessible to handicapped
   or color blind users. See Chapter 5, Accessibility Guidelines, for more
   detail. Background color may also affect the printability of your web
   pages. On sites that have dark backgrounds, offer a "printer friendly"
   version of pages, which uses a white background and default link
   colors. 20 2.2.3 Backgrounds Avoid background images. * Some browsers
   allow the page author to specify an image as a background for a page.
   Typically the image is tiled to fill the window area. However,
   background images should be avoided because they increase download
   time. Also, text can become unreadable if it overlays parts of the
   image. Consistent alignment between background images and the text or
   other elements is rarely possible on different platforms or browsers.
   The page can look distorted when viewed in a very large or very small
   window. If a background is used, the image size should be as small as
   possible, and the image subtle and low contrast. A possible exception
   is when using a margin along one edge of the page, perhaps in
   conjunction with a sidebar. However, in this case, if the window size
   is changed, the alignment of the sidebar text may be destroyed. For
   full screen windows, the margin may repeat in the middle of the page.
   2.2.4 Headers Page headers should be narrow and fast loading. * Page
   headers are text and/or graphics that appear at the top of every page.
   (Page headers should not be confused with HTML heading tags.) Using a
   similar-looking header creates a consistent look and feel for your
   pages. Examples of headers might be a line of text, a logo, and a long
   narrow banner graphic, image map, or a navigation bar. The header can
   also act as a navigational element such as an image map, or a
   navigation bar. Navigation bars are often "sliced" into several
   clickable navigational images or buttons. They can even incorporate a
   path summary or "bread crumb trail" for site navigation, as at
   http://www.useit.com. Because it takes up valuable screen space, the
   header should only be a few pixels tall. A single line of text wrapped
   in a table with a color fill is a quick loading alternative to a
   graphic header. Any image that is used should be designed to load
   quickly, as it is one of the first items loaded in the document. 21
   2.2.5 Footers Use the footer for navigation elements and for site-wide
   information that is too long or repetitive to fit in the header. * A
   footer is text or graphics that appear at the bottom of the page. As
   with the headers, footers should be similar throughout the web site.
   Footers might include site or agency logos, contact addresses, and
   feedback requests. Footers may also include Agency- or Center-required
   elements such as links to a privacy statement or a disclaimer, and
   listings of the site curator, NASA Responsible Official and date last
   updated. 2.2.6 Sidebars Use sidebars judiciously, using headers and
   footers whenever possible. * An alternative to both headers and footers
   is a sidebar, which is a vertical column of text located typically
   along the left edge of the page. Sidebars often contain the elements
   commonly found in headers and footers. The advantage of a sidebar is
   that, unlike a header, it does not push the main contents farther down
   the page and, unlike footers, it is visible when the page is first
   loaded. A sidebar allows prominent display of a large number of links
   or small, featured bits of information, without pushing other content
   completely off the first screen. The sidebar, therefore, can function
   as a navigational element. The disadvantage of using a sidebar as a
   navigation aid is that it reduces the width available for each line of
   text, which is particularly a problem on small monitors, laptops or for
   users who choose not to use their browser full screen. Also, text-only
   or speech-enabled browsers tend to display the sidebar before the
   content, particularly if the sidebar is in the left margin. It is worth
   noting that if tables are used to create a sidebar, the page may not
   load as quickly because most browsers do not render elements until the
   entire table has arrived. This problem can be addressed by making the
   sidebar itself a table while putting the rest of the content in a
   normal page body. If frames are used for the sidebar, consider the WBP
   recommendations that frames should by used judiciously. 22 2.2.7 Frames
   In the past, frames have been used as a method to lay out pages, so
   repeated elements are available on every page. For example, a sidebar
   in a frame on each page could contain navigational elements. However,
   WBP recommends avoiding frames altogether. Avoid using frames. * Frames
   make it difficult for the user to bookmark a specific page. Frames also
   make the process of printing the page confusing for the novice user.
   Coding the HTML to drop the correct page into the appropriate frame may
   become muddled, making it more difficult for search engines to find the
   pages. And JavaScript rollover menus may not function correctly as the
   user's cursor travels from frame to frame. Most important frames do not
   comply with the disabilities act. These issues are a few of the reasons
   why we do not recommend the use of frames. 2.2.8 Navigating the Site
   Site navigation exists on three levels: (1) site level, (2) section
   level, and (3) page level. Site level navigation focuses on the
   navigational elements that should appear on every page in the site:
   Help, Contacts, Search, and Home. Section level navigation elements
   only appear on pages within a section. They link to information that is
   pertinent to the topics referenced in the section. These section
   elements might be incorporated by adding a second row of buttons below
   the site level navigation. Section level navigation can be further
   differentiated by the use of colors that are different than those used
   for the more primary site level navigation. Page level navigation
   includes elements used to navigate within the page such as links that
   allow the user to jump down the page to a specific topic or location.
   2.2.8.1 Using Navigational Elements Be consistent in your use of
   navigational elements. * To maintain a unified look for a site and to
   avoid confusion for the user, choose a consistent set of navigational
   elements and use them on every page. Navigational elements can be text
   or image links, a row of icons in the footer, a menu in a sidebar, a
   navigation bar at the top of the page or a path summary in the header.
   Regardless of the type of links used, every page should have a link to
   the "home page" or to a higher-level page in the same section. Also
   Center or Agency rules may require including links to Center, 23 Agency
   or other locations in the Agency hierarchy. Regardless of the type of
   navigational elements, it is crucial that they be placed in consistent
   locations on the pages. Design tip: A user who arrives at your site
   from a search engine may start at some obscure page in the middle of
   the site and will need links back up to the major sections. Design tip:
   Links should be given descriptive names. Do not simply create a link
   that reads that reads "click here." Links should be self-explanatory
   where possible and should be part of the normal sentence structure of
   the site. Descriptive links also increase the accessibility of a site
   for screen readers used by visually impaired users. And always remember
   to create an ALT tag for any buttons or clickable images. 2.2.8.2
   Browser compatibility issues for navigational elements As HTML matures
   and new versions of browsers begin to support more capabilities, it is
   tempting to create navigational elements that incorporate these new
   features. New techniques, such as JavaScript rollover buttons are easy
   to create using HTML editors and are becoming commonplace. Java
   Applet-based interfaces and DHTML rollover menus are also becoming
   commonly used. While these new techniques may produce intriguing
   interfaces, they are not always compatible with older versions of
   browsers. Making content accessible to the user should be of a higher
   priority than creating intriguing interfaces. If the user has turned
   Java or JavaScript off in the browser's preferences, navigational
   elements based on these capabilities may not function. A good practice
   is to test all interfaces on different platforms (Mac, PC, and UNIX),
   as well as using several versions of both Netscape and Internet
   Explorer browsers. See Section 2.7 on Cross-Browser Compatibility for
   more details. 2.3 Maintain a Consistent Look Once you have designed a
   look for your site, you must maintain this design as pages are added or
   modified. This task is simplified by planning the site's design and
   using server- side includes, templates, scripts, and style sheets.
   2.3.1 Planning 24 When creating or revising a site, spend the time
   planning before starting to write HTML. Consider the major topics and
   subtopics, the structure and the layout of a typical page, and the
   navigation among pages. Begin writing content for your web pages and
   start writing descriptions and keywords to include in your META tags.
   Well-chosen keywords and descriptions improve your ratings with search
   engines. See Section 2.3.2 on writing for the web for more suggestions.
   If possible, get written sign-off on content and design from site
   stakeholders or customers. Settling such issues in advance will avoid
   the need to redo pages later. Develop a hierarchical chart of the site
   and submit this to your customers. 2.3.2 Writing for the Web Most
   people find reading from the screen an uncomfortable experience.
   Scrolling down lengthy pages becomes tedious. As a result, most users
   tend to skim or "surf" the page, reading titles, hypertext links,
   bulleted lists, and short paragraphs. As an alternative, people may
   print out pages to read later off-line. For more on "How Users Read on
   the Web," visit Jakob Nielsen's commentary at:
   http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html To write content that will be
   read by the impatient web surfer, it's best to: * Include your most
   important information in the lead sentence and use short two or three
   sentence paragraphs. * Keep page content brief, no longer than
   one-and-a-half screens. * Use hypertext links to highlight important
   information and lead the reader through your content. * Use well-placed
   links. Because people may enter a web site on any page, your
   information should not be dependent on concepts presented on "higher
   level" pages. However, using well-planned links may avoid the necessity
   of presenting redundant information. * Keep titles for sections of home
   pages short, no more than one or two words, especially if they are used
   as button labels for navigating the web site. * Use descriptive
   keywords for META tags. * Always spell check content. The Sun
   Microsystems' Guide to Web Style (http://www.sun.com/styleguide/) is an
   excellent reference for writing web content. 25 2.3.3 Server-Side
   Includes Server-side includes (SSIs) are page features found on some
   servers that allow insertion of one document into another before the
   server ships the page over the network. For example, a footer that is
   the same on every page can be stored in a separate file and inserted by
   the server. When you modify the footer document, all pages that refer
   to it are automatically updated. SSIs, if available on the server, are
   an easy way to help maintain consistency. One disadvantage of SSIs is
   response time is slightly slower because it takes time to parse a
   document and insert the requested file(s). Also, some servers do not
   set a last-modified time (for the benefit of caches) on server-parsed
   documents. 2.3.4 Templates Templates are valuable tools for creating
   consistency. They can be provided to page developers as a style guide
   for page layout. Comments in the template recommend font sizes, font
   types, and locations for navigational elements as well as for adding
   new content. A template can also be a general example of the SSI
   technique. If a site has a large number of similar pages, each with
   some static and some variable content, a template can be used to
   describe the static portions of the page. Tokens placed within the
   template are examined by the server and replaced by variable contents
   as needed. For example, a page showing information about a person might
   have static headers and navigation icons and variable tokens
   representing name, address, and phone number. The server might fetch
   those variables from a database and insert them before shipping the
   page. Using templates may require either custom programming or a
   third-party product. 2.3.5 Scripts Another way to maintain page
   uniformity is to generate pages dynamically using scripts. Scripts
   allow you to generate a collection of pages using a set of arguments.
   For instance, an image catalog can be scripted so each page is uniquely
   identified by the image it displays then a server-side script
   determines what page the user wants and then creates it on demand.
   Every page looks similar because the same script makes each page. A
   site- wide change can be implemented simply by making changes to that
   script. Using scripts typically requires custom programming and places
   extra load on the server. However, scripts efficiently handle infinite
   permutations of content extracted from a database. 2.3.6 Style Sheets
   26 Style sheets are becoming the preferred way to describe and maintain
   page appearance. A style sheet specifies how different elements look on
   the page. A style sheet can be coded within the HTML page, or it can be
   a separate file linked to the page. A large site with many pages should
   have a separate file. Using a separate file allows you to change the
   overall style of a web site by only changing one file, rather than
   changing a number of individual HTML pages. A style sheet ensures that
   every time a particular element (say, a level 1 heading) is used, it
   always appears consistent. Unfortunately, the current browsers do not
   fully support style sheets and are not consistent in their
   implementation. Therefore, you must research the elements of style
   intended for a site and make sure that these elements are compatible on
   all browser versions and platforms. Good places to research this are
   (http://www.webreview.com/guides/style/), (http://www.w3.org/) or
   (http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/default.asp). Style sheets should
   improve with time, and the result will be a powerful tool. 2.4 Graphics
   Graphics are used in web pages for navigation or as design elements-for
   logos, illustrations, and decoration. When using graphics, follow these
   guidelines: * Keep file sizes small. Commercial software is available
   to "optimize" or reduce file sizes. * Provide useful ALT attributes.
   ALT is an attribute in an HTML image tag that provides a meaningful
   text alternative when images are not loaded. * Provide an alternate
   means of navigation that does not require images * Remember that most
   search engines cannot read or index images. * Never use images from
   other sites without permission. * Specify WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes
   so the browser can render the document quickly. * Consult and, if
   appropriate, link to NASA's "Reproduction Guidelines for Use of NASA
   Images and Emblems": (http://www.NASA.gov/gallery/photo/guideline.html)
   2.4.1 Graphics File Formats 27 Several types of graphic file formats
   are used for the web. Choose a file format based on a specific use.
   JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) files work well for
   photographic images. GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) files work well
   with line drawings and text images. Older browsers may not support
   other file formats, such as PNG. When in doubt, test the images on
   various browsers and platforms. 2.4.2 Icons Icons used as navigational
   elements give a site a unique and consistent look. Icons can be used to
   illustrate as well as link to the major sections of the site. To avoid
   confusion, use the same icon for the same function. It is difficult to
   create icons whose meaning is obvious to all users. A small picture
   cannot always convey an abstract topic (e.g., consider inventing an
   icon for the topic "alkalinity"). However, libraries of icons exist
   that can be downloaded and used. These are simple to acquire, but may
   not make a site unique. Consider hiring an artist to design appropriate
   icons. Design tip: Always make icons small (both in pixel size and
   bytes) so they load quickly and do not overwhelm the page content.
   2.4.3 Logos A discreet logo on each page helps unify a site. * An
   Agency, Center, or project logo is a good way to identify a site and
   its sponsors. The logo should load quickly and unobtrusively, as
   visitors are more interested in content than in a logo. Choose an
   alternative text (ALT tag) that describes or replaces the logo (i.e.,
   "Laboratory for Atmospheres" rather than just "logo"). Institutional
   requirements dictate how the logo of the Agency or Center should be
   displayed; consult the appropriate Public Affairs Office for correct
   usage of the logo or visit the "Reproduction Guidelines for Use of NASA
   Images and Emblems" web page:
   http://www.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/guideline.html. 2.4.4 Illustrations
   Choose and produce illustrations with care. * Images and graphs are
   essential for illustrating conceptual ideas and research data. However
   do not overload a web page with large color graphics. Carefully select
   images for their aesthetics and use them sparingly to create a clean,
   uncluttered look. 28 Keep image file size as small as practical by
   using these techniques: ß crop or shrink the image ß reduce the number
   of colors ß consider using Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
   instead of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) for continuous tone
   imagery. ß use a thumbnail images as a link to the full-size image when
   displaying scientific data; the document will load more quickly and
   readers can select only the images they care about ß provide
   alternative text that describes the image and allows the reader to
   choose whether to load it. 2.4.5 Non-Functional Images Avoid decorative
   images. * Carefully selected images can be used as logos or banners to
   help create a unified look for a site. However minimize the number of
   purely decorative images, which add to page download time, and avoid
   the gratuitous use of images that serve no purpose at all. 2.4.6 Image
   Layout HTML provides limited capabilities for page layout, when
   compared to desktop publishing software or word processors. This is
   deliberate; HTML is designed to be viewed on a variety of devices,
   ranging from the tiny monochrome screen of a palmtop to a
   high-resolution true-color monitor. HTML may also be "viewed" by a
   text-to-speech reader or by an autonomous search engine. Attempting to
   control every aspect of the on- screen presentation or layout may
   interfere with device and platform compatibility. See the Accessibility
   Guidelines Chapter for more information on improving device
   compatibility. Do not create a page using one large image. * Avoid
   creating an entire page as an image. It may look just right on the
   screen, but the slow download time will deter most visitors. In
   addition, an image cannot be indexed by most search engines and
   therefore will not be searchable. To create the illusion of a single
   graphic, divide the image into several small graphics that are held in
   place by tables. Smaller graphics can be coded easily as image links
   and appropriate "ALT tags" can be added. Many 29 current HTML editors
   and image processors offer this image slicing capability. Keep in mind
   that although the screen will load quicker with several small images
   than with a single image, it does take time to download several images.
   Be cautious with invisible spacers and other layout tricks. * Some
   designers use invisible images (transparent images in GIF89a format, or
   images the same color as the background) to place page elements into
   the desired location. This trick is harmless if done properly. It is
   crucial to use only small images, supply alternative text attributes
   (ALT="spacer"), and view the result in a variety of browsers, with
   image loading disabled, and at several screen sizes. The presentation
   may differ on various browsers or platforms and may be not worth the
   effort required to produce it. As previously mentioned, you can create
   sophisticated layouts by dividing a larger image and putting the pieces
   into separate cells of a table. When doing this, follow the same rules
   as mentioned in the discussion about invisible spacer GIFs. Design tip:
   Focus on the information conveyed by your page rather than its
   appearance. Useful content is timeless; nice appearance depends on
   current fashion. 2.5 Image Maps Use image maps when necessary, and
   provide an alternate means of navigation. * Image maps allow different
   parts of a single image to be linked to different documents on a
   server. Image maps are useful, even essential, in many applications.
   For example, clicking on a geographic map to select a country is a
   reasonable user interface style. An image map might also be used for a
   row of navigation icons. Image maps, however, can easily be overused,
   such as when the image is simply a picture of text and various phrases
   are links to different documents. The same result can be achieved using
   HTML, unless a specific style of text is desired to maintain
   consistency. Furthermore, image maps cannot be read by the blind and
   cannot be indexed by search engines. When an image map is appropriate,
   construct it following the previous recommendations on how to use
   graphics (small file size, useful ALT text, etc.). In addition, provide
   an alternative means of accessing the links in the 30 image map. A
   typical alternative is a list or menu of text links immediately below
   the map, or use text (or clear text) at the end of the page for
   indexing and for blind users. Design tip: Don't use an image map that
   takes up the entire page. Design tip: If a search engine can't follow
   links from your image map, it won't be able to index your site. 2.6
   Multimedia Examples of multimedia on the web include animations, audio,
   video, and three- dimensional models. The features are useful if done
   well. Keep in mind that most multimedia is slow to download and
   requires special viewers, so some users will not be able to enjoy these
   features. 2.6.1 Audio Never use background audio on a web site. * From
   RealMedia to MP3, audio is coming into its own as a web communications
   media. However make sure that the audio is used appropriately. Most
   users do not want background music unexpectedly blaring when they visit
   a site. Furthermore, unnecessary audio is a waste of bandwidth. Short
   audio clips and continuous streaming audio can be used to present
   audible content, if the user is aware of this feature and has the
   proper software. Much bandwidth is required, so distribute audio
   judiciously. Identify the type of content to be provided and the size
   of the clip, if known. Provide a written transcript for archived audio.
   2.6.2 Video Use short video clips and continuous streaming video to
   present visual content, if the user has the proper viewing software. A
   lot of bandwidth is required to support video on the web, so distribute
   video judiciously. Identify the content to be provided and the size of
   the clip, if known. Provide a written transcript or still images when
   possible. RealMedia, QuickTime files, and streaming media broadcasts do
   take time to download, particularly on a slow modem connection. Both
   formats will play while downloading, which may improve the experience.
   Be aware that interruptions due to network congestion may occur while
   receiving data. 31 Design tip: When using video, warn the user of the
   limitations of slow modems, keep file size to a minimum, and provide
   links to a location to download the viewer if needed. 2.6.3
   Three-Dimensional Models Three-dimensional (3-D) content is a powerful
   tool for displaying data and objects that are not easily viewed in 2-D.
   VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) or QTVR (QuickTime Virtual
   Reality) 3-D formats give the user the opportunity to interact with and
   view an object from all sides. However, the technology is still
   immature. Not all users have the viewing software or the adequate
   processing power necessary to render the models. These tools should be
   used selectively as a supplement to traditional content based on text
   and images. Design tip: A simple animation that shows a solid object
   moving (for example, a rotating earth) may be more compactly
   represented in VRML (as object plus code to make it rotate) rather than
   as a movie. 2.6.4 Animations Animations are short sequences of images
   that play either once or loop repeatedly, usually without sound.
   Typical formats include animated GIF (GIF89a), MPEG and QuickTime.
   Flash is another form of animation. Flash sends streaming vector files
   that are much smaller in size than GIF files and can also provide MP3
   quality audio capabilities. However, Flash does require a plug-in.
   Rather than require the user to download the plug- in to view the page,
   use JavaScript to test the user's browser for the correct plug-in. If
   the plug-in is not available, use an HTML page, with a static image. To
   reduce the plug-in issue, it is best to relegate large Flash animations
   or interfaces to one section of your site. Also, because users don't
   have the most recent versions of the plug-in, save your Flash with
   audio files to the earlier 3.0 version. Otherwise, users may not be
   able to use the sound files. Animated GIFs can be inserted like a
   normal image into a web page. Only the first frame will be shown if the
   browser cannot perform the animation. GIF89a images are often used in
   banner advertisements. Animated GIFs are not recommended because the
   endless looping tends to become annoying to the user and because of the
   large file size required for multiple frames. However, if a brief
   animation is required, GIF89a is a suitable format. 32 MPEG, RealPlayer
   and QuickTime formats play either in a separate viewer or directly in
   the browser window. They are better than GIF89a for animations and for
   video clips that are more than a few frames long. Use them as needed
   for content. Always warn the user about the file size of the download.
   Whenever possible provide one or more still frames as preview images.
   This lets the user decide whether to download. At a minimum you should
   provide a text description. QuickTime works better on Macintosh and
   MPEG works better on PC and UNIX machines, and RealPlayer has more
   cross-platform compatibility. Also be aware that this is not smooth
   video quality and movements may be jerky. 2.7 Cross-Browser
   Compatibility Ensure that a site is usable on a variety of browsers. *
   Users have browsers both modern and ancient, ranging from Macs, PCs,
   and UNIX boxes to VMS machines. Some users will choose not to load
   images; blind users, for example, use text-to-speech readers; power
   users have big monitors; wireless warriors use Palm Pilots and cellular
   modems; web TV watchers surf on their couches. A page that looks great
   on one screen, with a particular browser, using a specified font size,
   may be unattractive or unreadable on another screen. Therefore you must
   test pages using as many different viewing configurations as possible.
   Cross-platform testing can be performed manually, and can be automated
   in part by third party utilities. After a while it becomes clear what
   constitutes cross-platform HTML and explicit testing can be done less
   frequently. Design Sites for All Users NASA disseminates information to
   the broadest possible audience. Therefore to reach a broad audience,
   avoid requiring specific browsers. Test sites for browser compatibility
   instead of dictating a particular browser that requires the public to
   view the site with browser ABC. Like all federal agencies, NASA must
   comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This compliance
   requires that web sites be accessible to the blind or vision impaired.
   Either every page must be accessible (readable by a text-to-speech
   converter, for example), or a parallel set of accessible pages must be
   provided. Design Tip: If your site is for public viewing, then you
   should test the site on at 33 least than three platforms (Mac, PC,
   UNIX) using at least two browser brands per platform. A brand of
   browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer will display the same
   site differently on different platforms. Also, be sure to modify the
   browser settings to turn off image loading for navigation testing.
   2.7.1 Web Page Printability Print capability should be considered when
   the site is designed. For example, dark color backgrounds do not print
   out clearly on some printers. Fixed width tables and graphics may be
   clipped off when finished. For a printable page, keep page elements
   within a 500 to 600 pixel width. Another common practice is to offer a
   "printer friendly" version of pages, such as fact sheets, which the
   user may wish to print out. This HTML version does not have dark
   background colors or non-standard link colors and prints out neatly on
   an 8 1/2" x 11" sheet, without unwanted clipping by the printer. PDF
   versions are also "printer friendly." 34 3.0 Site Accountability NASA
   web documents are subject to the same policies governing hardcopy
   documents. This chapter describes: ß Why NASA sites must adhere to
   government policies ß What policies apply to NASA web sites ß Who is
   responsible for ensuring that a site conforms to these policies ß What
   content can and cannot be included in a public-viewable site ß How to
   respond to internal and external users' inquiries on policies 3.1
   Accountability Defined NASA web documents are subject to the same
   accountability and dissemination policies and guidelines governing
   hardcopy documents. Site accountability refers to the person or persons
   responsible and liable for the content of a NASA web page or site. The
   "NASA Public Affairs Internet Policy" states: "NASA employees should
   follow the same general guidelines for posting information to the
   Internet that now guide their actions with other media, including
   television, radio, magazines and newspapers." Documents created or
   residing on government machines and intended for public viewing are
   considered official government records and publications. Therefore,
   these documents are subject to the same legal and regulatory guidelines
   and policies applied to hardcopy materials and publications. Therefore,
   anyone who publishes web pages on NASA servers is accountable for the
   content of those sites. This section strives to help the reader
   understand the significance involved in being the "accountable party"
   and to heighten the NASA web developer's sense of duty with regard to
   publishing information on the web. 3.2 Appropriate Content for NASA
   Sites NASA is candid in dealings with the public, and a similar stance
   is taken with the Internet. The "NASA Public Affairs Internet Policy"
   states, "From its origins in 1958 to the present day, NASA has pursued
   a policy of openness and accessibility. The Agency's business is
   conducted and explained in full public view, and the results of NASA's
   activities are considered a resource to be made as widely available as
   possible. With the advent of the Internet, a medium NASA helped create,
   a powerful new communications tool is available for explaining NASA's
   programs to the American people, and for making many of the 35 results
   of those efforts widely available electronically. Information is to be
   freely shared across the Internet, but only information that is
   appropriate and cleared for public release." Documents that are in
   development or are not to be viewed by the public should be placed on
   web servers that have restricted access. No document in a draft or
   development state should be viewable by users. Likewise, documents not
   cleared for public release should be separated from those posted on a
   public web site. In terms of content, all documents, whether public or
   private, shall be directly related to the official responsibilities of
   individuals and organizations fulfilling their assigned missions and
   charters consistent with their individual Center, NASA, and the federal
   government. If NASA content will be included or referenced on a
   non-NASA site (either by directly including it in the web page or by
   including a link to another site), make sure that the content is
   pertinent to your organization, and that the resulting page content is
   appropriate and endorsed by a government agency. 3.3 Policies and
   Guidelines for Information Dissemination The Office of Management and
   Budget (OMB) through its draft guidelines has clearly indicated that
   federal web sites fall under the existing policies governing federal
   information dissemination. (Refer to OMB Circular A-130)
   (http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/circulars/a130/a130.html) The NASA
   Internet Usage Policy, Executive Notice 02-95
   (ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/cio- office/Exc-Notice/en2-95.doc),
   establishes NASA's position for electronic publication and
   dissemination of NASA information for public access over the Internet
   is applicable to any information stored on the "nasa.gov" domain.
   Government records are subject to a Freedom f Information Act (FOIA)
   (http://www.epic.org/open_gov/foia/us_foia_act.html) request. "Those
   seeking information are no longer required to show a need for
   information. Instead, the `need to know' standard has been replaced by
   a `right to know' doctrine. The government now has to justify the need
   for secrecy." In 1996 Congress amended this act "to provide for public
   access to information in an electronic format, and for other purposes"
   through The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996
   (EFOIA) (http://www.epic.org/open_gov/efoia.html). Bear in mind that
   internal policies particular to the needs and requirements of
   individual Centers may also apply. Be certain that any information that
   is being made available complies with the guidelines and regulations of
   the organization and the NASA Center hosting the web site. 36 Design
   Tip: "Better safe than sorry" applies when posting documents to the
   web. If you are not sure if a document should be viewable to your
   intended audience, for any reason, then have appropriate personnel
   review the document before posting it to your site. 3.4 Identify the
   Site's Accountable Person or Organization NASA web sites should contain
   the name of the person or organization responsible for the site's
   content and operation. In Executive Notice 02-95, Internet Usage Policy
   (ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/cio- office/Exc-Notice/en2-95.doc), Section
   1.3, Paragraph 1 states " ...there must be clear accountability for the
   accuracy and appropriateness of the information displayed." Therefore
   all government sites should display the name of a point of contact
   (POC) who can explain what is contained within the site. What this
   policy statement does not specify is how that accountability is to be
   displayed: Should the accountable party be a person or an organization?
   and what process should be in place so that users who pose questions to
   the site's accountable party will receive a quality response in a
   timely manner? Feedback from site users is important because it keeps
   the site's creators in touch with the needs of the audience and
   provides users with a way to get information to the site's accountable
   POC. The following sections provide suggestions for completing these
   tasks. 3.4.1 Identify Site Curators The site curator is responsible for
   developing, deploying, and maintaining the web site. Place the name of
   the site curator at the bottom of the site's home page at the very
   minimum, and preferably at the bottom of all site pages. If problems
   arise such as links that do not work, images that do not display, or
   the site cannot be found, the site curator will be contacted and is
   responsible for correcting the problem. The curator can be a civil
   servant(s) or a contractor(s). It is best practice to adhere to a
   naming convention to identify the site curator, and maintain this
   convention throughout the site. Suggested naming conventions: Site
   Curator: John Q. Public (john.q.public@nasa.gov) Site Construction:
   John Q. Public (john.q.public@nasa.gov) Where possible and/or
   applicable, consider using an HTML form to generate the e-mail for the
   user. A form has the advantage of automatically encoding critical
   information (such 37 as the URL of the page in question) and allowing
   the user to contact the site curator regardless of whether or not the
   curator has an e-mail account. For more information on using forms for
   feedback, see Section 3.4.3. Design Tip: Include a "mailto: " link to
   the site's curator. You may want to create an e-mail alias (i.e.,
   webteam@nasa.gov) instead of using a specific individual's e- mail
   account. E-mail aliases help hide the "e-mail identity" of the site's
   POC and allows for the adding or removing of multiple POCs by simply
   modifying the site's mailto: link. Whether using an e-mail alias or a
   specific name, the full electronic mail address should also be
   displayed for those users who cannot or have not configured the
   electronic mail capability within their browser application. In
   addition, adding a default subject line to the mailto: will allow the
   site curator receiving the e-mail to easily determine which web page is
   referenced. 3.4.2 Identify the NASA Official Responsible for Site
   Content Site officials must be civil servants and are responsible for
   the content of the site. Their role is to approve all information to be
   posted to the site and to review that information once it has been
   posted. Place the name of the NASA Official at the bottom of the site's
   home page, at the very minimum, and optimally at the bottom of all site
   pages. Before posting content, use a staging server where pages can be
   approved before publishing the content. Once the site is viewable,
   conduct periodic reviews of the site's content to the site to ensure
   that information is relevant, accurate, and up-to-date. As suggested in
   Section 3.4.1, follow a naming convention to identify the NASA
   Official, and maintain this convention throughout the site. Suggested
   naming conventions might be: NASA Official Responsible for Content:
   John Q. Public (john.q.public@nasa.gov) Page Content: John Q. Public
   (john.q.public@nasa.gov) NASA Point Of Contact: John Q. Public
   (john.q.public@nasa.gov) Where possible and/or applicable, consider
   using an HTML form to generate an e-mail response for the user. A form
   has the advantage of automatically encoding critical information (such
   as the URL of the page in question) and allowing the user to contact
   the site's NASA POC, regardless of whether or not this contact has an
   e-mail account. For more information on using forms for feedback, see
   Section 3.4.3 below. Design Tip: It is best practice to include a
   "mailto: " link to the site's responsible point of contact. You can
   create an e-mail alias (i.e., nasa_poc@nasa.gov) instead of using an 38
   individual's e-mail account. E-mail aliases help hide the "e-mail
   identity" of the site's POC and allows for the adding or removing of
   multiple POCs with modification to the site's mailto: link. 3.4.3
   Timely Response to Site Inquiries All site inquiries should be answered
   in a timely and accurate manner, and to the best of a person's or
   organization's ability. According to the Yale Style Guide
   (http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/contents.html) "Feedback also
   means being prepared to respond to your user's inquiries and
   comments.... Planning for this kind of ongoing relationship with the
   users of your site is vital to the long-term success of the
   enterprise." Respond to each e-mail inquiry with a personal response
   that acknowledges receipt of each inquiry and provides appropriate
   feedback. To provide users with quick and personal responses, use a
   feedback form to: * Help filter inquiries. Use radio buttons to ask the
   users if they expect a response. Some users just want to send the site
   curator comments. * Provide an immediate response to all users through
   a "canned e-mail" that is automatically sent by the script processing
   the form's information. * Provide users with the capability to select a
   subject of interest. The users' selections are sent electronically to
   personnel within an organization who respond quickly. This process
   distributes the responsibility of responding to inquiries to many
   people and organizations rather than placing the burden on one person.
   * Redirect users to a Frequently Asked Questions site. Here they may
   find answers to commonly asked questions. Tip: The people sending
   e-mail to your site deserve a quick and polite response. They don't
   know you have been asked the same question ten times this week, nor
   that you handle a thousand other web activities. No matter what your
   time constraints, always respond quickly and politely. Your response is
   a reflection on NASA and at all times must be clear, concise and civil.
   3.5 Hit Reporting Some sites require monthly NASA reports that may
   include these types of statistics: * Number of total hits 39 * Quantity
   of data delivered * Unique network IP addresses served These statistics
   provide information that shows user traffic patterns including: * The
   most popular pages on a site * Length of time a user spends on an
   individual page * Number of return visits to a particular site section
   * The path a user took through the information To obtain user
   information, find a web-hosting service provider that offers parsed log
   files that can be captured and analyzed on a regular basis. These tools
   are commercially available and offer a variety of useful reports on
   user preferences. Another approach is using web-hosting log reports
   that at minimum provide information on the basic "big three" web
   statistics: number of total hits, quantity of data delivered; and
   unique network addresses served. Detailed user information helps
   webmasters revise a site to reflect user preferences. Webmasters can
   use web statistics to restructure site information to facilitate
   traffic patterns. 40 4.0 Site Security NASA depends upon the WWW to
   disseminate information both internally to its employees and externally
   to the public. To maintain the integrity of NASA's information and
   systems, Agency information must be adequately protected yet readily
   available to all intended audiences. What are the elements that will
   make a web server secure? There are 5 critical security elements. Their
   order of importance will vary for each site, but the following criteria
   in this order are common to most sites: 1. Availability or "Can people
   get to my server?" 2. Privacy or "Is anyone eavesdropping?" 3.
   Authentication or "Who are you?" 4. Authorization or "Who is allowed to
   do what?" 5. Non-repudiation or "I know what you did, and you can't
   deny it." 4.1 Availability Availability simply means "can people get to
   my web site?" When users come to your site, they expect that link to
   work right-every time! Otherwise you've lost the user. Tip: Start with
   hardware. Use the best CPU, as much RAM as you can, the most disk
   space, and the fastest network connection you can get. Things to
   remember: 1. Hardware is cheap, compared to the labor for a workaround.
   2. Hardware will be obsolete next year anyway. 3. Load will only
   increase, never decrease. 4.1.1 Monitor Resource Usage Monitor your
   resource usage. Is the CPU idle or overworked? Is the network swamped?
   Are your disks filling with log files? Keep statistics on the usage of
   each resource over time so you notice what you're running out of, and
   at what rate. For starters, on UNIX try the vmstat , netstat , or sar
   commands. On Windows NT, right-click on the task bar, choose "Task
   Manager," and look at the "Performance" and "Processes" tabs. Tip: Use
   load balancing. If you've got more traffic than one machine can handle,
   use a pool of smaller, cheaper machines. Mirror the data so it's the
   same on all of them, or use a caching shared file system like AFS to
   replicate the data across machines. 41 4.2 Privacy Privacy is gauged by
   how easy it is for someone to eavesdrop on what the user and server
   send back and forth. You wouldn't want to send a credit card number to
   a server if that information could be read as it crossed the network.
   Likewise you don't want to download a sensitive or restricted document
   that might be viewable to the public. 4.2.1 Use Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL) Technology to Protect Information One way to increase privacy in
   a web transaction is to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
   There are many commercial sites that use SSL. This technology is being
   used whenever URLs appear with "https" (HyperText Transfer Protocol,
   Secure) instead of the "http," which is used for unsecure sites. The
   https uses SSL to encrypt the traffic between a web browser and a web
   server, even if the information can be seen by the user, it does not
   appear as legible text. SSL protects the information the user and
   server exchange. But what if the connection setup is intercepted? For
   example, you try to connect to microsoft.com, but your connection is
   hijacked by Dr. Evil, creating a private connection to Dr. Evil. Now
   all your information is sent to this site. To avoid information from
   being hijacked, use server certificates. Server certificates solve the
   issue of knowing who you're dealing with; for details, see Section 4.3,
   Authentication. Tip: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another way to
   increase privacy., VPNs encrypt all traffic, not just web connections.
   Because VPNs encrypt traffic between networks instead of individual
   machines, they are more applicable for intranets (connections within a
   company or Center). 4.3 Authentication Authentication means identifying
   both the user and server to ensure proper usage. A user wants to be
   sure a server is authentic before sending personal information like a
   credit card number. How do you really know that you are really
   connected to amazon.com and not some imposter? 4.3.1 Server
   Certificates Server certificates (digital letters of introduction) are
   installed on web servers. A Certificate Authority (CA) issues a
   certificate and signs it. When you go to a web site, the server's
   certificate is presented to your browser that authenticates the CA. 42
   There are several dozen CAs that most web browsers can authenticate.
   For instance, Netscape browsers trust the Netscape.com CA, and MS
   Internet Explorer browsers trust the Microsoft.com CA. VeriSign and
   Entrust are trusted companies as well. These certificates are used in
   SSL, described in Section 4.2, Privacy. Authenticating a user often
   requires a name and a password, though for some information it's enough
   to check that a web request is coming from a machine in a specific
   domain like the *.nasa.gov domain. Although not all-inclusive, here are
   three examples of web pages with different authentication needs: 1. A
   press release publishing science data results. The authentication
   decision here is moot, since the information is written for public
   release. 2. An internal mission status report. This information can be
   distributed throughout NASA, but not to the public. Checking that the
   request came from *.nasa.gov domain may be adequate. 3. A draft of a
   procurement RFP. This information is highly sensitive and only
   procurement team members should see it. You need some way to prove the
   requester is part of this team. Even in the first example, the decision
   not to check is still a decision. This is how most web servers act by
   default, yet many webmasters are still surprised when the information
   published can be read by 15-year-old Canadians. 4.3.2 Domain Name
   System Registration The second example, checking the requester's IP
   address or domain name, is commonly used even though it is a weak
   solution. This decision is better than nothing, but basically keeps out
   the honest people and not the serious hacker. Tip: Decide what set of
   addresses to give access. This can be by domain name, like the
   following: *.jpl.nasa.gov or *.nasa.gov It can also be by the actual IP
   number or subnet (range of IP numbers) like the following: 137.78.81.46
   or 137.79.* 43 If you use the name, each requester's machine must be
   properly registered in the Domain Name System (DNS) Registration. Tip:
   You can check whether an IP address is registered by giving the
   following command from any UNIX or Windows command prompt: nslookup
   198.116.142.34 This command will either tell you the machine's hostname
   or will report that the machine is not in the DNS; in the latter case
   the requester will have to fix the DNS. Tip: Domain authentication is
   risky at best, so use it only if you really don't care whether the
   information is published publicly. Or, combine it with the stronger
   authentication, as outlined below. 4.3.3 How to Authenticate Users In
   the third case, you really need to know who someone is. Greek soldiers
   guarding their camps and challenging strangers for "the password" had
   the same problem. All approaches and technologies boil down to the same
   thing: prove that you know something no one else could know, or that
   you possess some token (key, artifact, religious icon, etc.) no one
   else could have. There are several ways to challenge and authenticate
   users attempting to access your site. ß Username and Password . Most
   web servers allow you to create usernames and assign them passwords.
   Servers can also be configured to authenticate using other systems that
   manage passwords, like kerberos realms and NT domains. Train users to
   select good passwords, and configure your system to reject bad ones. A
   poor password can be easily guessed. Reject words in the dictionary,
   common names, etc. Make passwords expire every 6 months or so to force
   users to change them, and keep a history of previous passwords so the
   user doesn't repeat them. ß Digital Signatures. Use LDAP (Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol) authentication, or the NASA-wide PKI (Public
   Key Infrastructure), which is being developed by Ames Research Center.
   Contact the Ames team to find out how to use LDAP and PKI. ß Tokens.
   These are physical objects like a Secure ID, smartcard, floppy disk,
   fingerprint, or retinal scan that are used for authentication. 44 It is
   prudent not to rely on just one type of security measure. Passwords are
   often transmitted "in the clear" from browser to server, thus leaving
   passwords open to interception by hackers. It is astounding how many
   places software writers stash passwords for clear-text transmission.
   Therefore, in conjunction with passwords, you also may want to use SSL
   to establish an encrypted connection. 4.4 Authorization Authorization
   is also called "Access Control" and determines the privileges a user
   has on a system. It is important to identify users to determine their
   level of access. There are various ways to configure certain types of
   authorization on a web server. For example, web server configuration
   files like httpd.conf (Apache) can be set up by the administrator to
   allow or deny access to an entire web site. These files can also
   restrict the placement of a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script to
   reduce the risk of a dangerous program from being run on your server;
   in addition, the robots.txt file resides in the web server's document
   root and is used by automated search engines to determine whether to
   index pages on the web server. Directory configuration files like
   ".htaccess" (Apache, NCSA) and "nsconfig" (Netscape server) allow you
   to specify what pages, directories, etc. can be viewed by a particular
   IP address, domain, or name/password. These files are usually more
   specific than a site-wide file like httpd.conf. 4.4.1 Securing Servers
   Because web servers are the most visible targets for intruder
   break-ins, they need to be as secure as possible. Therefore you must
   minimize the means of unauthorized access. Here are some tips for
   securing servers: ß When a machine runs a web server, all other
   services should be disabled, including e-mail, finger, ping, telnet,
   and ftp (except maybe anonymous ftp, carefully configured). ß Web
   administrators should schedule periodic security scans by a trusted
   third party in order to identify security weaknesses as well as look
   for suspicious behavior like an attempt to access the old "ph" CGI
   program. ß Minimize your overall system risk by minimizing what the web
   server can do. Never run the web server as "root" or "administrator."
   Always create a new user account to run the server process, with no
   other privileges on the machine. 45 ß Use a shared file system like AFS
   or NFS and give the web server "Read Only" access, or mount the data
   disk "Read Only," or if the content rarely changes, burn it into a CD
   and serve the site from there. When the web server is compromised, an
   intruder still won't have the ability to modify data. Because employees
   come and go, authorization configurations must be changed as personnel
   changes. A new developer or manager must have access to important
   information that keeps the system running smoothly. Utilizing
   role-based authorization may be a good practice if there is frequent
   turnover of those requiring access to your site. Role-based
   authorization would list a group like "shuttle_pilots" on an ACL
   (Access Control List), rather than listing specific people. The group
   contains the individual users who have that job or work on a specific
   team. New personnel are added to the group and automatically have
   access to whatever the group has been granted. 4.5 Non-Repudiation
   According to Webster's Dictionary, one definition of "repudiate" means
   to reject as untrue or unjust. Basically, it is very important, in
   terms of site security, to keep good logs of your web server. Proper
   logs can provide sufficient proof of a user's activities by logging the
   actions of that user. For the most part, this is usually unnecessary
   unless there has been some questionable activity on the web server.
   Proper logging provides a means of non-repudiation for security
   officials in the event that someone has acted maliciously against your
   web server. Because log files can be tampered with or erased, a best
   practice is to keep all logs on another machine, or log files could be
   written to write-once media like a "write-only" compact disk. It is
   important to note, however, that there are certain guidelines on
   gathering and retaining information. Please be aware of the Children's
   Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)
   (http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/9910/childfinal.htm) and the NASA Chief
   Information Office (CIO) policy on retention of web logs found under
   the NASA Records Retention Schedule (http://www.sti.nasa.gov/nasarrs).
   The CIO web site points to item 13A for guidance on the retention of
   web logs. Item 13A is found on page 2-16 of the NASA Records Retention
   Schedule PDF file. Non-repudiation relies on authentication to know who
   someone is. Obviously if authentication is weak then so is your ability
   to know who's doing what. You always know what IP address was in each
   request because that's the destination where the information is
   supposed to be returned. 4.5.1 Non-Repudiation Tips 46 ß When possible
   and practical, log everything the web server does. Every server can
   keep a log of every access attempt sent to it, as well as every error
   it may have had. Keep all of the logs for a minimum of a year or as
   close to forever as you can. ß After time, log files can take up
   valuable server space. Develop a program or procedure to compress the
   log files periodically. The logs compress at about 10:1, meaning that a
   10 MB log file only takes 1 MB if compressed. Save the older log
   entries, compressed or not, somewhere else like to tape, JAZ or ZIP
   files or on another disk drive. 4.6 Current NASA Policy on Protecting
   Web Servers Procedures and guidelines for determining the appropriate
   measures necessary for protecting information and for determining
   protective controls required for computer systems that host web pages
   can be found in the NASA Policy Guideline 2810, "Procedures and
   Guideline for the
