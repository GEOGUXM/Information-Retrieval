   Information Resources Catalog

   Welcome to the Information Resources Catalog of the U.S. Department of
   Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT). Here you will find
   publications, videos, software and other information products and
   services for improving industrial energy efficiency and preventing
   waste and pollution.

   Many of these products are available online as Adobe Acrobat PDFs.
   Download Acrobat Reader. All products can be ordered from our Resource
   Room using an online order form, and are free of charge unless
   otherwise noted. Please, when possible take advantage of the online
   availability of our products to reduce our printing and distributions
   costs.

   To get started, select some documents using a "drill-down" view such as
   Industry and OIT Program (e.g. Aluminum, BestPractices, etc), or
   Product Category and Series (e.g. Aluminum fact sheets, OIT Times,
   etc.),

   To locate specific documents quickly, use the Alphabetical Index.

   Additionally, documents may be located using a free-form Key Word
   Search, which includes selections from the above searches.
