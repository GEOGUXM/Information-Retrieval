   customers. We are currently reviewing all web site pages to ensure that
         they meet or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the
     Rehabilitation Act. We appreciate your patience as we make our way
                            through this process.

   For more information on the Department of Transportation's Section 508
      Policy Statement, please visit the DOT Access page under General

                      Options for Converting PDF Files

   Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) files on the internet may
    not be accessible to those customers using screen reading devices. To
   assist users, Adobe Systems, Inc., provides a free translation service
    through their Access Adobe web pages (http://access.adobe.com) which
       will translate PDF files into html code. There are two ways to
                              accomplish this:
                      1. Web-based forms submission tool
                   (http://access.adobe.com/simple_form.html)
        Type the URL into an electronic form and select the "Get This PDF
       Document as HTML" button. The document will be converted on the fly
          to HTML and will be returned immediately to the Web browser.
    2. E-mail submission tool (http://access.adobe.com/access_email.html)
        Submit the URL of a PDF file via e-mail to convert it to HTML or
       ASCII text. PDF files that are on a local hard disk, local CD-ROM,
        or local area network, can also be converted by attaching the PDF
        file to an e-mail message. The converted results are returned in
             the body of a new mail message in a matter of minutes.

                             Contact Information

   If you are having difficulty accessing any of the pages or documents on
