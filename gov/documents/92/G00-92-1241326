   Welcome to the website of the Acadian-Pontchartrain study unit of the
   National Water Quality Assessment Program. The National Water Quality
   Assessment Program (NAWQA) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
   describes the status of the ground- and surface-water resources of the
   nation using a nationally consistent design. NAWQA investigates
   water-quality information on a wide range of spatial scales, local to
   national in scope, a range of climates and seasonal conditions, and a
   variety of water-quality issues that affect large areas of the Nation.
   NAWQA has identified and chosen to study agricultural pesticides,
   nutrients, trace metals, and volatile organic compounds in urban
   settings, among others. This program is unique compared to other
   national water-quality assessment studies in that it integrates the
   monitoring of the quality of surface and ground waters with the study
   of aquatic ecosystems, and seeks to understand how natural and human
   factors influence water quality.

   The goals of the NAWQA Program are to:
     * describe current water-quality conditions for a large part of the
       Nation's freshwater streams and aquifers (water-bearing sediments
       and rocks)
     * describe how water quality is changing over time
     * improve our understanding of the primary natural and human factors
       affecting water quality

   Our study area (also known as "study unit") covers drainages of the
   southern half of Louisiana, encompassing the Calcasieu, Mermentau,
   Vermilion-Teche, Verret, Terrebonne, Barataria, and Pontchartrain
   basins. Our studies include ground-water quality, general surface-water
   quality, contaminants in bed sediments and tissues, and biological
   surveys of fish, invertebrates, algae, and their habitats. As
   publications and data are produced, they can be found at this website.
