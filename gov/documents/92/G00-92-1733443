    Welcome to the World Wide Web site of the DWR Office of Water
    Education!
    This is part of our continuing efforts to educate people on the
        importance of water, how this limited resource can be properly
        used, and the need for its continued availability to California
        homes, businesses, industries, agriculture, and the environment.
        This Web site will continue to grow as we answer your questions
        about water, provide you with new information, and point you to
        other sources that we hope you will find useful.
