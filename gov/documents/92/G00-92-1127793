   FOR RELEASE: OCTOBER 19, 2001

   The Commission has received notice that American Classic Voyages Co.
   filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on
   October 19, 2001, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
   Delaware. American Classic Voyages Co. is the parent of American Hawaii
   Cruises, United States Lines, Delta Queen Steamboat Company and Delta
   Queen Coastal Voyages, all of which have suspended their cruise
   operations, except that the vessel DELTA QUEEN apparently will continue
   to operate.

   This cruise operator participates in the Commission's Public Law 89-777
   program as a self-insurer in accordance with the applicable provisions
   of the Commission's Rules (46 CFR 540.5(d)). Consequently, no bond or
   other third-party instrument exists to satisfy passenger claims for
   recovery of unearned passenger revenue.

   For affected individuals with claims, the Commission recommends the
   following steps:

     1. If payment was made by credit card, a claim should be placed
     immediately with the card issuer.

     2. If third-party travel insurance was obtained, a claim should be
     placed immediately with the insurer.

     3. A claim should be filed with the bankruptcy court, especially if
     payment was made by cash or check. You may contact the court at:

     United States Bankruptcy Court
