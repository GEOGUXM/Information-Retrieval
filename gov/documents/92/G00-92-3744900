   Employment Opportunities in the Office of the Legislative Counsel
     * Currently we are not seeking any new attorneys. From time to time
       we will place information in this space about any positions we need
       to fill. We also place postings on other internet job sites for
       attorney positions, and occasionally interview at law schools.
       While the process is very competitive, especially for the entry
       level attorney jobs, we endeavor to have an open, nation-wide
       recruiting system, so as to assure the best possible candidates are
       considered.
