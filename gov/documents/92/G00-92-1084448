                               OHRP-L LISTSERV
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has created a LISTSERV
   in order to provide interested individuals with information regarding
   human subject research protection, and upcoming educational workshops
   and other programs.

   The list is used for posting human subject research protection
   announcements only; it is not a discussion list. You may post an
   announcement for an upcoming workshop or conference, and our editor
   will review/OK it for inclusion.

   You may subscribe to the OHRP-L LISTSERV by sending an e-mail to:
        LISTSERV@LIST.NIH.GOV
   with the following text in the message body:
        SUBSCRIBE OHRP-L Firstname Lastname
   replacing Firstname and Lastname with your name.
   LISTSERV will get your e-mail address from the "From:" address of your
   e-mail message.

   If at anytime you wish to unsubscribe from the list send e-mail to:
        LISTSERV@LIST.NIH.GOV
   with the following text in the message body:
        UNSUBSCRIBE OHRP-L
