   The FMS Internet Credit Card Collections (ICCC) service faciliates the
   collection of many kinds of payments including fees, fines, and
   filings. In a typical deployment, the agency maintains its own web
   forms and FMS provides the online credit card processing component.
     * Agencies maintain web servers with catalogs and on-line "shopping
       carts"
     * Client shops or fills out payment forms on agency Web site
     * Client clicks "Pay" button and is linked to FMS server
     * FMS payment server executes FMS Internet credit card processing
       transaction with client
     * Obtains payment authorization / denial
     * Sends approval / denial message to client and agency
     * Authorized transactions are settled into Agency's specific
       "Internet Credit Card Collections" Account, generally within one
       business day

   Sometimes agencies ask why they can't set up their own Internet credit
   card collections service. The answer is, they can. However, the
   simplicity of e-commerce from a user standpoint masks the tremendous
   amount of planning, work, and resources that are required to offer the
   service. The agency must initially navigate a complex roadmap in order
   to develop the agreements with financial institutions. This can take
   months or years. Then the system must be developed, which includes
   security measures that have to meet stringent standards.

   Once the system is in place, the system must constantly be monitored
   and maintained. In addition, risk mitigation factors need to be at the
   forefront at all times to ensure that the system remains safe,
   reliable, and available. The ongoing responsibility of maintaining the
   site is neither trivial nor inexpensive. Furthermore, new and better
   ways of providing the technology must constantly be monitored and
   evaluated. (Visit the FMS Electronic Money Project page.)
