   Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation provides all aspects of the
   Flight System development, test, launch and mission support. The Launch
   Vehicle, a Boeing Delta II rocket, will deliver the Flight System into
   a yearlong earth-to-earth (heliocentric) orbit. The Flight System will
   then continue its journey taking only 6 months to intercept comet
   Tempel 1. The flight system is the entire package made up of the Flyby
   Spacecraft, Impactor, and three Instruments. The flyby spacecraft
   carries the High Resolution and Medium Resolution Instruments. The
   impactor with the Impactor Targeting Sensor will separate from the
   flyby spacecraft 24 hours before hitting comet Tempel 1. The impactor
   will relay comet images through the flyby spacecraft to Earth while
   targeting itself at the comet, ultimately impacting the comet while the
   flyby spacecraft documents the results.
