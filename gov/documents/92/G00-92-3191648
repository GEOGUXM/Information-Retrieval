                          Simulation and Modeling for Applied Decision Making
                          to Promote the Efficient Use of Resource Allocation

                                  Modeling and Simulation Conference

                                               June 1999
                                        Albuquerque, New Mexico


   Sandia National Laboratories along with the University of New Mexico
   will co-sponsor a conference on the present state of modeling and
   simulation and its future role in providing decision support tools.

   The conference will explore the history of the application of modeling
   and simulation to a wide range of problems. It will utilize a case
   study methodology that will be applied to governmental, business,
   medical, academic, and scientific applications, where it will document
   modeling and simulations successes, difficulties, and failures.

   The conference planners believe it is time to examine the possibilities
   and methods of the economics of complex systems behavior. The implied
   recognition is that complex systems somehow manage the allocation of
   its resources. In a living being this may involve the use of calories;
   in business it may be budgets and profits; in government it may be
   resource allocation tied to a budgetary process, rather than the rate
   of return based on budget allocation that is common in business.

   The conference will explore what has evolved, in terms of varied
   applications, through a broad, representative spectrum of academic
   disciplines and sectors of the economy. A discussion of the topic Can
   any simulation of complex feedback be made a substantially more
   complete representation of real processes if the resource allocation
   process is incorporated into the model/simulation? will also be
   explored.
