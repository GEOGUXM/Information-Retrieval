   Links With Errors draft-ietf-pilc-error-00.txt Comments from PILC
   Mailing List Morten Schläger: Include UDP recommendations Include
   recommendations about UDP over links with errors - disagree, because we
   don't know why UDP was chosen (recommendations about link-layer
   reliability may affect latency-sensitive apps like voice/video) Morten
   Schläger: Tag encrypted packets with flow tags Tag encrypted packets
   with flow tags, so encrypted port numbers aren't a problem - leaning
   toward disagreeing, because this deals with data coming from mobile
   device. Other direction is a bigger concern Lloyd Wood et al:
   Drop/severely qualify FEC/ARQ recommendation Drop or severely qualify
   FEQ/ARQ recommendations in section 2.4, taking into consideration
   satellite links - agree to qualify this recommendation Monday, July 11,
