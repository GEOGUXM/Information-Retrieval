   The snow depth measurement below does not represent snowfall and
   accumulation at lower levels on the mountain.This is a single point
   measurement on top of a peak that is scoured by winds. The siting
   criteria included: not being a danger to skiers; near a power source
   and other instrumentation on the adjacent tower; and, trees to provide
   a natural windbreak.
