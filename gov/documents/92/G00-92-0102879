                                    News

     * May 1, 2000: GSFC PAO issues a press release on OMNI.
     * May 1, 2000: Federal Computer Week runs three articles on the OMNI
       project:
          + NASA demos space Net
          + Setting satellites to network time
          + NASA's new "spacecraft" ideal for small families
     * Apr 14, 2000: OMNI project achieves another first. UoSat-12 becomes
       the first spacecraft to use NTP (Network Time Protocol) to
       synchronize it's onboard clock to a ground reference. This
       illustrates the ease with which many typical spacecraft operations
       can be implemented with off-the-shelf network applications once
       standard end-to-end IP connectivity has been established all the
       way to the spacecraft. Test data and results are available.
     * Apr 10, 2000: OMNI project successfully extends the internet to
       space by conducting the first on-orbit test of of a spacecraft as a
       node on the Internet! See the announcement for details.
       Test data and results are available.
     * Feb 28, 2000: OMNI project receives NASA National Resource Award
       (109KB)
     * Feb 14, 2000: CSC lets a contract to VyTek LLC to provide software
       and spacecraft services for first on-orbit test of IP to a
       spacecraft.
     * Nov 3-5, 1999: OMNI supports JSC Inspection Day '99 Technology
       Showcase buy providing live audio/video/telemetry from mobile OMNI
       van to the SOMO Technology Booth in the lobby of "mission control"
       in Houston.
     * Aug 11, 1999: OMNI provides realtime webcast of the last total
       Solar eclipse of the Millennium. Data is sent from a ship in the
       Black Sea over IP via NASA's TDRS satellite by using the OMNI
       prototype IP spacecraft lashed to the deck of the ship.
     * Feb, 1999: OMNI conducts first successful mobile test. The OMNI
       prototype spacecraft is mounted in a van and driven around GSFC
       while uplinking real-time telemetry data in IP over the NASA TDRS
       satellite. No CCSDS protocols are used at all.
