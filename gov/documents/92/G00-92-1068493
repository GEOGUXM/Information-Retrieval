      Description of research projects:

      Harvesting and post-harvest grading of fruit crops are very costly and
      labor intensive operations. The supply of a skilled labor force to
      accomplish these tasks is a primary concern of the U.S. Fruit Industry
      and labor shortages are occurring. An innovative harvester for fresh
      market quality apples grown on narrow trellises is being developed that
      is expected to improve labor efficiency, maintain high fruit quality,
      and reduce harvesting costs. A harvester for fresh market quality
      stemless sweet cherries is also under development. A harvester using
      the ARS direct-drive spiked-drum canopy shaker technology has been
      developed for process oranges and is being commercialized. In addition
      to improving harvest labor efficiency, this harvesting concept is
      expected to lower harvesting costs by 50% or more while maintaining
      quality. Nondestructive sensors and imaging techniques developed by ARS
      and Cornell University engineers to assess post-harvest quality of
      apples are being incorporated into an automatic in-line inspection
      system for sorting apples based on surface and internal defects. This
      inspection system is a commercial prototype and should lead to improved
      reliability and precision in grading apples both for processors and the
      fresh market.
