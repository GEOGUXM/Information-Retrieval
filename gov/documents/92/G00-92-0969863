   About MEMS at JPL
   What we do
   The Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Technology Group at JPL is
   a multi-disciplinary group pursuing advanced research into the
   development of a broad range of technologies primarily for NASA
   applications in the area of robotic planetary exploration. Some of the
   MEMS-based devices/micro-instruments being developed by the group
   include miniature (Micro and Meso) gyroscopes, Micro-propulsion
   systems, Micro-valves, Micro-coolers, LIGA-based devices (miniature
   quadrupole mass spectrometer and scroll pump), Adaptive Optics,
   Micro-inductors and Micro-instruments (Atmospheric Electron X-ray
   Spectrometer, Force Detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer).
   New thrust research areas are in the Nanotechnology and Biotechnology
   fields. The MEMS Group has recently struck up a collaboration with the
   Aerospace Corporation to develop an exciting, DARPA/AFRL-funded
   "PICOSAT" program aimed at the rapid, low-cost space testing of MEMS
   devices.
   How we do it
   End-to-end prototype development of these technologies is conducted at
   the Microdevices Laboratory (http://mdlwww.jpl.nasa.gov/), a 38,000 sq.
   ft. facility with over 5000 sq. ft of cleanrooms (class 10 Â– 100,000)
   and over 5000 sq. ft. of characterization laboratory space. The
   facilities include computer design and simulation tools, optical and
   electron-beam lithography, dry and wet etching facilities including
   deep reactive ion etching, metallization, wafer bonding, assembly and
   device testing facilities. The group has also put in a significant
   effort into developing a sophisticated infrastructure for LIGA (High
   aspect ratio, synchrotron x-ray lithography-based MEMS) development.
   Following the fabrication and assembly of the device prototypes,
   reliability testing of these devices is conducted to determine failure
   modes.
   Why we do it
   MEMS technologies are uniquely suited for diverse space applications
   since they offer the advantages of low mass, low power consumption,
   ruggedness and reliability, and in some cases providing new
   functionalities. These attributes only enable the micro-spacecraft of
   the future but also provide low-mass devices with high redundancy for
   conventional spacecraft applications.

   Technology Group, Dr. Thomas George.
