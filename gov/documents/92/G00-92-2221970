                           The SDO Rating System

                           Reception quality or audibility is subjectively rated using the SDO
   system with numbers ranging from 1 to 5.

   The best possible reception would be a 555 and the worst possible would
   be a 111 or 151. Examples

   S is for signal strength, D is for degradation and O is for overall
   merit.

   They are rated as follows:

   Signal strength Degradation Overall merit Note: We add 'comments' to
   degradation to indicate that it is caused by interference, local noise,
   jamming, hetrodyne, propagation, RTTY, etc. We encourage our monitors
   to identify interferers whenever possible so that we may determine if
   we should move or, based on coordination agreements and length of use,
   ask someone else to move.
   5 - excellent 5 - none 5 - excellent
   4 - good 4 - slight 4 - good
   3 - fair 3 - moderate 3 - fair
   2 - poor 2 - severe 2 - poor
   1 - nil 1 - extreme 1 - nil

   We use words to describe what the subjective levels of overall merit
   mean. Close attention to these usually forces a rating clearly into one
   catagory or another. 5 Excellent best possible shortwave reception, no
   more than slight degradation.
   4 Good can be tuned in easily and listened to without difficulty
   despite slight to moderate degradation.
   3 Fair can be listened to with difficulty.
   2 Poor only portions of the program heard because of weak signal or
   annoying degadation.
   1 Nil no IBB program heard.

   Here are some examples of how SDO works.

      We've pre-rated a few reception examples. You can look at how we rated
      the reception and listen to what it sounds like.

      You'll need the RealAudio Player or plug-in to hear these. It's free!

      [sphere03.gif] The first example is from our Remote Monitoring System
      (RMS) in Luanda. It is a 20 second sample of our Sao Tome mediumwave
      (1530 kHz) in English at 0314 UTC on July 1, 2001. 544 is one possible
      rating for this long-distance, over-salt-water, near-the-coast
      mediumwave reception.

      [sphere03.gif] The second example is from our Remote Monitoring System
      (RMS) in Tel Aviv. It is a 20 second sample of our Rhodes mediumwave
      (1260 kHz) in English at 0616 UTC on July 1, 2001. 444 is one possible
      rating for another long-distance, DAYLIGHT, over-salt-water,
      near-the-coast mediumwave reception.

      [sphere03.gif] The third example is from our Remote Monitoring System
      (RMS) in Quito. It is a 20 second sample of a VOA Spanish broadcast at
      1210 UTC on July 1, 2001. 232 is one possible rating for this poor
      reception of a broadcast actually meant for Central America.

      [sphere03.gif] The last example is from our Remote Monitoring System
      (RMS) in Phnom Penh. It is a 20 second sample of a RFA Vietnamese
      broadcast at 2339 UTC on July 1, 2001. 422 is one possible rating for
      this poor reception of a good signal due to jamming.
