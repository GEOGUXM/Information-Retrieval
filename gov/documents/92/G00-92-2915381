   Consumer Protection & Complaints
   ORAs presence in a variety of forums before the Commission (sometimes
   as the only consumer representative) helps to ensure that consumer
   interests are adequately represented and considered. ORA closely
   follows informal and formal complaints before the Commission to monitor
   patterns of individual consumer concerns.


   Filing a Complaint
   Complaints should be filed through the official complaint form on the
   California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)Web site. Or, you can also
   register complaints by contacting the Public Advisor at the CPUC.
