   NIH Guide: Using the TOC Notification
   LISTSERV Service

   Each week the NIH transmits via LISTSERV email the Table of Contents
   (TOC) information for that week's issue of the NIH Guide for Grants and
   Contracts. Associated with each TOC entry is the WWW address (URL) for
   each Guide article.

   To subscribe to the Guide TOC Notifcation LISTSERV service, please send
   us email and in the first line of the email message itself - not the
   "Subject" line - provide the following information:

                        subscribe NIHTOC-L your name

   where your name is the name you wish to use. Your email address will be
   automatically obtained from the email message you send to the LISTSERV.
                     ___________________________________

   To unsubscribe to the Guide TOC LISTSERV, please send us email and in
   the first line of the email message itself - not the "Subject" line -
   provide the following information:

                            unsubscribe NIHTOC-L

   Your email address will be automatically obtained from the email
   message you send to the LISTSERV.

   Note:   The email address of the NIH LISTSERV is listserv@list.nih.gov,
   and the name of the Guide TOC service is "NIHTOC-L". Use this address
   if you have to send subscription related commands to the LISTSERV using
   an email software package that is not part of a web browser. Note also
   that the LISTSERV may sometimes require email confirmation of a
   subscription related command, which will result in your having to send
   2 email commands to complete the service request. More information on
   using the NIH LISTSERV can be obtained from the NIH LISTSERV FAQ page.

   If you are going to change your email address, please unsubscribe from
   the LISTSERV using your old email address. Then re-subscribe using your
   new email address. The NIH will not be able to administer email changes
   for you - please do so yourself.
