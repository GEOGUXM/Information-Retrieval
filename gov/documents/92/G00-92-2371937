   Notices of contract actions that appear in the CBD are arranged by
   classification codes. Classification codes are divided into two primary
   groups; Services and Supplies. Listed below are the titles and examples
   of the service codes.

   Please be aware that the CBD staff is not authorized to determine the
   classification code for any notice. Only the Contracting Officer who
   issued the notice is authorized to determine the classification code.
   Therefore, the Contracting Officer is held responsible if a notice of a
   contract action is misclassified, and as a result fails to effectively
   notify the firms most likely to respond and violates the Competition in
   Contracting Act. For additional information see Comptroller General
   Decision No. B-228774, dated November 12, 1987.
