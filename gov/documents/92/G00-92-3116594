   . The GRPIS (Governmentwide Real Property Information Sharing) Program
   exists to foster better communication and information sharing among
   Federal Agencies within a community. The primary goal is to encourage
   real property professionals from Federal agencies to network and
   communicate with each other through the formation of local real
   property councils.

   The Office of Real Property has used a series of site visits,
   interviews and meetings to identify best practices and other useful
   information to be shared among agencies. This information has been the
   basis for forming collaborative working relationships among Federal
   partners. Many of the topics of interest may also be useful to agencies
   in other communities.

   GRPIS Councils currently operate in the Puget Sound area of Washington
   State, South Florida, New England, Arizona, New Mexico, and Kansas
   City.
