                        A Brief Photographic History of
               JPL's Development of the Table Mountain Facility

     The Headquarters Building of the Table Mountain Facility as seen in
     May 1987. This building houses the resident staff member offices,
     kitchen and dormitory accomodations for all visiting science users
     and a library/conference room. Staff members include the facility
     operations manager, the resident astronomers and Lidar manager. Some
     dormitory accommodations include office space for extended users.

     In a remote location with excellent viewing conditions and fine
     transparent skies, the Table Mountain Facility is increasingly
     sought after as a site for scientific investigation of the earth's
     atmosphere, solar radiation, and solar system astronomy. Formally
     known as the Table Mountain Observatory, the name reflects a greater
     diversity of current operations and programs.

     Table Mountain is located in the San Gabriel Mountains at an
     elevation of 7500 feet. Although remote, the facility is only an
     80-mile drive from Los Angeles. The Smithsonian Institution
     established the 'observatory' in 1926, and the Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory acquired the USFS lease permit for the site in 1962. The
     following pictures show the progression of the site's development
     from 1961.

   The above photograph, dated in the fall of 1961, shows one of the
   original residence buildings used when Smithsonian occupied the
   mountain.

   This and the following picture were taken late in 1961 during a site
   survey JPL conducted to determine the feasibility of using Table
   Mountain for an astronomical observatory. The picture above shows the
   main residence that was used by the Smithsonian site resident observer.
   The picture below shows the 'bunker' used by the solar irradiance
   equipment for the Smithsonian measurements during the 1920-50 time
   period.

   The above photograph, looking ESE, shows the solar panel testing
   operation by JPL in May, 1962. JPL had been using the site on a limited
   basis to test spacecraft solar panels in the late 50's and early 60's.
   JPL acquired the lease permit from the United States Forestry (USF) in
   the spring of 1962, and purchased the facility buildings left by
   Smithsonian which were in remarkably good repair.

   A 16-inch optical telescope had already been purchased, so plans were
   drawn up for the first new building JPL would add to the site. Known as
   'TM-1', the observatory building to house the telescope was completed
   in July, the telescope was placed into operation, and initial tests
   (first light) were conducted on August 1.

   The following pictures show the building under construction (1), and
   Charles F. Capen, Jr., testing the drive mechanism for the telescope
   (2) just before the initial tests were conducted.
