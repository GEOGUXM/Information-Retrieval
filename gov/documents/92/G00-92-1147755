   Provided by the Bureau of Administration (A/RPS/IPS)

   Point of Contact
   The Office of IRM Programs and Services -- or IPS for short -- is the
   primary point of contact for anyone seeking access to Department of
   State records.

   Records Management
   IPS serves as the Records Manager for the Department of State, with
   responsibility for the U.S. Governments foreign policy archives, a
   unique historical collection of international significance.

   Compliance Issues
   IPS is responsible for ensuring that the Department of State is in
   compliance with a wide range of statutory and administrative
   requirements, including the Federal Records Act, FOIA and EFOIA laws,
   the Privacy Act, Executive Order 12958, and Ethics in Government.

   Information Access Programs
   IPS administers the Department of States information access programs
   and responds to requests from an extremely wide and diverse group of
   customers, including the foreign affairs and national security
   community, the Congress, the courts, foreign governments and the
   public.

   Records Searching
   IPS performs systematic, comprehensive and complex searches for
   information in those records -- including electronic records -- which
   are still in the physical custody of the Department.

   Information Technology
   IPS is leading the way in developing and applying new information
   technology to records management and information access programs in
   support of U.S. diplomacy.
