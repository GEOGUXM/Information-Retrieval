   "I am committed to tearing down the remaining barriers to equality that
   face Americans with disabilities today. My New Freedom Initiative will
   help Americans with disabilities by increasing access to assistive
   technologies, expanding educational opportunities, increasing the
   ability of Americans with disabilities to integrate into the workforce,
   and promoting increased access into daily community life."
