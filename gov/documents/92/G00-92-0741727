   Subject:     Policy for Allowing Nongovernment Users to Access National
   Weather Service Radar Data

   Purpose.

       It is our policy to encourage the dissemination and effective use
   of radar data through such channels as private meteorologists,
   industry, cable television, and television broadcasting for public use.
   With the increased number of nongovernment owned digital radar remoting
   transmitters being installed in our offices, it is necessary to have a
   policy to define the responsibilities of the National Weather Service
   (NWS) and the radar remoting users. The user need not necessarily be
   the owner of the equipment but is, nevertheless, responsible for proper
   operation of the equipment.

   To install a non-NWS owned radar remoting system to an NWS radar, the
   following must be accomplished by the user before the installation of
   any equipment is authorized.

    a. Apply in writing requesting access to the radar system. Application
       letters should be addressed to the appropriate Regional Director
       and should state the type of equipment to be installed at which
       radar site(s), what use will be made of the remoted radar
       information, and the qualifications of the people providing radar
       image interpretation.
    b. Agree to and complete, the AGREEMENT FOR ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION
       OF NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RADAR DATA. See Attachment A. Return
       the certified original and two copies of proposed agreement within
       30 calendar days of receipt. Attachment B is a sample cover letter
       to be sent to users with Attachment A.
    c. Prepare an installation proposal showing the location of  the
       equipment to be installed in the government quarters and the
       routing of  cable and conduit. All installation proposals must be
       coordinated with the local official charge at each radar site and
       approved by the chief of the regional Engineering Division.
       Equipment should be sent to users with Attachment installed within
       90 calendar days of receipt of fully executed copy agreement.
       Connections to NWS equipment must be coordinated through the
       appropriate NWS Area Electronics Supervisor (AES). NWS policy
       regarding the location of nongovernment owned radar remoting
       equipment in NWS offices is that the equipment should be located in
       air conditioned space if available.
    d. The user must provide, install, and maintain a National Weather
       Service Headquarters approved isolation distribution equipment
       (IDE), if not already provided. This is required even if no other
       radar remoting systems are installed on the radar so as to reduce
       the possibility of damage or interference to the radar.
    e. The user must provide and maintain the monitor system required in
       B.2 of the agreement if not provided by another user. The monitor
       must have a 19-inch diagonal measure picture tube or larger and
       must be capable of continuously displaying the remoted radar data
       available to the user whether the user is projecting the image or
       not.

       Monitoring equipment will not normally be installed at WSMO's. In
   the case of remoting installations at these sites, the site location of
   the monitoring equipment will be designated by the Regional Director
   after consulting with Area Managers.

       The location of the monitoring equipment within the office selected
   will be determined by the meteorologist/official in charge. However,
   this should be coordinated with the responsible AES.

       Approval of non-NWS owned radar remote systems at all radar sites
   is based on a first come, first served basis and is contingent on
   availability of space in government owned quarters. If space is not
   available in government quarters, it will be the responsibility of the
   user to arrange for space for the remoting equipment.

       To meet the interpretation requirements as stated in B.5 of the
   agreement, cable television users can furnish the NOAA Weather Radio
   audio on the channel the radar is displayed.

       Also, to prevent continuous display of old radar data, CATV users
   are required to automatically clear their display once an hour. This
   prevents continuous display of stored data whenever service to the
   transmitter is broken or when radar service has been terminated.

       To eliminate errors in the electronic map overlays, we recommend
   the maps be prepared from Lambert Conformal Conic Projections with
   standard parallel nearest the location of the radar site. Road or
   highway maps are not suitable for preparing electronic maps. Copies of
   paper radar charts can be requested from the radar station concerned.

       All telephone line terminations in National Weather Service offices
   must be in the NWS-Telco demarcation panel. It will be the
   responsibility of the radar remote transmitting equipment owner to make
   the final wiring and signal line terminations to the transmitting
   equipment.

   NWS Monitoring Responsibility.

       Quality control of transmitted radar information must be done, as
   described below, if the monitor is collocated with the radar or if the
   monitor is remote from the radar. For collocated equipment, it should
   be straightforward for one person to do the comparison. If the monitor
   is remote from the radar, then a phone conversation is required between
   the radar operator and someone at the location of the remote monitor.
   Procedures for carrying out the quality control effort between radar
   operators and personnel at the location of the remote monitor should be
   mutually agreed upon.

       Each station responsible for quality control of a color digital
   radar remoting system must maintain a log with entries to verify when
   the quality control procedure was accomplished and by whom. If problems
   are present, they must be described in the log, along with what action
   was taken. Each monitoring station should include in its log the phone
   numbers to call for repairs when problems are noted.

       Monitor the remoted display to assure the display is consistent
   with echoes on the NWS radarscope (PPI). Monitors should be checked at
   least once every 8-hour shift at locations where the monitoring
   equipment is located on site with the radar equipment. Where the
   monitor is located at a remote location from the radar, the remoting
   system should be checked once daily and whenever a malfunction is
   suspected. Remotely located monitors should be checked by whatever
   means that are available (WBRR, RRWDS, SD's, and other brands of
   remoting equipment). Also, obtain from the radar site the geographical
   locations, intensities, and coverage of echoes that can be easily
   located on the radar display and the location of echoes that can be
   isolated.

   Tolerances allowed:

    1. Geographical location, errors no more than +10 kilometers within
       230 kilometers of the radar station and no more than +15 kilometers
       between 230 and 450 kilometer range. This can be checked using the
       map background and the D/VIP test pattern and isolated echoes.
    2. Intensity levels.

     VIP Level 1 -- The remote system should display no more than +20
     percent echo coverage of VIP Level 1 as compared with the radar PPI.
     At Locations that are remote from the radar site this can be
     determined by measuring the extent of the Level 1 display along a
     selected azimuth and determining from the radar operator the extent
     of the Level 1 displayed on the PPI.

     VIP Levels 2 through 6 -- The intensity level displayed on the
     remoting system must be the same as displayed on the PPI.

    3. The following will be checked and appropriate entries logged each
       shift by the radar operator. Check azimuth readout on IDE in each
       quadrant. Check clock on the IDE or the transmitter and reset if
       necessary. The clock should be set to GMT. Check elevation
       indicator against the radar console readout. No more than 1 degree
       difference is allowed.

       Deviations approaching those listed above require notifying the
   user for corrective actions, but the remoting system can be allowed to
   continue to operate with monitoring for the above tolerance done each 8
   hours.

       Deviations that exceed those specified above require notifying the
   user immediately and terminating service until the fault is corrected.
   Termination is accomplished by turning off power to the transmitter or
   disconnecting the telephone signal lines.

       In general, NWS electronics technicians (el techs) are not
   authorized to make repairs or adjustments to radar remoting systems
   owned by others. The el tech's function is to determine that radar
   signals presented at the interface to the remoting system are correct.

   THIS AGREEMENT is entered into on this ______ day of  ________19__
   between the United States of America, Department of   Commerce,
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather
   Service, hereinafter referred to as "NWS," and

   data are not transmitted. The User is required to participate in NWS
   quality control procedures.

           (c)    That the monitor must make available, continuously, the
   color radar image. NWS has the authority to tap into the remote radar
   signal at any point in the transmission of this signal from the NWS
   Office into the facilities of the User. Any NWS Office has the right to
   dial into any existing coupler connected to NWS radars. NWS will be
   provided with the proper phone numbers to use. Sufficient electronic
   overlays of geographic features are to be included on the monitor.

       (d)     To assure that the monitor is properly maintained. Such
   maintenance shall include adjustments, installation of parts, etc., and
   will be provided promptly upon request from the NWS since continuation
   of this service by the NWS is dependent on proper maintenance. An
   address and phone number for obtaining this service will be supplied to
   the NWS. In this case, the address and phone number is (to be completed
   by User).

       (e)     That the monitor will be placed in a location selected by
   NWS. In this case, it is the weather office at
   _______________________________________________________________.

   .3.    To provide and maintain a National Weather Service Headquarters
   approved isolation distribution equipment (IDE) if not already provided
   by another user. This is required even if no other radar remoting
   systems are installed on the radar and is intended to reduce the
   possibility of damage or interference to the radar.

   4.    To give full credit and identification of any interpretations of
   the images on the radarscope that are furnished by NWS personnel and to
   take due care to avoid the implication that interpretations by others
   are those of NWS.

   5.    That all images on the radarscope to be conveyed to the public
   shall be accompanied with an interpretation of the display as provided
   by an employee of NWS or by a professional meteorologist who is
   experienced in the interpretation of storm detection radar and has the
   qualifications for membership in the American Meteorological Society,
   or by NOAA Weather Radio broadcast. All such interpretations must be
   based on a radar image that is within l hour of the time of the
   televised image. The User must specify or display the time of the
   image. The User's equipment must visibly specify the correct time of
   the image displayed, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and, if possible, the
   date. It is the User's responsibility to know the time of the image
   being transmitted and the time of the image which is the basis for the
   interpretation. Users that are providing radar images continuously to
   the public shall assure that the radar images are never more than l
   hour old. User agrees to standardize VIP levels and colors assigned to
   VIP levels, to NWS specifications, to avoid confusion to the public.

   6.    That if any advertisement or telecasts are involved, proper
   acknowledgement be given to the public that the video display is from
   the NWS radar at ______________________ (or other location, if
   appropriate). The acknowledgment must be oral or visible. If electronic
   sweep is used, the origin must be centered at the location of the NWS
   radar display.

   7.    That if TV broadcasts are involved, no visual commercial message
   shall be superimposed on the picture of the NWS radarscope at any time;
   that there shall be nothing in the announcements associated with
   telecasts to indicate or imply that NWS endorses any commercial product
   advertised.

   8.    To hold the United States Government, its officers, agents, and
   employees free from liability for any loss or damage to User property
   installed to carry out this Agreement.

   9.    To pay all costs and expenses resulting from this Agreement,
   except electrical energy when furnished by NWS under subparagraph
   (A.l.b.) above.

   Attachment B

       In accordance with your request for tie-in to WSR- Radar at
   ________________________, I have enclosed an original and two copies of
   the "Agreement for Access to and Distribution of National Weather
   Service Radar Data," to be signed by your company. All signed copies
   are to be returned to me. One copy will be sent back to you after final
   validation.

       It is important you understand that proper radar interpretation may
   affect the lives of thousands of people. Misinterpretation of  radar
   depictions could result in either false alarm or no alarm -- both of
   which could have serious effects on the National Weather Service's
   warnings.

       In regard to Article B.13, it will be up to the Users involved to
   work out agreements where it is desired or necessary to use a common
   transmitter. However, agreements such as the enclosed between the
   National Weather Service and any additional Users are also required.

       The National Weather Service requires a separate monitor for each
   transmitter attached to its radars. The monitors will be installed at
   an office specified by NWS. This is covered in paragraph B.2.a-e under
   Responsibilities. A monitor must be able to present continuously to the
   NWS the radar image available to the User whether it is being used or
   not. In consideration for space and/or electricity or monitoring
   service provided by the Government, the monitor shall be provided at no
   cost to the Government. The User providing the monitor is responsible
   for having it maintained and kept properly adjusted. In this case, a
   monitor provided by your firm would be installed at the Weather Service
   Office at

       You are required to provide us with the name and phone number of
   the person responsible for maintaining the transmitter and monitor.

       An installation proposal shall be approved by the NWS regional
   headquarters prior to actual installation of equipment. The proposal
   shall show the location of the equipment to be installed in Government
   quarters and the routing of cable and conduit. Personnel of the User
   and/or installer of the remoting equipment shall not enter NWS quarters
   containing radar equipment without permission of the station manager or
   electronics technician. Installation of the equipment must be performed
   in the presence of an NWS electronics technician.

       If there are any problems or questions about the radar, you may
   contact __________________________ Meteorologist in Charge (MIC) of
   ______________________ phone number ______________________ . Our
   regional headquarters staff can also be contacted for information by
   calling _______________________________________________ phone number
   ____________________________.
