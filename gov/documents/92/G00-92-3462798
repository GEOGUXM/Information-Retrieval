   The NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER conducts fishery and marine resource
   research supporting NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
   Pascagoula Laboratory in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The ship collects
   fish and crustacean specimens using trawls and benthic longlines and
   fish larvae and eggs, and plankton using plankton nets and surface and
   midwater larval nets. The GUNTER will normally operate in the Gulf of
   Mexico and Caribbean Sea. The vessel is operated by the Office of
   Marine and Aviation Operations.

   GORDON GUNTER was originally built as the U.S. Naval Ship RELENTLESS
   (T-AGOS 18) in 1989 by Halter Marine in Moss Point, Mississippi.
   RELENTLESS was operated by the Military Sealift Command as an Ocean
   Surveillance Ship until her transfer to NOAA on March 17, 1993.

   The RELENTLESS was commissioned as the NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER on
   August 28, 1998, in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The GUNTER is named after
   Dr. Gordon Gunter.

   GUNTER was converted to her present configuration, through two intense
   repair periods, begining in March, 1998. The ship was fit out with
   modern navigation electronics and oceanographic winches, sensors, and
   sampling equipment. A custom designed marine mammal observation and
   survey station was installed. Significant modifications were also made
   to the mission-dedicated laboratory spaces with the installation of
   wet, dry, chemistry, and electronic lab space equipment. Modifications
   were made to provide the ability to collect fisheries research data by
   stern trawling, longlining, and other types of gear. The ship was also
   mechanically overhauled for her return to service, including the four
   main diesel generators, the propulsion machinery, and all of the ship's
   motors, pumps, and compressors. Upon completion, GUNTER has
   demonstrated the economic compromise between the ideal construction of
   a fisheries research vessel and a low-cost conversion to a fit
   replacement vessel. GORDON GUNTER will continue to serve while NOAA
   adds new, custom built, world class fisheries research vessels to its
   fleet.

   The GORDON GUNTER, in cooperation with the Pascagoula Laboratory,
   offers seagoing opportunities to individuals through the Seagoing
   Cooperator Program. This program is designed for those individuals
   interested in marine science who want to obtain hands-on experience
   participating in a research cruise.
