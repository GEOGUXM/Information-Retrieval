                     Real-Time Simulation Documentation

   Technical documents pertinent to real time simulation are often
   requested from the Simulation Experiments Branch at NASA Ames Research
   Center. You can find certain of these documents in pdf format by
   visiting our Real-Time Simulation page. Most of these documents have
   been previously published by NASA; others are NASA-copyrighted "working
   papers." Please be aware that these documents were created with Adobe
   Acrobat 4.0 and are not accessible to screen readers for the visually
   impaired. We will make these documents screen-reader accessible as soon
   as we have access to Acrobat 5.0. In the meantime, if you would like us
   to send you a hardcopy of the documentation, please contact
   kstarmer@mail.arc.nasa.gov

   The technology represented in these documents is generally available to
   users of the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research
   Center, and instances have occurred where the aircraft industry has
   come to our facility with compliant models. This has been especially
   true where the technology resulted from applied research on simulation
   models provided in our partnership with the aircraft industry, notably
   with Boeing, Bell, and Sikorsky.

   Technical reviews of these papers are always welcome. Especially of
   interest are any comments concerning the utilization of this material
   and any suggestions concerning its improvement or expansion. Please
   contact Richard McFarland at rmcfarland@mail.arc.nasa.gov
