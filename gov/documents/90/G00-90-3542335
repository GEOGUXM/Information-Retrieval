   Latest Solar Image, link to large image Full Disk H-alpha image of the
   sun received Jan 28 at 14:51 UTC from Holloman AFB. (Large size image
   512x480 pixels, 8 bpp)

   The complex dynamics of the Sun, and many prominent solar features are
   evident in images taken in the H-alpha wavelength. Additional images
   from 1998 to today are online.

  3-day Solar-Geophysical Forecast issued Jan 29 at 22:00 UTC

   Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be moderate.
   Region 9800 does have the potential to produce an isolated major flare.

   Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected to be
   at quiet to unsettled levels.

Solar X-ray Flux

   3-day Solar Xray Flux graph

   This plot shows 3-days of 5-minute solar x-ray flux values measured on
   the GOES 8 and 10 satellites.
   Click on the plot to open an updating secondary window. Black
   background version.
   An updating 6-hour 1-min Solar X-ray Flux plot is also available.
   See D-region Absorption page for affects of solar x-rays.

Satellite Environment Plot

   3-day Satellite Environment graph and image map.

   The Satellite Environment Plot combines satellite and ground-based data
   to provide an overview of the current geosynchronous satellite
   environment. Click on a data panel to open an updating secondary
   window. An updating Satellite Environment Plot window is also
   available.

   Although these data are of interest to the satellite community, they do
   not include all parameters and energy ranges known to be associated
   with satellite anomalies. See related information from the NOAA POES
   satellite -- Auroral Activity Estimates, Relative Intensities of
   Energetic Particles, and Solar Protons.
