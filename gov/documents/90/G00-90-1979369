Background Studies

   This file catalogs background studies prepared for the Commission. The
   Commission's work on a recommendation typically begins after a
   background study has been prepared -- usually by a specialist in the
   field, who is retained as a consultant, or by a member of the
   Commission's staff. Many prominent law professors and members of the
   Bar have served as Commission consultants over the years.

   Some background studies are available in electronic form and are in the
   related subject folder in the FTP Directory or in the Printed Report
   Directory. The names of background study files start with "BKST-",
   followed by an indication of the general subject covered. The "811"
   notation in a file name indicates it is in 8.5 x 11 page format, not
   the 6 x 9 format of our printed reports.

   This table lists printed background studies prepared for the
   Commission. Citations are to the volume and page (V:p) of the bound
   volumes of the Commission's printed reports. The "Pamph" citations
   indicate the beginning page of the original pamphlet that was bound
   into the hardcover volume. See the publications list for a complete
   list of Commission publications. Recent background studies may be
   downloaded in Adobe Acrobat format.

           Photocopy and Mimeograph Editions of Background Studies

   Background studies usually appear first in photocopy form (on 8.5 x 11
   pages) or in mimeograph form before 1979. Studies are circulated for
   analysis and comment to interested persons before being considered by
   the Commission. Typically, the consultant or staff will present the
   background study at a Commission meeting, where initial policy
   decisions are made.

   Studies are almost always forwarded to the Commission in the form of an
   attachment to a memorandum. In the table below, the number of the
   forwarding memorandum is given in the last column.

   The consultant may revise the background study before it is printed,
   perhaps in response to issues raised by commentators and the
   Commission. The study may then be published in a law review or in the
   Commission's reports, usually in connection with a Commission
   recommendation. If a background study is printed, the final printed
   study supersedes the original version. In the table below, a citation
   is given in brackets where studies have been printed.

   In some cases, however, the study is not printed, and the final version
   is the photocopy (or mimeo).

   Recent background studies may be downloaded in Adobe Acrobat format.
