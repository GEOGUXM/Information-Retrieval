   NEW SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS REFLECT CHANGES IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY
   POPULATION

   Following a series of five public hearings and five public meetings of
   a county redistricting committee, the San Bernardino County Board of
   Supervisors on August 14, 2001 gave final approval to a redistricting
   plan that reflects shifts in the county's population recorded by the
   U.S. Census.

   The law requires the Board to redraw each of its five districts to
   ensure that each contains an equal number of residents. 2000 Census
   data released earlier this year pegged the countys population at
   1,709,434, meaning that each of the countys five supervisorial
   districts should contain about 341,887 residents.

   To achieve this, the Board had to make only minor changes to the
   previous boundaries. The most significant changes moved Wrightwood from
   the Second to First district, moved Joshua Tree and a portion of the
   Twentynine Palms Marine Base from the First to Third district, unified
   Highland within the Third District, and moved the Fifth District
   further west in Fontana.
