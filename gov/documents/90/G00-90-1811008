   NEWYEAR

   This is the first SandyGRAM of the new year, so let me take this
   opportunity to wish everyone a happy and healthy 2002. I know we all
   hope and pray that in the world this is a better and more peaceful year
   than 2001 turned out to be.
       As for the VA and our medical center, theres lots going on and lots
   of activity. In the VA as a whole, as Im sure youve heard, Dr. Tom
   Garthwaite, our Under Secretary for Health, has accepted a job on the
   West Coast and will be leaving in the next few weeks. The President has
   announced his intention of nominating Dr. Robert Roswell, the VISN
   Director of VISN 8, to be the new Under Secretary for Health.
   Hopefully, his nomination will move quickly through Congress and before
   long, we will have our new Under Secretary in place. We certainly wish
   him the best of luck and look forward to his starting in his new
   position.
       Virtually everything else on the national scene appears to be
   rumors, including lots of discussion of possible reorganization of the
   VISN structure into a fewer number of VISNs and other possible changes
   for VA and VHA.
       On the local front, we begin a year that is clearly going to be a
   challenging one. For one thing, come approximately next November we
   will have our visit by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of
   Hospitals (JCAHO). That means that in the coming months, we will be
   doing lots and lots of preparation for that visit. I would urge all of
   you to begin to get involved and ask questions to ensure you are up to
   speed on all the issues surrounding a JCAHO visit. As you know, the way
   medical centers are reviewed now by the Joint Commission, any employee
   may be asked questions on numerous issues from patient safety to
   training to whatever other areas of interest the JCAHO surveyors may
   have. So, please make sure that you are up to date on these issues.
       Another major issue facing our medical center is our budget.
   Although we received an increase to our budget this year, it was not of
   the magnitude that we have received in previous years and we must be
   extremely prudent in our allocation of resources. Services have been
   asked to restrain their spending levels where possible, and hiring is
   being limited. Also, we're looking at other, more significant,
   programmatic changes that could result in resource savings.
       Next month, our medical centers strategic plan is due to our VISN.
   We have done lots of work on the plan, which focuses on the themes of
   quality, satisfaction, and cost effectiveness. In the area of quality,
   we are looking to include areas such as assuring that providers and
   staff have the necessary information, knowledge and systems, assuring
   that patients receive care in a safe and secure environment, and
   maintaining our commitment to academics and research. In the area of
   satisfaction, we are looking at developing and implementing a
   comprehensive medical center service program and creating a health care
   environment characterized by courteous and coordinated patient focused
   services. In the area of cost effectiveness, were reviewing our
   alignment of available resources to maximize benefits for veterans and
   maximizing the internal and external revenue sources. Those are just
   some of the areas that are being viewed and staffed out to assure that
   we have a strategic plan that meets the needs of our patients and staff
   for the future.
       Finally, I cant help but think as we enter the new year that one of
   the issues raised on the employee surveys that we did during the past
   several months was the fact that it seems that we often react to a
   crisis rather than anticipating some of them. I like to think that we
   do anticipate some of them, but when I think of last year and think of
   all the unknowns that we still have as we face this year, I must say
   that no matter how much planning we do, and we do a lot of it, no
   matter how many times we go through our strategic plan and refine our
   strategic planning process, and we do that often, no matter how much we
   talk about being in control of the situation in much the same way that
   you commented on during the employee surveys, it is a difficult thing
   to do. And while there are many areas from planning for the Joint
   Commission, to how we distribute our budget dollars, to planned changes
   that were making in various other medical center processes, it is very
   difficult to anticipate what the future will bring.
       If theres one thing that we learned in the year 2001, it is that
   the only thing that is sure is what an unsure world we live in. And,
   unfortunately, that applies to a great extent to our little world of VA
   Medical Center in Washington, DC as well. I assure you that we are
   sensitive to your concerns and we will do everything we can to see that
   we work together to be in as much control of our future and as little
   of a crisis mode as we can in 2002. Have a great year!
