   Missions

   For the first time in history, humanity is on the verge of having the
   technological capability to explore age-old questions about our cosmic
   origins and the possibility of life beyond Earth.

   Even with the best talents and technologies available, our plans are
   ambitious and daring. To collect faint light from the first-ever
   galaxies and from Earth-sized planets around distant stars, we would
   essentially need telescopes the size of Texas. We haven't achieved that
   capability here on Earth, let alone in space, and even if we could do
   it, the effort would triple the national debt.

   Our Family of Missions

   That's why the Origins Program has embarked on a series of closely
   linked missions that build on prior achievements. As each Origins
   mission makes radical advances in technology, innovations will be fed
   forward, from one generation of missions to the next. By the end of the
   decade, we will have combined the very best imaging, formation flying,
   and other visionary technologies, giving us the power of enormous
   telescopes at a fraction of the cost.

   Support for these missions is provided by the Interferometry Science
   Center (ISC), a science operations and analysis service sponsored by
   the Origins theme and operated by the California Institute of
   Technology. The ISC facilitates timely and successful execution of
   projects that use interferometry, a key technology in the Origins
   Program.

   While the majority of Origins efforts are focused on developing
   space-based observatories above Earth's atmosphere, investigations on
   the ground pave the way for future achievements in orbit. Join us in
   learning more about the remarkable Origins family of missions, the
   questions they seek to answer, and the technologies that will make it
   all possible.
