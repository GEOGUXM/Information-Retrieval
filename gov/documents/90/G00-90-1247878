   Exemptions and Approvals



   The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety
     __________________________________________________________________




   The Office of Hazardous Materials Exemptions and Approvals (OHMEA) has
   the primary responsibility for the issuance of DOT Exemptions and
   Approvals to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR). An Exemption or
   Approval is a document which authorizes a person to perform a function
   that is not currently authorized under the authority of the HMR. Also,
   in many instances, the Regulations require approvals and/or
   registrations prior to transportation in commerce. The main difference
   between an exemption and an approval is the fact that an approval
   document can only be issued if there is a specific approval cite in the
   Regulations i.e., approved by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous
   Materials Safety. If there is no approval cite, one must apply for an
   exemption. Further information regarding the functions of the office
   and the similarities and differences between exemptions and approvals
   are set forth below.
