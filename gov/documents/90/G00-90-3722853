                          Random Number Generation
                                 and Testing

     The three primary goals were: (a) to develop a battery of
     statistical tests to detect non-randomness  in binary sequences
     constructed using random number generators and pseudo-random number
     generators utilized in cryptographic applications, (b) to produce
     documentation and a software implementation of these tests, and (c)
     to provide guidance in the use and application of these tests.
