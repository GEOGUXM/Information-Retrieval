   The LBNL Image Library is a distributed, wide area network based
   approach to cataloguing, searching, storing, and providing Web access
   for hi-resolution images. It provides an Web-based image management
   service to the LBNL community. Its capabilites include rapid browsing
   of thumbnail sized images, indexed searching over associated text
   information for each image, collection curation done exclusively via
   Web tools and text and image format and access control customizable by
   collection.

   ImgLib represents one implementation of the WALDO architecture.

   There are three types of users of the Image Library:
     * Browsers (people who search or browse the collections for whatever
       reason)
       You can browse small images which are grouped by subjects into
       sub-collections; you can do text based searches over a complete
       collection; and in some collections, you can retrieve the
       high-resolution original images.
     * Authors (who incorporate images and text from ImgLib into their own
       documents)
       You may use ImgLib as an archival source of information through
       links from your own documents to ImgLib. Examples of this type of
       use is LBL News 50th Anniversary Issue and A microscopic tour of
       the lung.
     * Curators (who create and maintain collections of images and
       desriptive text)
       For more information on the curator function, see User's Guide. If
       you wish to add images or a collection to the LBNL's Image Library
       Web server contact (MRThompson@lbl .gov). You may also download the
       software to your own Solaris Web Server.

Related Work

     * The Image Library work has been expanded into the Wide Area Large
       Data Object project. It's home page includes papers of a more
       general scope that use Image Library examples.
     * The article "Historical Collections for the National Digital
       Library: Lessons and Challenges at the Library of Congress" (part
       1,    part 2) from "D-lib: The Magazine of Digital Library
       Research" describes work in the Library of Congress to put image
       collections on-line as part of their National Digital Library
       project. There are many parallels between their work and ImgLib.
     * UC Berkeley Digital Library The project's goal is to develop the
       technologies for intelligent access to massive, distributed
       collections comprising multiple terabyte databases of photographs,
       satellite images, videos, maps, full text documents, and
       "multivalent" documents.
