                       Hunting Hollow 10K Run / 5K Walk
                                June 15, 2002


      Hunting Hollow is a long, broad, grassy valley, crisscrossed by a
      meandering creekbed
      and surrounded by steep hillsides, a perfect setting for running or
      walking.
      The 10K coarse follows a fairly level dirt road to the valley's end and
      back,
      occasionally passing through the shade of large oaks, sycamores, and
      bay trees.

      The 2001 event was a huge success, and we expect that people
      will have even more fun in 2002.

      More information about the 2002 10K Run/Walk will be available here
      next spring.
