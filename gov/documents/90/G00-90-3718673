              The Philosophy Behind the SoHO Object Abbreviations

   The SoHO on-line catalogs are designed to have a field called OBJECT to
   represent the object or event that the observation was intended to
   study. Associated with this is another field called OBJ_ID which is
   supposed to uniquely identify the object. For example, if the object is
   an active region, then OBJ_ID would be the active region number.

   The catalog of SoHO observations will be very large, easily going to
   several hundred thousand entries. If one were to size the OBJECT field
   big enough to hold character strings such as "Active Region" or
   "Coronal Mass Ejection", then it would take up quite a bit of space.
   Also, the OBJECT field is one of the tools that users will have for
   searching for observations that are relevant to their interest. To that
   end, one has two possibilities:
    1. Make the OBJECT string free form, and let the user search for the
       presence of strings, or
    2. Restrict the value of OBJECT to a predefined set of possibilities.

   It would be more efficient in terms of disk space, and I think easier
   for both creating the catalog and using it, if we followed the latter
   approach. Therefore, I have put together an initial list of generic
   objects and events together with suggested three-letter code values.
   Please let me know at the address at the bottom of the page about any
   modifications or additions you would like me to make.

   A cogent argument can be made for keeping the number of possible object
   codes small. Scientists will be using these to find observations that
   are relevant to their interest, and shouldn't have to enter in several
   codes that all mean basically the same thing. Thus some thought will
   have to be put into the list to be sure that it is well designed. What
   I have is only a first, very rough cut.

Why only three characters?

   There's really nothing magical about using three characters for the
   object codes. The more characters, the more space this field will take
   up in the database. My initial guess was that two characters would
   probably be sufficient to uniquely identify all the possible generic
   objects that SoHO will observe. I am now using a scheme based on three
   characters which is working much better.

What are the rules for forming the abbreviations?

   I've tried to make the abbreviations as natural as possible. The
   necessity of avoiding duplications makes that difficult. Some of the
   ways that the abbreviations are formed are as follows:
     * The initials of a phrase, e.g. "BP" for "bright points".
     * The letters of each syllable in a word, e.g. "FP" for "footpoint".
     * The first two or three letters of a word, e.g. "FL" for "flare".

What will the person using the catalog software see?

   The user will generally see the expanded out name rather than the
   abbreviation. One could use a number instead of an abbreviation, but I
   thought there might be some advantage in using something that was a
   little more closely associated with the concept actually being stored.

What will appear in the FITS file headers?

   The expanded out name will be used in the FITS file headers. There's no
   storage advantage in using an abbreviation.
