   Health-mart.net provides hospital comparative pricing and quality data
   by disease. Since the information is based on Medicare patients, senior
   citizens and their families can draw some general idea of how hospitals
   differ within their communities.

      This service is free, but only if you enter from the FirstGov for
                              Seniors web site.

   Health-mart is a web site that contains hospital pricing and outcome
   data by disease for virtually every hospital in the U.S.. Users of the
   site can compare how long a hospital stay may last for a particular
   condition, as well as the expected cost. A hospital report card
   identifies the top hospitals for any given disease based on length of
   stay, pricing and mortality that occurs during hospital treatment.

   Additionally, Health-mart.net provides Medicare price schedules for
   durable medical equipment. The prices can be viewed by state.

   From a public policy perspective, Health-mart.net can be a tool to
   direct healthcare consumers to the highest quality hospitals. Quite
   often, these institutions are also the ones that are excellent
   healthcare values in terms of their charges.
