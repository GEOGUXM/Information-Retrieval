   Every year, NINDS establishes a set of funding plans based on the
   appropriations received from Congress. This year (FY2002) we budgeted
   $1,006 million for Research Project Grants and Centers. These funds are
   apportioned between our competing awards ($244 million) and funding
   commitments made in previous years for the continuing non-competing
   awards ($762 million).

    Research Project Grants (RPGs) and Centers

   These are the main mechanisms of support for investigator-initiated
   research and include: single investigator awards, e.g., traditional
   research project grants (R01), Small Business Innovative Research
   Grants (R43, R44), Small Business Technology Transfer Grants (R41,
   R42), Cooperative Agreements (U01), and multicomponent awards, e.g.,
   Program Projects (P01) and Centers (P50).

    Competing RPGs

   We have set aside approximately 80% ($186 million) of the total funds
   available for competing awards to fund unsolicited grants (not in
   response to special initiatives). The new (Type 1), competing renewal
   (Type 2), and competing supplement (Type 3) grants will be funded based
   on percentile rank order. We estimate this will fund applications
   scored through the 23.0 percentile rank this fiscal year. Applications
   in response to Program Announcements within the 23.0 percentile are
   treated the same as applications that have no Program Announcement
   designation. We anticipate 30% of all eligible competing RPGs and
   Center applications will be funded this year. This overall success rate
   includes applications in response to special initiatives.

   Modular grants will be awarded at an average of 95% of the
   Council-recommended level. Modular grants will be funded with no
   escalation factor for future years. Non-modular applications, those
   requesting more than $250,000 direct costs in any year, will be awarded
   at an average of 90% of Council-recommended amounts. In general, future
   year commitments for non-modular grants will be calculated by using the
   FY 2002 award level as a base and applying a 3 percent escalation
   factor for recurring costs. Appropriate adjustments will be made for
   non-recurring costs, such as equipment.

    Special Initiatives

   The remaining funds available for competing awards ($58 million) are
   set aside for special initiatives, including responses to Requests for
   Applications (RFAs) and Program Announcements with set asides (PASs).
   Applications that have percentiles beyond the 23.0 percentile may be
   designated by NINDS as high program priority applications and funded on
   a case by case basis from this amount.

    Major Clinical Trials

   Multi-center clinical trials and other types of fixed-protocol clinical
   studies generally have major budget implications and substantial NINDS
   staff involvement. Funds from the set-aside for special initiatives
   will be made available for competing clinical trial awards depending on
   the scientific merit of applications received. All such applications
   will receive special Council consideration for potential funding.
   Budgets for individual awards are set each year by staff after careful
   consideration of the resources that will be needed to follow study
   protocols.

    Non-Competing RPGs

   NINDS will award non-competing RPGs in FY 2002, in nearly all cases, at
   the levels committed in the FY 2001 Notices of Grant Award. However,
   NINDS retains the right to reduce the funding level when necessary and
   appropriate. For example, such a reduction would be made to eliminate
   any overlapping support identified.

    Duration of Grants.

   The NIH is required to fund competing RPGs in such a manner that the
   average length of these awards does not exceed four years. To achieve
   this four-year average, NINDS will award four years of support for many
   applications that requested and were recommended for 5 years. A limited
   number of 5-year awards will be approved based on percentile rank of
   application, type of research (longitudinal study or clinical trial),
   and new investigator status of applicant.

    Research Training and Career Development

   NINDS funds individual postdoctoral fellowships (F32), institutional
   postdoctoral training grants (T32), and several career development
   grants, including mentored research scientist development award (K01),
   mentored clinical scientist development award (K08), mentored
   patient-oriented research career development award (K23), midcareer
   investigator award in patient-oriented research (K24), and independent
   scientist award (K02). The approximate total NINDS budget for training,
   fellowship, and career development awards is $47 million.

   For postdoctoral fellowships (F32), it is estimated that for this
   fiscal year about 40% of the eligible applications will be funded. For
   institutional training grants, we estimate about 45% of eligible
   applications will be funded and for career development awards, we
   estimate about 50% will be funded. Please note that training and career
   development awards do not receive a percentile score, and that it is
   somewhat misleading to provide an estimated priority score for each, as
   these vary from one funding cycle to the next.

    Special Supplement Funding

   A total of $12 million has been set-aside in FY 2002 for special
   supplements to include enhancing research on mouse transgenics,
   promoting an increase in minority and disabled persons working in
   neuroscience research, and supporting urgent unforeseen needs that
   might arise.

    Merit Awards (Javits)

   The NINDS Advisory Council may designate up to 12 competing applicants
   per year as Jacob Javits Neuroscience Investigator Awards. These awards
   are made in two segments, an initial four year award, followed by a
   subsequent three year award with staff review and Council concurrence
   for progress and expanded scope of project. Investigators may not apply
   directly for a Javits Award. These awards are made to distinguished
   investigators who (1) have a record of substantial contributions on the
   "cutting edge" of some field of neurological science, and (2) can be
   expected to be highly productive for a seven-year period. Any
   application selected for nomination would be expected to be exemplary
   of the investigator's body of work and would have been judged
   especially meritorious by a peer review group (study section). For more
   information, see the Javits Award description.

    NINDS Policy for Accepting Applications Exceeding $1,000,000 per Year

   An applicant planning to submit an investigator-initiated new (type 1),
   competing continuation (type 2), competing supplement, or an
   amended/revised version of the described grant application types for a
   clinical research project requesting $1,000,000 or more in direct costs
   for any year is advised that he or she must contact the NINDS staff a
   minimum of 3 months prior to the next submission deadline for new grant
   applications (Feb 1, June 1, or Oct 1). Furthermore, the applicant must
   obtain agreement from the NINDS staff that the Institute will accept
   the application for consideration for award. Any application subject to
   this policy that does not receive permission to submit will be returned
   to the applicant without review. Select this link for more information.
