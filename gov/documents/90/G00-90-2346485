  [world.gif] Greenhouse warming

   [bluebar.gif]

   Certain gases in the atmosphere, such as water, carbon dioxide (CO2),
   methane, CFCs, and nitrous oxide, absorb infrared light that would
   otherwise escape to space, radiating it back toward the planet's
   surface. These "greenhouse gases," as they are called, have always had
   a critical role in determining the temperature of the Earth's surface
   and the livability of the planet. Now, with the amounts of CO[2] and
   other greenhouse gases increasing in the atmosphere due to human
   activities, the possible implications for climate are the subject of
   much research.

   At the Aeronomy Laboratory, researchers are conducting laboratory
   experiments and theoretical research to determine the infrared
   properties and atmospheric lifetimes (how long they "live" in the
   atmosphere) of molecules that may contribute to the greenhouse effect.
   The relative roles of these "other" (non-CO[2])greenhouse gases have
   been evaluated through laboratory experiments that enable calculation
   of the Global Warming Potential (GWP), a number that compares the
   warming properties of a given gas to those of carbon dioxide. The GWP
   gauges the climate impact of a given molecule and hence becomes a
   crucial piece of information for policymakers, who are faced with
   decisions about which substances to restrict. Other Aeronomy Lab
   studies have led to important advances in our understanding of the
   removal rate of a key greenhouse gas, methane.

    An Illustrative Example

   An interesting recent contribution was a study of molecules known as
   "perfluorocarbons", or PFCs for short. PFCs are a class of compounds
   that were being considered as replacements for the ozone-destroying
   chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in industrial applications such as fire
   extinguishing, foam blowing, and refrigeration (some of them are also
   byproducts of aluminum production).

   Their suitability as substitutes was clear on one level: they have
   essentially zero ozone-destroying capacity and can be considered "ozone
   friendly." However, scientists at the Aeronomy Laboratory recognized
   that they could have other implications in the atmosphere, in
   particular that they may be greenhouse gases that could influence the
   temperature of the surface of the Earth.

   With industry poised to produce PFCs, information about their total
   impact on the global atmosphere was needed. To find out, scientists in
   the Aeronomy Laboratory's Middle Atmosphere and Atmospheric Chemical
   Kinetics Programs studied the lifetimes of the PFCs using models and
   instruments in the laboratory. The atmospheric lifetime is a crucial
   parameter that is used in the calculation of the Global Warming
   Potential (GWP) index used by policymakers to gauge each compound's
   global climate impact.

   The answer? "Some human-made greenhouse gases could live forever" was
   the finding of the study, which has subsequently opened up research in
   this area and also influenced policymaking on the national and
   international level.

   The Aeronomy Lab study was very timely and very comprehensive. Using a
   concerted laboratory and modeling approach, scientists studied several
   chemical loss pathways (reaction of the PFCs with trace gases in the
   atmosphere) and the pathway involving photolytic destruction by
   ultraviolet light. The research yielded definitive answers for
   policymakers and industry on six PFCs, finding that each of them had an
   atmospheric lifetime of more than 2000 years (on the same order of
   magnitude as human civilization and much longer than the industrial
   period).

   The implications were three-fold for policymakers: 1) emissions of PFCs
   would accumulate in the atmosphere for tens of centuries; 2) the Global
   Warming Potentials for these compounds would be very large, and likely
   much larger than the CFCs they would replace; and 3) it would take the
   atmosphere an extremely long time to recover from any inputs of these
   compounds and, in fact, the recovery times would dwarf the
   century-scale recovery times required in the case of CFCs (see figure
   below).

   The scientific findings of this research had nearly immediate impacts
   on industry and policy. In the United States, the results caused the
   Environmental Protection Agency to encourage voluntary efforts to
   reduce the use of these gases. Internationally, other countries
   re-evaluated their policies towards such chemicals. The findings were
   used by the international scientific community to assess Global Warming
   Potentials and Ozone Depletion Potentials in the recent United Nations
   Environment Programme-sponsored evaluation of the "state of the
   science" on ozone depletion (Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion:
   1994; see the section above on stratospheric ozone).

   By averting the use of what would have been very unsuitable substitutes
   for the CFCs, this research has spared industry a great expense while
   simultaneously protecting the atmosphere from additional burdens of
   potent greenhouse gases.
