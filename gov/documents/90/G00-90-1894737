     Dear Ms. King:

     This report (INP-02-001) provides the results of our inspection of
     the South Middlesex Legal Services Incorporated's client trust fund
     account. The inspection focused on compliance with record keeping
     requirements established in the LSC Accounting Guide For LSC
     Recipients (Accounting Guide).

     The on-site inspection was conducted on October 29, 2001 through
     October 31, 2001. This inspection determined that the South
     Middlesex Legal Services, Inc. generally complied with the LSC
     Accounting Guide. The grantee has effective internal controls over
     the client trust fund and no significant violations of LSC
     requirements came to our attention. Our observations and review of
     records indicate that the program efficiently operates its client
     trust fund.

     Sincerely,

     Leonard J. Koczur
     Acting Inspector General
