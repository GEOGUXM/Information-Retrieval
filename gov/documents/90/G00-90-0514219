                     Biography of Senator Jean Carnahan

   Before taking Harry Truman's seat in the Senate, Jean Carnahan devoted
   her two terms as First Lady to improving Mrs. Carnahan at a crafts
   table with teacher and school children the lives of Missouri's children
   and to bringing a new warmth and hospitality to the Governor's Mansion.

   She has been a wife, mother, grandmother, author, children's advocate,
   and public speaker. When her husband, Governor Mel Carnahan, ran for
   the U.S. Senate she was actively involved in his campaign just as she
   had been in the previous 19 campaigns he had waged during his lifetime
   of public service.

   However, on October 16, 2000, her life moved dramatically to the
   forefront. Just three weeks before the November 2000 election, Mel
   Carnahan was killed in a tragic plane crash along with their oldest
   son, Randy, and long-time adviser Chris Sifford.

   With her husband's name still on the ballot, she agreed to serve in his
   place should he be elected.

   "I soon found that people wanted something to survive that crash," she
   said. That turned out to be true. On election day the people of
   Missouri showed their faith in Mel Carnahan's ideals and their
   confidence in her to continue his work on behalf of Missouri's
   families, by giving Carnahan a 48,000 vote victory.

   Swearing in at the Old Senate Chamber, January 3, 2001 Jean Carnahan
   took the oath of office on January 3, 2001 after having been appointed
   by Governor Roger Wilson.

   Even before her appointment, Mrs. Carnahan had already shown how
   strongly she felt about Missouri's families and their impact on the
   future of the state and nation. As First Lady, she advocated for
   childhood immunization and created an annual arts festival for
   children. She was the co-founder of Children in the Workplace, a
   project to develop employer-supported, on-site daycare centers for
   working families.

   She frequently spoke on behalf of victims of domestic violence and for
   those who struggle with cancer, osteoporosis, mental health, and drug
   problems. She raised funds for the Rape and Abuse Crisis Center and
   helped build homes for Habitat for Humanity. Mrs Carnahan celebrating
   with fellow Habitat for Humanity volunteer. Each Thanksgiving, the
   Carnahans served meals to the needy at the Salvation Army kitchen, a
   tradition she and her family continued just weeks after her husband's
   death.

   In 1998, after five years of research and writing, Mrs. Carnahan
   completed her first book, "If Walls Could Talk," a 440-page history of
   Missouri's first families and the challenges they faced in public
   service. The following year, she published "Christmas at the Mansion:
   Its Memories and Menus."

   In July 1999, her speech on women of achievement was selected for
   national publication in "Vital Speeches of the Day." The following
   year, a collection of her speeches was published in paperback form
   under the title "Will You Say a Few Words."

   In recognition of her work, Mrs. Carnahan has received the Robert C.
   Goshorn Award for public service and the state's Martin Luther King,
   Jr. special achievement award. In 1995, she received the Child Advocate
   of the Year Award from Boys' and Girls' Town of Missouri. She was named
   1997 Citizen of the Year by the March of Dimes, and the 1999 Woman of
   the Year by the St. Louis Zonta Clubs International.

   She served on the board of William Woods University and helped create
   the Missouri Center for the Book to recognize authors from around the
   state.

   Jean Carnahan graduated from George Washington University with a degree
   in Business and Public Administration. She has three surviving children
   and two grandsons. Her son Russ is an attorney and Missouri legislator
   and lives in St. Louis with his wife, Debra; Robin and Tom are also
   attorneys in St. Louis.

   In her new role as U.S. Senator, Carnahan views herself as a centrist,
   seeking common sense solutions, and as an advocate for Missouri jobs,
   schools, and families.
