                            Bahrain Joins GLOBE!
     __________________________________________________________________

   The GLOBE Program welcomes the State of Bahrain, an archipelago of 33
   islands in the Persian Gulf, as the Program's 97th partner country.
   Officials from the State of Bahrain's Ministry of Education and the
   United States Embassy signed the bilateral Agreement June 16, 2001 in
   Manama, Bahrain's capital city.
   Bahrain Flag "We are delighted that Bahrain's school children and
   educators are about to share the exciting, hands-on science and
   education opportunities enjoyed by an ever-increasing number of people
   around the world," said Lyn D. Wigbels, GLOBE's Assistant Director for
   International Programs.
   "They'll have the satisfaction of making scientifically authentic
   contributions to the worldwide understanding of the planet," Ms.
   Wigbels continued. "Plus, GLOBE makes learning fun!"
   His Excellency Dr. Mohamed Bin Jassim Alghatam, Minister of the
   Ministry of Education and U.S. Charge' d'Affairs Joseph Mussomeli
   signed the official bilateral agreement.
   "The first participating school has already signed up six students who
   are ready to start 'GLOBE-ing' when classes begin in the fall," wrote
   Ms. Donna Winton, Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Embassy in
   Bahrain. "Meanwhile we'll get them supplied with a computer and
   measuring instruments over the summer."
   Bahrain's GLOBE Country Coordinator Ms. Zakiya Ahmed is currently being
   trained at a GLOBE workshop in Poland. "She is really excited about it
   [the training] and so are we," Ms. Winton added.
