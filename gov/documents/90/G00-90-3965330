   Interplanetary Physics Branch, Code 692

                   Mission

   The Interplanetary Physics Branch supports NASA missions designed to
   provide a better understanding of the composition, structure, and
   dynamics of the ionized and magnetized media in the heliosphere
   including the Sun's corona, the solar wind, the local interstellar
   medium, and their interaction with planetary plasma environments,
   including comets and other unmagnetized bodies. Branch support for
   these missions takes the form of mission planning and supervision,
   advanced instrumentation development, experiment participation, data
   analysis, and theoretical modeling for increased understanding of the
   basic processes involved.
