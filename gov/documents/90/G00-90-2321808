      Handling Misconduct


   ALLEGATIONS

      Allegations are made to the institution where the research misconduct
      has occurred. If the institution receives PHS funding, it must have a
      policy for responding to allegations of research misconduct. The policy
      should specify the form of the allegation - oral, written, anonymous or
      signed, the content of the allegation, and the person or persons to
      whom the allegation should be reported. An allegation containing the
      following information is most useful:
        * Name of respondent(s)
        * Name of whistleblower(s)
        * Names of witnesses
        * Description of misconduct
        * When misconduct occurred
        * Where misconduct occurred
        * Supporting documentation
        * Grant number or title
        * Funding source

      A whistleblower may also make an allegation of research misconduct to
      ORI or a PHS funding agency. Many allegations received by ORI do not
      involve PHS funding or research misconduct. Allegations of research
      misconduct that do not involve PHS supported research are forwarded to
      the appropriate federal research agency. Allegations concerning the
      protection of human or animal subjects, conflicts of interest,
      financial mismanagement, the use of hazardous materials, or regulated
      research are referred to the PHS offices that deal with these abuses of
      the research process.
