                                    About

   INSPIRE is a non-profit scientific, educational corporation whose
   objective is to bring the excitement of observing natural and manmade
   radio waves in the audio region to high school students. Underlying
   this objective is the conviction that science and technology are the
   underpinnings of our modern society, and that only with an
   understanding of science and technology can people make correct
   decisions in their lives, public, professional, and private.
   Stimulating students to learn and understand science and technology is
   key to them fulfilling their potential in the best interests of our
   society. INSPIRE also is an innovative, unique opportunity for students
   to actively gather data that might be used in a basic research project,
   as is being done with INSPIRE data taken during the 1992 flight of
   SEPAC (Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators) on ATLAS 1.

   Our eyes are only sensitive to a very narrow range of the
   electromagnetic spectrum. Like the dog that can hear sounds we can't,
   there is a large spectrum of electromagnetic waves we can not see. If
   we could see at very low frequencies, called VLF, we would be dazzled
   by electromagnetic emissions such as sferics, tweeks, whistlers,
   chorus, and many others. These are natural radio waves or emissions
   coming from such common phenomena as lightning, but there are also VLF
   emissions that reach the ground that come from ten's of thousands of
   miles from the Earth. VLF radio emissions are at such low frequencies
   that they can be received, amplified and turned into sound that we can
   hear. Each of the natural VLF radio emissions has a very distinctive
   sound. It is fun to listen to natural VLF emissions.
