   Subject:     Airport Weather Warning Risk Reduction

   References: WSOM Chapter D-26, Transmittal Issuance 85-9 dated August
   26, 1985

   Supersedes: WSOM Chapter D-26, Issuance 85-9, Section 4.4 regarding
   only the issuance of Local Airport Advisories by the Weather Service
   Forecast Office at Norman, Oklahoma.

   Purpose. This OML details National Weather Service (NWS) policy and
   procedures for conducting an operational test of the proposed Airport
   Weather Warning (AWW) at Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) Norman,
   Oklahoma. The test is one of the risk reduction activities in support
   of the NWS Modernization and Associated Restructuring (MAR). The AWW
   risk reduction will begin on June 29, 1992, and is scheduled to end on
   July 4, 1993. During this period, the AWW shall be issued in place of
   the Local Airport Advisory (LAA) currently issued by WSFO Norman.

   The purpose and general description of the LAA, detailed in WSOM
   Chapter D-26, paragraph 4.4, is also applicable to the AWW. However,
   the AWW will be a more detailed enhancement of the LAA. By taking
   advantage of new technology available at WSFO Norman, the AWW risk
   reduction should demonstrate a capability to provide improved
   resolution, accuracy, and timeliness critical to airport ground
   operations.

   Users. For the Norman risk reduction exercise, AWWs shall be issued for
   the Will Rogers World Airport at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OKC). Primary
   users will be those who now receive the LAA. They are the Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) OKC tower, commercial air carrier
   operators, airport security, airport maintenance, fixed based
   operators, and the duty officer and NWS flight line personnel located
   at the adjacent FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (commonly
   referred to as the FAA Academy). The FAA tower and the contract weather
   observing station at Oklahoma City's Wiley Post Airport currently
   receive the LAAs issued by WSFO Norman for OKC. Although, outside of
   the risk reduction activity, AWWs shall also replace LAAs at these
   offices.

   Product Description. An AWW shall be issued by WSFO Norman whenever the
   following weather conditions are expected to occur over or within 5
   miles of Will Rogers World Airport:

   - Thunderstorms producing sustained winds or gusts of 35 knots or
   greater.

   - Thunderstorms with hail of 1/2 inch or greater.

   - Surface wind gusting to 40 knots or more.

   - Sustained surface winds of 35 knots or more.

   - Freezing rain.

   - Onset of heavy snow equal to, or greater than, two inches.

   The AWW shall be valid for no more than 30 minutes and should normally
   be issued with a 30 minute lead time. Updates or cancellations will be
   issued as necessary, if and when additional or different user reaction
   is required (e.g., if warning initially indicated criteria within 5
   miles but not over airport, and then expectations change to include
   airport).

   The AWW shall be written in a plain language and free text format. It
   shall include the triggering phenomenon, location, timing, and may
   include additional remarks. The following is an example of the AWW to
   be issued at Norman:

   OKCAWWOKC
   WWUS35 KOKI 242145
   OKC109-242245-

   AIRPORT WEATHER WARNING FOR WILL ROGERS WORLD AIRPORT
   NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OKLAHOMA CITY OK
   445 PM CDT FRI JUL 24 1992

   THUNDERSTORM 5 MILES DIAMETER WITH HEAVY RAIN...SMALL HAIL...CLOUD TO
   GROUND LIGHTNING...AND SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS GUSTING TO 39 KATS...10
   MILES SOUTH SOUTHWEST MOVING TO THE NORTHEAST AT 25 KATS...WILL ENTER
   AIRPORT AREA BY 515PM CONTINUING TILL 545PM.

   Communications. For the Norman risk reduction, the WSFO shall transmit
   the AWW via Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOOT) to the
   Oklahoma City Weather Service Office (SO). The SO shall then enter the
   AWW into the local Systems Atlanta Information Distribution System
   (ASIDES), which is linked to the OKC tower and the FAA Academy flight
   line. The SO will also telephone the FAA Academy duty officer and the
   OKC security office, who should in turn fan out the AWW to other users
   on the field (e.g., commercial air carriers, airport maintenance, fixed
   base operators).

   It is anticipated that, early during the test period, the AFOOT/RAT
   system will be tied directly into the ASIDES. This will allow the AWW
   information issued by WSFO Norman to be automatically fed to users on
   the ASIDES without requiring any manual interaction at the SO.
