               COMMENCEMENT OF §§301 AND 302 VOLUNTARY CASES

                          AND FILING RELATED PAPERS

   (a) Voluntary Cases. A voluntary case is commenced by filing a petition
   (see Official Bankruptcy Forms appended to the Federal Rules of
   Bankruptcy Procedure (Fed. R. Bankr. P.)); filing a matrix (see Local
   Bankruptcy Rule (L.B.R.) 1007(a)-1 and Appendix 1); filing the lists,
   schedules or statements required by the Bankruptcy Code; and by either
   paying the filing fee or, if the debtor is an individual, making
   application to pay the fee in installments. (See Local Form 1).

   (b) Divisions. The Clerk maintains an Office in each Division of this
   Judicial District.^(1)

   (c) Emergency Voluntary Case Filing. In the event of an emergency that
   necessitates the commencement of a voluntary case before the submission
   of documents that otherwise accompany a petition, a debtor may commence
   a case by filing a petition; the matrix (see L.B.R. 1007(a)-1); the
   required filing fee (or an individual debtor's application to pay the
   fee in installments pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1006); and in chapter
   11 cases a list of the names and addresses of the creditors holding the
   twenty largest unsecured claims. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(d).

                   COMMENCEMENT OF §303 INVOLUNTARY CASES

              AND §304 CASES ANCILLARY TO FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS

   To commence an involuntary case under §303, or a case ancillary to a
   foreign proceeding under §304, the following documents shall be filed
   and the following fee shall be paid:

   original and four (4) copies of the petition (see Official Bankruptcy
   Forms); original summons (see Local Form 4); and the filing fee as
   required by 28 U.S.C. §1930, paid by cashier's check, money order,
   attorney's business check, or cash.

                    FILING FEES - INSTALLMENT AND PAYMENT

   (a) Filing Fee. The filing fee, or approved installment payment
   thereof, is payable to the Clerk by cashier's check, money order,
   attorney's business check, or cash. (28 U.S.C. §1930(a) and (b), Fed.
   R. Bankr. P. 1006(b)(1)).

   (b) Clerk's Approval of Installment or Deferred Fee. The Clerk shall
   have the authority to grant an application filed by an individual
   debtor to pay the filing fee in installments, as provided in Fed. R.
   Bankr. P. 1006 and, where applicable, to approve a trustee's
   application to defer payment of any proceeding fee and special charges
   due from the estate. (See Local Form 1).

   (c) In Forma Pauperis. The Western District of Tennessee is currently
   one of six districts selected by Congress to participate in a pilot
   program to study the effects of allowing a chapter 7 no-asset debtor to
   receive a discharge of debts without paying the required filing fee.
   H.R. 2519, §111(d). Guidelines and procedures have been adopted in this
   District by Standing Order, Misc. No. 94-3, and a copy of those
   guidelines and procedures may be obtained from the Clerk's office. The
   pilot study is for a period of three years, beginning on October 1,
   1994.

                       DISMISSAL OF CASE OR PROCEEDING

   When it appears that a plaintiff, movant, or applicant has failed to
   obtain service on a party, failed to prosecute an action, or is unduly
   delaying the disposition of a case or proceeding, then the Court, on
   its own motion or on motion of a party in interest, after notice and
   opportunity for hearing, may dismiss the case or proceeding.

               CONCURRENT JURISDICTION AMONG BANKRUPTCY JUDGES

   Once a case or proceeding assignment has been made to a Bankruptcy
   Judge in accordance with the current assignment procedures, and even
   though the assigned Judge shall have primary responsibility for a case
   or proceeding, the other Bankruptcy Judges for this Judicial District
   shall have concurrent jurisdiction of each case or proceeding.
   Accordingly, if a Judge is absent from the District or otherwise
   unavailable, the other Judges in their discretion may exercise
   concurrent jurisdiction to process the absent Judge's paperwork,
   including signing appropriate orders, and hearing, for example, certain
   priority calendar matters. By mutual consent of the Judges, a Judge may
   transfer a case and/or proceeding therein to another Judge in this
   District.

   If it appears that a matter or proceeding demands immediate attention
   in the nature of a judicial determination such as a temporary
   restraining order and the Judge to whom the case is assigned is not
   reasonably available, then the party seeking the action shall request
   the Clerk of the Court to assign the matter or proceeding temporarily
   to a Judge who is available and who consents to hear the matter. Any
   such temporary transfer shall not be deemed a permanent reassignment of
   the case or a proceeding therein.

   (a) Pre-Trial Orders, Memoranda of Facts and Law. In the discretion of
   the Court, attorneys may be permitted or required, at any time before
   or after argument or trial of any matter or proceeding, to submit to
   the Court a joint pre-trial order (see Local Form No. 14), a joint
   pretrial statement and/or to submit a memorandum of facts and law. The
   memorandum of facts and law shall be accompanied by a certificate of
   service upon opposing counsel. The original and one (1) copy of all
   memoranda of facts and law shall be filed with the Clerk. Such
   memorandum shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages without prior
   approval of the Court.

   (b) Citations. Unless an opinion being cited by counsel in a memorandum
   or in open Court appears in Federal Reporter, Federal Supplement,
   Tennessee Decisions, Bankruptcy Reporter (West), Bankruptcy Court
   Decisions (LRP), Bankruptcy Law Reporter (CCH) or Collier's Bankruptcy
   Cases (Matthew Bender), counsel shall attach to the memorandum or
   present to the Judge's Law Clerk a copy of the cited case within five
   (5) days before the hearing.

                                EXAMINATIONS

   (a) Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2004 Examinations - Procedure.

   (1) In those instances where a creditor or other party in interest
   seeks an examination of the debtor(s), or a representative of a
   non-individual debtor, pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2004, a motion
   requesting an order for the examination shall be filed with the Clerk
   and the motion shall be accompanied by a proposed order authorizing
   such examination. Such an order may be signed by the Court without a
   hearing, but the order shall be entered without prejudice to the
   debtor(s) moving to quash, vacate, or modify such order prior to the
   scheduled examination.

   (2) In all other instances where a Rule 2004 examination is requested,
   including the debtor moving to take the Rule 2004 examination of
   another entity or a creditor moving to take a Rule 2004 examination of
   an entity other than the debtor(s), the movant shall file with the
   Clerk a motion requesting authority to conduct an examination and such
   a motion shall thereafter be governed by L.B.R. 9013. The movant shall
   additionally file with such motion a completed Order and Notice of
   Hearing (Local Form 5 or 6) and shall otherwise comply with L.B.R.
   9013, giving the entity proposed to be examined, the United States
   Trustee, and the case trustee, a notice and opportunity for hearing.

   (b) Scheduling.

   (1) Unless the Court expressly directs otherwise, all Rule 2004
   examinations shall be scheduled by the moving party in a location other
   than one of the Bankruptcy Courtrooms or Bankruptcy Court facilities.
   The Clerk shall not schedule Rule 2004 examinations.

   (2) After issuance, the order will be returned to the party for service
   on the entity to be examined.

   (c) Attendance. A party authorized by Court order to conduct a Rule
   2004 examination may compel attendance of the party to be examined by
   subpoena. Compulsory attendance of non-debtors is subject to the
   requirements and limitations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. (See Fed. R. Bankr.
   P. 2004(c) and 9016).

                     CHAPTER 11 - ESTATE ADMINISTRATION

   (a) Financial Reports.

   (1) Upon the filing of a chapter 11 case, the United States Trustee
   shall promptly transmit a monthly financial report form to the debtor
   in possession or to the case trustee if one has been appointed.

   (2) On a form provided by the United States Trustee, the debtor in
   possession or case trustee shall file monthly financial reports with
   the Clerk, setting forth the information required by Fed. R. Bankr. P.
   2015(a)(3) and shall continue to file reports until plan confirmation,
   case dismissal, case conversion to chapter 7, or as otherwise ordered
   by the Court.

   (3) Each report shall cover a calendar month; the first report is due
   30 days after the case is commenced, and each subsequent monthly report
   is due by the 15th day of the following month.

   (4) The entity filing the report with the Clerk shall certify thereon
   that a copy was served on the United States Trustee.

   (5) Upon written request from the unsecured creditors' committee or
   other interested party, the debtor in possession or trustee shall send
   the requester a copy of the monthly financial reports for which
   reasonable costs may be charged.

   (6) Failure to comply with this Rule may constitute cause resulting in
   a case dismissal or conversion to a case under chapter 7 of the Code.

   (b) Small Business Chapter 11 Cases.

   (1) Election to be considered a small business in a chapter 11 case. In
   a chapter 11 case, a debtor that is a small business may elect to be
   considered a small business by filing a written statement of election
   not later than 60 days after the date of the order for relief or by a
   later date as the Court, for cause, may fix.

   (2) Conditional Approval of Disclosure Statement. If the debtor is a
   statutorily defined small business and has made a timely election to be
   considered a small business in a chapter 11 case, the Court may, on
   motion of the plan proponent, conditionally approve a disclosure
   statement filed in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3016. On or before
   conditional approval of the disclosure statement, the Court shall:

   (A) fix a time within which the holders of claims and interests may
   accept or reject the plan;

   (B) fix a time for filing objections to the disclosure statement;

   (C) fix a date for the hearing on final approval of the disclosure
   statement to be held if a timely objection is filed; and

   (D) fix a date for the hearing on confirmation.

   (3) Application of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3017. If the disclosure statement
   is conditionally approved, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3017(a), (b), (c) and (e)
   do not apply. Conditional approval of the disclosure statement is
   considered approval of the disclosure statement for the purpose of
   applying Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3017(d).

   (4) Objections and Hearing on Final Approval. Notice of the time fixed
   for filing objections and the hearing to consider final approval of the
   disclosure statement shall be given in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr.
   P. 2002 and may be combined with notice of the hearing on confirmation
   of the plan. Objections to the disclosure statement shall be filed,
   transmitted to the United States Trustee and served on the debtor, the
   trustee, any committee appointed under the Bankruptcy Code and any
   other entity designated by the Court at any time before final approval
   of the disclosure statement or by an earlier date as the Court may fix.
   If a timely objection to the disclosure statement is filed, the Court
   shall hold a hearing to consider final approval before or combined with
   the hearing on confirmation of the plan.

   (c) Other Chapter 11 Disclosure Statements. For Chapter 11 cases that
   are not small businesses, see L.B.R. 3018-1.

   financial report shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the
   commencement of the case. The debtor shall certify on each report that
   copies have been served on the chapter 13 trustee, United States
   Trustee, and any creditor or interested party who has made written
   request therefor.

   Upon written request from any interested party, the debtor shall send

   fails to appear at the confirmation hearing.

   (3) If a party files a written objection to confirmation and appears at

   disbarment or suspension from any other court.

   (d) Entry of Appearance. An attorney appearing for a party in a case or
   proceeding may enter an appearance by signing and filing a pleading or
   an entry of appearance. The signing of a petition commencing a case by

   party in interest, who has filed an adversary proceeding or a contested
   matter, may be permitted to withdraw only upon leave of Court with

   party's counsel may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
   directs, until that party appears pro se or through new counsel.

   must be signed individually by at least one attorney of record who also
   shall include the attorney's address, zip code, telephone number, fax

   (a) Hearings. A request for a continuance shall be directed to the
   appropriate Courtroom Deputy Clerk and shall be requested at the
   earliest time that the necessity therefor appears to counsel. Absent
   consent of all parties and Court approval, requests for continuances
   shall be by written motion or, in emergencies, by oral motion made in
   open Court. The party who moves for a continuance shall give proper
   notice of the requested continuances to all interested parties. A party
   who successfully moves for a continuance of a trial or hearing shall
   forthwith submit to the Courtroom Deputy Clerk a completed "Notice of
   Continuance" form. See Local Form 13. The successful party moving for
   the continuance shall forthwith give notice to all interested parties

   (b) Continuance of §341 Meeting of Creditors. Requests for continuance
   of the §341 Meeting of Creditors shall be addressed initially to the

   a continuance of the meeting of creditors is granted at the request of
   a party in interest, then that party shall notify creditors and
   interested parties in writing, to the extent feasible. If the
   continuance is granted within five (5) days of the §341 meeting date,
   the notice shall be by telephone.

                           COURT RECORDING SYSTEM

   This Bankruptcy Court has adopted the electronic sound recording system
   as the official record of cases and proceedings unless, upon written
   motion or sua sponte, a Judge for cause in a particular proceeding or
   matter orders otherwise. Deputy Court Clerks known as Court Recorder
   Operators ("CRO's") shall take the official record of cases and
   proceedings rather than private stenographic or court reporters.

   The production of an acceptable record of a legal proceeding requires
   discipline and order in the Courtroom. Extraneous noise, unnecessary
   interruptions of witnesses or attorneys, and low or mumbled speech may
   make production of a quality transcript more difficult than it should
   be. To assure the quality of the audio tape record, all persons are
   requested to speak into a Courtroom microphone. The CRO or the Court
   will remind anyone who is not being recorded properly to speak more
   clearly or closer to the microphone. Attorneys are requested to
   identify themselves and whom they represent at the commencement of each
   case or proceeding, and to conduct their examinations in front of a
   microphone.

   notice is issued and not superseded by an asset notice, the §341 notice
   shall contain a notice to creditors that the trustee may abandon
   property at or after the §341 meeting of creditors, and the trustee is
   relieved of the requirement of giving additional notice of abandonment
   or disposition of property under §554 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6007(a).

   (b) Notice Requirements - Asset Cases.

   (1) The trustee or debtor in possession is relieved of the notice
   requirement imposed by §554 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6007(a), other than
   the notice contained in the §341 notice (see part (a) of this Rule),
   where the proposed abandonment relates to property of the estate with a
   net value to the estate of less than $1,000.00 per item and less than
   $2,500.00 in the aggregate. (See Local Form 11).

   (2) In all other instances where creditors are entitled to notice of an
   abandonment under §554 and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6007(a), the party seeking
   the abandonment shall request that relief by motion pursuant to L.B.R.
   9013-1 or, alternatively, shall comply with the procedures contemplated
   by use of Local Form 12.

   (a) Pursuant to applicable tax laws, the entity required to make timely
   payment of taxes incurred by the debtor or the debtor's estate during
   the pendency of the case and required to submit timely tax returns
   shall do so. In chapter 11 cases, copies of such returns shall be
   served on the United States Trustee. The foregoing shall not apply to
   individual chapter 7 debtors.

   (b) Unless excused by the United States Trustee, or the Court, any
   entity operating the debtor's business during the pendency of the case
   shall segregate and deposit all sales taxes and all payroll taxes
   withheld from employee earnings into a separate bank account. All funds
   so deposited shall be used solely for payment of payroll tax liability,
   either by direct payment to the taxing authority or by payment with
   Federal Tax Deposit Coupons submitted to authorized financial
   institutions.

   (a) Discovery Procedure. All discovery is governed generally by the
   applicable Fed. R. Civ. P. as incorporated in Fed. R. Bankr. P., Part
   VII. Discovery pleadings should not be filed with the Clerk unless it
   is necessary to make them a part of the docketed pleadings or unless it
   is necessary to bring them to the attention of a Judge. In the event of
   any discovery dispute and prior to the filing of a motion, it shall be
   necessary for all counsel (and any pro se parties) to confer at least
   telephonically in an effort to resolve the dispute, and the motion
   concerning a discovery dispute must contain a certification signed by
   the movant's counsel (or moving pro se party) that such a conference
   has occurred.

   (b) Opt out. By Miscellaneous Order 93-2 the Bankruptcy Judges in this
   District have opted out generally of the mandatory disclosure
   provisions contained in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) (1-4) and (f). However,
   in a particular proceeding or contested matter a Judge may, after
   notice and opportunity for hearing, require compliance with one or more
   of these opt out provisions.

                            DESIGNATION OF RECORD

   (a) When the appellant and appellee file the Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8006
   designations of the items to be included in the record on appeal and
   statements of the issues to be presented, such designations of the
   record and statements of the issues shall expressly identify the
   specific items, document by document, to be included in the record on
   appeal and specific issues to be presented. Moreover, general,
   catch-all designations of the items to be included in the record on
   appeal such as "all bankruptcy files," "the entire case and/or
   proceeding record" or similar phrase and general, vague, non-specific
   statements of the issues are not acceptable and shall result in the
   record on appeal being considered incomplete. Only that part of the
   record necessary for the appeal should be designated.

   (b) All parties to the appeal shall strictly comply with the foregoing
   so as to enable the Clerk to promptly assemble and transmit the
   complete record on appeal for an effective and efficient review by the
   District Court. Failure of any party to comply with the foregoing shall
   be ground for such action as the Bankruptcy Court or District Court
   deems appropriate, which may include ultimate dismissal of the appeal
   and/or cross appeal by the District Court.

                                L.B.R. 9013-1

                         MOTIONS: FORMS AND SERVICE

   (a) Scope. Local Rule 9013-1 governs all motions, applications,
   objections to claims, contested matters, similar pleadings, and
   proposed orders whereby relief is sought by order of the Court after
   notice and hearing; provided however that this Rule does not apply to
   petitions commencing a case pursuant to §§301, 302, 303, or 304 to
   motions for final decrees pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3022 in chapter
   11 cases, or to motions for examination of debtors pursuant to Fed. R.
   Bankr. P. 2004. See L.B.R. 1002-1, 1003-1, 2004-1(a)(1), and 3022-1
   regarding matters excepted from this Rule.

   (b) Chapter 7, 11, and 12 Cases.

   (1) The party seeking an order (Movant) shall:

   (A) file a pleading or proposed order and a completed Notice of Hearing
   (Local Form 6), leaving only paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notice for
   completion by the Clerk who will fix a period of not less than 20 days
   for the filing of objections, unless otherwise ordered by the Court,
   and will then return the completed notice to the movant for service;

   (B) within five (5) days of receipt of the completed notice from the
   Clerk, mail a copy of the notice and the pleading or proposed order to
   all parties entitled to notice; and

   (C) within three (3) days of mailing the Notice of Hearing to parties,
   execute and file a certificate of service (Local Form 7) that
   explicitly identifies the pleading or proposed order served and sets
   out the names and addresses of all entities served.

   (2) If no objection is timely filed, the relief sought may be granted
   without an actual hearing, and the movant shall immediately submit an
   order with a certificate of movant's compliance with this Rule (Local
   Form 8). In the event of compliance with this sub-part of the Rules,
   only the signature of the party or attorney preparing the order must
   appear on the order. See generally L.B.R. 9074-1 for the signatures
   required on other orders submitted to the Court.

   (3) If an objection is timely filed, the matter will be heard, and the
   party instructed by the Court to submit an order will do so.

   (4) Objections must specifically state the grounds therefore and
   include copies of supporting documents; conspicuously recite in the
   first paragraph the date of the hearing; and include a certification of
   service on the movant, the debtor, the case trustee, the United States
   Trustee, and, in matters where the United States is an interested
   party, the United States Attorney, as well as other affected parties.

   (5) After entry, a copy of each order will be returned to the party
   responsible for service [see L.B.R. 9074-1] and that party shall

   (A) within five (5) days of receipt, mail copies of the order, bearing
   the date of docket entry, to the parties who were served with the
   Notice of Hearing and to the debtor, the case trustee, the United
   States Trustee and, in matters where the United States is an interested
   party, the United States Attorney; and

   (B) within three (3) days of mailing the order to parties, certify
   service by executing and filing a certificate of service (Local Form 7)
   that explicitly identifies the order served and sets out the names and
   addresses of all entities served.

   (c) Chapter 13 Cases.

   (1) The party seeking an order (Movant) shall:

   (A) file a pleading or proposed order and a completed Notice of Hearing
   (Local Form 5), leaving only paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notice for
   completion by the Clerk who will set a date calculated to give
   interested parties not less than 20 days notice of the matter, unless
   otherwise ordered by the Court, and will then return the completed
   notice to the Movant for service;

   (B) within five (5) days of receipt of the completed notice from the
   Clerk, mail a copy of the notice and the pleading or proposed order to
   all parties entitled to notice; and

   (C) within three (3) days of mailing the Notice of Hearing to parties,
   execute and file a certificate of service (Local Form 7) that
   explicitly identifies the pleading or proposed order served and sets
   out the names and addresses of all entities served.

   (2) As the Court docket is called by a Courtroom Deputy Clerk in
   conjunction with the chapter 13 trustee on the date and time set by the
   Notice of Hearing, if no party appears to resist the relief sought, it
   may be granted without hearing; the movant will so advise the Courtroom
   Deputy Clerk and the chapter 13 trustee and promptly submit an order
   for entry. See also L.B.R. 9074-1 for the signatures required on orders
   submitted to the Court.

   On the date and time set by the Notice of Hearing, parties also may
   announce an agreement regarding the relief sought and submit an order
   accordingly.

   If counsel for a party affected by the relief sought is known to
   movant's counsel, then movant's counsel will make a good faith effort,
   prior to or at the docket call, to confer with opposing counsel
   regarding the matter.

   (3) As the docket is called on the date and time set by the Notice of
   Hearing, if a party appears and objects to the relief sought, the
   Courtroom Deputy Clerk shall set the matter for a hearing on a
   subsequent date and so advise those present. After such subsequent
   hearing, the party instructed by the Court to submit an order will do
   so.

   (4) After entry, a copy of each order will be returned to the party
   responsible for service [see L.B.R. 9074-1] who shall

   (A) within five (5) days of receipt, mail copies of the order, bearing
   the date of docket entry, to the parties who were served with the
   Notice of Hearing and to the debtor, the case trustee, and in matters
   where the United States is an interested party, the United States
   Attorney; and

   (B) within three (3) days of mailing the order to parties, certify
   service by executing and filing a certificate of service (Local Form 7)
   that explicitly identifies the order served and sets out the names and
   addresses of all entities served.

   (d) Responsibility for Service.

   (1) Whenever a party is directed by these Rules to serve a notice,
   order, or other document, it is the responsibility of that party to
   identify (by judicial determination, if necessary) and serve all
   parties upon whom service is required by the Court, the Bankruptcy
   Code, Fed. R. Bankr. P., these Local Rules, or the Clerk. To assist the
   responsible party, the Clerk may provide a mailing list of names and
   addresses when returning notices or orders for service.

   (2) The party responsible for serving an order pursuant to this Rule is
   the party who drafted or approved the draft of the order. When two or
   more parties approve the draft of an order, they shall also designate
   the one responsible for service by placing an asterisk by that party's
   name on the order.

   (e) Service by the Clerk. The other provisions of these Rules
   notwithstanding, the Clerk will serve the following:

   (1) notice of entry of orders of conversion or dismissal, including
   notices required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1017;

   (2) notice of the §341 meeting of creditors, the date fixed for filing
   claims against surplus funds of the estate, and the date fixed for
   filing proofs of claims;

   (3) notice of the filing of a proof of claim by the debtor or the
   trustee;

   (4) notice of the date fixed for filing complaints pursuant to §727 and
   §523(c);

   (5) notice of the filing of a notice of appeal;

   (6) notice of entry of orders denying, revoking, or waiving discharge;

   (7) notice of hearing regarding contempt of court;

   (8) notice of entry of judgment or order [Note: This does not obligate
   the Clerk to mail copies of all orders.];

   (9) upon request of the case trustee of an estate with no available
   funds, the notices, orders, or other documents that would otherwise be
   served by the case trustee; and

   (10) pursuant to Court order, any document that, absent the order,
   should be served by another party.

   (f) Notice to Creditors Added by Amendment. Whenever the debtor or
   interested party adds a creditor by amendment, the debtor or interested
   party shall, within five (5) days, serve the added creditors with each
   notice that previously has been served on all creditors in the case,
   without regard for who initially served the previous notices.

   (g) Expenses of Noticing. Without the necessity of a Court order, the
   debtor in possession or the case trustee is authorized to pay the
   expenses of serving notices, orders, or other documents required by
   these Rules to be served by the debtor-in-possession or case trustee.
   Any such payment shall be subject to the Court's review and shall be
   disclosed in any application for reimbursement.

                                 JURY TRIALS

   (a) Applicability of certain Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rules
   38, 39, and 47-51 Fed. R. Civ. P., and Rule 81(c) Fed. R. Civ. P.,
   insofar as may apply to jury trials, apply in cases and proceedings,
   except that a demand made under Rule 38(b) Fed. R. Civ. P. shall be
   filed in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 5005.

   (b) Consent to have trial conducted by Bankruptcy Judge. If the right
   to a jury trial applies and a timely demand has been filed under Fed.
   R. Civ. P. 38(b), the parties may expressly consent to have a jury
   trial conducted by a Bankruptcy Judge under 28 USC §157(e) by jointly
   filing a statement of consent no later than a date to be set by the
   Court in a pretrial and scheduling order. A consent form (Local Form
   18) must be executed by all the parties before it is filed with the
   Clerk. This consent should never be filed with the Clerk unless all
   parties to a proceeding expressly and jointly consent in writing to a
   jury trial by the Bankruptcy Judge by actually signing and approving
   the consent form. Failure of all parties to a proceeding to jointly
   sign and file the consent form shall be deemed by the Bankruptcy Judge
   that all of the parties do not expressly consent to a jury trial by the
   Bankruptcy Judge. Consent to a jury trial is deemed consent that the
   Bankruptcy Judge can enter a final order in noncore proceedings.

                        SUBMISSION OF PROPOSED ORDERS

   (a) Consent Orders:

   (1) Scope. This Rule governs the submission of proposed orders which
   are not dispositive of any prior pleading and which may be properly
   issued upon consent or stipulations of all affected parties.

   (2) Designation of Party Responsible for Serving Orders. The party
   responsible for serving orders pursuant to this Rule is the party who
   approved the draft of the order. When the draft has been approved by
   more than one party, the one responsible for serving it shall be
   designated thereon with an asterisk by that party's name.

   (3) Notice of Entry. After entry, a copy of each order will be returned
   to the party responsible for service who shall

   (A) within five (5) days of receipt, mail copies of the order, bearing
   the date of entry, to the affected parties, including the debtor; the
   case trustee; the United States Trustee (except in chapter 13 cases);
   and in cases where the United States is an interested party, the United
   States Attorney; and

   (B) within three (3) days of mailing the order to parties, certify
   service by executing and filing Local Form 7 with a copy of the order
   attached.

   (b) Orders on Bench Rulings. Upon the Court's announcement from the
   bench of an oral ruling in any action, the prevailing party or the
   party designated by the Court shall prepare an order that briefly and
   accurately sets forth the ruling and shall present it to opposing
   counsel for approval, unless otherwise directed by the Court. An order
   approved by the parties shall be presented to the Judge within ten (10)
   days from the issuance of the ruling, unless approval by all parties
   can not be obtained in which event the procedure of L.B.R. 9074-1(d)(2)
   shall be followed.

   Counsel are encouraged to make written notes when oral rulings are
   announced from the bench. If the parties cannot agree on the content of
   an order, each party (or jointly) shall file a written motion
   accompanied by a proposed order. Before such motion is made, the movant
   shall listen to the tape recording of the oral ruling and shall so
   certify in the motion. See L.B.R. 5076-1.

   (c) Form of Orders. All orders must contain the correct case name(s)
   and case number. If the order is submitted in an adversary proceeding,
   the caption must include the adversary proceeding name and number.
   Moreover, if the order contains more than one page, each following
   page(s) must contain at the top the correct case and adversary name(s)
   and number(s).

   (d) Signatures on Orders.

   (1) An order in any contested proceeding or matter must be signed by
   the contesting parties or their attorneys before it is submitted to the
   Court. An order in any uncontested proceeding or matter must be signed
   by the party or attorney who prepared it before it is submitted to the
   Court. A consent order within the scope of these Local Rules must be
   signed by the affected parties or their attorneys, before it is
   submitted to the Court. In addition to the foregoing, orders in chapter
   12 or chapter 13 cases must also be signed by the case trustee. See
   L.B.R. 2082-1 and 2083-1.

   (2) In the event that the attorney who prepares an order is unable,
   after diligent effort, to obtain the required signatures thereon, that
   attorney may submit the order to the Court with the following
   certificate:

   "I, , certify that I, as counsel for a party to this proceeding or
   matter, have mailed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, on the day
   of , 19 , a copy of this order to all opposing parties and/or counsel,
   giving them at least ten days to approve and return the said order to
   me. I further certify that an approved order has not been returned to
   me by (name of party or counsel) . I further certify that I have on (at
   least three business days prior to submission) notified said party or
   counsel that this order is being submitted to the Court.

                                  HEARINGS

   (a) Mandatory Hearings. Notwithstanding other provisions in these Rules
   concerning notice and opportunity for hearings, the Court shall set and
   hold hearings on the following matters:

   (1) approval of chapter 11 disclosure statements (see L.B.R. 2081-1(c)
   for conditional approval);

   (2) confirmation of chapter 9, 11, 12, and 13 plans;

   (3) motions for abstention from a case or proceeding;

   (4) motions seeking a citation for contempt or the imposition of
   sanctions under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011;

   (5) motions for the appointment of a trustee or examiner; and

   (6) motions filed in adversary proceedings, unless the Court determines
   sua sponte that no hearing is warranted.

   (b) Special or Expedited Settings. Any pleading for which a special or
   expedited setting is sought, and any pleading seeking emergency or ex
   parte relief, including those requesting relief under §362 or 363(e),
   shall so state in the caption and shall specifically state the grounds
   for such relief.

   (c) Unwarranted Requests For Expedited Hearing or Emergency Relief.
   Unwarranted requests for expedited hearing or emergency relief may
   subject counsel and/or the parties to sanctions.

   (d) §542(a) Turnover Complaints in Chapter 13 Cases. Because of the
   urgency of relief typically requested in certain turnover complaints in
   chapter 13 cases, they are entitled to expedited settings. Expedited
   settings, under this provision, shall be restricted to the chapter 13
   debtor(s)' complaint for turnover of vehicles or banking accounts. In
   all other instances, a motion to expedite the trial of a turnover
   complaint will be required. Pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(c)(1),
   the time for notice of hearings on these certain turnover complaints is
   shortened to the time set by the Clerk who is hereby authorized to
   issue the Notice of Expedited Hearing (Local Form 9) in these certain
   turnover complaints in chapter 13 cases.
