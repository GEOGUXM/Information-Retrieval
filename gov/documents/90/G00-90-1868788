   Web Browsers :
   This site has been designed to view optimally with Microsoft's Internet
   Explorer web browser, version 4.x or higher, at a screen resolution of
   800x600. You may need to check your computer's resolution settings for
   best viewing. This is, however, just the suggested configuration and
   every effort has been made to ensure the pages will view properly under
   earlier versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape
   Navigator compatible web browsers.  Support of any web browser below
   version 3.x (examples include IEv2.x or Netscape v2.x) is currently
   limited in some areas of the website.

   The top web browsing software from Microsoft and Netscape are free, so
   ensure you are using the latest technologies by visiting their web
   sites.  Choose a button below to link to and download either of the
   latest browsers.
