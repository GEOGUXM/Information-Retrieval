   Lesson Learned

      The lesson learned database would provide to the tester information on
      operating system known vulnerabilities as well as knowledge to the
      government on the stability of security products before they are
      purchased. The information contained would provide the governments with
      proven vendor claims on the documented test results on areas of
      concerns such as limitations, interoperability, encryption performance
      (throughput), privacy, auditing & reporting, ease of installation &
      configuration and access controls, but not limit to these.

Security Tools

   The security tools database would provide support to the SEWPSC for
   testing of products. This would include proven tools from other
   security government agencies or government contractors. The following
   tools will help determine the vendor claims of security features during
   the verification of a known product:
   Detection Tools
       Hacker Tools
       Audit Tools
       Penetration Tools
       Information Gathering Tools
       Encryption/Decryption Tools
       Identification/Authentication Tools
       Data Access Tools
       Prevention/Filtering Tools
       Honey pots
