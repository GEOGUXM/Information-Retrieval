    ICE THAT BURNS - Flames from burning hydrate crystals.
                                                          -

       Morgantown, WV - Methane hydrates are a tantalizing energy prospect. A
       mixture of natural gas and water frozen into ice crystals, hydrates
       could be an immense future source of clean energy. Scientists estimate
       that if only one percent of the hydrate resource in the United States
       could be tapped, America's natural gas supplies could be more than
       doubled.

       Yet hydrates might also pose a hazard to drilling, especially offshore.
       Numerous landslide scars detected on relatively gentle slopes of the
       continental shelf may be evidence of hydrates breaking apart at or just
       below the ocean floor. Although a seafloor hydrate slide has never been
       observed, safety concerns arise as companies probe for oil and gas in
       deeper offshore waters where encounters with hydrates are more likely.

       To determine whether hydrates are tomorrow's new gas frontier or a
       dangerous foe for future drillers, the U.S. Department of Energy's
       Strategic Center for Natural Gas part of the agency's National Energy
       Technology Laboratory has selected six new projects valued at almost
       $48 million.

       The six are [click on each project for more details]:
         * University of California at San Diego, Scripps Institute of
           Oceanography, San Diego, CA, which will study hydrates in the
           northern Gulf of Mexico;
         * Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Washington, D.C., which will
           develop new tools for recovering and analyzing hydrate cores from
           ocean sediments;
         * Chevron Petroleum Technology Co., Houston, TX, which proposes to
           ultimately drill into hydrates in the Gulf of Mexico;
         * Halliburton Energy Services Inc., Houston, TX, which will conduct
           laboratory experiments to develop reservoir models and simulators
           that can be used to predict the behavior of hydrate formations
           during gas production;
         * Maurer Technology Inc., Houston, TX, which will concentrate on
           hydrates formed beneath the Arctic permafrost in Northern Alaska;
         * BP Exploration Inc., Anchorage, AK, which will also focus on
           determining whether gas hydrates and associated gas resources on
           the Arctic North Slope offer future commercial prospects.

       What are Methane Hydrates?

       Hydrates are formed when a cage-like lattice of ice encases molecules
       of methane, the chief constituent of natural gas. When the hydrate
       forms, the trapped methane compresses; a cubic centimeter of methane
       hydrate, when it melts at room temperature, will release about 160
       cubic centimeters of methane.

       Methane hydrates form in generally two types of geologic environments:
       in permafrost regions where cold temperatures dominate and beneath the
       sea in sediments of the outer continental margins where high pressure
       dominate. Hydrates can also form a seal that traps more conventional
       supplies of natural gas seeping toward the surface.

       A 1995 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimate of both marine and arctic
       hydrate resources revealed the immense energy potential of hydrates.
       Using seismic surveys, well logging, and core samples extracted in the
       internationally-sponsored Ocean Drilling Program, the USGS concluded
       that the hydrate resources of the United States could be as much as
       320,000 trillion cubic feet. By comparison, the United States has about
       167 trillion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves and about 1,400
       trillion cubic feet of total gas resources in formations other than
       methane hydrates.

       DOE's New Interest

       DOE's initial hydrate studies, from 1982 to 1992, helped researchers
       gain a better understanding of hydrates but came to an end as
       priorities shifted to more near-term exploration and production R&D.
       Work continued at relatively small scales at the U.S. Geological
       Survey, universities, other laboratories, and overseas.

       In 1997-98, the Energy Department revived its hydrate research program
       as exploration and drilling technology advanced and the need for
       greater long-term gas supplies became apparent. The new program, which
       involves joint efforts from several other federal agencies, is
       examining both the energy production potential and possible safety
       concerns of methane hydrates.

       Over the next two decades, as U.S. demand for clean-burning natural gas
       is projected to increase by more than 50 percent, producers will look
       for gas prospects in deeper offshore waters. These operations require
       drilling through areas likely to contain hydrates. Hydrates are also
       believed to overlie conventional offshore oil deposits.

       Drilling and producing hydrates, however, are likely to pose enormous
       challenges. As hydrates dissociate into water or ice and methane,
       instabilities can be created within the seafloor or the wellbore.
       Therefore, technologies to locate and either avoid or deal with
       potential problem areas will be especially important.

       Details on each of the new projects follow:

                                   Project Details
         * University of California at San Diego, Scripps Institute of
           Oceanography, San Diego, CA, proposes to conduct a field and
           laboratory study to better understand the formation and
           dissociation of exposed gas hydrates and gas hydrate-rich sediments
           in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The work will characterize the
           chemistry and structure of the hydrates, the composition of
           overlying seawater, and the chemistry, mineralogy, and hydrology of
           associated sediments and pore waters. Hydrates will be collected
           using a submersible vehicle and specially designed pressure
           chambers and sampling equipment. Methane release and its effect on
           the immediate environment will be monitored with a year-long
           seafloor installation of specialized sampling equipment and
           time-lapse camera surveillance.
           Project cost: $612,528; proposed DOE award: $550,002; participant
           share: $62,526;
           Project duration: 12 months;
           Principal investigator: Dr. Miriam Kastner, (858) 534-2065
         * Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Washington, D.C., proposes to
           develop and test tools to sample and characterize methane hydrates
           using the systems and capabilities of the drilling research ship
           JOIDES Resolution (JOIDES stands for Joint Oceanographic
           Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling). Future testing would be
           conducted in the Gulf of Mexico. The project's funds would benefit
           the Ocean Drilling Program, which seeks to improve in-situ core
           recovery systems that better characterize gas hydrates in the
           seafloor.
           Project cost: $4.197 million; proposed DOE award: $959,786;
           participant share: $3.23 million;
           Project duration: 18 months
           Principal investigator: Dr. Frank Rack, (202) 232-3900
         * Chevron Petroleum Technology Co., Houston, TX, proposes a two-phase
           study that would drill for gas hydrates in the deepwater Gulf of
           Mexico. After collecting and analyzing data from workshops and
           other sources, Chevron would devise a strategy to drill through
           hydrates, core them, and transport and test samples. Two wells
           would be drilled in areas rich in gas hydrates; a third well would
           be drilled nearby in an area that does not contain hydrates. Data
           on the drilling, seismic response, response and core from these
           sites would determine the effects of hydrates in the pore space of
           rocks. Depending on the results, a third phase involving the
           drilling of seven boreholes would be proposed.
           Project cost: $13.60 million; proposed DOE award: $10.58 million;
           participant share: $3.02 million;
           Project duration: 40 months;
           Principal investigator: Emrys Jones, (281) 596-2269
         * Halliburton Energy Services Inc., Houston, TX, with Westport
           Technology Center International proposes to expand our knowledge of
           gas hydrates through lab experiments and analytic modeling.
           Specifically, the project would 1) identify and measure properties
           to characterize methane production from a reservoir typical to the
           Gulf of Mexico, 2) quantify the effects sediments have on these
           properties, 3) develop a reservoir model that integrates data from
           steps 1 and 2 to assess well productivity, and 4) develop a hydrate
           reservoir simulator by combining the reservoir model and
           geophysical properties models from the project with an in-house
           model.
           Project cost: $820,750; proposed DOE award: $655,750; participant
           share: $165,000;
           Project duration: 36 months;
           Principal investigator: Dr. Keshawa Shukla, (713) 470-8455
         * Maurer Technology Inc., Houston, TX, proposes a two-phase project
           to evaluate existing best technologies to drill, complete, and
           produce methane from hydrates, and to drill, core, test, and
           instrument three gas hydrate wells in the Prudhoe Bay/Kuparuk River
           area of Northern Alaska. The project will obtain the field data
           required to verify geological, geophysical, and geochemical models
           of hydrates, and to plan and implement a program that safely and
           economically drills and produces gas from Arctic hydrates. Anadarko
           Petroleum Corporation and Noble Engineering and Development, LTD
           will assist Maurer.
           Project cost: $7.36 million; proposed DOE award: $3.99 million;
           participant share: $3.37 million;
           Project duration: 28 months;
           Principal investigator: William C. Maurer, (713) 683-8227
         * BP Exploration Inc., Anchorage, AK, will characterize, quantify and
           determine the commercial viability of in situ, recoverable gas
           hydrates and associated free gas resources in three areas of the
           Alaska North Slope: Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk River and Milne Point
           units. The project will provide practical input to reservoir and
           economic models, determine the feasibility of gas hydrate
           production, and provide leverage for exploration and field
           extension of hydrates in the three ANS areas being studied. The
           University of Alaska in Fairbanks, the University of Arizona in
           Tucson and the U.S. Geological Survey will assist BP.
           Project cost: $21.3 million; proposed DOE award: $13.27 million;
           participant share: $8.05 million;
           Project duration: 48 months;
           Principal investigator: Robert B. Hunter, (907) 564-5733
