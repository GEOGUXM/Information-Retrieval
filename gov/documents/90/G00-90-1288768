Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World

  USGS Fact Sheet 133-99

   The world's glaciers react to and interact with changes in global and
   regional climates. Most mountain glaciers worldwide have been
   retreating since the latter part of the 19th century; global sea level
   has risen about 10 centimeters during the past century. Glaciers vary
   in size as a result of several factors, of which climate variation is
   probably the most important. The reasons we are interested in glacier
   variation include its connection to climate change and to global sea
   level.

   The present volume of the Earth's glacier ice, if totally melted,
   represents about 80 meters in sea-level rise. From minimum (an
   interglacial epoch) to maximum (an ice-age epoch) volume of glacier ice
   on the continents, sea level has a range of 200 meters. For example,
   during the last glacial peak, about 20,000 years ago, sea level is
   estimated to have been 120 meters lower than it is today. During a
   warmer climatic interval in the last interglacial period, 125,000 years
   ago, sea level was about 6 meters higher than it is today; during an
   even warmer interval 3 million years ago, sea level is estimated to
   have been 25 to 50 meters higher. Sea-level changes, especially in
   low-lying coastal areas and on islands, have significant effects on
   human activities and facilities.

   A thorough global baseline study of the areal extent of existing
   glaciers is required if we are going to assess the magnitude of changes
   in glaciers that will occur worldwide during the 21st century. This
   research comprises a comprehensive global baseline study of the total
   area of glacier ice on Earth. The effort is important because present
   and future changes in glacier margins worldwide cannot be assessed
   without such a baseline study. The atlas also includes ancillary
   information from historical and modern ground observations by
   glaciologists.

   One element of the Earth's cryosphere (frozen water) amenable to global
   inventorying and areal-change monitoring with Landsat images is
   glaciers. In 1978, the USGS decided to prepare an 11-chapter U.S.
   Geological Survey Professional Paper, Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers
   of the World. In this volume, Landsat 1, 2, and 3 multispectral scanner
   (MSS) images and Landsat 2 and 3 return beam vidicon (RBV) images are
   used to inventory the areal occurrence of glacier ice on our planet
   within the boundaries of the spacecraft's coverage (between about 82°
   north and south latitudes). Between 1979 and 1981, optimum Landsat
   images were distributed to a team of 60 scientists, representing 25
   nations and 45 institutions, who agreed to author sections of the
   Professional Paper concerning either a geographic area or a
   glaciological topic.

   In addition to analyzing images of a specific geographic area, each
   author summarized up-to-date information about the glaciers within the
   area and compared their present areal distribution with historical
   information (from published maps, reports, photographs, and so on)
   about their past extent. Due to the limitations of Landsat images for
   delineating or monitoring small glaciers in some geographic areas (the
   result of inadequate spatial resolution, lack of suitable seasonal
   coverage, or absence of coverage), information on areal distribution is
   sometimes necessarily derived from ancillary sources.

   Completion of the atlas in 2001 will provide an accurate regional
   inventory of the areal extent of glaciers on our planet during a
   relatively narrow time interval (1972-1982). This global "snapshot" of
   glacier extent is already being used for comparative analysis with
   previously published maps and aerial photographs, as well as with new
   maps, satellite images, and aerial photographs, to determine the areal
   fluctuation of glaciers in response to natural or human-induced changes
   in the Earth's climate. For example, sequential Landsat images have
   documented major changes in the coastal regions of Antarctica. See USGS

   Antarctica at http://pubs.usgs.gov/factsheet/fs50-98/. See also USGS

   Foreword to the Volume

      On 23 July 1972, the first Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS 1
      or Landsat 1) was successfully placed in orbit. The success of Landsat
      inaugurated a new era in satisfying mankind's desire to better
      understand the dynamic world upon which we live. Space-based
      observations have now become an essential means for monitoring global
      changes.

      The short- or long-term cumulative effects of processes that cause
      significant changes on the Earth's surface can be documented and
      studied by repetitive Landsat images. Such images provide a permanent
      historical record of the surface of our planet; they also make possible
      comparative two-dimensional measurement of change over time.
      Professional Paper 1386 demonstrates the importance of the application
      of Landsat images to global studies by using them to determine the
      current distribution of glaciers on our planet. As images become
      available from future satellites, the new data will be used to document
      global changes in glacier extent by reference to the image record of
      the 1970's.

      Although many geological processes take centuries or even millennia to
      produce obvious changes on the Earth's surface, other geological
      phenomena, such as glaciers and volcanoes, cause noticeable changes
      over shorter periods. Some of these phenomena have worldwide impact and
      often are interrelated. Explosive volcanic eruptions can produce
      dramatic effects on the global climate. Natural or culturally induced
      processes can cause global climatic cooling or warming. Glaciers
      respond to such warming or cooling periods by decreasing or increasing
      in size, thereby causing sea level to rise or fall.

      As our understanding of the interrelationship of global processes
      improves and our ability to assess changes caused by these processes
      develops further, we will learn how to use indicators of global change,
      such as glacier variation, to more wisely manage the use of our finite
      land and water resources. Professional Paper 1386 is an excellent
      example of the way in which we can use technology to provide needed
      earth-science information about our planet. The international
      collaboration represented by this report is also an excellent model for
      the kind of cooperation that scientists will increasingly find
      necessary in the future in order to solve important earth-science
      problems on a global basis.
