   The Project EXPORT Centers of Excellence (Centers) will promote the
   conduct of minority health and/or health disparity research aimed at
   reducing disparities in health status; promote the participation of
   members of health disparity groups in biomedical and behavioral
   research and prevention and intervention activities through education
   and training; and build research capacity in minority serving
   institutions.  The Centers will be established at academic institutions
   with a significant number of students from racial and ethnic minority
   and other health disparity populations.

   NCMHD will release a Request For Applications (RFA) during Fiscal Year
   2002 notifying institutions of the opportunity to compete for program
   funds.  To become eligible for these funds, institutions must have:

   ยง         A significant number of members of minority health disparity
   populations or other health disparity populations enrolled as students
   in the institution (including individuals accepted for enrollment)

   ยง         Been effective in assisting its students to complete the
   program or training and receive a degree

   ยง         Made significant efforts to recruit minority students to
   enroll in and graduate from the institution, which may include
   providing means-tested scholarships or other financial assistance as
   appropriate

   ยง         Made significant recruitment efforts to increase the number
   of minority or other members of health disparity populations serving in
   faculty or administrative positions at the institution.

   Eligible institutions that meet specified secondary qualifications will
   also be encouraged to apply for funding to ensure the participation of
   institutions located in the geographic regions experiencing the
   greatest disparities in health status.
