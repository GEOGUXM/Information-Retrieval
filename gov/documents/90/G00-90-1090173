   The Department of Energy, Office of Scientific and Technical
   Information (OSTI) in partnership with DOE Program Offices, announces
   new tools for information access, Subject Portals. These versatile
   subject-specific Web sites provide full-text DOE scientific and
   technical reports, links to journal literature, and other information
   sources pertaining to the following subjects: Photovoltaics, Geothermal
   Energy, Hydrogen Energy, Superconductivity, Heavy Vehicle Technology,
   Wind Energy, Biopower, Environmental Management, Biofuels,
   Concentrating Solar Power, and Fuel Cells Technology. All Subject
   Portals include a distributed searching feature, which provides
   parallel searching across a select set of heterogeneous databases. In
   addition, each portal is customized to meet the needs of the sponsoring
   organization.
