ROWS Project Overview
     __________________________________________________________________

   The radar ocean wave spectrometer was a concept conceived to permit the
   remote sensing of ocean waves from space. Researchers at NASA/GSFC used
   an airborne prototype, (we call it ROWS), to demonstrate the capability
   to map the directional ocean wave field from aircraft flying 5-10 km
   above the ocean. While a satellite sensor is not in current NASA plans,
   the aircraft instrument remains one of few remote sensors capable of
   deriving directional swell estimates over the open ocean. ROWS
   continues to provide ocean radar remote sensing researchers with sea
   surface information useful for the study of ocean data from satellite
   sensors such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radar scatterometer,
   and radar altimeter.

   The system has been modified to provide full-time operation as both a
   spectrometer and a radar altimeter. Distinct, collocated ROWS data
   products include: a) the 'standard' ROWS directional long wave
   spectrum, b) altimeter-derived SWH and wind speed (apparent mean square
   slope), and c) scatterometer-like radar cross section data from the
   off-nadir scanning antenna. Collectively, these data provide
   information needed to study effects of longer waves on the short-scale
   wave spectrum (those wavelengths (2-10 cm) to which the scatterometer,
   SAR, and altimeter most strongly respond).

Current Research Activities

   Past efforts have demonstrated ROWS' long wave measurement ability
   along with a capability to provide airborne radar altimeter
   measurements. We are building on that work by developing a database of
   concurrent aircraft and satellite radar backscatter measurements along
   with a modeling framework to permit quantitative investigation of sea
   surface backscatter for near-nadir incidence angles of 0ø to 30ø. An
   overall goal is to provide a consistent physical interpretation of the
   relationship between radar backscatter (at a given incidence angle and
   frequency) and the wind-roughened sea surface. Such developments should
   be able to describe current wind retrieval Geophysical Model Functions
   (GMF) used by the satellite scatterometer (NSCAT) and altimeter
   (TOPEX), but more importantly, they provide a physical basis for the
   inferrence of such geophysical variables as wind stress and sea state.
   The integral equation method (IEM) electromagnetic scattering model has
   been slightly modified to help parameterize the competing effects of
   specular and Bragg scattering in the ROWS and other sensor's (SAR,
   scatterometer and altimeter) radar cross section data. This model
   allows input of a continuous wave spectrum but also allows reversion to
   the more widely used two- scale approach under Gaussian surface
   roughness assumptions.
