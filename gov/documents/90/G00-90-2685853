   INTERIM GUIDANCE ON SECTION 508 FOR DEPARTMENT OF and in MS Word.

   The Buy Accessible database, available soon, will assist government
   personnel in completing the market research necessary to ensure that
   they are buying the most accessible IT products and services available
   in order to comply with Section 508.

   GSA's Section 508 Reference Manual provides a starting point for
   implementation of Section 508 within an agency. This document was
   designed as a reference to assist Section 508 Coordinators with their
   respective duties and to give them a tailorable product that can be
   enhanced to fit their specific environment.

   The Guidelines (in MS Word format) cover the Key Features of Section
   508, Definitions, Standards, Exemptions, Complaint Procedure, Reporting
   Requirements, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Final Rule.
   It defines the Roles and Responsibilities of the Chief Information
   Officer, the Section 508 IT Accessibility Coordinator, and the Section
   508 EIT Accessibility Team. The guide describes an typical
   Implementation Plan, Budget Issues, Strategic Planning, Working with
   Developers, the Software Development Life Cycle, Security Issues,
   Checklists, and references.

   Also in MS Word, the Appendices include Memorandum for Chief
   Information Officers, a Sample Implementation Plan, Acronyms,
   Definitions, Resources, Accessibility Forum Questions and Answers,
   Federal Assistive Technology Centers, Summary of Final Standards, Final
   FAR Rule, FAQ's, and Technical Assistance Materials from the Access
   Board.

   The Access Board technical assistance materials cover each of the six
   parts of the technical provisions (web, software, multimedia, telecom,
   desktop and laptop computers, and self-contained closed products).

   Web-based interactive training on how to make web sites accessible is
   available at http://www.section508.gov.

   On Tuesday, June 19, President Bush reaffirmed this Administrationâ€™s
   commitment to full implementation of section 508. The text of his
   speech is available at
