   Reports of Changes to FDIC Financial Institution and Office Structure
           The Reports of Changes to FDIC Financial Institution and Office
   Structure describe non-financial activity of FDIC supervised and
   regulated institutions. The bi-monthly report reflects transactions
   processed between the 1st and 15th and the 16th and last day in each
   month. Data becomes available two business days after the reporting
   period ends. Some reports may not have any data for selected reporting
   period, cert. no., state, region, or class. First, check the Summary of
   Changes for totals.
           The Reports of Changes to the FDIC Institution and Office
   Structure is updated on the 1st and 16th of each month. If that day
   falls on a holiday or weekend, the reports will be updated the next
   day. If you have any questions or suggestions, please e-mail us.
