                       National Geodetic Survey (NGS)

   [ngs1.gif] Imagine being able to predict the disastrous effects of
   earthquakes by understanding the movement of the continental plates.
   Imagine helping to accurately predict future flood damages for every
   building in or near a community's flood hazard area. Imagine helping
   local officials determine areas that are prone to fires and whether
   several fires in a certain area indicate arson. Imagine dramatically
   improving the ability to predict severe storms. Imagine helping local
   emergency response workers guide vehicles to their destination as
   quickly as possible.

   NOAA's National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is committed to meeting the
   current and anticipated positioning needs of the American public by
   developing the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). NSRS provides
   the reference base for position, height, distance, direction, and
   gravity values, and how these values change with time. This information
   is essential for ensuring the reliability of transportation,
   communication, and defense systems, land records, mapping and charting,
   public utilities, coastal zone management, natural resource mapping,
   and a multitude of scientific and engineering applications. NGS also
   conducts the coastal mapping program, including surveying the Nation's
   coastline and providing precise positions of the shoreline and other
   features that are used to produce navigational charts.


   Vision:

           Everyone is able to know where they are and where other things
           are...anytime, anyplace.

   Mission:

           To deliver and evolve the Nation's foundation of reference for
           latitude, longitude, height, velocity, shoreline, and gravity
           throughout the United States with consistency, accuracy, timeliness,
           currency, and easy access to support public safety, coastal
           stewardship, economic prosperity, and environmental well being.

   [ngs2.gif] The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) develops and maintains
   the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) using advanced geodetic,
   photogrammetric, and remote sensing techniques. NSRS is a consistent
   national coordinate system that defines latitude, longitude, height,
   scale, gravity, and orientation, and how these values change with time,
   across the United States. This information is essential to support
   public safety, coastal stewardship, economic prosperity, and
   environmental well-being. It ensures the reliability of transportation,
   navigation, communication, defense systems, boundary and property
   surveys, land record systems, mapping and charting, public utilities,
   coastal zone management, natural resource mapping, and a multitude of
   scientific and engineering applications.

   aerial_photo.jpg (5934 bytes) NGS also conducts the coastal mapping
   program, which includes surveying the U.S. coastline and providing
   precise positions of the shoreline and other features. NGS is
   responsible for the photogrammetric mapping of all U.S. coastal
   regions, including the Great Lakes and U.S. territories. NGS provides
   information needed for safe air transportation, including information
   used to develop instrument approach and departure procedures and to
   investigate aircraft accidents.

   NGS also provides federal leadership in developing specifications and
   standards for conducting geodetic surveys, coordinates the development
   and application of new surveying instrumentation and procedures, and
   assists state, county, and municipal agencies through a variety of
   cooperative programs.

   NGS is organized into six divisions including:  Geodetic Services
   Division, Spatial Reference System Division, Remote Sensing Division,
   Observation and Analysis Division, Systems Development Division and
   Geosciences Research Division.   Many of the NGS products and services
   from these divisions can be accessed at
   http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/products_services.shtml.
