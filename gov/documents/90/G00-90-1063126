   Description: The NASA Academy is an educational program at the
   university level for developing space leaders at Goddard Space Flight
   Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and Ames Research Center in Moffett
   Field, California. The selected students at each center will be placed
   in the projects and laboratories of our most innovative scientists and
   engineers working for NASA. The technical work for each student is set
   up in advance, with the specific program arranged between the student
   and the researcher. Throughout the program the students, as a group,
   will be introduced to a highly specialized "experts" or leader, active
   in some aspect of the space program, and who will openly discuss
   his/her work, the problems, and the possible solutions. Besides
   technical, these "experts" will include the administrative, fiscal, and
   management aspects of our space program, as well as industry, which
   builds space hardware, and our Congress, who legislate the resources.
   The Academy at GSFC may visit several field sites, including the
   Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA; the Wallops Flight Facility in
   Wallops Island, VA; and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
