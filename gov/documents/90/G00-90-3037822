   President William J. Clinton: Eight Years of Peace, Progress and
   Prosperity

   In 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore put in place an
   agenda to get America back on its economic feet while restoring the
   values of opportunity, responsibility and community that made this
   country great. Their work, along with the hard work of the American
   people, has led to remarkable progress: the longest economic expansion
   in our nation's history, more than 22 million new jobs, historically
   low unemployment, the lowest crime rates in a generation, the smallest
   welfare rolls in 35 years, and cleaner air and water in our nation's
   communities. Our report "Eight Years of Peace, Progress and Prosperity"
   highlights all of President Clinton's historic achievements and details
   the progress our nation has made over the past eight years. The report
   is available in HTML and as a PDF here on the White House web site.
