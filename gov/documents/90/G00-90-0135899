                                    Nemesis

Origin of the theory

   The "Nemesis Theory" was an outgrowth of the discovery of Alvarez et
   al., that the impact of a large (10 km diameter) comet or asteroid was
   responsible for the great mass extinction that took place 65 million
   years ago.
   Studies of the fossil record by Dave Raup and Jack Sepkoski shows that
   this was not an isolated event, but one of several mass extinctions
   that appear to occur on a regular 26 million year cycle. Their original
   paper analyzed marine fossil families, and was published in the
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, vol 81, pages
   801-805 (1984).

   The original extinction data of Raup and Sepkoski are replotted in the
   following figure.

                             [USEMAP:explot.GIF]

   The vertical axis shows the "extinction rate." This was taken from the
   values given by Raup and Sepkoski for the percent family extinctions at
   each geologic boundary. In order to take into account the uncertainty
   in the boundary ages, each data point was plotted as a Gaussian, with
   width equal to the uncertainty, and area equal to the extinction rate.
   This plot thus represents a statistical estimate of the extinction rate
   vs. time. The individual Gaussians for each stage boundary are shown as
   dotted lines. The extinction 65 million years ago is indicated with the
   little dinosaur icon.
   The peak near 11 Ma is real, but exaggerated by the requirement that
   the plot go to zero at the present. Arrows are plotted every 26 million
   years. Note that many of these are close to the peaks in the extinction
   rate. This is the apparant 26 million year periodicity discovered by
   Raup and Sepkoski.

   There have been many statistical studies of these data. Although
   several studies indicate the periodicity is significant, not everyone
   agrees. I suggest that you decide for yourself. If you decide that the
   extinctions are not statistically significant, then there is no need
   for the Nemesis theory.

   Additional work by Sepkoski shows that the periodicity is also present
   for fossil genera. His results were published in the Journal of the
   Geological Society of London, vol 146, pp 7-19 (1989). Figure 2 from
   this paper is shown below. Please note that the time axis has been
   reversed compared to that of the previous figure.

   Plotted is the per-genus extinction rate (in units of
   extinctions/genus/Myr) for 49 sampling intervals. The upper time series
   (labelled Total) is for Sepkoski's entire data set of 17,500 genera,
   wheras the lower "filtered" time series is for a subset of 11,000 from
   which genera confined to single stratigraphic intervals have been
   excluded. The vertical lines are plotted at 26 Myr intervals.

   The Nemesis theory was devised to account for this regularity in the
   timing of the mass extinctions reported by Raup and Sepkoski. According
   to this model, a companion star orbiting the Sun perturbs the Oort
   comet cloud every 26 Myr causing comet showers in the inner solar
   system. One or more of these comets strike the Earth causing a mass
   extinction. The Nemesis theory was originally published in Nature by
   Davis, Hut, and Muller (vol 308, pp 715-717, 1984). A longer
   description of the work leading up to the theory was writen in book
   form: "Nemesis," by Richard Muller (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988). You
   can read Chapter 1 Cosmic Terrorist. here. This book is out of print,
   but I have some extra copies. Contact me RAMuller@LBL.gov if you need a

Stability of the Nemesis orbit

   There is a great deal of confusion among astronomers about the
   stability of the Nemesis orbit. Even many theorists who should know
   better believe that the orbit is unstable, and that the original
   Nemesis paper was in error. However detailed calculations by Piet Hut
   at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton show that the original
   estimate about the orbit were correct. Hut's results were published in
   Nature, vol 311, pp. 636-640 (1984). In our original paper we had
   stated that the orbit presently has a stability time constant of
   approximately one billion years. Many people naively assumed that this
   was incompatible with the 4.5 billion-year age of the solar system. But
   unlike the lifetime of a radioactive element, the lifetime of the
   Nemesis orbit is not predicted to be constant with time. In fact, Hut
   has shown that the lifetime decreases linearly, not exponentially, with
   age. The expected orbit lifetime when the solar system was formed was
   (presumably) about 5.5 billion years. When nearby stars pass the solar
   system, the orbit of Nemesis is given slight boosts in energy. The
   Nemesis orbit becomes larger and less stable. At present, the Nemesis
   orbit has a semi-major axis of about 1.5 light-years, and the orbit is
   expected to remain bound to the sun for only another billion years.

   Note that the Nemesis theory predicts that the periodicity should not
   be precise. Perturbations from passing stars are not sufficient to
   disrupt the orbit, but they are sufficient to cause a slight (a few
   Myr) jitter in the interval between exinctions.

   Why do so many people think the orbit is unstable? The basic answer is
   that scientists often don't have time to read the literature, so they
   depend on the summaries of others. Click here for more details.

The Search for Nemesis

   Nemesis is most likely a red dwarf star, magnitude between 7 and 12.
   Virtually all such stars have been catalogued, but very few of them
   have had their distance measured. It is likely that Nemesis, if it
   exists, will be visible with binoculars or a small telescope.

   We don't need a large telescope to find Nemesis. We need a small or
   medium telescope, and enough time to look at and analyze 3000 candidate
   stars. A series of images taken throughout the year should allow us to
   measure the large parallax of this star. We are also eliminating the
   stars measured by the Hipparcos satellite.

   We began the search for Nemesis using the automated telescope at
   Leuschner Observatory. However this telescope was not designed for the
   heavy use it was receiving from this search and from our automated
   search for nearby supernova. So we are in the process of constructing a
   new telescope. It is now undergoing final testing, and it soon will be
   moved to a mountaintop near Monterey . Its primary use will be for the
   Hands on Universe and Automated Supernova Search projects, but we only
   need it part time to find Nemesis.
