   About The Earth Team
        We need your help in reducing soil erosion, conserving our water
   and improving its quality, and developing pride in our country's
   natural resource heritage. Your commitment to the Earth Team will help
   ensure that generations to come will enjoy America's bounty.
       The Earth Team, the volunteer arm of the USDA Natural Resources
   Conservation Service (NRCS), is now recruiting volunteers in more than
   3,000 locations across the country. Make a difference in your community
   -- become an Earth Team Volunteer.

   Who Can Volunteer?
        Anyone 14 years of age or older and interested in conserving our
   precious natural resources can join the Earth Team. You can work
   part-time or full-time, evenings or weekends, outdoors or in an local
   NRCS office. You can volunteer as an individual or as a group!

   Where Volunteers Can Help
       On the Land - with professional conservationists who are working
   directly with farmers and ranchers.
       In schools - with elementary and high schools, college and
   university students. Through camps and classes, you can introduce young
   people to the wonders of nature.
       With organizations -- youth groups, professional societies, or
   civic groups. All types of organizations are joining together to
   sponsor water quality education campaigns, community beautification,
   and erosion control projects. Cooperative Earth Team efforts can help
   solve many natural resource problems in your area.
       In offices - where NRCS or your conservation district may want to
   use your talents for clerical assistance, organizing information in a
   computer, preparing newsletters, or educating others about natural
   resource conservation.

   Kinds of Jobs Our Volunteers Do
        As an Earth Team Volunteer, you'll work with professionals on
   conservation activities in your community Whatever your talents or
   interests, there is a volunteer opportunity for you. Technical
   assistance is needed to plan, lay out, and design conservation
   practices; to make natural resource inventories; and to improve
   wildlife habitat. Schools and community groups benefit from the
   conservation tours and exhibits that volunteers can organize. Taking
   photographs writing articles, speaking to community groups and
   producing artwork and publications are some of the opportunities
   available. Office support services include opportunities in computer
   data entry, typing, filing, computer programming, and conservation
   information. There are opportunities for everyone.
