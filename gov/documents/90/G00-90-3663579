   UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No.
   00-5212 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, APPELLEE, v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION,
   APPELLANT ________________________ Consolidated with 00-5213 MOTION FOR
   LEAVE TO FILE SEPARATE AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF On November 3, 2000, the
   court granted leave for a joint brief to be filed by the Association
   for Objective Law and the Center for the Moral Defense of Capitalism
   (hereinafter "CMDC"). The brief developed by the Association for
   Objective Law did not accurately present the arguments and point of
   view that the CMDC had wished to present for the Court's consideration.
   Nevertheless, the Association for Objective Law elected to proceed
   without the CMDC and without its consent. Therefore, CMDC requests
   leave to file the attached amicus curiae brief separate from the brief
   filed or to be filed by the Association for Objective Law.
