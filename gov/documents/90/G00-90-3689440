                                   MISSION

   The mission of the Emergency Medical Services program in Alaska is to
   reduce both the human suffering and economic loss to society resulting
   from premature death and disability due to injuries and sudden illness.

   The EMS Program provides leadership in EMS by consensus building,
   developing and administering guidelines and regulations, and by
   developing and distributing publications for planning, treatment, and
   evaluation.

                          Brief Alaska EMS Overview

   Revised 12/17/2001

   Emergency Medical Services in Alaska is provided by a rich mixture of
   paid and volunteer responders incorporated in seven regions. There are
   over 4,000 EMS EMTs, EMS Instructors, and Defibrillator Technicians
   certified by the Department of Health and Social Services, as well as
   another 175 Mobile Intensive Care Paramedics licensed thought the
   Department of Commerce and Economic Development.

   Many of these personnel are members of the approximately 40 EMS
   agencies providing advanced life support, 40 which provide basic life
   support and occasional ALS, 5 services providing basic life support,
   and 17 air medical services. Ground and air medical services providing
   advanced life support must be certified by the Department of Health and
   Social Services. Services range in size from small rural agencies
   providing basic life support to state of the art, paramedic based,
   agencies in the more populous areas of the state.

   The Section Community Health & Emergency Medical Services has
   facilitated the development of the Alaska EMS Goals, which provides
   guidance in the development of EMS in Alaska based on national and
   state recommendations regarding over 15 core areas of EMS. This
   reference is used by the state, regional, and local agencies for EMS
   planning and evaluation.  The "goals document" categorizes communities
   in Alaska by level.

   The geography, weather, and vast distances between some communities
   makes the planning, delivery, and evaluation of emergency medical
   services formidable challenges. Fortunately, the resourcefulness and
   teamwork of EMS personnel and agencies allow these challenges to be met
   on a daily basis.

                                  OUR GOALS

   The overall goal of the Emergency Medical Services program is to
   prevent life-threatening and disabling injuries whenever possible, and
   to establish a comprehensive, coordinated system of emergency medical
   services that:
     * assures citizens and visitors easy access to services;
     * provides an injury prevention component;
     * expedites initial response;
     * ensures appropriate lifesaving and stabilization measures rendered
       at the scene; and
     * ensures transport or transfer of patients in a timely and efficient
       manner to facilities capable of effecting maximum recovery and
       rehabilitation.
