   [USEMAP:img0.gif]

   Life Science Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory is building a
   Neutron Diffraction Structural Biology station at LANSCE
   to locate important protons at catalytic sites, study hydrogen bonding
   and hydration structure, metal coordination and integral components
   in single crystals of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and other
   biological macromolecules, biological fibers and membranes.
