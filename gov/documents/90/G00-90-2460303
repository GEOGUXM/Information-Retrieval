Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Coast 2050

   Coastal land loss and CWPPRA (Breaux Act)

   1. How much coastal wetland loss is happening in Louisiana?
     * 25-35 square miles per year

   2. Can we really stop this process?
     * Not entirely. Land loss is a natural process in delta systems.
     * Historically, uninhibited land gain balanced the loss.
     * Man’s intervention into these systems has severely hampered the
       natural land gain mechanisms while increasing the land loss rate.
     * River diversions are one strategy to rebuild and replenish the
       wetland base that drives biological productivity on the coast.
     * Breaux Act projects from Priority Lists 1-7 are projected to stop
       14% of the loss over 20 years.
     * Caernarvon and Davis Pond Freshwater Diversions are projected to
       stop 9% of the basin wide loss over 20 years.

   3. What is the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration
   Act? Why is it important?
     * The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act
       (CWPPRA), also known as the Breaux Act, was signed into law in
       1990. It insures that state and federal monies ($40 million per
       year) are available for coastal restoration and conservation
       efforts.

   4. So if we have the Breaux Act, do we need more?
     * Yes! The Breaux Act was a good step, but it is not enough.
     * It is estimated that work authorized to date through this effort
       would reduce land loss by about 14%.

   Coast 2050

   5. What is Coast 2050 trying to accomplish?
     * Coast 2050's goal is to obtain public opinion and input on
       restoring our coast, from all marsh users and to use this
       information in the development of technically sound ecosystem
       management plans.
     * Coast 2050 seeks multiple-use objectives from the public so wetland
       restoration strategies can be developed with public input to meet
       these objectives.
     * If the entire public can recognize the consequence of no action,
       there may be a willingness to accept planned habitat and land
       changes in order to achieve long-term benefits of coastal
       restoration.
     * Coast 2050 seeks this public input, through such mechanisms as
       public meetings and local parish contacts.
     * The Coast 2050 effort is a way to discuss the needs of our coast
       and to plan to make it a great place to live for our children and
       grandchildren.

   6. What will Louisiana and the nation get for their money if we restore
   coastal marshes?
     * Protection of a commercial fishing industry that harvests more than
       1.1 billion pounds of finfish and shellfish annually.
     * Protection of habitat for more than 5 million wintering waterfowl.
     * Continued revenue from hunting, recreational fishing, and
       ecotourism. Recreational fishing revenues contribute more than $235
       million per year to Louisiana’s economy.
     * Protection of natural gas production worth $7.4 billion per year.
     * Protection of coastal zone refineries, which produce $30 billion
       worth of petroleum products every year.
     * Protection of a waterborne commerce industry that moves 400 million
       tons of products through coastal channels every year and handles
       more commodities than the entire west coast combined.
     * Assurance that our children and grandchildren will have these
       unique natural resources.
     * Protection of towns and cities in the coastal zone from damage by
       hurricanes and storms.

   7. Who is in charge of Coast 2050 ?
     * Coast 2050 is a partnership between the Breaux Act Task Force,
       chaired by Colonel Thomas F. Julich, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
       District Engineer; the State Wetlands Authority, chaired by Dr. Len
       Bahr, Governor Foster’s Executive Assistant for Coastal Activities;
       and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Coastal
       Zone Management Authority, which is under the administration of DNR
       Secretary Jack C. Caldwell. These three entities are ultimately in
       charge of guiding the Coast 2050 initiative.

   8. Who is on the Coast 2050 teams?
     * The Strategic Working Group makes policy and is comprised of
       representatives of the Breaux Act Task Force and the State Wetlands
       Authority.
     * The Coastal Zone Management Working Group consists of parish
       government. representatives and parish Coastal Zone Management
       Advisory Committees.
     * The Planning Management Team and Regional Teams consist of federal
       and state coastal scientists and engineers from agencies, academia,
       and the private sector. In addition, the Regional Teams have
       volunteers from the region.

   9. What can the average person do to get involved and help conserve our
   coast?
     * Through Coast 2050, public input and participation is being sought
       at a grander scale.
     * Come to Coast 2050 meetings in your region.
     * Tell us what you want your coast to look like in 2050.
     * Get involved with your local Coastal Zone Management Advisory
       Committee (CZMAC) or your local parish contact.
     * Tell your local officials of your hopes and concerns about the
       future.
     * Stay informed about coastal restoration in your area--what works
       and what doesn’t work.

   10. After the Coast 2050 strategic planning effort, how will concerns
   about a specific project be communicated to the agencies making project
   decisions?
     * Projects are recommended to the Breaux Act Task Force by agencies,
       local governments, landowners and the general public through a
       series of state wide meetings.
     * After projects are initially chosen by the Breaux Act Task Force
       (representatives of five federal agencies and the Governor’s Office
       of Coastal Activities), one of the federal agencies is identified
       as the lead agency.
     * The state of Louisiana, through the Department of Natural
       Resources, usually serves as the nonfederal sponsor (a 15% state
       match is required).
     * It is the responsibility of these agencies to keep local government
       and the public informed and to obtain comments through direct
       communication and public meetings.
     * Parish Coastal Zone Management groups often serves as points of
       local contact.
     * Local governments also serve as contact points with state and
       federal agencies.
     * Annual reports are presented to the Legislature and a comprehensive
       report is presented to the US Congress.

   11. How can the public be assured that projects work as proposed after
   project implementation?
     * The Breaux Act Restoration Plan provides for scientific monitoring
       of projects.
     * If a project is not meeting its goals, modifications are made.
       Sometimes it may be necessary to deactivate a project.
     * Science and engineering can sometimes produce unexpected outcomes;
       the best chance we have for building a project that works well is
       to have the best information on a project as early as possible. For
       this reason, qualified field biologists monitor project effects on
       water quality, hydrology, soils and sediments, vegetation,
       wildlife, and fisheries throughout the project life.

   12. Do we have to lose our levees to rebuild our marsh?
     * No!
     * Although levees and the leveeing off of the Mississippi River have
       been identified as one of many causes of coastal land loss, the
       Breaux Act Task Force and the State Wetlands Authority do not
       propose that we degrade existing levees.
     * The Coast 2050 effort is designed to recognize the value of our
       existing and proposed levee systems and other infrastructure and to
       account for such in coastal restoration planning.

   13. Is there an effort to educate young people regarding the land loss
   risks and restoration needs?
     * Yes. Programs such as the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service’s
       Marsh Maneuvers Program, the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary
       Program, and CD-ROMs produced under the Breaux Act, target young
       people from kindergarten through high school.
