   The Payments-Equal-To-Taxes (PETT) provisions of the Nuclear Waste
   Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA) (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.).provide
   that DOE will make these payments to eligible States, affected units of
   local government, and affected Indian Tribes for activities related to
   siting, development, and operation of a high-level radioactive waste
   and spent-fuel repository, and any monitored retrievable storage (MRS)
   facility. The scope of this Notice is limited to site characterization
   activities related to the repository or MRS facility. Development and
   operational phases of the repository and MRS facility will be addressed
   at a later date. The jurisdictions are eligible for payments equivalent
   to the amount they would receive if authorized to tax the Federal site
   characterization activities at such site.
