   Sky Survey Lowers Estimate of Asteroid Impact Risk

   The odds of earth suffering a catastrophic collision with an asteroid over
   the next century are about one in 5,000, which is less likely than previously
   believed, according to research published by astronomers at the Sloan Digital
   Sky Survey in the November 2001 issue of the Astronomical Journal.


   Asteroids

      January 14, 2002Astronomers using data from the Sloan Digital Sky
      Survey found that the solar system contains about 700,000 asteroids big
      enough to destroy civilization. That figure is about one-third the size
      of earlier estimates, which had put the number at around two million
      and the odds of collision at roughly one in 1,500 over a one
      hundred-year period.

      "Our estimate for the chance of a big impact contains some of the same
      uncertainties as previous estimates, but it is clear that we should
      feel somewhat safer than we did before we had the Sloan survey data,"
      said lead researcher Zeljko Ivezic of Princeton University.

   Brookhaven Physicists Produce "Doubly Strange Nuclei"


   Doubly Strange Nuclei

   Physicists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National
   Laboratory report the first large-scale production of nuclei containing two
   strange quarks.

      August 27, 2001Strange science has taken a great leap forward at the
      U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. There,
      physicists have produced a significant number of "doubly strange
      nuclei," or nuclei containing two strange quarks.

      Studies of these nuclei will help scientists explore the forces between
      nuclear particles, particularly within so-called strange matter, and
      may contribute to a better understanding of neutron stars, the
      superdense remains of burnt-out stars, which are thought to contain
      large quantities of strange quarks.
