                                 Black Holes

      There are many popular myths concerning black holes, many of them
   perpetuated by Hollywood. Television and movies have portrayed them as
     time-traveling tunnels to another dimension, cosmic vacuum cleaners
    sucking up everything in sight, and so on. It can be said that black
   holes are really just the evolutionary end point of massive stars. But
   somehow, this simple explanation makes them no easier to understand or
                              less mysterious.

   NOTE: This section is about what are called "stellar-mass black holes".
    For information about black holes with the mass of billions of Suns,
                       see Active Galaxies & Quasars .

                         Black Holes: What Are They?

    Black holes are the evolutionary endpoints of stars at least 10 to 15
   times as massive as the Sun. If a star that massive or larger undergoes
   a supernova explosion, it may leave behind a fairly massive burned out
   stellar remnant. With no outward forces to oppose gravitational forces,
    the remnant will collapse in on itself. The star eventually collapses
     to the point of zero volume and infinite density, creating what is
   known as a " singularity ". As the density increases, the path of light
   rays emitted from the star are bent and eventually wrapped irrevocably
    around the star. Any emitted photons are trapped into an orbit by the
   intense gravitational field; they will never leave it. Because no light
    escapes after the star reaches this infinite density, it is called a
                                 black hole.

      But contrary to popular myth, a black hole is not a cosmic vacuum
   cleaner. If our Sun was suddenly replaced with a black hole of the same
         mass, the only thing that would change would be the Earth's
   temperature. To be "sucked" into a black hole, one has to cross inside
   the Schwarzschild radius. At this radius, the escape speed is equal to
      the speed of light, and once light passes through, even it cannot
                                   escape.

      The Schwarzschild radius can be calculated using the equation for
                                escape speed.
                            v[esc] = (2GM/R)^1/2
   For photons, or objects with no mass, we can substitute c (the speed of
        light) for V[esc] and find the Schwarzschild radius, R, to be
                                 R = 2GM/c^2

             If We Can't See Them, How Do We Know They're There?

                                 HDE 226868

   Since black holes are small (only a few to a few tens of kilometers in
   size), and light that would allow us to see them cannot escape, a black
   hole floating alone in space would be hard, if not impossible, to see.
   For instance, the photograph above shows the optical companion star to
                the (invisible) black hole candidate Cyg X-1.

   However, if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter,
   or is close to another "normal" star, the black hole can accrete matter
    into itself. As the matter falls or is pulled towards the black hole,
   it gains kinetic energy, heats up and is squeezed by tidal forces. The
      heating ionizes the atoms, and when the atoms reach a few million
    degrees Kelvin, they emit X-rays. The X-rays are sent off into space
   before the matter crosses the Schwarzschild radius and crashes into the
              singularity. Thus we can see this X-ray emission.

       Binary X-ray sources are also places to find strong black hole
   candidates. A companion star is a perfect source of infalling material
    for a black hole. A binary system also allows the calculation of the
       black hole candidate's mass. Once the mass is found, it can be
   determined if the candidate is a neutron star or a black hole. Another
     sign of the presence of a black hole is random variation of emitted
    X-rays. The infalling matter that emits X-rays does not fall into the
   black hole at a steady rate, but rather more sporadically, which causes
   an observable variation in X-ray intensity. Additionally, if the X-ray
    source is in a binary system, the X-rays will be periodically cut off
   as the source is eclipsed by the companion star. When looking for black
    hole candidates, all these things are taken into account. Many X-ray
      satellites have scanned the skies for X-ray sources that might be
                       possible black hole candidates.

    Cygnus X-1 is the longest known of the black hole candidates. It is a
   highly variable and irregular source with X-ray emission that flickers
    in hundredth of a second bursts. Because nothing can exceed the speed
    of light, an object cannot flicker faster than the time required for
    light to travel across the object. In a hundredth of a second, light
   travels 3000 kilometers. Thus, Cyg X-1 must be smaller than Earth! Its
        companion star, HDE 226868 is a B0 supergiant with a surface
   temperature of about 31,000 K. Spectroscopic observations show that the
   spectral lines of HDE 226868 shift back and forth with a period of 5.6
   days. From the mass-luminosity relation, the mass of this supergiant is
   calculated as 30 times the mass of the Sun. Cyg X-1 must have a mass of
    about 7 solar masses or else it would not exert enough gravitational
    pull to cause the wobble in the spectral lines of HDE 226868. Since 7
   solar masses is too large to be a white dwarf or neutron star, it must
                              be a black hole.

                        Diagram of Cygnus X-1 system

    However, there are arguments against Cyg X-1 being a black hole. HDE
    2268686 might be undermassive for its spectral type, which would make
        Cyg X-1 less massive than previously calculated. In addition,
   uncertainties in the distance to the binary system would also influence
    mass calculations. All of these uncertainties can make a case for Cyg
   X-1 having only 3 solar masses, thus allowing for the possibility that
                            it is a neutron star.

   Nonetheless, there are now about 10 binaries for which the evidence for
    a black hole is much stronger than in Cygnus X-1. The first of these,
     an X-ray transient called A0620-00, was discovered in 1975, and the
      mass of the compact object was determined in the mid-1980's to be
     greater than 3.5 solar masses. This very clearly excludes a neutron
    star, even allowing for all known theoretical uncertainties. The best
   case for a black hole is probably V404 Cygni, whose compact star is at
      least 10 solar masses. With improved instrumentation, the pace of
   discovery has accelerated over the last five years or so, and the list
      of dynamically confirmed blackh hole binaries is growing rapidly.

                     What about all the Wormhole Stuff?

      Unfortunately, worm holes are more science fiction than they are
    science fact. A wormhole is a theoretical opening in space-time that
    one could use to travel to far away places very quickly. The wormhole
   itself is two copies of the black hole geometry connected by a throat -
    the throat, or passageway, is called an Einstein-Rosen bridge. It has
    never been proven that worm holes exist and there is no experimental
   evidence for them, but it is fun to think about the possibilities their
                           existence might create.
