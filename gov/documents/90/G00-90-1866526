   BROAD BAND SEISMOGRAMS OF THE 2001 JAN13 NE AR EL SALVADOR EARTHQUAKE
   jl

This is a broadband seismogram digitized in 20 24 bit samples per second
by the Guralp CMG-3TD seismometer in the Leonard underground vault. The
seismometer detects vertical, North-South, and East-West ground motion.
However the N-S and E-W were rotated by trigonometric multiplication of the
digits to produce RADIAL (horizontal motion toward and away from the direction
to the epicenter), and TRANSVERSE (motion perpendicular to the direction
to the epicenter) traces. This completely separates the Love (LQ seen only on
transverse), and Rayleigh (LR seen on vertical and radial) surface waves.
As expected, the P wave is almost absent on the transverse.

The red box on the vertical seismogram shows the largest Rayleigh wave,
which has a peak to trough value of 3.366 million digital counts. This
indicates a vertical earth motion near Leonard of 2.291 millimeters. From
this amplitude, and the distance from Leonard to the epicenter (23.83
Great Circle Degrees) a surface wave magnitude of 7.5 was calculated.
