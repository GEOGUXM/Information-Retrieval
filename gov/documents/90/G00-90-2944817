                       RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION LIMITS

                                January 2002

   Beginning in 2002, Congress enacted new federal tax laws that would
   increase the maximum allowable contributions to individual retirement
   accounts. However, the State of California has not enacted similar laws
   and as a result there is a discrepancy in the tax treatment of the
   contributions between the federal and state laws. To help correct this
   discrepancy, I've called on Governor Davis to take a lead on bringing
   parity between federal and state law.

   If you're interested in reading more about this issue, I recommend
   reading an article in the San Francisco Chronicle which explains the
   discrepancy and its implications in more detail. My office also stands
   ready to answer any questions you may have.
