Field Name: Additional Fields:

   In addition to the field labels on the form, at the bottom of the form
   is a field containing a list of field names. This is known as a
   multipurpose field. You can search any of the listed fields by
   selecting its name from the droplist and entering a seach value in the
   box to the right of the multipurpose field. Use an asterisk (*) for a
   wildcard.

   Searching multiple fields:
   Choose appropriate field connector from droplist box at the bottom of
   the search form.

   Search Examples

   Sort Options:
   You may sort your search results by any of the fields in the droplist
   box at the bottom of the search form. You may also sort them in either
   ascending or descending order. If you select $RANK as the sort
   criterion, then the documents will be sorted according to how many hits
   were found in each. (A hit is a term in the document that matches the
   search value you specified.) If you keep the default value of NONE,
   then the documents will not be sorted.

   Note: When you specify $RANK for the Sort By box, the system will list
   the documents in descending order no matter what value you have
   selected in the Sort Order box.
