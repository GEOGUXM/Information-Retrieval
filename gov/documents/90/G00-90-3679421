Check Status

   You can use the application status check to check the status of your
   FAFSA or correction at any point during the processing period.

   Checking the status of your application at any time during the
   processing period is beneficial, but we recommend you at least check
   the status at the following times:

     * 1 week after submission - if you used a PIN to sign your
       application
     * 2-3 weeks after submission - if you printed, signed and mailed a
       signature page.

   Helpful Hint: If you printed out the Electronic Filing Instructions
   when you filed your Web application, write down the dates you checked
   the status.

   If you've already checked the status of your processed application and
   would like to view your application data, select this link. (Note: you
   must have a U.S. Department of Education PIN.)
