   5. MAIN INJECTOR PERFORMANCE GOALS* 5.1 Project Overview This chapter
   contains a description of the design and construction schedule of the
   Fermilab Main Injector (FMI) Project. The technical, cost, and schedule
   baselines for the FMI Project have been established and may be found in
   the Fermilab Main Injector Title I Design Report, Revision 0, issued in
   August 1992. The FMI Technical Design Handbook (TDH) updates and
   expands upon the design and schedule for construction of all subsystem
   components and associated civil construction described in the Title I
   Design Report. The facilities described in the TDH have been designed
   in conformance with DOE 6430.1A, "United States Department of Energy
   General Design Criteria." The purpose of the Fermilab Main Injector
   Project is to construct a new 150 GeV accelerator, and all required
   interconnections and interfaces to the existing accelerator complex, on
   the Fermilab site in support of the Fermilab High Energy Physics (HEP)
   research program. The construction of this accelerator will result
   simultaneously in significant enhancements to both the Fermilab
   collider and fixed target programs. The FMI is located south of the
   Antiproton Source and tangent to the Tevatron ring at the F0 straight
   section. The FMI will assume all duties formerly required of the Main
   Ring. Using the FMI reduces the background rates seen in the colliding
   beam detectors. The performance of the FMI, as measured in terms of
   protons per second delivered to the antiproton production target or
   total protons delivered to the Tevatron, is expected to substantially
   exceed that of the Main Ring. In addition the FMI will provide high
   duty factor 120 GeV beam to the experimental areas during collider
   operation, a capability which did not exist in the Main Ring. The
   location, operating energy, and mode of construction of the FMI were
   chosen to minimize operational impacts on Fermilab's ongoing High
   Energy Physics program. The area in which the FMI was situated was
   devoid of any underground utilities which might be disturbed during
   construction, while the separation between the FMI and Tevatron was
   sufficient to allow construction concurrent with Tevatron operations.
   The energy capability of the FMI was chosen to match the antiproton
   production and Tevatron injection energies presently used in the
   Fermilab complex. The FMI is being built from newly constructed dipole
   magnets, thereby allowing a large portion of the installation process
   to proceed independently of Tevatron operations. The use of newly
   designed dipoles was also desirable from the standpoint of enhanced
   performance and reliability, and will result in a reduction of the
   operating costs by 33% relative to what would be obtained by recycling
   existing Main Ring magnets. The Total Project Cost (TPC) of the FMI is
   estimated to be $259,300,000, including a Total Estimated Construction
   Cost (TECC) of $229,600,000 and $29,700,000 in associated R&D,
   pre-operating, capital equipment, conceptual design, and spares costs.
   Included within the scope of the project are all technical and civil
   construction components associated with the ring itself, with beam
   lines needed to tie the ring into the existing accelerator complex, and
   with modifications to the Tevatron and switchyard required to
   accommodate the relocated injections. The project involves the
   construction of 15,000 ft of tunnel enclosures, 11 service buildings,
   and a new 345 kV substation. Construction on the FMI project was
   initiated in June, 1992. Construction will be largely completed late in
   1998. Design of civil construction has been done by an outside * Last
   revised on March 20, 1998. 5.1 Architectural Engineering firm, Fluor
   Daniel, with support from the Beams Division and from Fermilab
   Engineering Support Section. Design of technical components has been
   done by Beams and Technical Division personnel. 5. 1. 1 Role In The
   Fermilab III Program The Fermilab Main Injector is the centerpiece of
   Fermilab's initiative for the 1990s, known as Fermilab III. Some of the
   more important goals of Fermilab III are to illuminate the properties
   of the top quark, the most recently discovered fundamental building
   block of matter, to provide a factor of two increase in the mass scales
   characterizing possible extensions to the Standard Model, and to
   support new initiatives in neutral kaon physics and neutrino
   oscillation investigations. In order to reach these goals Fermilab is
   planning to attain by the end of the year 2000 a luminosity in excess
   of 5×1031 cm-2sec-1 in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. Several
   projects have been completed over the past four years that have
   resulted in a factor of 25 improvement over the initial 1.0x1030
   cm-2sec-1 design luminosity of the Tevatron collider. These include
   upgrades to the Antiproton Source, development of new low- systems
   which have allowed the implementation of a second high luminosity
   interaction region, development of separators to allow multi-bunch
   operation, an upgrade of the linac energy from 200 MeV to 400 MeV, and
   the installation of cold compressors to lower the temperature of the
   Tevatron. As a result of these enhancements, the Tevatron operated
   during Run Ib with initial luminosities in the range of 1.52.5×1031
   cm-2sec-1. Further improvements to performance require the construction
   of the FMI. The present bottleneck in the production of antiprotons and
   in the delivery of intense beams to the Tevatron is the Main Ring. The
   Main Ring is not capable of accelerating the quantity of protons which
   can be provided at injection by the 8 GeV Booster. This is for the
   simple reason that the aperture of the Main Ring (12 mm-mr) is about
   half the size of the Booster aperture (20 mm-mr). (These emittances are
   95% normalized values.) As a result the Booster is typically run well
   below its full capability during normal operations. The restricted
   aperture in the Main Ring is due to perturbations to the ring which
   have been required for the integration of overpasses and new injection
   and extraction systems related to operations with antiprotons. With the
   400 MeV Linac upgrade the Booster aperture at injection has increased
   to 30 mm-mr due to increased adiabatic damping within the new linac,
   and the ability to produce larger antiproton stacks has been increased.
   However, the mismatches between Booster/Antiproton Source and Main Ring
   capabilities have become even more acute. Only with the construction of
   the FMI will these mismatches be removed, and the full benefit to the
   collider and fixed target programs of the recently completed upgrade
   projects be realized. The construction of the FMI will also provide
   beams of up to 3×1013 protons at 120 GeV to the experimental areas
   during collider runs. Such beams are envisioned as being used for
   detector development and for supporting fixed target experiments such
   as rare K decay and neutrino experiments which can benefit from the
   high average intensity deliverable from the FMI. The Main Ring as
   presently configured does not support a slow spill, nor is it felt that
   implementation of a high intensity slow spill in the existing ring
   would be feasible in light of the small machine aperture and the need
   to minimize backgrounds in the collider experiments. Specifically,
   benefits expected from the construction of the FMI include: 1. An
   increase in the number of protons targeted for antiproton production
   from the current 4.8×1015/hour to 1.2×1016/hour. 5.2 2. An increase in
   the total number of protons which can be delivered to the Tevatron for
   fixed target to 6×1013. 3. The ability to accelerate efficiently
   antiprotons originating in stacks containing more than 2×1012
   antiprotons for injection into the Tevatron collider. 4. The ability to
   produce proton bunches containing as many as 3×1011 protons for
   injection into the Tevatron collider. 5. The reduction of backgrounds
   and dead time at the CDF and D0 detectors through removal of the Main
   Ring from the Tevatron enclosure. 6. Provision for slow extracted beams
   at 120 GeV year-round and potential development of very high intensity,
   high duty factor (>1×1013 protons/sec at 120 GeV with 34% duty factor)
   beams for use in high sensitivity K decay and neutrino experiments. It
   is expected that with the construction of the FMI and the completion of
   planned improvements to the Antiproton Source the antiproton production
   rate will be 2×1011 antiprotons/hour, and that a luminosity in the
   range 820×1031cm-2sec-1 will be supportable in the Tevatron collider
   during Run II. 5. 1. 2 Performance The FMI parameter list is given in
   Table 5.1. It is anticipated that the FMI will perform at a
   significantly higher level than the existing Main Ring as measured
   either in terms of protons delivered per cycle, protons delivered per
   second, and transmission efficiency. For the most part expected
   improvements in performance are directly related to the optics of the
   ring. The FMI ring lies in a plane with stronger focusing per unit
   length than the Main Ring. This means that the maximum -functions are
   half as large and the maximum (horizontal) dispersion only a third of
   the Main Ring, while vertical dispersion is nonexistent. As a result
   physical beam sizes associated with given transverse and longitudinal
   emittances are significantly reduced compared to the Main Ring. The
   elimination of dispersion in the rf regions, raising the level of the
   injection field, elimination of sagitta, and improved field quality in
   the dipoles all have a beneficial impact on beam dynamics. The
   construction of new, mechanically simpler magnets is expected to yield
   a highly reliable machine. The FMI is seven times the circumference of
   the Booster and slightly more than half the circumference of the
   existing Main Ring and Tevatron. Six Booster cycles will be required to
   fill the FMI and two FMI cycles to fill the Tevatron. The FMI is
   designed to have a transverse admittance of 40 mm-mr (both planes,
   normalized at 8.9 GeV/c). This is a factor of three larger than that of
   the existing Main Ring. It is expected that the Booster will be capable
   of delivering a beam intensity in the range 5-7×1012 protons per batch
   with 20-30 mm-mr transverse and ~0.2 eV-sec longitudinal emittance in
   Run II. A single Booster batch needs to be accelerated for antiproton
   production while six such batches are required to fill the FMI. The FMI
   should be capable of accepting and accelerating these protons without
   significant beam loss or degradation of beam quality. Yields out of the
   FMI for a full ring are expected to lie in the range 3-4x1013 protons
   (6-8×1013 delivered to the Tevatron for fixed target). By way of
   contrast, the existing Main Ring is capable of accelerating fewer than
   3×1013 protons in 12 batches for delivery to the Tevatron. 5.3 Table

   Quadrupole Busses 2 The power supply and magnet system is designed to
   allow a significant increase in the number of 120 GeV acceleration
   cycles that can be run each hour for antiproton production, as well as
   to allow a 120 GeV slow spill with a 35% duty factor. The cycle time at
   120 GeV can be as low as 1.5 seconds. This is believed to represent the
   maximum rate at which the Antiproton Source could stack antiprotons,
   and is to be compared to the current Main Ring capability of 2.4
   seconds. The FMI dipole magnets are designed with twice the total cross
   section of copper and half as many turns as existing Main Ring dipoles.
   This keeps the total power dissipated in the dipoles during 5.4
   antiproton production at roughly the same level as in present
   operations while keeping the number of power supplies and service
   buildings low. The 344 dipole magnets are excited by 12 power supplies
   located in six service buildings. With the major exception of the
   dipoles, existing components from the Main Ring are, for the most part,
   recycled. Such components specifically include quadrupoles and the
   radio frequency (rf) systems. The use of all 18 existing rf cavities in
   a ring roughly half the size of the Main Ring will support an
   acceleration rate of 240 GeV/sec compared to 120 GeV/sec in the present
   Main Ring. 5. 1. 3 Operational Modes At least four distinct roles for
   the FMI have been identified along with four corresponding acceleration
   cycles for the configuration of the FMI in the absence of the Recycler.
   Operation of the Recycler for storing antiprotons or for cooling
   protons for the Collider does not require any additional cycles, but it
   does change some of the details of how the Collider filling operation
   is done. The one operation that is new with the Recycler is
   decelerating antiprotons which have been recovered from the Collider.
   The operating modes are listed in Table 5.2. More detailed descriptions
   of the acceleration cycles and power supply requirements are given
   below. 1) Antiproton Production. In the antiproton production mode a
   single Booster batch containing 5×1012 protons is injected into the FMI
   at 8.9 GeV. These protons are accelerated to 120 GeV and extracted in a
   single turn for delivery to the antiproton production target. As
   mentioned earlier, it is anticipated that with this flux of protons
   onto the target and expected improvements in the Antiproton Source the
   antiproton production rate will exceed 1.7×1011/hour. 2) Main Injector
   Fixed Target. A much higher intensity, high duty factor (34%) beam can
   be delivered at 120 GeV with a 2.9 second cycle time. The average
   proton current delivered is about 2 µA (3×1013 protons/2.9 seconds).
   Running in this mode does not put any peak power demands on the power
   supply system beyond those imposed by the antiproton production cycle,
   but it does expend 67% more average power. This cycle can also be used
   to provide test beams to the experimental areas during collider
   running. In this instance it is likely that a much lower cycle rate,
   accompanied by a much lower average power, would satisfy experimenters'
   needs. Additionally, a high intensity, low duty factor beam can be
   delivered at 120 GeV with a 1.9 second cycle time for the production of
   high flux neutrino beams. 3) Tevatron Fixed Target. For Tevatron fixed
   target injection, the FMI is filled with six Booster batches, each
   containing 5×1012 protons at 8.9 GeV. Since the Booster cycles at 15
   Hz, 0.4 seconds are required to fill the FMI. The beam is accelerated
   to 150 GeV, cogged, and extracted in a single turn for delivery to the
   Tevatron. The FMI is capable of cycling to 150 GeV every 2.4 seconds
   for short periods of time. Two FMI cycles are required to fill the
   Tevatron at 150 GeV at one minute intervals. 4) Collider Operation. The
   FMI operates on a 4 second, 150 GeV cycle for delivery of coalesced
   proton beams to the Tevatron for collider operations. A 1.45 second
   flattop is provided for bunch coalescing at flattop. Phase-locking to
   the Tevatron and synchronization of the transfer requires a few tens of
   milliseconds. Depending on the multi-bunch coalescing efficiency, 1, 2,
   3, or 4 bunches will be accelerated per cycle. A total of 36, 18, 12,
   or 9 Main Injector cycles would be required, respectively, depending on
   the number of bunches per cycle. 5.5 The antiproton cycles are slower
   because of the unique rf manipulations described in section 5.5.2 and
   section 5.5.3. The ramps for acceleration and deceleration will be
   similar, and four bunches of antiprotons will be accelerated (or
   decelerated) per cycle. Combinations of the above operational modes are
   also possible. One such example is simultaneous operation for
   antiproton production and high intensity slow spill. One could load the
   FMI with six Booster batches containing 3x1013 protons, accelerate to
   120 GeV, extract one batch fast to the antiproton production target,
   and extract the remainder of the beam slowly over a second. This would
   produce slightly more than half the antiproton flux into the Source and
   83% of the average MI fixed-target intensity of the dedicated scenarios
   listed in Table 5.2. Table 5.2 Main Injector Cycle Parameters. "Booster
   Cycles" is the number of cycles required per Main Injector cycle. "MI
   Cycles" is the number of Main Injector cycles required to fill the

   varies *The rise time of the existing Tevatron proton injection kicker
   is too slow to inject two groups of 6 batches into the Tevatron. The
   new short batch kicker will have a fast enough rise time provided that
   an appropriate pulse forming network is built. The momentum program and
   the resulting total dipole bus voltage for each acceleration cycle have
   been calculated, using conservative extrapolations from Main Ring
   practice and not requiring the rf or power supplies to run close to
   design limits. The bus resistance is assumed to be 0.30 , and the
   inductance is 0.67 H. The lower resistance (relative to the value of
   0.32 used in Title 1) allows increasing the ramp rate to 270 GeV/c/s
   while limiting the power supply voltage to ~11,500 V. The 2.8667 sec,
   120 GeV cycle has been assumed to be run in rapid succession for
   calculations of rms power when designing the cooling systems and pond
   sizes, and for determining feeder currents and capacities. (The cycle
   times are required to be a multiple of the Booster 15-Hz repetition
   period, 0.0667 sec.) A useful variant on the 120 GeV fixed target
   cycles is to fast extract one Booster batch for antiproton production
   before resonantly extracting to the switchyard. This approach, referred
   to as "mixed mode", is extremely attractive for fulfilling the demand
   for protons per hour. The sixth Booster batch is injected into the
   center of the 3.2 µsec gap that exists after the first five batches are
   injected. The beam is accelerated to 120 GeV, the sixth batch is
   extracted in a single turn to the antiproton production target, and
   then the remaining beam is extracted by resonant extraction to 5.6
   Switchyard. For a loss of 17% in fixed target intensity the two types
   of operation are efficiently combined. The loss in stacking rate is
   about 50% when the long spill is needed but only about 20% when the
   short spill is used. The interleaving of single-purpose cycles is less
   efficient. For example, when a slow spill cycle is interleaved with an
   antiproton production cycle, the slow spill flux is reduced by a third,
   and the antiproton production is reduced by two thirds. The expected
   numbers of protons per hour that can be delivered in the various modes
   are given in Table 5.3. The Tevatron is filled for fixed target physics
   by two FMI injection cycles. Average feeder power sets a limit on the
   frequency of the injection cycles; they can not be repeated more than a
   few times per Tevatron cycle. The operating limits for the magnet power
   supply and the rf systems are discussed in the TDH. Table 5.3. Protons

   bunch and additional time required for bunch manipulations and turning
   off magnetic switch at F17 in mixed modes. There are two accelerator
   physics concerns which could lead to changes in the details of the
   magnet ramps, especially the initial parabola. The first relates to the
   Main Ring experience that bunches are seriously disturbed if the
   synchrotron frequency approaches 720 Hz for even a few milliseconds.
   Although the FMI has improvements on the Main Ring magnet power supply,
   there is some possibility that the initial parabola might need to be
   slowed down to provide adequate bucket area without approaching this
   critical value for the synchrotron frequency. It is not anticipated
   that this will be a dominant concern because it will be possible to
   pass through the 720 Hz region quite fast from a higher value. On the
   other hand, it may be highly advantageous to speed up the initial
   parabola as much as the rf and power supplies will allow to pass the
   transition energy quickly. There is further discussion of transition
   crossing later in this section, and in the TDH. 5.2 Lattice and
   Performance Simulations The Fermilab Main Injector is situated in the
   southwest corner of the Fermilab site. The details of its location are
   determined by requirements for transfers of both protons and
   antiprotons into the Tevatron. The MI-60 straight section is parallel
   to the Tevatron F0 straight section, separated from it by 11.823 m (38'
   9.5") horizontally and 2.3253 m (7' 7.5") vertically. The reference
   point defining the plane containing the Main Injector design orbit lies
   at the intersection of a line from the center of the Tevatron ring and
   passing near F0 normal to the F0 straight section, and a line parallel
   to the MI-60 straight section and equidistant from the MI-60 and MI-30
   straight sections. Gravity at this point defines the normal to the
   plane. The plane containing the Main Injector orbit dips at an angle of
   0.231 milliradians (47.65") toward the southwest corner (project
   coordinates) of the site. 5.7 The nominal elevation of the FMI was
   specified in earlier design reports to be 2.332 m below the Tevatron
   beam. To account for the relative tilt of the Tevatron and the FMI, it
   is now specified that MI-52 and MI-62 are placed at this elevation. The
   line from MI-52 to MI-62 is offset 28.789277 m from the MI-60 straight
   section and parallel to it. The tilt of the FMI then places the MI-60
   straight section 2.3253 m below the Tevatron beam line. The FMI
   contains eight straight sections; their numbering and their functions
   are as follows: MI-10 - 8 GeV proton injection MI-22 - (unused) MI-30 -
   (unused) MI-32 - (unused) MI-40 - proton abort MI-52 - 150/120 GeV
   proton extraction; 8 GeV antiproton injection MI-60 - FMI rf section
   MI-62 - 150 GeV antiproton extraction The straight sections are capable
   of beam extraction at 150 GeV. Due to the fact the ring lies 11 meters
   from the Tevatron, two of these (MI-52, MI-62) are required to provide
   injection into the Tevatron, one each for protons and antiprotons. On
   the opposite side of the ring two straight sections (MI-22, MI-32) are
   added for symmetry. MI-10 is necessary for injection of protons from
   the Booster, and MI-40 is placed symmetrically for the proton abort.
   The FMI is designed to accelerate beams of energy 8 GeV to 150 GeV from
   the Booster, the Recycler, and the antiproton source. The FMI lattice
   has two different types of cells, the normal 17.2886-meter FODO cells
   and the 12.9665-meter FODO dispersion-suppressor cells. The lattice has
   two different length dipoles: 6 m and 4 m. Also there are three
   different lengths of quadrupoles: 2.13 m for normal cells, 2.95 m for
   dispersion suppressor cells, and 2.54 m at the boundary between the two
   types of cells. The dispersion suppressor cells have shorter dipoles (4
   m), and match the horizontal dispersion to zero in the straight
   sections. The FMI lattice has fewer magnets than the Main Ring. This
   requires higher field dipoles and larger bending angles. The resulting
   sagitta in a 6 m dipole is 16 mm. The new dipoles are being built with
   a curvature which eliminates loss of aperture due to sagitta. A 90o
   phase advance per cell is chosen, resulting in a maximum in the cell of
   58 m and a maximum in the cell of 1.9 m. The vertical dispersion in FMI
   is very small. The Main Ring has maximum and of 110 m and 6.6 m
   respectively. In the lattice design, the beta function and the
   dispersion are kept small to have minimal effect on the beam size. The
   beam size due to transverse emittance is only 70% of what it is in Main
   Ring and the maximum beam size due to momentum spread is down by a
   factor of 3. The ring is designed to have twofold rotational symmetry.

   of errors Simulations have been made to investigate the performance of
   the Main Injector by using the code TEAPOT. Closed orbit errors and
   their corrections were analyzed. The extent to which field errors
   perturb beta functions and dispersion functions was explored. The
   variation of the betatron tunes, Qx and Qy, with respect to betatron
   amplitudes was recorded, and the expected dynamic aperture was
   predicted. All the results quoted here refer to simulations of the Main
   Injector at its most critical time, injection, when the beam is stored
   for approximately 35,000 turns at an energy of 8.9 GeV. All simulations
   were performed with the alignment errors of Table 5.4 and the magnetic
   field errors of Table 5.5. Table 5.4. Random misalignment errors used
   in the Main Injector tracking simulations. Magnet type h (mm) v (mm)

   and Table 5.5 is too lengthy to be included here, some comments are in
   order. Multipole field errors for dipoles are 5.9 quoted in units of
   10-4 at a displacement of one inch. "Short" dipoles will be constructed
   to have 2/3 the magnetic length of the "long" dipoles, 6.096 meters, at
   the slow extraction energy of 120 GeV. Long dipoles nominally bend the
   beam through an angle of 6 /904 radians. At 8.9 GeV injection, the
   magnetic lengths of long and short dipoles are 0.3 mm longer than their
   nominal values, 6.096 and 4.064 meters respectively, at 120 GeV. This
   is reflected in the non-zero dipole multipole in the dipole ends. The
   average effect of this magnetic lengthening is compensated by
   decreasing the dipole excitation, as reflected in the non-zero dipole
   component of the dipole body. The remaining relative error between long
   and short dipoles has a significant but easily correctable effect on
   uncorrected closed orbit errors. Figure 5.2 shows the field profile of
   the Main Injector dipole field at various energies. Table 5.5. Magnetic

   orbit and betatron function errors Figure 5.3 shows two superimposed
   histograms, representing the distribution of uncorrected horizontal and

   used to construct independent sets of random errors. The average values
   over all the seeds of the root mean square orbit deviation for each
   particular seed is 5.0 mm in the horizontal, and 3.9 mm in the
   vertical. In order to correct these orbits for a typical seed, the
   maximum required corrector strength is less than 100 µr in both the
   horizontal and vertical planes. A typical uncorrected closed orbit is
   shown in Figure 5.4, where the two traces represent horizontal and
   vertical displacements. After three iterations of the orbit correction
   scheme, the average root mean square closed orbit deviation is reduced
   to 4.8×10-4 mm in the horizontal, and 1.0×10-8 mm in the vertical. 5.11

   versus amplitude and dynamic aperture results The long-time behavior of
   the Main Injector at injection was tested by launching an array of
   particles at different amplitudes. In what follows, a test particle is
   labeled with an amplitude of A millimeters when, in the absence of
   nonlinear phase space distortions, it achieves a maximum horizontal
   displacement of A at a location where the horizontal beta function is
   70 m. This value is chosen as a conservative maximum beta value-see
   Figure 5.1. The maximum vertical displacement of the same particle is
   0.4 A, also at a beta of 70 m. Synchrotron oscillations were included
   in the simulation by launching all test particles with an amplitude of
   max = ( p/p)max = 0.002, corresponding to twice the root mean square
   momentum width of the beam. Net chromaticities in both planes were set
   to dQ/d = -5, a conservatively large value with the correct sign to
   combat the head-tail instability. Base tunes of (Qx,Qy) =
   (26.425,25.415) were used in all the simulations, with unoptimized
   fractional tunes that were derived as follows. Slow extraction requires
   that the horizontal tune be moved onto the half integer without
   crossing a major resonance. It is conventional practice to operate near
   the tune diagonal, but with the tunes separated by, say, 0.01, with the
   horizontal tune larger to avoid crossing the coupling resonance during
   slow extraction. Finally, all test particles had a tune modulation
   amplitude in both planes of 0.01, due to non-zero 5.13 net chromaticity
   and finite amplitude synchrotron oscillations. It is necessary to be at
   least this far from major resonances. Assuming that the 2/5 resonance
   is the resonance closest to the half integer that must be avoided, all
   of the above conditions are satisfied if Qy > 25.41, Qx = Qy + 1 + 0.01
   The base tunes were moved an extra 0.005 away from the 2/5 resonance,
   without getting unduly close to the half integer. Figure 5.6 shows the
   variation of horizontal and vertical tunes in the Main Injector as the
   amplitude of motion was increased, for a typical seed. The numbers on
   the tune plane plot correspond to the amplitude of a test particle, in
   millimeters. Points on the plot lie on a straight line up to an
   amplitude of about 20 mm, with the spacing between points increasing
   linearly. That is, both horizontal and vertical tunes depend
   quadratically on amplitude, for moderate amplitudes. This octupolar
   detuning is dominated by a combination of the systematic octupole error
   in the recycled Main Ring quadrupoles, and second order sextupolar
   effects. Points with an amplitude above 28 mm did not survive for the
   full 35,000 turns of the simulation, for this particular seed. y 0.42

   amplitude of the smallest amplitude particle that does not survive for
   35,000 turns, then the dynamic aperture for the Main Injector at the
   injection energy is predicted to be 30.6 ± 0.5 mm, corresponding to a
   normalized emittance of 127 ± 4 mm-mr. 5.14 40000.0 35000.0 30000.0

   The Main Injector, as discussed above, has a dynamic aperture at
   injection of over 120 mm-mr, corresponding to ±30.6 mm amplitude in the
   horizontal plane. The injection and extraction regions, as discussed in
   more detail in the TDH, unfortunately require physical restrictions
   near the center of the aperture. While these devices limit the
   available physical aperture, it is still substantially greater than 40
   mm-mr. To preserve the large physical aperture, good closed orbit
   control is required, especially at injection. To ease demands on the
   dipole correction elements, it is intended to induce closed orbit
   distortions at the extraction-device locations by intentionally
   misaligning quadrupoles in a controlled manner. In the vertical plane,
   the dipole beam tube has an inner dimension of ~±24 mm, corresponding
   to an admittance of over 80 mm-mr at injection and at a of 60 m. The
   injection devices will likely limit the emittance of the injected beam
   (but not the circulating beam) to somewhat less than this, but still
   provide an aperture much larger than what is required. 5.4 Transverse
   Emittance The Main Injector and associated transfer lines were designed
   originally to accept 40 mm- mr 8 GeV proton and antiproton beams.
   Continuing improvements in Booster operation, however, have since
   reduced transverse proton emittances below 20 mm-mr. In addition, pbar
   emittance is also anticipated to be less than 20 mm-mr. Emittance
   dilution will result primarily from position and optical mismatches in
   transferring the beams between machines.1 An injection error in
   position and/or angle produces an oscillation which eventually
   decoheres and manifests itself as emittance growth in the beam.
   Simulations of beam transport in 5.15 the 8 GeV proton line including
   random field and alignment errors indicate that this effect will
   neither be excessive nor completely negligible. For 20 error sets the
   injection position mismatches were found to be x(rms) = 0.39 mm and
   y(rms) = 0.14 mm-comparable to the assumed random alignment errors.2 At
   mid Q101 ( x = 10m & y = 60m) this translates into < 0.5 growth
   horizontally and essentially zero growth vertically for a 20 mm-mr
   beam. A dispersion mismatch corresponds to a position error for
   off-momentum particles. However, since the transfer lines are matched
   to the zero dispersion of the Main Injector straight sections,
   emittance growth from this source is not expected to be a problem. At
   Q101, with a momentum spread p/p = 10-3, dispersion would need to be
   mismatched by at least = 1.0 m for emittance to grow by 0.5 . An
   optical mismatch in the amplitude will also lead to emittance dilution,
   but the penalty is less severe in this case than for position errors.
   The transfer lines are capable of matching into ±20% variations of the
   amplitudes from their design values. Even for a beam line-machine
   mismatch as large as / = 0.25, however, transverse emittance grows by
   only 0.5 for a 20 mm-mr beam. 5.5 Longitudinal Considerations and
   Emittance Projections 5. 5. 1 Proton Acceleration and Coalescing Proton
   acceleration and coalescing will be similar to the process in the Main
   Ring in previous collider runs. Five to seven bunches containing 6×1010
   protons in a 0.2 eV-sec emittance will be accelerated to flat top. A
   flat top the bunches will be coalesced into a single bunch of 27×1010
   protons in a 1.5 to 2.0 eV-sec emittance. 5. 5. 2 Antiproton
   Acceleration The cooled antiproton bunches will be synchronously
   transferred from the Recycler to Main Injector in 2.5 MHz buckets, four
   bunches at a time for a total of nine transfers. The cooled antiprotons
   bunches will have a longitudinal emittance of 1.5 eV-sec and a typical
   intensity of 60×109 particles per bunch. Following transfer from the
   Recycler, the 2.5 MHz voltage will be adiabatically raised from 2 kV
   (matching voltage for the transfers from the Recycler) to 60 kV. Then
   the antiproton bunches will be accelerated through transition to a
   front porch at about 25 GeV. There the bunches will be transferred to
   the 53 MHz rf system as follows: a) The 2.5 MHz voltage will drop from
   60-6 kV in 0. 2 msec. b) The bunches will be rotated at 6 kV of 2.5 MHz
   for 1/4 of sync. period ( about 100 msec). c) The 2.5 MHz voltage will
   be raised again to 60 kV in 0.2 msec. d) The bunches will be left to
   rotate for 1/4 of sync. period ( about 30 msec). e) The 2.5 voltage
   will be turned off and the bunches will be captured with 800 kV of 53
   MHz. The whole process of acceleration through transition and transfer
   to the 53 MHz rf system has been simulated with ESME. A longitudinal
   emittance blowup of 25% is predicted with no particle loss. 5. 5. 3
   Antiproton Deceleration The antiproton bunches that have been
   decelerated from 1 TeV to 150 GeV in the Tevatron will be synchronously
   transferred to the Main Injector, four bunches at a time for a total of
   nine transfers. The antiproton bunches in the Tevatron will have a
   typical intensity of 50×109 and a longitudinal emittance less than 4
   eV-sec. 5.16 The pbar bunches will be decelerated to an energy close
   but above transition ( 23-25 GeV), using the 53 MHz rf system. At this
   point the antiproton bunches will be transferred from the 53 MHz
   buckets to 2.5 MHz buckets. This transfer is necessary to reduce the
   momentum spread of the large longitudinal emittance antiproton bunches
   so that they don't exceed the momentum aperture of the machine during
   transition crossing. The transfer from the 53 MHz to the 2.5 MHz
   buckets will be take place in four steps: a) Reduce first the 53 MHz
   voltage till the beam fills the bucket. b) Turn the 53 MHz voltage off
   and perform a 90 degree rotation with 60 kV of 2.5 MHz and 12 kV of 5.0
   MHz. c) Go to a capture voltage of around 300 Volts of 2.5 MHz. d)
   Adiabatically raise the 2.5 MHz voltage to 60 kV. After the transfer to
   the 2.5 MHz rf, the antiproton bunches will be decelerated through
   transition with a dp/dt of 4 GeV/sec. The transition crossing of the
   antiproton bunches with 2.5 MHz has been simulated with ESME. The
   simulations predict a 25% emittance growth but no particle loss. After
   transition the rate of deceleration will be reduced to about 1.7
   GeV/sec so that the existing 2.5 MHz system can continue to provide the
   required bucket area. At 8.9 GeV the Main Injector will transfer cog to
   the Recycler, and the 2.5 MHz voltage will be adiabatically reduced
   until the bucket area equals the beam emittance. At this point the
   antiproton bunches will be synchronously transferred to the Recycler.
   The deceleration cycle will be about 12 sec long. 5. 5. 4 Transition
   Crossing A set of theoretical calculations has been performed to
   examine the transition crossing in the Main Injector with a proton
   bunch of longitudinal emittance of 0.5 eV-sec and intensity of 2.7×1011
   particles-parameters applicable to preparation of collider protons with
   electron cooling in the Recycler ring. Electron cooling will not be
   available for the early part of Run II, but it is interesting to
   consider the demands of the potentially small emittance beams that
   could be produced by electron cooling. In the initial stages of Run II,
   the Tevatron collider proton bunches will be formed by coalescing 5 to
   7 bunches each with 6×1010 protons in a 0.2 eV-sec emittance. Four
   different transition crossing effects were examined: Negative mass
   instability, space charge effects, microwave instability and non-linear
   effects. 5. 5. 4. 1 Negative Mass Instability The critical coefficient
   c defined by W. Hardt (W. Hardt, "Gamma-transition scheme of the CPS",
   Proc. 9th Int. Conf. on High Energy Accelerators, Stanford 1974; also:
   " Transition Crossing in the Fermilab Main Ring, Past and Present" I.
   Kourbanis, K.Y. Ng, Proc. of the 1993 Particle Accelerator Conference,
   Washington , D.C., May 17-20, 1993) to give the negative mass stability
   limit (unstable if c 1) was calculated for the intensity above with
   different longitudinal emittances. The critical coefficient c is
   plotted as a function of longitudinal emittance in Figure 5.8. For
   emittances greater than 0.35 eV-sec it can be seen that c < 1 (c~0.3
   for 0.5 eV-sec) so the beam is expected to be stable. 5.17 8 7 6 5 4 3

   longitudinal emittance for 2.7x1011 ppb. 5. 5. 4. 2 Space Charge
   Effects The equations of motion near transition (with non-linearities
   neglected) have been solved numerically by Sorenssen and others. To
   evaluate the importance of the longitudinal space charge effects on the
   transition crossing, the space charge parameter 0 (ratio of the space
   charge-force to the rf force) is calculated. The space-charge mismatch
   at transition is defined as the ratio of the bunch length at transition
   with space charge to the bunch length without space charge (and the
   corresponding ratio of the p/p at transition) as a function of the
   space charge parameter. The space charge mismatch at transition is not
   so important provided the space charge parameter is smaller than one .
   The calculations for the Main Injector have been done with a bunch
   intensity of 2.7×1011 ppb and with different longitudinal emittances.
   The results of the calculation are shown in Figure 5.9, where the space
   charge parameter is plotted as a function of the longitudinal
   emittance. Figure 5.9 shows that for longitudinal emittances greater
   than 0.2 eV-sec, o <0.5, so space charge is not expected to be
   important during the transition crossing. 5.18 2 N=2.7E11ppb 1.5 1 0.5

   instability to occur at transition for a parabolic bunch distribution
   is given by (J. Wei): Z V 3 cos s 0 [5.1] n hI 8 where V is the rf
   voltage at transition, s the synchronous angle, h the harmonic number,
   0 the bunch length at transition (in radians) and I is the peak bunch
   current. Based on the formula above, the threshold Z/n for 2.7 x 1011
   protons as a function of the bunch emittance is plotted in Figure 5.10.
   For emittances greater than 0.3 eV-sec the threshold Z/n for the
   microwave instability is greater than the estimated Z/n for the Main
   Injector (less than 3 ), so no microwave instability is expected at
   transition. 5.19 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Lo

   Effects Nonlinear effects are expected to dominate the transition
   crossing in the Main Injector under the conditions above. First the
   maximum p/p at transition for a bunch without space charge is plotted
   as a function of longitudinal emittance in Figure 5.11. In these
   calculations a transition crossing rate d /dt of 255 s-1 and a voltage
   at transition of 3.0 MV were assumed. 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.1 0.2

   the peak excursion in p/p at transition is approaching the momentum
   aperture and beam scraping might occur. Secondly the nonlinear time
   (the time that it takes the particle with the largest momentum spread
   p/p to cross transition before the synchronous particle) was calculated
   according to the formula: ( 1 + 3/ 2) × T t dp [5.2] NL × . p where 1
   is the Johnsen nonlinear coefficient in the momentum compaction factor,
   taken to be equal to 0.65 in this case, and t is the transition gamma.

   than 0.2 eV-sec the non-linear time is comparable with the
   characteristic time Tc (time around transition during which the
   particle motion is non-adiabatic), which in this case is calculated to
   be 2.04 msec. That will lead to the development of tails after
   transition, which will filament and increase the effective bunch area.
   The effective increase in the bunch area during the transition crossing
   depends on the ratio of Tnl to Tc (J. Wei Ph. D thesis) as follows: T
   0.76 nl × for T << T S T nl c c S 4 T ×( nl ) e 3 Tc - 1 for T nl Tc
   [5.3] Beam loss occurs if the effective bunch area S+ S after
   transition is larger than the bucket area. The results of the formulas
   above for different longitudinal emittances are shown in Figure 5.13.
   Since Tnl/Tc is ranging from ~0.4 to ~0.9, neither of the two regimes
   applies unambiguously, and 5.21 most likely, the emittance growth will
   fall somewhere in between the two curves. Simulations are needed to
   better understand the question of emittance growth in this case. 2 Tnl

   about 1.5 unit in 1 msec will decrease the nonlinear time by a factor
   of 6 while the characteristic time will be reduced only by a factor of
   1.8, so for a given longitudinal emittance the ratio Tnl/Tc will become
   a factor of three smaller, minimizing the emittance growth and the
   particle loss. The gamma-t jump is a possible upgrade to the Main
   Injector project following initial operation for Run II. 5. 5. 4. 5
   Conclusions The following conclusions are reached concerning transition
   crossing of bunches containing 2.7 x 1011 protons in a bunch of area Sb
   = 0.5 eV-s. 1. Stability against negative mass breakup requires Sb >
   0.32 eV-s. 2. Space charge focusing mismatch at transition is not
   serious for Sb > 0.2 and is a very weak function of Sb for Sb > 0.4
   eV-s. 3. The nominal momentum acceptance should support Sb = 0.6 eV-s,
   but potential loss at transition becomes a consideration for Sb > 0.4.
   4. If Sb > 0.32 eV-s and Z||/n < 3 Ohm there should be no microwave
   instability. 5. Emittance growth from the nonlinear bunch tilt becomes
   a serious consideration for larger However, the coalescing process
   proposed for the initial portion of Run II should not suffer from these
   effects in a serious way. 5.22 5.6 Impedance and instabilities 5. 6. 1
   Impedance budget and the microwave instability The Main Injector is a
   high intensity proton synchrotron. In order to control beam
   instabilities, it needs to be a low impedance machine. Components in
   the vacuum, rf, diagnostic and injection/extraction systems have been
   carefully analyzed, and computer models have been built. The following
   guidelines have been adopted in the machine design: * The bellows are
   to be shielded. * The flange gaps are to be shielded. * The gate valves
   are to be shielded. * The pump ports are to be screened. * The
   transitions are to be tapered. * The weldment gaps are to be minimized.
   * The dangerous higher order modes (HOM) of rf cavities are to be
   damped. * The kicker beam tubes will be coated * The Lambertson joints
   are being designed with care. There are two characteristic frequencies
   associated with the beam instabilities. One is the cutoff frequency of
   the TM01 mode of the elliptic beam tube (2"×5"), which is analytically
   calculable and is about 3.6 GHz. This gives an n (which is the ratio of
   the cutoff frequency to the revolution frequency) of 4×104. Another is
   the rms frequency of the bunch spectrum (assumed Gaussian), which is
   below 300 MHz and is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the
   cutoff. This implies that the broad-band impedance model is applicable
   in the analysis. The preliminary impedance budget is listed in Table
   5.6, where Z||/n is the longitudinal impedance and Z the transverse
   one. The instability thresholds at injection and extraction are also
   listed. The ratio of the threshold to the budget, which is sometimes
   called the safety margin, must be greater than unity in order to avoid
   microwave instabilities. 5.23 Table 5.6. Impedance Budget Component

   Instability threshold: At 8.9 GeV/c 39 7.9 At 120 GeV/c 8.0 16 Specific
   attention is needed during the bunch coalescing at 150 GeV/c. In the
   process of adiabatic debunching, the minimum bunch height is
   constrained by the machine impedance. For a bunch full height of 12
   MeV, the corresponding microwave instability threshold is Z||/n= 1.0 ,
   which is already smaller than the budget. Another critical stage during
   the cycle is the transition crossing at about 20 GeV/c, when the slip
   factor tends to zero. Both analytical study and computer simulations
   have limited power in predicting the instability threshold. From the
   experiences at other high intensity proton machines (e.g., AGS at
   Brookhaven and PS at CERN), particle losses and emittance dilution have
   strong dependence on the beam intensity. However, based partly on our
   Main Ring experience, we do not expect the microwave instability at
   transition to seriously limit Main Injector performance in Run II. 5.
   6. 2 Chromaticity and slow head-tail instability The chromaticity in
   the Main Injector comes from four different sources: quadrupoles,
   sextupoles, eddy current in the beam tube and dipole saturation. The
   chromaticity model can be described as a summation of four terms: 5.24
   -33. 65 828 90.1 S 0.0916 H F dp GeV /c/ s saturation = -32. + 87 -182
   - 443 S 0. ( ) + 0859 V D + - dt [5.4] It is seen that the eddy current
   term has a ramp rate dependence. In order to have enough room for
   manipulating the chromaticities in both positive and negative
   directions, it is necessary to have bipolar power supplies for the
   focusing sextupoles. (The defocusing sextupoles do not need to be
   bipolar.) The head-tail growth time is inversely proportional to Re Z (
   ), the real part of the transverse impedance at the chromaticity
   frequency, which is equal to o/ . Table 5.7 lists the growth time of
   the m=±1 mode at injection for different chromaticities. Table 5.7.
   Head-Tail Instability Growth Time -33 -20 -10 -5 (ms) 26 27 22 17 It
   will be possible to adjust the crhomaticity to be negative at injection
   and to avoid the instability. In addition, a damper will provide
   stabilization even if the chromaticity has the "wrong" sign. 5. 6. 3
   Resistive wall instability The beam tube is made of 316L stainless
   steel. Its resistivity is 7.4x10-7 -m and its thickness is 1.5 mm. At
   low frequencies near o , where is the fractional tune, the skin depth
   is larger than the wall thickness. Therefore, the wall impedance is
   determined by the thickness. Assuming = 0.4, the wall impedance would
   then be Z = (1 + j) 19 M /m. It would give a transverse coupled-bunch
   mode growth time = 1.2 ms, which is about 100 turns. The actual growth
   time could be longer due to other factors (chromaticity, octupoles,
   etc.) as observed in the Main Ring. The Main Injector damper system
   will suppress this instability. 5. 6. 4 Coupled bunch instabilities
   Based on the preliminary higher-order mode (HOM) tables of the Main
   Injector rf cavities, the coupled bunch instability growth time is
   calculated and listed in Table 5.8. Table 5.8. Coupled Bunch
   Instability Growth Time Direction Bunch Shape Mode Growth Time (ms) 8.9

   1900 L m = 1 L L Note: The entry "L" means Landau-damped. The damper
   system should also be capable of damping these modes. 5. 6. 5 Transient
   beam loading There are two transient beam loading effects that are of
   concern. One is the phase modulation due to the gap in a bunch train.
   For 18 cavities, each having R/Q = 80 and Q = 5.25 4500, the phase
   modulation of several cases is listed in Table 5.9. While these phase
   errors are not too serious, the Main Injector will have a beam loading
   compensation system to reduce these effects.Another effect is the
   instability driven by the fundamental mode (i.e., TM01) of rf cavities
   due to detuning. Feedback will be used to stabilize this potentially
   unstable mode. Table 5.9. Phase Modulation from Transient Beam Loading

   Damper requirements 5. 7. 1 Transverse dampers The damping process can
   be described as follows. Let us define a vector that represents the
   amplitude and phase of the collective beam oscillation: x = + j x + x'
   [5.5] where and are the lattice functions. When a feedback system with
   gain g is applied, the amplitude | | will be decreased. After N turns,
   we will have sin( 2 (2 + ) 1 ) - sin 2 (N) exp -g N N o = o + 4sin 2 2
   [5.6] in which | | and o are the initial amplitude and phase,
   respectively, and the betatron tune. Thus, the collective amplitude
   damps as an exponential with a characteristic period of 2/g turns, but
   the exponential also has some minor wiggles. The transverse feedback
   systems in the Main Injector serve three different purposes that are
   described below. 5. 7. 1. 1 Correction of injection errors. If there is
   a position error xc at injection, the decoherence due to chromaticity
   is described by A = (x ) c - x xc , where xc is the centroid of the
   particle distribution in a bunch. The decoherence factor can be
   calculated by 5.26 2 p p A(N) = 1 - exp - 2 sin( ) s N s [5.7] in which
   is the chromaticity, p/p the rms relative momentum spread, s the
   synchrotron tune, and N the number of turns after injection. Table 5.10
   lists the maximum value of A as a function of , which occurs when N =
   1/2 s. It is seen that, for a large chromaticity, the damping time of
   the injection damper must be shorter than half of the synchrotron
   period in order to avoid any significant emittance dilution due to
   decoherence. Table 5.10. The Decoherence Factor 33 20 10 5 Amax 1 0.99
   0.72 0.27 5. 7. 1. 2 2. Damping of the resistive wall instability:
   Because this is a fast beam blowup, a feedback system with a large gain
   is needed. The maximum bandwidth is determined by the batch separation.
   5. 7. 1. 3 3. Damping of the coupled-bunch instability: In order to be
   able to damp the coherent oscillation of each individual bunch, this
   feedback system needs a wide bandwidth. It is planned to build two
   feedback systems in each transverse plane. System A has high power and
   medium bandwidth for correcting injection errors, while System B has
   low power and wide bandwidth for damping the resistive wall and
   coupled-bunch instabilities. The specifications are listed in Table
   5.11. Table 5.11. Specifications of Transverse Feedback Systems

   The simplest implementation of a feedback system consists of a pickup
   and a kicker, which are (n+1/2) apart in phase advance. But this simple
   scheme is sensitive to tune variations, closed orbit errors, and the
   initial phase of the bunch at the pickup/kicker. An improved version is
   as follows: 1. Two pickups taken together determine both x and x',
   thereby eliminating the sensitivity to initial phase and tune
   variations. 2. Two-turn (or multiple-turn) measurement will reject the
   closed orbit signal. 3. Two kickers, which can get rid of the initial
   phase dependence, will (in principle) provide almost exact orbit
   correction within one turn. A new transverse feedback system, which has
   both high power (6 kW) and wide bandwidth (53 MHz), has been built for
   the Main Ring and will be used in the Main Injector. Another important
   consideration for dampers is the noise level of the system. This may
   not be a problem for the Main Injector because of its short cycle time,
   but it is critical for any proton storage ring. The consequence of
   noise in the feedback system is the possible emittance dilution. The
   emittance growth due to the feedback noise can be described by d 2 x N
   = 2 0.64 o f dt o x [5.8] in which o is the initial emittance, fo the
   revolution frequency, xN the equivalent noise level at the pickup, x
   the rms beam size, and the total tune spread. It is interesting to note
   that the growth rate is independent of the gain and is proportional to
   the square of the tune spread (which is somewhat contrary to one's
   intuition). The theoretical limit of the pickup resolution due to
   thermal and electronic noise, x, is also calculable. In designing a
   feedback system, x must be smaller than xN, which is determined by a
   specified allowable growth rate d /dt. 5. 7. 2 Longitudinal dampers
   Passive mode dampers will be used on the Main Injector cavities (which
   are being reused from the Main Ring). In addition, phase feedback will
   be used as necessary to damp dipole oscillations. Quadrupole feedback
   will be used for the m=0 mode. 5.8 RF Systems and Beam Loading
   Compensation The 18 existing 53 MHz Main Ring rf cavities will be
   installed in straight section MI-60 and operated at harmonic number
   588. The operating levels below transition are determined by an
   interplay between cycle time, bucket area, and synchrotron frequency.
   Since the FMI must accelerate antiprotons as well as protons, a degree
   of simplicity and system flexibility will be achieved by placing the
   cavities at spacings that are multiples of one-half the rf wavelength.
   The 180 spacing of accelerating cavities will simplify the rf signal
   distribution (fan-out/fan-back) system as well as providing simpler
   choices for coalescing stations. A bucket area of at least 0.2 eV sec
   is required to accept beam out of the Booster. Historically, it has
   been necessary to keep the synchrotron frequency in the Main Ring below
   720 Hz to avoid resonance with power supply ripple at the twelfth
   harmonic of the line frequency. The rf system has the capability of
   generating enough voltage at injection to produce a 1.0 eV sec bucket
   area at injection, where the limit of 150 kV per cavity is set by the
   tendency of the tuners to spark because they are close to parallel
   resonance. In this mode the synchrotron frequency lies well above 720
   Hz at injection and descends rapidly, crossing 720 Hz when the beam
   energy is about 5.28 15 GeV. At the frequency for transition energy the
   cavities are capable of producing 240 kV each, so that 4.0 MV are
   available even with one cavity inoperative. If the rf system has more
   than a 50% duty factor, it is not possible to maintain the 4 MV level
   all the way to top energy because of cavity heating. Operational
   experience will dictate the exact ramp scenario that is used. One
   limitation of the existing Main Ring rf system is the power that it can
   deliver. The present requirements are 70 kW per cavity with the
   increased beam intensity provided by the Linac upgrade. The FMI will
   require 112 kW for accelerating the full intensity at 240 GeV/sec,
   which is excessive for rf amplifier reliability using the present Main
   Ring rf system. Provision in the original cavity design allowed for a
   second amplifier to be installed on the cavity. This choice, while
   possible, places additional amplifier components in the enclosure, thus
   increasing maintenance. To overcome this limitation, a new 200 kW power
   amplifier is placed in the tunnel with a 4 kW rf driver and 30 kV
   series tube modulator in the equipment gallery. R&D development of a
   200 kW rf power amplifier and a 4 kW driver has been completed.
   Tevatron style 500 volt programmable grid and screen supplies are used
   for dc biasing. Rf drive is be provided by a solid-state 4 kW rf driver
   coupled to the final tube cathode. More than 200 kW of output power has
   been achieved with the new amplifiers. Reliability testing is being
   done in a test station and in an active accelerating station in the
   Main Ring rf System. Operation in a Main Ring Station since May 15,
   1994 without failure, has given us encouragement that the design is
   sound. The transient beam loading from 6x1010 protons per bunch will
   require about 1.25 amp delivered to the cavities, supplied by 15 A
   (12:1 cavity step-up ratio) of rf current generated by the power
   amplifier. A 200 kW rf power amplifier operated at a dc plate voltage
   of 20 kV will produce a peak rf current of approximately 21 A. The 40%
   surplus initial current capability will insure adequate operating
   lifetime as the power tube ages. In the present Main Accelerator rf
   systems, two 30 kV anode power supplies provide dc power to 18 rf
   stations. Nine stations are powered by each anode supply. With 200 kW
   amplifiers, only six stations can be powered by a MR anode supply. One
   additional anode supply will be provided. The two existing MR anode
   supplies will be rebuilt at the MI-60 location when the Main Ring is
   decommissioned. Design improvements proven to increase reliability in a
   similar supply used in the Tevatron rf systems will be implemented.
   This will make the Main Injector anode supplies similar to the Tevatron
   supply. Uniformity of the systems will both ease maintenance and
   provide consistent safety requirements in the two systems. The FMI will
   use the 2.5 and 5.0 MHz coalescing cavities from the Main Ring to
   prepare intense bunches for collider loading; no significant
   modifications are required. The system consists of five 2.5 MHz ferrite
   loaded cavities producing 12 kV per cavity and one 5.0 MHz cavity
   producing 15 kV. These cavities are driven with solid state amplifiers
   which will be located in the MI-60 Service Building. Because the
   harmonic number for 2.5 MHz is 28 in the FMI compared to its Main Ring
   value of 53, the system will provide 1.4 times the bucket height
   available in the Main Ring. For longitudinal emittance of 0.15 eVs,
   about 30 kV of 2.5 MHz rf is required, so there is substantial reserve
   in this system. The FMI will also use a 15 kV, 106 MHz cavity from the
   Main Ring. It is used to linearize the 53 MHz bunch rotation in the
   procedure called snap coalescing. The four operating modes of the Main
   Injector are listed below. 5.29 Table 5.12. Operating Modes of the Main
   Injector. Energy Mode Beam Extraction 120 GeV Antiproton Production 1
   batch 1 turn 120 GeV Slow Spill 6 batch 1 sec 150 GeV Tevatron Fixed
   Target 6 batch 1 turn 150 GeV Collider, 36 on 36 11 bunch 1 turn For
   antiproton production and fixed target operation, the compensation is
   designed for an intensity of 6x1010 per bunch with a ramp rate of 240
   GeV/sec. The maximum intensity that could be accelerated at this ramp
   rate without running into instabilities is not much larger, perhaps
   7x1010. The most critical beam loading compensation is necessary for
   snap coalescing twelve batches of protons at 150 GeV. 5.9 Intensity and
   Transmission Efficiency The Fermilab Main Injector is designed to have
   a much larger aperture, greater than 40 mm-mr normalized at 8 GeV,
   compared to the Main Ring aperture of 12 mm-mr. The Main Ring aperture,
   both transverse and longitudinal, limits the performance of the
   Fermilab Tevatron complex. The Main Ring is not capable of efficiently
   accelerating the full intensity that will be available from the
   Booster, namely 6×1010 protons/bunch. The Main Ring is used in three
   different modes: 1) proton acceleration from 8 GeV to 120 GeV for
   antiproton production; 2) proton acceleration from 8 GeV to 150 GeV,
   coalescing and cogging for Tevatron injection; and 3) antiproton
   acceleration from 8 GeV to 150 GeV, coalescing and cogging for Tevatron
   injection. In the first two modes the Main Ring accepts beam from the
   Booster, and in the third mode from the Antiproton Source. In all of
   these modes the beam intensity is limited by the admittance of the Main
   Ring, and furthermore, the Main Ring has no transverse aperture left
   for any motion in orbit. In the antiproton production mode the Booster
   runs with 84 bunches of about 4.5x1010 protons each. Main Ring delivers
   only about 3.5x1010 protons/bunch to the antiproton production target,
   with an efficiency of less than 80%. Figure 5.14 shows the efficiency
   of proton transfer through the Main Ring for different Main Ring
   cycles. In the Main Ring about 10% of particles get lost in the first
   few thousand turns. This loss is mainly caused by the small aperture of
   the Main Ring at injection. The small aperture is caused by a
   combination of poor magnetic field quality at low excitation and
   perturbations to the ring that have been required for the integration
   of overpasses and new injection and extraction systems. The second
   considerable loss of particles in the Main Ring, about 10%, is at
   transition energy. At transition the growing beam size also scrapes on
   the limited aperture of the Main Ring. Figure 5.14 also shows the
   transfer efficiencies for the other two cycles of the Main Ring
   operation, which are used to fill the Tevatron for collider operations.
   As in the antiproton production cycle, these two cycles have losses of
   particles from injection to transition energy. The total loss is about
   20%. A few percent (<3%) of particles get lost between 20 GeV and 150
   GeV. Due to the limited momentum aperture of the Main Ring, the proton
   loss during cogging and coalescing is about 25%. The average
   transmission through the Main Ring during antiproton production cycles
   is at best 80%, whereas the average transmissions of coalesced proton
   and antiproton bunches are 50% and 70% respectively. The antiproton
   transmission is larger due to the smaller emittance of the antiproton
   beam from the Accumulator. 5.30 100.0 80.0 Efficiency (%) 60.0 Pbar

   transmission efficiencies for different particle transfer cycles. In
   the Main Injector era, the Booster proton emittance is expected to be
   about 18 mm-mr for 6x1010 protons/bunch. The Main Injector, with an
   aperture more than three times larger than the Main Ring, will
   eliminate most of the losses currently caused by the aperture
   restrictions at injection. Any loss due to small injection oscillations
   will also be reduced. Figure 5.15 shows the expected particle
   transmission for different Main Injector cycles. Due to much larger
   transverse admittance of the Main Injector, the expected loss from
   injection to transition energy is less than 5%. The Main Injector is
   designed to have larger momentum aperture; hence loss of particles at
   cogging and coalescing is expected to be much smaller than in the Main
   Ring. A conservative estimate of these losses is less than 5%. The
   average transmission through Main Injector during antiproton production
   cycles is expected to be 95%. The average transmission efficiencies of
   coalesced proton and antiproton bunches are expected to be 85% and 90%
   respectively. The Main Injector is designed to exceed the Run II
   requirements of 2.7x1011 protons/bunch and 5.5x1010 antiproton/bunch
   delivered to the Tevatron. 5.31 100.0 80.0 Efficiency (%) 60.0 Pbar

   Extraction The Main Injector slow extraction system is designed to be
   capable of providing year- round, uniform spills of 120 GeV beams,
   either with a 2.9 s cycle time and 1 s flattop, or with a 1.9 s cycle
   time and ~1 ms spill for neutrino experiments. The following sections
   outline the principle of slow spill through excitation of the
   half-integer resonance, and description of the hardware required. More
   detail is provided in the TDH on results from numerical simulation of
   the extraction process, and on spill modulation and duty factor
   considerations. 5. 10. 1 Half-Integer Resonant Extraction The
   half-integer resonance is a linear resonance that can be induced solely
   by a quadrupole field. In that case, the beam is either entirely stable
   or entirely unstable, if tune spread resulting from chromaticity and
   momentum spread is ignored. With the addition of an octupole field,
   however, an amplitude-dependent tune spread is introduced into the beam
   ( ~ x2). Particles with large betatron amplitudes have tunes closer to
   the half-integer than those of small amplitude. Consequently, the phase
   space splits into stable and unstable regions, thereby providing a
   means for manipulating the extraction rate through control of the
   stable area in phase space. Recycled Main Ring octupoles distributed
   around the ring on the 0th-harmonic provide the non-linear tune shift,
   while two orthogonal families of Main Ring trim quads distributed on
   the 53rd-harmonic provide the half-integer driving term. One quadrupole
   family alone produces the desired driving 5.32 term for extraction,
   while both families are available for correcting the intrinsic
   half-integer stop- band of the machine. Slow extraction from the Main
   Injector proceeds basically as follows. The horizontal tune is raised
   towards the half-integer from x = 26.425 to 26.485 using the main
   quadrupole circuits. The desired orientation of the phase-space at the
   extraction septa is obtained by energizing the appropriate
   53rd-harmonic quadrupole circuit plus the 0th-harmonic octupoles. The
   strengths of the harmonic elements are chosen such that the stable
   phase-space area equals the emittance of the circulating beam. The beam
   is just marginally stable, therefore, at the end of the initial ramp.
   Extraction begins by further ramping the harmonic quadrupoles to
   increase the width of the half-integer stop-band and start the
   stop-band moving through the beam. Small amplitude particles (lower
   tune) remain stable, with their motion in phase-space oscillating
   between the 'fixed' points on successive turns. As the stable
   phase-space region shrinks, large amplitude particles enter the
   stop-band and become unstable, with their amplitude then growing
   exponentially from turn to turn. The unstable particles stream out
   along the separatrices until they ultimately jump across (or hit) the
   wires of the electrostatic septa and enter the extraction channel. The
   kick supplied by the electrostatic septa provides sufficient separation
   between extracted and circulating beams that magnetic septa are used
   for the final extraction from the machine. 5. 10. 2 Extraction Elements
   There are five major components of the resonant extraction system: 1.
   magnetic and electrostatic extraction septa; 2. one family of
   0th-harmonic octupoles; 3. two families (cosine and sine) of
   53rd-harmonic quadrupoles; 4. low frequency extraction regulation
   quadrupoles (QXR), and; 5. high frequency spill modulation regulation
   quadrupoles (Buckers). The extraction septa are located in straight
   section MI-52 for extraction to Switchyard and the present experimental
   areas beyond. This region must accommodate extraction of 120 GeV/c
   slow- spill protons
