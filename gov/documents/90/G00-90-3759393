   As part of NASA's Aviation Safety Program, the Icing Branch at Glenn
   Research Center strives to make flight in icing conditions safer
   through extensive practical and computational research, education, and
   partnering with agencies, industry, and academia.
   Did You Know?
   The Icing Branch utilizes a "flying laboratory", the Twin Otter, to
   study aircraft icing in the sky. They also utilize a large refrigerated
   wind tunnel at NASA Glenn Research Center to create realistic icing
   conditions for models and airfoils on the ground.
   Did You Know?
   The Icing Branch creates a variety of software codes. These tools are
   used for predicting ice growth, ice protection system behavior, and the
   effects of ice contamination on aircraft.
   Did You Know?
   The Icing Branch produces high quality educational videos and
   computer-based training material on various aspects of flight in icing
   condtions. Some of these products may be requested on-line.
