   Frequently Asked Questions

             Q: How do I obtain GEOLAB Software?
             A: GEOLAB Software is available to the U.S. Government and its
             contractors as well as other U.S. entities (universities,
             industry, etc.). The first step in obtaining our software is to
             complete the appropriate Online Software Request Form. This will
             electronically generate a request for software, but only alerts
             us of your request. The electronic request must be followed by a
             required written request. The written request is a statement, on
             company letterhead, which is used by the GEOLAB to verify that
             you are who you say you are. Once both forms of the request are
             received, the software can then be transferred electronically or
             by magnetic tape.

             Q: How can I use GEOLAB resources?
             A: GEOLAB accounts are available to employees of NASA LaRC and
             its contractors. Accounts may also be requested by other
             government, industry, and educational partners of NASA LaRC.
             Interested parties should contact Pat Kerr or Bill Jones for
             further information.

             Q: When is TetrUSS (GridTool) training held?
             A: TetrUSS training is scheduled for the 1st full week of every
             month. Interested parties may contact Dr. Shahyar Pirzadeh for
             details and signup.
