   Utah Scales

               Drug Courts
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Background

   The establishment of drug courts in the State of Utah is part of an
   ongoing effort to combat the rising number of drug related crimes
   within our communities. Estimates have indicated that in recent years,
   arrests for drug related crimes have more than doubled. Additionally,
   judges have observed that the same offenders appear in their courts
   time and time again. It seemed as if traditional methods of dealing
   with addicts such as strict probation or mandatory imprisonment did not
   attack the fundamental problem of addiction.

   Drug courts work by recognizing that unless substance abuse ends, fines
   and jail time are unlikely to prevent future criminal activity.
   Consequently, drug courts, through frequent testing and court
   supervision, focus upon eliminating drug addiction as a long-term
   solution to crime.

   Since the first drug court in Utah was established in Third District
   Court (Salt Lake) in 1996, the program has spread quickly. There are an
   estimated 700-800 participants statewide and hundreds of successful
   graduates.

   Although a number of drug courts exist within the State of Utah, all
   programs have incorporated a set of ten components created by the
   United States Department of Justice. These guidelines establish
   structural components across drug courts while each jurisdiction
   independently handles matters such as treatment providers and
   participatory restrictions.

   Frequently Asked Questions

   How do Drug Courts Differ from Traditional Courts?

   Drug courts differ from traditional methods of adjudication not only in
   their methodology, but also in their results. These differences
   include: (Source: Office of Justice Programs: "Looking at a Decade of
   Drug Courts")

   1. Level of Supervision

     * Traditional: Court involvement generally does not take place unless
       a probation violation has been reported. Therefore, follow-ups for
       urinalyses may not be as frequent.
     * Drug Courts: Throughout the duration of drug court, defendants
       attend required and regular treatment sessions and court
       appearances as well as undergo random urinalyses.

   2. Reductions in Recidivism

     * Traditional: According to the United States Department of Justice,
       45 percent of defendants convicted of drug possession will commit a
       similar crime within the next several years. In fact, the more
       often a defendant is arrested for a drug offense, the more likely
       they are to commit an additional offense.
     * Drug Courts: Drug court participants exhibit a lower recidivism
       rate ranging from five percent to 28 percent. The recidivism rate
       for drug court graduates is approximately four percent.
       Additionally, urinalysis reports for drug court participants are
       generally 90 percent negative.

   3. Emphasis on Long Term Recovery

     * Traditional: In many cases, drug addiction may not be the only
       problem faced by offenders. Poor reading skills, low levels of
       self-respect, and troubled family relationships are just a few of
       the issues offenders face outside of the courts. Traditional
       processes may refer offenders to treatment programs but follow up
       is not generally conducted.
     * Drug Court: Drug courts often recommend that participants develop
       skills and connections that will allow them to survive following
       treatment. For example, some programs suggest that participants
       attain their GED or develop ties with community mentors. Many Utah
       drug courts also encourage alumni groups so that the recovery
       process will continue after treatment ends.

   How do Drug Courts Work?

   Qualified participants enter a guilty plea for their charges. This
   plea, called a "plea in abeyance", is put on hold while the offender is
   enrolled in drug court. Upon completion of the program, the guilty plea
   is withdrawn and the charges are dismissed. If however, the offender
   does not complete his/her treatment, they will face sentencing and
   imprisonment.

   Drug courts seek to combat drug addiction through several means
   including:

     * Specific and clearly stated rules and expectations of performance.
       For example, if an offender misses three court appearances, they
       are automatically expelled from the program and the case is
       processed in the traditional manner.
     * Close supervision from the court and treatment providers. This
       surveillance includes frequent urine testing as well as scheduled
       appearances in court. This level of supervision is much higher than
       that of traditional treatments.
     * Consequences for noncompliance. Offenders who fail to complete
       necessary requirements will face sanctions including jail time or
       additional court appearances.

   What sort of Treatment does Drug Court Entail?

   Adult felony drug courts operate in four broad phases that take a
   minimum of 52 weeks to complete. The time frame for juvenile drug
   courts ranges from six to ten months minimum.

   The requirements for these phases include participation in
   detoxification, inpatient and outpatient treatments, substance abuse
   groups, drug education classes, urine testing, court attendance, and
   completion of community service hours.

   Why do we Need Drug Courts?

   Many drug court participants, including first time offenders, have
   extensive histories of drug abuse often spanning 15 years or more.
   (Source: US. Department of Justice) This observation demonstrates the
   need for programs to reach the root of addiction in order to yield a
   long-term solution.

   A recent study has reflected substantive increases in drug related
   crime rates within the State of Utah. For a ten-year period between
   1989 and 1998, statistics revealed:
     * Drug sale and manufacturing arrests increased by 263 percent.
     * Drug arrests for possession increased by 360 percent.
     * Arrests for drug related crimes increased by 335 percent.

   Additionally, nationwide estimates indicate that 80 percent of
   incarcerated individuals committed their crimes:

     * While under the influence of drugs,
     * Are in jail for drug-related crimes, and/or
     * Possess a history of drug/alcohol abuse.

   What are the Different Kinds of Drug Courts?

   There are three basic kinds of drug courts: adult criminal, dependency,
   and juvenile.

   1) Adult criminal drug courts focus upon individual adult offenders
   charged with a felony drug crime.

   2) Dependency drug courts hear cases where the state has alleged abuse
   or neglect on the part of the parent. These drug courts acknowledge
   that neglect and abuse may be a product of drug addiction.
   Subsequently, teams within this court hold parents accountable for
   their behavior by monitoring their treatment and encourage a focus on
   recovery so the family may be reunited.

   2) Juvenile drug courts are aimed specifically at first time or second
   time juvenile offenders. Requirements of juvenile drug court include 60
   hours of community service, written essays on the dangers of drug use,
   and on-going court supervision.

   Who is Eligible for Drug Court?

   Though restrictions may vary by location and program, adult felony drug
   court is generally available to:
     * Certain non-violent offenders charged with a felony drug crime.
       These crimes include forged prescriptions, possession with intent,
       and felony possession of a controlled substance.
     * Offenders with at least one previous drug conviction for which a
       sentence was given.
     * Offenders must be in the country legally.

   There are certain offenders that are automatically excluded. These
   include:
     * Offenders who have past convictions for crimes of violence.
     * Offenders whose drugs of choice are either alcohol or marijuana
     * Offenders with pending charges or convictions of operating
       production facilities or distribution of controlled substances.
     * Offenders who lack the ability to manage the structure of the
       program such as those with disruptive behavior problems.

   How is Treatment Paid for?

   The State of Utah has devised a unique formula to pay for drug court
   treatment. In this formula, for every dollar spent on drug courts, 87
   cents will go towards treatment and 13 cents will cover court costs.
   This ratio allows for lower costs to the participant who may pay
   anywhere from zero to a maximum of forty dollars a week for treatment.

   Do Drug Courts Work?

   Drug courts are proven to be more successful than traditional court
   processes. The following statistics attest to the effectiveness of this
   program:
     * Statistical evidence and research supports the proposition that
       drug courts reduce criminal activity. For example, a study
       conducted in 1998 by the University of Utah's School of Social Work
       revealed that recidivism rates for local drug court graduates
       remained at a steady seven percent. In contrast, the US Justice
       Department estimates that approximately 45 percent of offenders
       convicted of similar charges but whom have not participated in drug
       court will relapse and commit another crime. This recidivism rate
       is even higher, at 60 percent, for offenders imprisoned for their
       convictions.
     * Drug courts additionally work by saving tax-dollars. For example,
       drug court treatment for one offender costs approximately seven
       dollars per day. This is compared to the $50 dollar a day cost of
       incarcerating one individual in a state prison.

   Additional benefits of drug courts include:
     * Healthier families: The US Department of Justice reports that over
       500 drug free babies have been delivered to female drug court
       participants while enrolled in the program. Programs such as alumni
       support groups also emphasize long-term success and give
       participants the tools and experience necessary to rebuild their
       lives.
     * Increased availability of resources: The referral of less serious
       drug related cases to drug court, allows for personnel and services
       to be channeled to more serious cases or offenders posing greater
       risks to the community.
     * End to "revolving door" syndrome. By placing defendants into a
       demanding and court supervised program, a message is sent to
       community members that drug offenses are taken seriously and that
       those who violate the law regarding drug abuse will be dealt with.
       This adds credibility to prosecutors and police officers whose
       primary duty it is to uphold the law.
