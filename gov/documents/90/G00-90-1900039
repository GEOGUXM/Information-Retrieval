   Work Sharing - A Smart Alternative to Layoffs

   Printer Friendly Version

   The Work Sharing Unemployment Insurance program allows for the payment
   of benefits to individuals whose wages and hours have been reduced.
   This program is considered a temporary and practical alternative to
   layoffs.

   This program was established by the California legislature to help
   employers and employees avoid some of the burdens that accompany a
   layoff situation. If employees are retained during a temporary
   slowdown, employers can quickly gear up when business conditions
   improve. Employers are spared the expense of recruiting, hiring, and
   training new employees. Employees are spared the hardship of total
   unemployment.

   Any employer who has a reduction of production, services, or other
   conditions that cause the employer to seek an alternative to layoffs
   may participate in the Work Sharing Program.
