   Moon Mission.

     One of the most remarkable coincidences found in nature is the fact
     that the Moon and the Sun both appear the same size as seen from
     Earth. The Moon, a small, cold, and dark body is only 3,500 km in
     diameter while the sun, a self-luminous, gaseous giant, is 1,400,000
     km across. The coincidence arises from the fact that although the
     sun is 400 times larger than the Moon, it is also 400 times farther
     from Earth. A direct consequence of this fortuitous geometry is that
     during a total solar eclipse, the Moon occludes the Sun with a
     nearly perfect fit.

     The fundamental basis of the solar eclipse is the alignment of the
     Sun, Moon and Earth such that some region of Earth passes through
     the Moon's shadow. This shadow is composed of two parts: the outer
     or penumbral shadow and the inner or umbral shadow. From within the
     penumbra, only part of the sun is obscured. In contrast, the dark,
     central umbra is the shadow of complete or total eclipse. During a
     total eclipse, the umbra sweeps across Earth from west to east and
     the course it travels is called the path of totality. Anyone
     standing within this zone will see the Sun completely obscured by
     the moon for as long as 7 1/2 minutes. At this time, the solar
     corona is visible as a halo about the moon and the landscape takes
     on the appearance of an eerie twilight. Outside the path of totality
     but still within the penumbra, a partial eclipse is seen. The path
     of the umbra is rarely more than 300 km wide, while that of the
     penumbra is about 7,000 km wide. Sometimes the umbral shadow misses
     Earth entirely and only a partial eclipse occurs.
