   The GTE Weather Plotters will be going through a major change in the
   coming 9 months. The graphics package will be changed
   from NCAR Graphics to GrADS software (click here for more information
   on GrADS). The GrADS software will allow the use of
   the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Global Datasets in netCDF format from the NOAA
   Climate Diagnostic Center, covering the years
   of 1958-2000. Also, the GrADS software can generate the products
   currently available on the GTE Weather Plotters, as well as
   others not yet available such as vertical cross-sections. The user may
   continue to generate products with the current GTE
   Weather Plotters, but no changes to the plotters will occur until the
   new versions are fully operational. (djw 01/19/2001)
