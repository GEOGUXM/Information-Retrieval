                           About Notarial Archives

     The New Orleans Notarial Archives holds some forty million pages of
     signed acts compiled by the notaries of New Orleans, Louisiana over
     three centuries. They reside in the only archive dedicated to notarial
     records in the United States. Founded in 1867 when it gathered the
     records of colonial and antebellum notaries, the Archives relates     Site
                                                                           Plan

     closely to those European and Western Hemisphere repositories that
     share Louisiana's heritage of civil law. The world's civil law
     notarial collections derive from a Roman law-based system that
     elevates the notary to a prominent place in society as the
     draftsman, guarantor, and finally, archivist of contracts in the
     private sector. In New Orleans, nearly every property transaction
     that has occurred since the founding of the city was recorded by, or
     found its way to, a notary's office.

     Most of the local notary's business dealt with sales or mortgages of
     immovables in the city and surrounding parishes. Notaries also
     received Wills, marriage contracts, building contracts, powers of
     attorney, and individual declarations. They conducted estate
     inventories, family meetings, and meetings of creditors. They
     recorded acts of partnership, corporate charters, marine bonds, and
     marine or ship captains' protests. Slave sales and emancipations
     from prior to the Civil War are another important act type. These
     records provide names, ages, and skills, indicate color or
     ethnicity, and may provide lineage useful for the study of
     African-American history.

     In addition to text-based documents, the Archives holds thousands of
     "Plan Book Drawings" created during the 19th century by civil
     engineers, surveyors and architects. This collection includes
     topographical elevations, construction documents and site plans of
     property located throughout New Orleans, the State of Louisiana and
     in surrounding states. The signed and dated drawings depict both
     property lines and buildings, and were usually created to advertise
     judicially-ordered auction sales held to comply with the rules of
     civil procedure.

     Antiquities of the Notarial Archives collection may be found in the
     Research center now relocated to 1340 Poydras Street, Suite 360, in
     dowtown New Orleans, just steps from the main office. French Period
     acts in the collection (1731 to 1768) amount to some 2,000 pages.
     Spanish Period acts and Court Proceedings (1768 to 1803) amount to
     some 225,000 pages. Early American, ante-bellum and post-Civil War
     documents (French and English) consist of nearly 6,000 volumes of
     notarial acts, each containing about 1,000 legal size pages.

     Plans and surveys may be found either attached to notarial acts or
     in the Plan Book collection, housed today in flat files. Plans may
     be ink and water color on paper, ink on cloth, blueprint, blueline,
     or inkplot on Mylar or modern vellum. Many "attached" plans are
     design drawings attached to building contracts. These drawings may
     be signed by trained architects or may be the simple sketches of
     builders working in vernacular styles.
