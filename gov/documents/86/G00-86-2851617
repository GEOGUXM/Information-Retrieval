   1. BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES TO REVIEW ALS
   (Contact: NVSmith@lbl.gov)

   A review committee from the Department of Energy's Office of Basic
   Energy Sciences (DOE BES) will wind up its series of reviews of the
   four DOE synchrotron light sources by visiting the ALS on February 4-6,
   2002. According to review committee chair Pedro Montano (DOE BES
   Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering), this is an important
   review that will "have teeth." A list of questions posed to the ALS by
   the review committee involves issues such as beamtime allocation,
   alternatives to participating research team (PRT) models, cost
   effectiveness, and future trends, plans, and potential problems. The
   agenda also includes updates on the current status of the ALS,
   scientific highlights, descriptions of industrial programs, overviews
   of future directions, and lunches with representatives of ALS advisory
   groups (UEC, SAC, PRTs). The highlight sessions will be open and will
   take place Monday and Tuesday, February 4-5, in Rm. 6-2202.

   2. REMINDER: COMPENDIUM ABSTRACTS DUE JANUARY 28
   (Contact: LSTamura@lbl.gov)

   The deadline for submitting Compendium abstracts is next Monday,
   January 28, 2002. All users or user groups (including ALS staff
   members) should submit a one- to three-page abstract (including
   figures) describing each project conducted at the ALS during calendar
   year 2001, whether published, unpublished, or in progress. Submission
   information (including author guidelines, file specifications, and a
   submission form) can be found on the Web at
   http://alspubs.lbl.gov/Compendium_old. If you encounter problems
   uploading files via the Web, please don't hesitate to notify Lori
   Tamura as soon as possible (LSTamura@lbl.gov, 510-486-6172).

   3. TIGHTER ACCESS PROCEDURES TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY
   (Contact: alsuser@lbl.gov)

   According to Berkeley Lab Director Charles Shank, the DOE has
   determined that the national laboratories will operate at a somewhat
   heightened security status for the foreseeable future. For ALS users,
   this means being diligent about planning ahead and following
   registration procedures (see
   http://www-als.lbl.gov/als/quickguide/registration.html). This will
   ensure that your name(s) will be added to the access list for the main
   (Blackberry Canyon) gate, where you should be prepared to show a photo
   ID upon arrival. Shuttle bus riders will be asked to show ID (e.g., Lab
   proximity card, Berkeley student ID, DOE badge) or demonstrate a
   business need to enter the Lab (e.g., a letter from the ALS, a badged
   employee as escort). Visitors arriving at the site who are not cleared
   by any of the above methods will remain in the gate area while the
   visitor's host is called. If the host cannot be reached, the Security
   Officer will then offer an escort to the visitor's destination. Further
   information about security procedures at Berkeley Lab can be found at
   http://www.lbl.gov/ehs/securityupdate/. If you have any questions about
   what to do, please contact the User Services Office at alsuser@lbl.gov
   or 510-486-7745.

   4. UEC CORNER: NOTES FROM THE USERS' EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
   by Roger Falcone
   (Contact: rwf@physics.berkeley.edu)

   As the new Chair of the Users' Executive Committee, I want to extend an
   invitation to all users to contact the members of the UEC with concerns
   or questions regarding the ALS Users' Group. I look forward to
   coordinating the efforts of the UEC in support of science at our
   facility.

   As you may know, the UEC represents the over one thousand users of the
   ALS in a variety of venues, including discussions with ALS, Berkeley
   Lab, and DOE leadership.

   The current membership of the UEC is as follows:

   Harald Ade (North Carolina State University, harald_ade@ncsu.edu,
   2000-02, Past Chair)
   John Bozek (Advanced Light Source, Berkeley Lab, jdbozek@lbl.gov,
   2002-04)
   Jennifer Doudna (Yale University, doudna@csb.yale.edu, 2001-03)
   Roger Falcone (University of California, Berkeley,
   rwf@physics.berkeley.edu, 1999-03, Chair)
   Carolyn Larabell (Life Sciences Division, Berkeley Lab,
   calarabell@lbl.gov, 2000-02)
   Dennis Lindle (University of Nevada, Las Vegas, lindle@nevada.edu,
   2001-03)
   Gerry McDermott (Physical Biosciences Division, Berkeley Lab,
   gmcdermott@lbl.gov, 2001-03)
   Alexander Moewes (University of Saskatchewan, moewes@usask.ca, 2002-04)
   Yasuji Muramatsu (Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute,
   murama@spring8.or.jp, 2002-04)
   Cheuk-Yiu Ng (University of California, Davis, cyng@lbl.gov, 2000-02)
   Eli Rotenberg (Advanced Light Source, Berkeley Lab, erotenberg@lbl.gov,
   2002-04)
   Sophie Canton (Western Michigan University, secanton@lbl.gov, 2002-04,
   Student Member)

   I would like to thank outgoing Chair Harald Ade for his excellent
   leadership and successful efforts during 2001, both in Berkeley and
   with our sponsors in Washington. I'm very pleased that he will be
   continuing on the UEC.

   To briefly introduce myself to you, I am on the Berkeley Physics
   faculty, and have done experiments at the ALS for about five years. For
   my research, I am interested in the dynamics of condensed-matter
   systems illuminated by intense, ultrashort-pulse lasers. I am part of a
   team developing time-resolved x-ray scattering techniques, at both the
   ALS and other synchrotron facilities.

   Please contact me with your ideas for the ALS.

   (Contact: Lampo@lbl.gov)

   For the user runs of December 12 - 17, 18 - 23, January 4 - 7, 8 - 13,
   and 14 - 20, the beam reliability (time delivered/time scheduled) was
   98%. Of the scheduled beam, 86% was delivered to completion without
   interruption. There were no significant outages.

   Long-term and weekly operations schedules are available on the Web
   (http://www-als.lbl.gov/als/accelinfo.html). Requests for special
   operations use of the "scrubbing" shift should be sent to Bruce
   Samuelson (BCSamuelson@lbl.gov, x4738) by 1:00 p.m. Friday. The
   Accelerator Status Hotline at (510) 486-6766 (ext. 6766 from Lab
   phones) features a recorded message giving up-to-date information on
   the operational status of the accelerator.
