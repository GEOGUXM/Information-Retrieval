   ARS National Program Animal pests and pathogens are a serious threat to
   the United States agricultural economy, to food safety, and to human
   health. Losses caused by pests and associated pathogens amount to
   billions of dollars annually and comprise productivity losses and
   damage to the quality of animal products. These problems restrict the
   exportation of animals and animal products from the United States and
   leads to higher prices in the domestic market. Arthropods that transmit
   human disease pose risks to the health of United States military troops
   deployed overseas and to the global human population. Pesticides and
   drugs used for the control of pests and pathogens pose a distinct and
   identifiable threat to animal and human health. Research is needed to
   develop safe, efficacious, environmentally benign, and user friendly
   methods for the detection, surveillance, and control of pests, and for
   the development of new and effective vaccines and immunomodulators,
   biologically-based pest and pathogen control strategies, and for the
   development and use of pest and pathogen resistant livestock.
