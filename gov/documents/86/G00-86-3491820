   Background

   Dr. Blumenthal obtained his Ph.D in physical chemistry at the Weizmann
   Institute, Rehovot Israel. Following post-doctoral work at the
   Institute Pasteur, Paris, France and at Columbia University, New York,
   he came to the NIH and was ultimately recruited by NCI. Dr. Blumenthal
   has worked in a wide range of areas in membrane biophysics which
   include membrane transport, cell surface receptors, immune cytotoxic
   mechanisms, and use of liposomes for delivery of drugs and genes into
   cells. Dr. Blumenthals' current interest is in the cell biology of
   virus entry, replication and pathogenesis.

   Research:

   Mechanism(s) of viral envelope protein-induced membrane fusion

   Introduction: Membrane fusion is ubiquitous in biological systems,
   occurring in the simplest of unicellular eukaryotes as well as higher
   eukaryotes. Evidence is now accumulating that there are several highly
   conserved families of proteins associated with vesicle fusion events,
   from yeast to mammalian cells, as well for intracellular traffic,
   regulated exocytosis and synaptic transmission. The molecular
   structures (or scaffolds) that regulate membrane fusion are likely to
   contain related proteins and share certain fundamental properties. We
   had proposed that an assembly of viral envelope glycoproteins could
   form such a molecular scaffold responsible for bringing the viral
   membrane close to the target cell membrane and creating the
   architecture that enables lipid bilayers to merge . We have developed
   experimental systems based on fluorescence videomicroscopy to study
   such scaffolds. Our work on the stages of influenza hemagglutinin
   fusion pore assembly and dilation confirms the scaffold model in a
   relatively simple biological fusion system.

   Viral Entry: Our goal is to find out how the virus "negotiates" the
   entry of its genetic material into the cell. Cells are surrounded by
   cell membranes which impose insurmountable barriers for passage of
   undesirable molecules and particles into the cell. Viruses are
   enveloped by similar membranes. The virus has developed strategies to
   overcome these insurmountable barriers by designing envelope
   glycoproteins which catalyze the fusion of viral and cellular
   membranes. We are specifically studying the mode of action of the
   envelope glycoproteins of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (gp120-gp41),
   Murine Leukemia Virus, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, Paramyxovirus, and
   Influenza virus. Using quantitative fluorescence videomicroscopy we
   monitor kinetics of fusion between cell pairs consisting of a viral
   envelope glycoprotein-expressing cells and target cells bearing
   appropriate receptors. The cells are labeled with both a fluorescent
   lipid in the membrane and a fluorescent solute in the aqueous space.
   Initial fusion pore opening between cells produced a change in membrane
   potential which was monitored by a decreases in probe fluorescence.
   This event was followed by two distinct stages of fusion pore dilation:
   the flux of fluorescent lipid and the flux of a large aqueous
   fluorescent dye. We have analyzed the kinetics of events which occur as
   a result of transitions between the various stages of fusion pore
   opening. We are pursuing the molecular characteristics of these
   intermediated using a variety of biophysical, virological, molecular
   and cell biological techniques.

   Studies with HIV-1: The concepts and techniques based on working with
   those envelope glycoproteins prepared us to embark upon a program on
   HIV entry into cells. The majority of players (receptors and
   co-receptors) required for HIV-1 entry into cells have now been
   identified. Furthermore, the high resolution structures have been
   determined for the HIV-1 gp41 core and gp120 core complexed with a
   two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a
   neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding.
   Therefore, we are now in a good position to apply our biophysical
   techniques to the elucidation of mechanisms. While a plethora of
   laboratories are pursuing the receptor end of the fusion process, our
   main focus is on the structure and function of the HIV-1 envelope
   glycoprotein (gpl20-gp41) in mediating membrane fusion. During the past
   years we have been able to make great strides in our ability to
   identify the various steps involved in HIV- 1 envelope
   glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion from conformational changes to
   fusion pore widening. We have defined those steps by monitoring the
   kinetics of fusion of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein expressing cells with
   susceptible target cells using differential interference contrast and
   dye redistribution assays monitored by fluorescence video microscopy.

   Recent Findings: Three important advances in the understanding of the
   HIV-1 fusion reaction have resulted from these studies. For the first
   time we have monitored the conformational changes in situ undergone by
   gp120-gp41, which lead to membrane fusion, and shown that they are
   highly cooperative, requiring both CD4 and appropriate chemokine
   receptor (1). We have shown that peptides corresponding to the core
   structure of gp41 capture the fusion reaction in a stable hemi-fusion
   intermediate (2). We have identified a glycosphingolipid which is
   involved in fusion mediated by a CD4-dependent CXCR4-utilizing HIV-1
   Envelope Glycoprotein (3). We also have shown that a synthetic all
   D-Amino Acid peptide corresponding the N-terminal sequence of HIV-1
   gp41 (D-WT) of HIV-1 associates with its enantiomeric wild type fusion
   (WT) peptide in the membrane and inhibits cell fusion mediated by the
   HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (4). The knowledge gained concerning fusion
   mechanisms is helpful in our endeavors to design reagents which block
   fusogenic activity and delivery of the HIV-1 genome into the cell.
