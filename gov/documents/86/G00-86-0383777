   Our mission emphasizes working with NSF to increase the effectiveness
   of our Audit and Investigation activities. Our efforts to develop
   meaningful partnerships within NSF and with NSF awardees are managed
   through the Outreach and Liaison Programs.

   Designated OIG staff Members are liaisons to all the major NSF
   directorate offices. They engage in constructive and informative
   dialogue through briefings and individual conversations with our
   partners to ensure that we develop projects that are mutually
   beneficial and that we effectively communicate the results of our
   activities to NSF managers so that their goals and those of the
   scientific and engineering community are met.

   As always, we welcome your questions, comments and concerns, please
   feel free to contact any of our liaisons. A list of liaisons and their
   telephone numbers is provided below. If you are interested in
   scheduling a briefing at your institution or if you would like to
   obtain specific information to address your particular needs, please
   contact our Outreach Coordinator.
