Debt from Vendors and Suppliers for Small Businesses

   A key source of outside capital.

For nearly 70% of all small businesses, the first source of external capital
is trade credit with vendors and suppliers. Instead of assuming that all
purchases must be paid in advance, or cash on delivery (COD) ask if you can
be invoiced, say monthly. Many established vendors/suppliers have credit
terms and guidelines that you may benefit from. Particularly because if they
make it easier for you to do more business with them, then their business
grows as yours doesa mutually beneficial arrangement.

   Take discounts when appropriate

   Some vendors offer pricing discounts when invoices are paid before due.
   For example, a common option is "2/10 net 30" which translates to: "the
   purchaser can take a 2% discount if the bill is paid within 10 days,
   but the full bill is due in 30 days."


   These types of discounts or "terms" can help the vendors cash flow and
   can increase your profit margin, which contributes toward internally
   generated capital through savings.


   Hint: Some discounts are more valuable than others; consider your cost
   of funds.


   Where to look for vendors and suppliers:
     * Business to Business Yellow Pages
     * Thomas Register of Manufacturers and Suppliers
     * Trade and Industry Publications
     * Networking Expos and Events
     * Referrals from other business owners
     * Referrals from key customers
     * Referrals from key advisors


   Establish primary and secondary relationships.

   If your primary vendor does not offer any assistance, consider
   comparing what other companies may offer. Be sure to consider other
   aspects of the relationship, too, such as pricing, quality, delivery,
   minimum orders, service, and return guidelines before making a radical
   change.


   Even the best supplier can experience an unforeseen problem that can in
   turn impact your business operations. Although working through any
   temporary problems with a dedicated supplier or vendor is best for
   long-term relationships, a prudent entrepreneur has a "back up" or
   contingency plan to obtain critical materials, supplies or services
   when necessary.


   Other ideas to consider with vendors and suppliers are other forms of
   cooperation such as shared advertising, bartering and referrals.
