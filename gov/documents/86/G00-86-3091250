      The U.S. Commercial Service has created the "Travel and Tourism
      e-Market Express" as an expansion of our partnership with the Tourism
      Industries Office (TI) and in response to demand from the travel and
      tourism industry. Travel professionals want to know on a regular basis
      about the latest in market research, trade opportunities and events
      submitted by officers in U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the
      world. Through the online "Travel & Tourism e-Market Express" bulletin,
      U.S. firms can electronically request current market research reports
      created by Commercial Specialists in U.S. Embassies and Consulates
      abroad to assist in expanding their international efforts.

      Firms can also obtain information for upcoming shows in the industry as
      well as trade opportunities and contacts in various international
      markets.

      In addition to the "Travel and Tourism e-Market Express", the Tourism
      Industries Office and U.S. Commercial Service offer other resources
      that can assist U.S. firms with their international endeavors.

      Tourism Industries, which serves as the National Tourism Office for
      policy issues and as the core statistical center, publishes the
      baseline monthly and quarterly arrivals and receipts data, bi-annual
      forecast and analysis and the annual reports on traveler flows,
      expenditures and traveler characteristic data and profiles. Visit TI's
      website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov.

      The U.S. Commercial Service has over 100 offices located throughout the
      U.S.A., and 160 offices located in 82 different countries. Staff in
      these offices work together to provide export counseling to U.S.
      businesses and destinations interested in entering or increasing their
      presence in international markets. Services include one-to-one
      counseling, market research and partner identification. The staff and
      offices serve as a bridge to assist U.S. destinations with identifying
      their best partners overseas and promoting themselves effectively on a
      global basis. To learn more about the Commercial Service offices,
