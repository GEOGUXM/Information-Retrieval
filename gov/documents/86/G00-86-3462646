                      Products and Protection Profiles
                                In Evaluation

   The security products and protection profiles listed herein are in
   various stages of evaluation for conformance to the Common Criteria
   (ISO/IEC 15408). Further, there is no guarantee that products or
   protection files listed will complete evaluation successfully.

   In order for a product or protection profile to be placed on this list
   the product or protection profile must currently be undergoing CCTL
   evaluation under CCEVS procedures, and the CCEVS must have received
   from the sponsor a completed, signed and faxed/mailed CCEVS Form F8001,
   Sponsor's Approval to List Products That Are "In Evaluation". A copy of
   CCEVS Form F8001 is available through "CCEVS Forms & Templates" under
   the "Guidance Documents" webpage.

   The text of the entry will be the same as recorded on CCEVS Form F8001.
   However, PLEASE BE AWARE that information in entries listed below such
   as product or protection profile names, versions, EAL, etc. may change
   as the evaluation progresses, therefore, the viewer should always
   confirm the below entry information with the sponsor contact. Entries
   on this list will be removed when either a Common Criteria Certificate
   has been issued on the product or protection profile, or the CCTL is
   not longer pursuing evaluation of the product or protection profile
   under CCEVS procedures.

   The entries listed below contain information for contacting the sponsor
   of the product or protection profile. The sponor of the evaluation
   provides all information concerning the products or protection profiles
   "in evaluation" including product descriptions, evaluation status and
   evaluation schedules.
