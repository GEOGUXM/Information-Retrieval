   This page provides a quick summary of comets that can be observed
   visually and are expected to be at least magnitude 13.5. Positions for
   the comets discussed below are given on the Ephemerides Page. Current
   information and observations of these comets are also summarized.
   Images for some comets can be found on the Images Page.

Long-Period Comets

   C/1999 Y1 (LINEAR)
   C/2000 SV74 (LINEAR)
   C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR)
   C/2001 W2 (BATTERS)

Short-Period Comets

   P/2001 MD7 (LINEAR)
   P/2001 Q2 (Petriew)
   P/2001 Q6 (Petriew)
   19P/Borrelly
   29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1

C/1999 Y1 (LINEAR)

   C/1999 Y1 (LINEAR) had a perihelion date of March 24, 2001 at a
   perihelion distance of 3.09 AU (MPC 40988). The comet is a Southern
   circumpolar object and is probably too faint for visual observers.

C/2000 SV74 (LINEAR)

   This comet has a perihelion date of April 30, 2002 at a distance of
   3.54 AU (MPC43018). This comet is m1~13.0. It is not expected to change
   its brightness significantly through mid-2002. It is and will continue
   to be a north circumpolar object.

C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR)

   At the present time, the comet is 5.3 magnitude. The comet is
   well-placed for both hemispheres in the evening sky, but it will become
   an exclusively Southern Hemisphere object by mid-December as it races
   south. The comet will continue south and will reach peak brightness
   (~4.5 magnitude) in mid-January 2002, when it is at ~-54 or so degrees
   declination. The comet will then move northward giving both Northern
   and Southern Hemisphere observers the chance to watch the it fade.

   The comet's perihelion date is 2002 Jan. 22.8 at a distance of 0.55 AU.

C/2001 MD7 (LINEAR)

   This comet has a perihelion distance of 1.25 AU on November 30, 2001
   (MPC 43759). The comet is near its peak magnitude of 12.0 and it wil
   fade as it moves north as an evening object. The Southern Hemisphere is
   favored.

C/2001 W2 (BATTERS)

   IAU Circular 7758 (November 21, 2001) announced the discover of a comet
   by the "Bisei Asteroid Tracking Telescope for Rapid Survey" (BATTERS)
   program. The orbit (MPEC 2001-X10) indicates a perihelion date of Dec
   24, 2001 at a distance of 1.05 AU. The comet, which is m1~12.0, is in
   the evening sky heading for conjunction. It is not expected change in
   brightness significantly in the next few weeks. It is unlikely to be
   observed visually after conjunction.

P/2001 Q2 (Petriew)

   It is rare these days when an amateur discovers a comet...it is even
   rarer when it happens to be a visual discovery and rarer still when it
   happens at a star party. Such was the case on Saturday night when Vance
   Avery Petriew discovered a comet during a star party at Cyprus Hills
   Interprovincial Park, Saskatchewan, Canada (IAUC 7686, August 19,
   2001).

   IAU Circular 7688 (August 21) states that the preliminary orbit for
   this comet indicates that it is periodic with perihelion of 0.95 AU, a
   perihelion date of September 2, 2001, and a period of 5.5 years. The
   elements suggest a close approach to Jupiter in 1982. The comet is
   fainter than 13.0 and will move south as a morning object as it fades.

P/2001 Q6 (NEAT)

   The orbit (MPC 44030) indicates a perihelion date of November 9, 2001
   at a distance of 1.4 AU. The comet peaked at ~11.0 and was last
   reported at ~11.5. It is in the morning sky and ti is expected to fade.
   Northern Hemisphere is favored.

19P/Borrelly

   This dust-rich periodic comet reached perihelion on Sept. 14, 2001 at a
   distance of 1.36 AU. The comet is ~11.5 and moving North in the morning
   sky. The Northern Hemisphere is favored. The comet will fade slowly.

29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1

   This comet has outbursts to 11th magnitude and thus, should be
   monitored. It is heding for solar conjunction.
