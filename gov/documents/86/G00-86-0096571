   NIH Web Privacy Notice

   Of the information we learn about you from your visit to "www.nih.gov,"
   we store only the following: the domain name from which you access the
   Internet (such as "aol.com"), the date and time you access our site,
   terms entered into our search engine, and the Internet address of the
   web site from which you direct-linked to our site. This information is
   used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our
   site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. We do not
   attempt to associate this information with individual users. Unless it
   is specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be
   collected about you.

   When inquiries are E-mailed to us, we store the question and the E-mail
   address information so that we can respond electronically. Unless
   otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends
   questions or comments to our web site. We will not obtain information
   that will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our site,
   unless you chose to provide such information to us.

   E-mail sent to NIH may be seen by a number of people who are
   responsible for answering questions. If the information specialist who
   answers the mail does not know the answer to your question, your query
   may be forwarded to another NIH employee more experienced in that area.
   On occasion, we may conduct a study concerning the types of questions
   sent to us. These studies involve coding the queries to see if there
   are recurring problems that users are having in finding information.
   The knowledge gained by these studies is used to improve our Web site
   in order to make it more responsive to the needs of our users. We do
   not forward your mail outside of NIH nor do we collect your name and
   e-mail address for any purpose other than to respond to your query.
   Nevertheless; you should be aware that e-mail is not necessarily secure
   against interception. If your communication contains sensitive or
   personal information, you may want to send it by postal mail. This
   statement applies to the central NIH home page. Other organizations at
   NIH may process their mail differently. Please check their sites for
   additional privacy information.

   About "Cookies"
   While visiting sites within the NIH.GOV domain, you may occasionally
   encounter a Web page that employs cookies. A cookie is a small file
   that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our
   server to "remember" specific information about your session while you
   are connected.

   Requests to send cookies from NIH Web pages are not designed to collect
   information about you, but only about your browser "session." The
   cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of these Web
   pages. The cookie and the information about your session will be
   destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browser--it is not
   permanently stored on your computer. Unless an NIH web page
   specifically notifies you otherwise, we will not collect and maintain
   personal information about you.

   To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after
   you have finished conducting business with a Web site that uses
   cookies. If you are concerned about the potential use of information
   gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to
   prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have
   settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies.

   Questions about NIH privacy policies should be sent to the NIH Privacy
   Act Officer.
