   Postdoctoral Program

   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

   The Postdoctoral Program AM 1107 (77k pdf*) provides a means of
   advancing knowledge in the areas of basic and applied research and
   strengthening our national scientific and technical capabilities.
   Appointees provide valuable stimulus to the research efforts of
   Laboratory staff and make available the most recent developments of
   university science and engineering departments as well as forming
   communication links between the Laboratory, industry, and universities.
   The Laboratory experience presents appointees the opportunity to derive
   significant professional accomplishment and advancement of their career
   goals by publishing the results of their work, participating in
   scientific and technical conferences and presenting seminars.
   Candidates are nominated and sponsored by a member of the Laboratory's
   technical staff. Selection is based on Laboratory wide competition and
   is determined by the candidate's academic qualifications and research
   excellence.

   The call for postdoctoral packages (master management memo) to consider
   candidates for Postdoctoral Fellow Director's funding) is sent out
   every quarter approximately one month before submittal deadlines.

   NOTE: When accessing the LDRD PIRS system, the Postdoc Program falls
   under the category of "PRD". You must "submit" the proposal first to
   access the required forms. If you have any problems with this system or
   process, please contact Lennett Rendon in the LDRD Office at 7-1235 for
   assistance.
   APPLICATION PROCEDURES

   Every postdoc at the Laboratory MUST be sponsored by a technical staff
   member. To identify a potential sponsor, you can review the technical
   divisions and the science subject areas of the Laboratory. In addition,
   you can meet potential sponsors at national and international
   conferences and workshops, by networking with colleagues, or by
   scanning journal publications.

   For initial consideration, apply directly to the program OR apply
   online to a specific posted job. To apply online:
    1. Find a job that matches your qualifications and interests.
    2. Click "Apply for this job" button at the bottom of the detailed job

   TYPES OF POSITIONS
    1. Postdoctoral Fellows are provided the opportunity to pursue
       independent research of their own choice. Doctoral degree
       recipients within the past five years, who are recognized in their
       fields, are eligible to compete for two year, renewable for a third
       year, limited-term appointments. The number of appointments is
       limited. Candidates for Postdoctoral Fellow appointments are
       reviewed and selected four times annually and are determined by the
       strengths of the candidates' research proposals and their academic
       and research excellence, by a committee comprised of technical
       staff members.
    2. Postdoctoral Research Associates are provided the opportunity to
       pursue research directly involved with Laboratory programmatic
       efforts. Postdoctoral Research Associates are required to
       contribute to Laboratory programs and do not generally perform
       independent research. Doctoral degree recipients within the past
       five years are eligible to compete for two year, renewable for a
       third year, limited-term appointments. Sponsored candidates for
       programmatic funded appointments - Postdoctoral Research Associates
       - are reviewed and selected by the postdoctoral committee
       throughout the year.
          + Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Appointment
            This appointment, in coordination with the Intelligence
            Community and the Department of Energy, affords exciting and
            challenging research opportunities to candidates interested in
            areas that have the basis for future technological
            developments important to the Intelligence Community. Up to 2
            appointments will be funded per year. Each year, research
            topics of interest will be announced, although other topics
            that may be of interest to the Intelligence Community and the
            Department of Energy will be considered if proposed. The
            current topics are:
               o Radiometric Analysis of Detectable Phenomenology in the
                 LWIR
               o Use of Combinatorial Chemistry in Power Sources
                 Development
               o Electrode Improvements for Lithium-Ion Batteries
               o Analog Neural Networks for Communication Receivers
               o Quantum Dot Technology
               o Low Power Wireless Telecommunications
               o Neuroscience for Visual & Display Systems
               o Neuromorphic Engineering
            Recipients of these Postdoctoral appointments will have the
            opportunity to work as a Laboratory postdoc for a period of up
            to three years. In addition to conducting research with their
            identified LANL sponsor, recipients of these appointments will
            interact with a resource person within the Intelligence
            Community. In addition, the recipients and LANL sponsors will
            travel to Washington up to two times a year to meet with other
            recipients of this appointment as well as visit the funding
            agency to gain a better understanding of its technical needs.
            Salary and eligibility requirements for these appointments are
            the same as for regular Postdoctoral Research Associate
            appointments. Appointments will require the ability to obtain
            a DOE "Q" clearance. US citizenship is required. Current
            Laboratory Postdocs who have been at the Laboratory for less
            than two years are eligible to apply for this opportunity.
    3. There are three Special Postdoctoral Fellowships:
       Candidates for these fellowships must display extraordinary ability
       in scientific research and show clear and definite promise of
       becoming outstanding leaders in the research they pursue.
       Sponsored candidates competing for this fellowship will be reviewed
       by the Laboratory's Postdoctoral Committee at the December
       quarterly meeting. See meeting schedule.. The Director of the
       Laboratory will make final selections.
          + The J. Robert Oppenheimer (JRO) Postdoctoral Fellowship
            Named after the Laboratory's first Director, this fellowship
            provides the opportunity for recipients to pursue independent
            research of their own choice. This opportunity is not
            restricted to U.S. citizens.
          + The Richard P. Feynman (RPF) Postdoctoral Fellowship in Theory
            and Computing
            Named after the famed theoretical physicist and winner of the
            1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, this fellowship provides the
            opportunity for recipients to pursue independent research of
            their own choice in the areas of theory and computing with
            emphasis on modeling and simulation.
          + The Frederick Reines (FR) Postdoctoral Fellowship in
            Experimental Sciences
            Named after the former Los Alamos National Laboratory
            researcher who won the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics, this
            fellowship provides the opportunity for recipients to pursue
            independent research of their own choice in experimental
            sciences. The awards will go to outstanding experimentalists
            regardless of their field of study.
       The Feynman and Reines Fellowship appointments will require U.S.
       citizenship and the ability to obtain a DOE "Q" clearance. The
       Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear Weapons will fund these
       fellowship categories.
