                     JURISDICTION

             Judicially independent, although it "is located for
   administrative purposes only in the Department of Defense of Defense,"
   the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces exercises
   jurisdiction over questions of law in -- (1) all cases in which the
   sentence, as affirmed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, extends to death;
   (2) all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge
   Advocate General of a military department or the General Counsel of the
   Department of Transportation acting for the Coast Guard orders sent to
   the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review; and (3) all cases
   reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals in which, upon petition of the
   accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for the Armed
   Forces has granted a review.  In those cases which extend to death,
   which are ordered sent to the Court by the Judge Advocates General of
   the military departments or by the General Counsel of the Department of
   Transportation acting for the Coast Guard, or in which the Court grants
   further review on petition of the accused for good cause, the decisions
   of the Court are subject to further review by the Supreme Court of the
   United States on petition for certiorari.  In all other cases on direct
   appellate review the Court's decisions are final and conclusive --
   there is no further direct review of such cases provided by law.  Since
   only about 10 percent of the cases reviewed by the Court become
   eligible for further review by the Supreme Court of the United States,
   for most convicted servicemembers the United States Court of Appeals
   for the Armed Forces is truly the court of last resort.  An accused may
   petition a Federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus or for
   other collateral relief in an attempt to set aside a conviction or
   upgrade a punitive discharge based on an alleged denial of
   constitutional rights.  An accused may also challenge a court-martial
   conviction in a suit for back pay in the United States Court of Federal
   Claims.  However, very few court-martial convictions are overturned in
   these courts.

             In addition to exercising jurisdiction to review
   court-martial cases on direct appellate review, the Court entertains
   and acts on petitions for extraordinary relief, writ appeal petitions
   (in which a Court of Criminal Appeals has acted on a petition for
   extraordinary relief), and petitions for review of decisions of the
   Courts of Criminal Appeals in cases in which the United States has
   exercised its right to appeal certain rulings of a military judge
   during the course of a court-martial trial.  In such cases, further
   review by the Supreme Court of the United States on petition for
   certiorari is limited to those instances in which the United States
   Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has granted relief.
