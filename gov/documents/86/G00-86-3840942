   ADWR Contact Information

   ADWR works to secure long-term water supplies for Arizona's
   communities. The Department administers state water laws (except those
   related to water quality), explores methods of augmenting water
   supplies to meet future demands, and develops policies that promote
   conservation and equitable distribution of water. Also, the Department
   oversees the use of surface and groundwater resources under state
   jurisdiction and negotiates with external political entities to protect
   Arizona's Colorado River water supply.

   Other responsibilities include management of floodplains and
   non-federal dams to reduce loss of life and damage to property. ADWR is
   not a municipal water provider.
