 Remote MEchanical MIrroring using Controlled stiffness and Actuators (MEMICA)
                                    Homepage

   This Website describes the JPL's NDEAA Technologies joint activity with
   Rutgers University. In this project, the team is pursuing the
   development and demonstration of a novel haptic interfacing capability
   called MEMICA (remote MEchanical MIrroring using Controlled stiffness
   and Actuators). MEMICA is intended to provide human operators intuitive
   and interactive feeling of the stiffness and forces at remote or
   virtual sites in support of space, medical, underwater, virtual
   reality, military and field robots performing dexterous manipulation
   operations. The key aspect of the MEMICA system is a miniature
   Electrically Controlled Stiffness (ECS) element that mirrors the
   stiffness at remote/virtual sites. The ECS elements make use of
   Electro-Rheological Fluid (ERF), which is an Electro-Active Polymer
   (EAP), to achieve this feeling of stiffness. Forces applied at the
   robot end-effector due to a compliant environment will be reflected to
   the user by this ERF device where a change in the system viscosity will
   occur proportionally to the force to be transmitted.

   Currently, medical applications of the MEMICA technology are being
   considered by the following team:
   JPL - Dr. Yoseph Bar-Cohen, Dr. Benjamin Dolgin and Dr. Sean Leary
   Rutgers University - Dr. Constantinos Mavroidis, and Dr. Mourad Bouzit
   Harbor-UCLA Medical Center - Rodney White, M.D., and George Kopchok
   NASA Johnson Space Center - Dr. Deborah Harm
