     INTERNSHIPS
     The rules of the House of Representatives permit interns,
     volunteers, and fellows to serve temporarily in the office of a
     Member of Congress when that service is primarily of educational
     benefit. Congressman Dreier has tried to make internships available
     in his office in Washington, D.C., and in his district office in
     California in order to provide that experience for students and
     others who wish to learn more about the workings of a congressional
     office and about the workings of our country's democratic political
     process.

     Internships in both California and Washington are unpaid and last
     approximately three months (Washington internships are usually
     full-time during that period). It is extremely important to remember
     that internships are wholly educational experiences designed to
     further the knowledge and skills of students. Interns will not be
     asked to substitute for paid staff.

     To apply for an internship with Congressman Dreier fill out and send
     in a completed Internship Application Form to the respective office
     where you wish to intern. Addresses can be found at the top of the
     internship application form.

     If you have any questions regarding internships with Congressman
     Dreier, please feel free to call our Covina office at (626)339-9078
     or our D.C. office at (202)225-2305.

     NOTE: The application deadline for Summer internships is March 15th.
