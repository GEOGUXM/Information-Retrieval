   CIS2 Visual Interoperability Testbed

   (aka the CIS2 to VRML Translator)
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview

   The CIS2 Visual Interoperability Testbed translates a CIS2 file
   (CIMsteel Integration Standards) of a steel structure into a 3D
   interactive model in the form of a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling
   Language) file. The translator is part of the research in developing a
   mapping between VRML data structures and CIS2.

   The translator recognizes CIS2 entities related to analysis,
   manufacturing, and design models, however, some entities related to
   those types of models are ignored. Users can visualize CIS2 files and
   make them available on the web and software developers can verify their
   CIS2 export capabilities. CIS1 files are not recognized.


VRML Information

     * A VRML browser or plugin must be installed in the web browser in
       order to be able to view a CIS2 file that is translated to a VRML
       file.
     * Use the VRML Browser Detector to check if your web browser is
       properly configured to be able to view VRML files.
     * Cosmo Player is the recommended VRML browser (Getting Started
       Guide).
     * The VRML generated by the translator can also be displayed with
       Cortona or Pivoron Player but not with blaxxun Contact.
     * If you are unfamiliar with VRML, read the basic information for
       viewing VRML files before proceeding.
     * A fast computer (500 MHz) with at least 128 Mb of memory, an 8 Mb
       graphics card, and a screen resolution of at least 1024x768 is
       recommended to view the VRML models. Larger models will require 512
       Mb of memory, a 32 Mb graphics card, and a 1 GHz processor.

  Sample CIS2 Files

     * If you do not have your own CIS2 files to translate, sample files
       (.stp extension) can be found at the CIS2 web site under Download
       or at Georgia Tech under Test Models.
     * The following links are to sample CIS2 files at those web sites:
       three story building with bracing (analysis model),   structure
       with bolts, holes, and welds (analysis and manufacturing models),
       large church (analysis model)
     * Right-click on the links for the sample files above to save them on
       your computer. Then they can be used in the form below and
       translated to VRML.

  Usage

    1. To translate a CIS2 file to a VRML model, enter the local file name
       of the CIS2 file in the typein box below or use the Browse...
       button to find the file on your local computer. The CIS2 file must
       be an ASCII text file.
       The optional display features below can make the resulting VRML
       models several times larger, than without those features, at the
       expense of how fast the VRML browser can process the model. It can
       also significantly slow down the 3D interactivity of the VRML
       model.
    2. By default, the CIS2 file is initially translated to a VRML text
       file. This way the user can verify that the translation process was
       successful. At the top of the resulting VRML text are some lines
       indicating which CIS2 entities were ignored.
       At the very end of the text should be a line # VRML translation
       complete indicating that the VRML translation has finished. If this
       line is not present, then an error occured during the translation
       process. Error and warning messages generated by the translator
       about the CIS2 file, will be also be at the end of the file.
       The text file can be saved as a file with an extension of .wrl and
       displayed in the web browser. In the extension .wrl, the last
       letter is an L not a 1.
    3. The CIS file can also be translated directly to a 3D interactive
       model. If there are no errors with the VRML that is generated, then
       it will be displayed in the VRML browser. The VRML is generated
       with predefined viewpoints which can be accessed with the PageUp
       and PageDown keys.
       Information about navigating your VRML browser can be found in the
       Cosmo Player Getting Started Guide or Cortona User's Guide.
       Warning or error messages are indicated in Cosmo Player by yellow
       or red lights at the top of the VRML browser controls. Clicking on
       the lights will open up the VRML console where the text of the
       warning or error messages can be found. The VRML console can also
       be displayed with the "\" key.

  Notes

     * If the VRML file cannot be translated directly to a VRML model or
       the VRML model is never displayed, then generate the VRML as text
       (step 2) and save it as a file with an extension of .wrl (In the
       extension .wrl, the last letter is an L not a 1). Edit this file to
       remove the HTML at the top and bottom of the file. The first line
       of the .wrl file should be #VRML V2.0 utf8   The last line should
       be # VRML translation complete. Then, open this file in the web
       browser (not this web page) and the VRML should be displayed if a
       VRML browser or plugin is installed in your web browser.
     * Xsteel users: Older versions of Tekla's Xsteel output the
       orientation of manufacturing model parts incorrectly to the CIS2
       file. Therefore, in the resulting VRML, the parts are positioned
       correctly but are usually rotated 90 degrees about their long axis.
     * New Features: option to ignore part or element thicknesses

  Feedback

   There are several possible outcomes of the translation process:
    1. An error occurs with the translation or VRML display. Errors that
       occurs during the translation process are automatically reported
       back to me and if they are not dependent on your CIS file can be
       readily fixed.
    2. If the VRML model is missing some features that you expect to see,
       then check the top of the VRML text file to see which CIS2 entities
       were ignored.
    3. If the VRML model looks wrong, then it is either a problem with the
       translator or the model.
    4. If the VRML model only displays the background colors and ground
       plane or the parts are all oriented in the same direction, then
       your computer does not have enough memory to display the model.
