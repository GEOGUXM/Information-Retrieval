Section 3.2  LOW-ENERGY ELECTRON RANGES IN MATTER

   [OrangeBar.gif]

   Piero Pianetta

   The electron range is a measure of the straight-line penetration
   distance of electrons in a solid [1]. Electrons with energies in the
   kilo-electron volt range, traveling in a solid, are scattered
   inelastically in collisions with the electrons in the material. For
   low-Z materials, such as organic insulators, scattering from the
   valence electrons is the major loss mechanism for incident electron
   energies from 10 eV to 10 keV. The core levels contribute less than 10%
   to the electron’s energy dissipation for energies between 1 keV and 10
   keV [2].

A. CSDA RANGES

   For electron energies below 5 keV, the usual Bethe-Bloch formalism is
   inadequate for calculating the electron energy loss in a solid, and an
   approach using the dielectric response of the material is used [3]. The
   complex dielectric function [[Sec3202.gif] ] describes the response of
   a medium to a given energy transfer [[Sec3204.gif] ] and momentum
   transfer [[Sec3206.gif] ]. The dielectric function contains
   contributions from both valence and core electrons. References 4 and 5
   describe the steps for calculating [[Sec3207.gif] ] for insulators and
   metals, respectively. For an electron of energy E, the probability of
   an energy loss w per unit distance is given by [2]

   [[Sec3209.gif] ]                      (1)


   where[ [Sec3211.gif] ] and [[Sec3213.gif] ]. The quantity
   [[Sec3215.gif] ] is also known as the differential inverse mean free
   path, because by integrating it over all allowed energy transfers, the
   inelastic mean free path (IMFP) is obtained. Furthermore, an
   integration of [[Sec3217.gif] ] over all allowed energy transfers gives
   the energy loss per unit path length, or stopping power S(E) The
   stopping power can then be used to calculate the distance it takes to
   slow an electron down to a given energy. This distance is called the
   continuous slowing down approximation range, or CSDA range, because the
   calculation assumes that the electron slows down continuously from the
   initial energy E to the final energy, which is usually taken to be 10
   eV [2]. The CSDA range [[Sec3219.gif] ] is given by

   [[Sec3221.gif] ]                                                (2)


   The calculations for IMFP and stopping power have been carried out down
   to 10 eV for a number of materials, including [[Sec3223.gif] ] [3];
   polystyrene [2]; polyethylene [6]; collodion [7]; and silicon,
   aluminum, nickel, copper, and gold [5]. The CSDA ranges from 15 eV to 6
   keV were then calculated for polystyrene, silicon, and gold by
   integrating Eq. (2) and are shown in Fig. 3-3. These curves can be used
   with confidence down to 100 eV. However, comparisons of different
   available calculations with the meager experimental data below 100 eV
   indicate that errors as large as 100% may occur at 10 eV. An example of
   this is shown in the figure, where experimental range data for
   collodion are given. It is clear that the agreement between the
   collodion and polystyrene data starts to become reasonable above 100
   eV. The differences below 100 eV could equally well be due to problems
   with the theory or to the increased difficulty of the measurement.
   Stopping-power calculations for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have
   been carried out only from 100 eV, so that the CSDA range as defined
   above could not be calculated [4]. However, data on effective electron
   ranges of photoelectrons in PMMA at several energies can be found in
   Ref. 8.

   and silicon [5] and for polystyrene, (C[8]H[8])[n], with a density of

   density of 1 g/cm^3 is also plotted [7].


   B. ELECTRON INELASTIC MEAN FREE PATHS

   A very important aspect of photoelectron spectroscopy, especially with
   synchrotron radiation, is the ability to effectively tune the surface
   sensitivity from a few angstroms or a few tens of angstroms in
   core-level photoemission measurements to a few hundred angstroms in
   total-electron-yield surface EXAFS experiments. This variation arises
   from the fact that the IMFP of the photoemitted electrons is a strong
   function of the electron kinetic energy, which can be tuned by the
   appropriate choice of photon energy. The definition of the IMFP [9] is
   the average distance traveled by an electron between inelastic
   collisions. Although the exact relationship between the IMFP and
   kinetic energy depends on the detailed electronic structure of the
   element or compound of interest, the general features are similar for
   all elements, starting at large values for kinetic energies below 10–15
   eV, dropping to a minimum value of 5–10 Å at kinetic energies between
   30 and 100 eV, and then rising monotonically above 100 eV.

   Since the surface sensitivity is determined by the depth perpendicular
   to the surface from which electrons can escape, it is best defined
   using the mean escape depth (MED), which is related to the IMFP by

   D = l[i] cos a
   ,                                                                 (3)

   where D is the MED, l[i] is the IMFP and a is the emission angle of the
   electrons relative to the surface normal. However, it should be noted
   that elastic scattering effects within the solid could increase the MED
   as much as a factor of two at electron emission angles greater than
   60°, depending on the angle of incidence of the incoming x-rays and the
   particular core level being studied [9,10]. Therefore, the standard
   technique of increasing the surface sensitivity by working at glancing
   emission angles using Eq. (3) must be qualified to take these effects
   into account. In addition, both angle-dependent cross sections and
   photoelectron diffraction effects can result in anisotropic emission
   from the solid that can also cause errors in the interpretation of the
   MEDs in solids. Because of these complications, graphs of the IMFPs,
   rather than the MEDs, versus electron kinetic energy will be presented
   here to give a measure of the surface sensitivity. The reader is
   referred to Ref. 9 when more complicated experimental conditions need
   to be considered.

   Using the formalism developed by Penn that uses optical data to
   determine the IMFP of a material [11], Tanuma et al. have calculated
   the IMFPs for a large number of elements and compounds for kinetic
   energies up to 2000 eV [12–14]. Figure 3-4 shows IMFP curves for Ag,
   Al, Na, PMMA, Si, and SiO[2].

   to 2000 eV, for Ag, Al, NA, PMMA, Si, and SiO[2].

   These materials are representative of a fairly wide variety of
   materials for kinetic energies between 200 and 2000 eV. For example,
   the IMFPs for Ni, Ta, W, Pt, and Au all hover around the values given
   here for Ag; Cr, Fe, and Cu fall between Al and Ag. Likewise, C falls
   between Si and SiO[2], whereas GaAs overlies the PMMA curve for much of
   this energy range. The behavior below 200 eV is more complex, because
   the IMFPs are strongly dependent on the details of the electronic
   structure. Figure 3-5 shows the region below 250 eV for Al, Ag, GaAs,
   NA, PMMA, and Si. Silicon dioxide is not shown here because it overlaps
   the PMMA curve in this range, whereas GaAs does not. Although the
   calculations below 50 eV may not be reliable, owing to limitations in
   the theory, the values are plotted at these low energies to show the
   general behavior of the IMFPs in this region, as well as the location
   of the minima for the different materials.

   Calculations for additional materials can be found in the literature as
   follows: (i) elements from C to Bi [12]; (ii) III-V and II-VI compound
   semiconductors, alkali halides, Si[3]N[4], and several oxides [13]; and
   (iii) organic compounds [14]. Calculations are being presented here
   because they provide the most complete and consistent set of values for
   the IMFPs. References 9 and 10 give the historical background for both
   the theory and the experimental work in this field and show that it is
   difficult to generalize much of the experimental data in the
   literature, owing to the experiment-specific effects described above,
   as well as uncertainties in sample preparation. Seah and Dench [15]
   where the first to classify the material dependence of the IMFPs and
   presented data for kinetic energies up to 10 keV. A good example of the
   care that is needed in determining IMFPs is given in Ref. 8, which is a
   study of the Si/SiO[2] system. Finally, it should be mentioned that
   spin-dependent effects on the IMFP have also been observed in
   ferromagnetic materials [17].
