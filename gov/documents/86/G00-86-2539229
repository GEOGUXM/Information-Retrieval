                            CEDR User Authorization

     Why is Registering for Access to CEDR Data Necessary?

     The reason for the registration is that cause of death is provided
     in some of the files pertaining to mortality studies. Some of the
     States from whom death certificates were obtained to ascertain cause
     of death require that they be notified who is using these data
     before CEDR can release the files with cause of death. Part of the
     reason for this is that, although the obvious identifiers have been
     removed from the data, a promise of confidentiality is still
     required. One state requires a description of the protocol or
     intended usage of the data file.

     Is There Any Way to Get a Preview of What Data Look Like Before I
     Register?

     Yes. In addition to the CEDR data files that require authorization,
     CEDR comprises a number of data file sets and other information
     objects which contain no restricted data.

     The following CEDR data file sets are publicly accessible:

     * RERF Cancer Incidence
     * RERF Report 12 Cancer Mortality
