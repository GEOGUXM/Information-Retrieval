Summary of Surface-Water-Quality Data Collected in Ottawa County, Oklahoma,
in 2000

U. S. Geological Survey, in Cooperation with the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma
     __________________________________________________________________

   The U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Quapaw Tribe,
   conducted periodic water-quality sampling of five sites in Ottawa
   County, Oklahoma in 2000. Surface waters draining Quapaw Tribal lands
   may be substantially affected by runoff and discharges from lead and
   zinc mines in the historical Picher Mining District. Those surface
   waters may also be affected by agricultural runoff, industrial
   discharges, and municipal wastewater discharges.

   Surface water in the area was determined to transport substantial loads
   of heavy metals during high streamflows. There were also substantial
   counts of fecal- indicator bacteria in streams during high flows.
   Traces of numerous pesticides were also detected. A few VOC's were also
   detected.
