   Washington, D.C.

   The Denver Mint. The United States Mint offers tours in its
   Philadelphia and Denver locations. At both facilities, the tours are
   free to the public. Touring the U.S. Mint is a fascinating experience
   for those of all ages and one that will be remembered for a lifetime.
   Tours cover both the present state of coin manufacturing as well as the
   history of the Mint. Learn about the craftsmanship required at all
   stages of the minting process, from the original designs and sculptures
   to the actual striking of the coins. Click on the photo from either
   city for details on hours and addresses.

   The Philadelphia Mint. Both of the Mint locations welcome school groups
   and are wheelchair accessible. Our tours are self-guided but because
   many of our guests have special needs, special services are provided by
   the Exhibits and Public Services Office. Office personnel can provide
   private tours to handicapped or older individuals who request
   assistance. At the Philadelphia Mint facility, a wheelchair is also
   available for individuals who need assistance. Please call 215-408-0110
   (voice) for further information.
