   Caltrans will spend almost $9.6 billion in 2001/02 to manage more than
   45,000 miles of Californias highway and freeway lanes, provide
   inter-city rail services, assist more than 100 public general aviation
   airports and work with local agencies. This is an increase of about
   $1.6 billion, or 17 percent over last year. The budget includes
   resources for about 23,100 staff and an expenditure of $4.2 billion for
   capital projects and $2.3 billion to assist local governments in the
   fiscal year. This very large budget has armed Caltrans with abundant
   resources to pursue its mission of improving mobility and accessibility
   throughout California.

   Where It Goes

   Caltrans carries out its objectives with six primary programs:
   Aeronautics, Highway Transportation, Mass Transportation,
   Transportation Planning, Administration and the Equipment Service
   Center. The department will spend $4 billion for capital outlay
   (excluding buildings) this year, an increase of $834.3 million over
   2000-01. Caltrans will spend $2.6 billion to strengthen toll bridges
   for earthquakes. It will also perform work worth $960.4 million in
   projects for local agencies.
