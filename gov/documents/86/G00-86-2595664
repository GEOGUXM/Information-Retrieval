        "Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity,
        and is the torch which illuminates the world. Science is the highest
        personification of the nation because that nation will remain the
        first which carries the furthest the works of thought and
        intelligence."

                                                              --Louis Pasteur

   Possible concept for Next Generation Space Telescope mission.

        Spaceborne optical interferometry has been identified as a critical
      technology for many of NASA's 21st century science visions. Included in
      the visions are interferometers that can probe the origins of stars and
        galaxies and can ultimately study Earth-like planets around nearby
            stars. To accomplish this feat, precision separation of an
         interferometer's small collecting apertures by large baselines is
      required--hundreds of meters up to thousands of kilometers, along with
      multiple spacecraft formation flying to at least the centimeter level.

         An even finer control level is required, where the interferometer
        optical pathlengths over these distances must be controlled to the
      nanometer level. To date, the technologies have been demonstrated only
      in ground applications with baselines on the order of a hundred meters.
          Space operation will require a significant enhancement of this
                                    capability.

      The StarLight mission will provide a technology demonstration for deep
             space precision formations and very long baseline optical
                                  interferometry.
