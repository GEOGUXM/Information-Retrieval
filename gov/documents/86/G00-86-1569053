   Minister Paris, May 7, 1999 Dear Sir, The Government would like to have
   a study concerning the economic data of the entire nuclear industry and
   in particular the later stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including
   reprocessing. This study will take into account the various hypotheses
   contained in the "Energy 2010-2020" plan report and the international
   conditions of the energy economy. The economic comparisons will be
   carried out from this point of view in respect of the full costs of
   other energy sources, including external environmental costs. This
   study will integrate the various possible development scenarios up to a
   time horizon allowing the long-term costs of the industry's later
   stages to be taken into account. I have requested that this study will
   be caried out by you in conjunction with Messrs René Pellat,
   High-Commissioner for Atomic Energy and Benjamin Dessus, Director of
   the ECODEV programme at the CNRS. I would like to thank you for
   agreeing to do so. You may rely notably on the work concerning the
   later stages of the fuel cycle carried out by Mr Mandil, Director
   General of Energy and Raw Materials at the Ministry of Economy, Finance
   and Industry, and Mr Vesseron, Director of Prevention, Pollution and
   Risks at the Ministry of Regional Development and Environment. In the
   same way, you may also take into account the evaluations prepared by
   the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry (1997 electricity
   generation reference costs), and the strategy reviews and programme of
   the Ministry of National Education, Research and Technology concerning
   research into the later stages of the fuel cycle conducted under the
   terms of the 1991 Act. Furthermore, the work of the Parliamentary
   Office for evaluation of scientific and technological choices, together
   with the reports from the National Commission for Evaluation will be
   helpful in performing your study . I would like you to carry out a
   comparative analysis of the various methods of generating electricity
   and to examine all the factors on which a public decision must be
   based: inherent competitiveness, externalities and long- - Engagement
   letter - term effects, such as the impact of the various generation
   methods on our CO2 emissions and the management of the later stages of
   the nuclear cycle. In order to ensure a relevant analysis of the
   relative economic performances of the various industries, you will
   define harmonised analysis methods, in particular as regards the
   optimisation and discounting criteria to be taken into account. It is
   the Government's wish that you should work in collaboration, where
   necessary, with the departments of the main corporations and bodies of
   the nuclear industry, among them the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique,
   Electricité de France, Cogema, Framatome, ANDRA and the CNRS. It will
   also be desirable to gather experience acquired outside France on these
   subjects and to enlist the support of economic research teams. The
   French Planning Office (Commissariat Général du Plan) will act as your
   group's secretariat. I would like that your report will be submitted to
   me no later than the end of March 2000. For the purposes of this study,
   you will have to contact the Minister of National Education, Research
   and Technology, the Minister of Regional Development and Environment,
   the Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry, the Secretary of state
   for Industry, and the members of the Government directly concerned by

   JOSPIN Monsieur René PELLAT Haut-Commissaire à l'Energie atomique
   Commissariat à l'Energie atomique 31-33, rue de la Fédération 75762
   Paris Cedex 15 Introduction In his letter of May 7, 1999, the Prime
   Minister requested that we conduct "a study concerning the economic
   data of the entire nuclear industry and in particular the later stages
   of the nuclear fuel cycle, including reprocessing". The study was
   intended to include comparisons with the cost of other means of
   producing electricity and to take into account the environmental costs.
   We quickly agreed to respect in a severe manner the terms of this
   request. The study that we have produced covers the technical,
   financial and ecological factors. In addition to meeting the
   requirements of the Prime Minister's remit, our approach also offers
   two key advantages. First we have had to undertake our own detailed
   analysis of all the information needed to carry out the study. This is
   particularly important in a field where doubt is often expressed as to
   the accuracy and even trustworthy nature of the information used. On
   the basis of the contrasting reviews carried out, we can be reasonably
   confident that our sources are reliable. At the same time, this
   strategy has allowed us to explain the main arguments for the
   negotiations in which government and operators will be involved. A
   broad cross-section of scenarios has been explored, with the purpose to
   cover the majority of the strategies envisaged in the context of public
   discussion. Each scenario has been the focus of in-depth study. We have
   also indicated clearly the parameters which, in our opinion, should be
   used as a matter of priority, in order to compare the various
   scenarios. There is an evident disadvantage with the chosen approach.
   We have not sought to define what would be the most desirable future
   scenarios, let alone the resources needed to make them a reality. This
   study does not therefore put forward any recommendations. Those tempted
   to discern any by reading between the lines will do nothing more than
   reveal their own preferences. As for the major choices connected with
   the selected configurations in general, there is no one dominant
   scenario in relation with the determining criteria which we set
   ourselves, whether of an economic or environmental nature. Our
   overriding aim, rather than to guide authorities in their choice or
   even influence public opinion, is to make it possible for the necessary
   democratic - 15 - - Introduction - debate to take place on the basis of
   carefully examined information and reasoning explained in technical,
   economic and ecological terms. Our study centres on two series of
   questions. The first one focuses on existing nuclear facilities. In
   view of the inertia of a French electric power generation system based
   to a very large extent on nuclear energy and on which considerable
   investments have already been made, what leeway are public authorities
   and operators left with as far as the future of these installations is
   concerned ? Specifically : - under what conditions and with what
   economic consequences could the service life of the existing facilities
   be extended ? - what are the economic and environmental consequences of
   decisions aimed at continuing or halting the reprocessing of irradiated
   fuels from the existing facilities ? The second concerns the new
   investments likely to meet, under a variety of hypotheses, the demand
   for electric power. In particular : - what are the technologies
   (nuclear and non nuclear) that can be envisaged, and in what timeframe
   ? - what are the major developments under way in the world likely to
   have an impact on the choices made in France ? - what environmental
   consequences could these choices have by 2050, particularly in terms of
   greenhouse emissions and volumes of high level and long-lived
   radioactive waste ? - what economic consequences will have these
   choices ? The working method In order to provide some answers to these
   questions and having taken account of works conducted previously, in
   particular by Messrs Mandil and Vesseron on the later stages of the
   nuclear cycle, the strategy reviews and programmes by the Ministry for
   National Education, Research and Technology, concerning research into
   the later stages of the cycle conducted under the terms of the 1991 -
   16 - - Introduction - Act, the work of the Parliamentary Office for
   evaluation of scientific and technological choices, as well as the
   reports produced by the National Commission for Evaluation, we have
   given priority to a method in which the selected scenarios aim to
   highlight the consequences of the various sequences of events and
   decisions. Alternative hypotheses have thus been examined regarding the
   growth in demand for electric power, the service life of the nuclear
   power stations currently in operation, the technologies available for
   the future, strategies in terms of reprocessing and the price of fuels.
   The forward-looking analysis of the electric facilities is based above
   all on the description of electric power demand scenarios. For the same
   development in economic growth between 2000 and 2050, we have described
   two electricity demand growth hypotheses, the lower assuming a planned
   effort to bring demand for electric power under control. This is
   followed by a description of the choices of electricity generation
   capacities in line with requirements. These capacities are
   differentiated in terms of : - the share of centralised and
   decentralised power generation ; - the organisation and capacity of
   natural gas supply networks and transport and electricity distribution
   networks ; - the share of non-nuclear technology (mainly in respect of
   the combined natural gas cycles) ; - the share and nature of the
   nuclear industries used (reactors and fuels). We have made a particular
   effort to ensure the technical and economic data used for the various
   industries, nuclear, fuel and renewable, are consistent each other and
   have based our analyses on existing forward-looking scenarios. We have
   thus taken into account both the work of the 2010-2020 Energy
   Commission prepared by the French Planning Office (Commissariat Général
   du Plan) in 1998 and the forward-looking world scenarios available for
   2050, in particular those produced by the International Institute for
   Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) for the World Energy Council. Analysis
   of the scenarios includes the presentation of materials balances
   prepared closest to the physical analysis. It also comprises
   calculation of the annual economic flows in terms of spending
   (investments, including those linked to natural gas supply networks and
   transport and distribution networks, exploitation, fuels) associated
   with each scenario from 2000 to 2050, on the basis of technical and
   economic information collected for each electricity - 17 - -
   Introduction - generation and usage technologies. It produces a global
   comparison of the various discounted cost scenarios, calculated with a
   discount rate of 6 % for the next 30 years and 3 % thereafter.
   Limitations of the study These are connected, on the one hand, with the
   geographical and time- dependent constraints of our study and with the
   uncertainty associated with any long-term discussion, on the other. *
   Geographic and time-dependent limitations - We deliberately limited our
   study to the analysis of France's demand for electricity and to the
   methods of meeting this demand nationally, at a time when the European
   electricity market is opening up. This choice is clearly a restrictive
   one in that the long-term existence of a European electricity market
   could prompt an optimisation of electricity generation facilities at
   European level and not France-wide. - France and Europe's dependence on
   a natural gas supply is only taken into account via the hypothesis
   concerning gas prices, with no quantitative fuel shortage anticipated.
   The impact on national employment has not been quantified. - For the
   most part, our economic analysis is based on economic flows for the
   2000-2050 period. However we have emphasised the inescapable expenses,
   such as dismantling, provisionial storage and definitive waste storage,
   and production potential beyond this date, associated with the
   facilities existing in 2050. Furthermore, we have included some
   appraisal of the economic valuation of the facilities in place in 2050
   for the various scenarios. The study therefore does nothing more than
   touch on the long-term consequences of decisions prior to 2050 (climate
   warming, supervision and maintenance of the very long-term nuclear
   waste stocks). - Similarly, in our analysis of the existing facilities,
   we have not tried to optimise their operations by integrating the
   consequences of decisions relating to new investments. - 18 - -
   Introduction - * Technical, economic and environmental uncertainties In
   order to quantify the various scenarios, a series of forward-looking
   images have been used, both technical and economic in nature ; there is
   a certain degree of uncertainty about these images, as regards economic
   growth, the rate and extent of technical progress, and particularly the
   development in the cost of the various fuels. In this last topic and in
   order to take into account a sufficiently wide range of possibilities,
   we have used contrasting developments in fossil fuel prices, specially
   from a stagnant level beyond 1999 to a doubling by 2050 for the cost of
   the main fuel in question we mean, natural gas. Contents of the report
   Chapter 1 deals with questions concerning the existing stock of nuclear
   facilities and presents an analysis of the economic and environmental
   consequences of the choices still possible as to the service life of
   nuclear power plants and the later stages in the nuclear fuel cycle ;
   however it does not tackle the issue of renewing the facilities, as
   this problem is dealt with in chapter 5. Chapter 2 assesses the
   international situation as far as the civil nuclear industry is
   concerned and highlights the recent internationalisation in
   environmental concerns linked to energy systems. Chapter 3 takes an
   overview of the developments anticipated in terms of the various
   technologies concerning the management of electricity power demand, the
   generation of electricity using fossil and fissionable fuels and
   renewable energy sources as included in the various scenarios set out
   in Chapter 4. Chapter 4 describes the chosen scenarios, differentiated
   by their associated demand electricity (high or low) and by the extent
   to which they rely on nuclear power (with nuclear industry options
   varying both in terms of the choice of reactors and fuels). It also
   contains the materials balances associated with each of these
   scenarios, with presentation of the cumulative balances between now and
   2050 for CO2 emissions and for high level and long-lived nuclear waste
   to be deposited or stored permanently. Chapter 5, presents an
   evaluation of the economic flows corresponding to the various scenarios
   on the basis of the chosen economic hypotheses. Cost components by kWh
   for the various industries are produced on this basis. The economic
   estimate of the environmental externalities is addressed in this - 19 -
   - Introduction - chapter by means of a valuation of the CO2 emissions
   and the nuclear waste accumulated during the 2000-2050 period, on the
   basis of value ranges for CO2 gas and transuranic elements (Pu + minor
   actinides) which are avoided. * * * We would like to thank all the
   experts of the ANDRA, CEA, COGEMA, EDF and FRAMATOME which so kindly
   provided information and agreed to comment on our analyses. Our thanks
   go to the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, the Ministry of
   Regional Development and Environment and the Ministry of Research for
   their support, in particular for the funding of specific studies. We
   would also like to thank the authors of the three reports 1 prepared at
   our request on "Le parc nucléaire actuel", "La prospective
   technologique de la filière nucléaire" and "La prospective
   technologique des filières non nucléaires", together with Enerdata
   which produced the projection model. Although we cannot be held liable
   for these reports, they are nonetheless annexed to our report as key
   documents. We would also like to express our gratitude to our two
   rapporteurs, Nicole Jestin-Fleury and Jacques Percebois, for their
   valuable contribution. Clearly we take full responsibility for the
   contents of the report. The fact that our career paths and personal
   development differ so much has enabled us to appreciate not only the
   difficulties but also the immense benefits of working together on a

   Chapter 1 The legacy from the past for France The evolution of the
   costs of the electricity produced by the nuclear plants developed in
   France from 1977 onwards is largely a tribute to past capital
   expenditure (building of nuclear plants, Eurodif uranium enrichment
   facility, La Hague reprocessing facility, Melox fuel manufactory,
   etc.). Since the majority of those infrastructure costs are now paid
   off, the cost of producing a kWh of electricity is that much lower for
   nuclear plant operators. That situation could continue through to the
   end of the service life of the existing reactor fleet. The only capital
   outlay remaining to be made relates to the interim storage and
   definitive disposal of long-life waste. In this chapter, we chose to
   calculate the balance of materials (fuels used and quantities of spent
   fuels and ultimate waste for disposal) and the economic balance of the
   current fleet of 58 PWR reactors separately from any new power plants
   to be built after the year 2020. Certainly, in doing so, we leave out
   the transitional situations between today's power plants and those of
   the future, which, if we were to pursue our nuclear policy beyond the
   lifetime of the current power plants, would justify further investment
   on such aspects as fuel manufacture or the recycling of certain waste
   types. Those transitional situations will be discussed via the
   scenarios presented in Chapter 4. Knowing the technical characteristics
   of the current nuclear plants, calculating the balances proved easy.
   However, it leaves the operator with some latitude, particularly as
   regards the decisions of the nuclear safety authority, which influence
   the overall economic performances of the fleet. 1. The latitude
   associated with the fleet of reactors This latitude depends : - 21 - -
   The legacy from the past for France - * Firstly, on the service life of
   the existing nuclear plants Indeed, as the major portion of the capital
   investment is already paid and weighs heavily on the overall cost of
   the system, the lifetime of the nuclear plants has a major impact on
   the economic equilibrium of the system. Although prolonging the
   lifetime of the plants increases the electricity production for the
   same initial investment, it nevertheless involves quite considerable
   expenditure on upkeep. Achieving the optimum balance between lifetime
   and cost of upkeep will minimise the average price of the kWh over the
   lifetime of the fleet. * Then, on the good or poor use made of the
   existing nuclear plants The productivity of the existing plants can be
   improved by adjusting various parameters, basically those that impact
   the energy content of the fuel and the utilisation of the power plants.
   Improving the energy efficiency of the fuel shortens the outage time
   for fuel reloading, saves on materials at the front end of the cycle,
   produces less waste at the back end of the cycle and increases annual
   electricity production. Concerning fuel quality, we recall that the
   amount of energy released in the core of the reactor depends on the
   quantity of fissile materials and, to a lesser extent, the quantity of
   fertile materials contained in the fuel that was loaded into the
   reactor. When that quantity increases (for instance if the fuel is
   enriched so that it contains more 235U, the fissile isotope of the
   uranium), the fuel produces the same amount of energy in the core each
   day but over a longer period, thereby increasing its combustion rate.
   The utilisation of the nuclear plant is described by its load factor or
   capacity factor Kp (i.e. its real production compared to the
   theoretical yield of the same nuclear plant running at full capacity
   over the same period). The factor Kp is the product of the fleet
   availability factor (the period of time during which the plant is
   on-line generating electricity) and its utilisation factor (the real
   energy called over the period of availability). The ability to improve
   the production capacity of the fleet depends on the following factors :
   - the operator's ability to reduce unplanned outages (i.e. the
   frequency and duration of random failures) ; - the operator's ability
   to reduce scheduled outages, i.e. to manage the power plants as
   efficiently as possible (by keeping down maintenance and refuelling
   times, the duration of ten-year inspections, etc.) ; - 22 - - The
   legacy from the past for France - - the position of the nuclear plants
   in the load curve, since we are aware that using nuclear plants for
   anything other than base-load generation impacts the overall economics
   of the fleet. * And lastly on the options taken up for the back end of
   the cycle Those options must be chosen from the range of possibilities
   still available. Decisions in particular that impact evolutionary
   strategies or perhaps that break with the current strategy have to take
   into account the technical, regulatory and economic conditions of their
   implementation in the industrial environment born of past choices. This
   latitude also depends on the importance of the time factor in any
   decisions taken concerning the nuclear industry. The time factor is
   particularly crucial in the nuclear domain. This is true in the
   production phase (the rate of renewal depends on the lifetime of the
   nuclear plants, if indeed renewal is appropriate) but also, and perhaps
   particularly so in the fuel cycle, especially the back end of the
   cycle. The characteristics of the spent fuel (its extremely high
   radioactivity and heat release, diminishing over time) bring the time
   factor into the equation. The different stages of the back- end,
   whether an open cycle (direct disposal of the spent fuel) or "closed"
   cycle (reprocessing-recycling of the re-usable uranium and plutonium
   materials and definitive disposal of the wastes) must therefore take
   into account various time- related effects such as : * Reduction in
   heat emission This factor is determinant for the disposal of the spent
   fuel or of the materials making up the spent fuel after separation,
   because the amount of heat emitted conditions the storage volume
   required for a given type of waste, and therefore the cost of that
   storage. For instance, the heat emitted by spent MOX is very much
   greater on average 1 than the heat emitted by spent UOX : this implies
   either placing the MOX fuel in interim storage for a longer period
   prior to definitive disposal, or storing less MOX in the same space.
   For the same cooling-off period, the space required to store MOX is
   three times more than the one for UOX. The time frame generally
   considered for the spent fuel to be cooled sufficiently to allow
   handling varies from a few years (for instance, before reprocessing) to
   several decades before the spent fuel or vitrified waste (1) Its exact
   value depends on the combustion rate. - 23 - - The legacy from the past
   for France - from re-processing (which contain all the fission products
   and minor actinides contained in the spent fuel) is suitable before
   definitive disposal. * Long-life radioactive decay Certain
   radioelements formed in the spent fuel are short or very short-lived
   waste. Most components of the spent fuel (uranium, plutonium, minor
   actinides and some fission products) on the contrary are long or very
   long-lived waste. The time frame for radioactive decay ranges from a
   few hundred to several hundreds of thousands of years and well exceeds
   the foreseeable future. This therefore demands that we conceive safe
   and stable storage solutions over a period of time no man-made
   structure can guarantee, hence the idea of using a natural structure
   that obeys a time scale fitting to the decay period of long-life
   radwaste and disposing of it in deep geological formations. Conversely,
   that time frame may result, on behalf of the future generations in,
   rejecting such an option and seeking other solutions such as advanced
   separation and the transmutation of minor actinides and long-life
   fission products and/or long-term interim storage (along the lines of
   research options 1 and 3 of the December 30th 1991 law) 1. Although
   this would allow us in theory to recover the waste later, when
   transmutation technologies are sufficiently developed. This latter
   solution appears to be rather unrealistic, technically and above all
   economically, for category C wastes : these are currently conditioned
   in the most stable form possible (vitrification) to withstand natural
   chemical attacks and the effects of time. * Degradation of nuclear
   energy sources This relates to the transformation of radioactive
   materials over time (the gradual disappearance of certain radionuclides
   and appearance of others according to a determined chain of events). It
   concerns all radioelements present in the spent fuel (whether present
   in the spent fuel or separated). The degradation of nuclear materials
   must be factored in when managing the back end of the fuel cycle, if it
   is decided not to dispose of the spent fuel directly. For instance,
   with the current reprocessing strategy aimed at separating and re-using
   the plutonium, the phenomenon of degradation of the plutonium isotope
   241 due to the formation of americium 241 is very important : in just a
   few years, americium is formed in the separately stored plutonium in
   sufficient quantity 2 that the plutonium can no (1) See main excerpts
   from the December 30th 1991 law (referred to as the « Bataille » law)
   at the end of the glossary. (2) Two phenomena occur : firstly, the
   americium isotope 241 is not fissile, whereas plutonium isotope 241 is,
   hence a reduction in the energy is likely to occur ; secondly, - 24 - -
   The legacy from the past for France - longer be used directly for the
   manufacture of MOX fuel and requires a simplified reprocessing
   operation to remove the americium 1. In future strategies aimed at
   re-using or « incinerating » some of the other materials contained in
   the fuel (minor actinides and long-life fission products), this problem
   would inevitably extend to all of these elements, therefore
   considerably increasing the complexity of management of the
   corresponding fuel cycle. * Short-life radioactive decay This has
   little or no influence on the management of the spent fuel. It can,
   however, be of major importance for the dismantling of nuclear
   reactors. The residual radioactivity of these installations after
   evacuation of the nuclear materials, resulting from the irradiation of
   the structural materials, is due in large part to the short-life
   radioactive elements. The rapid radioactive decay of these elements
   assures a speedy reduction in the ambient radioactivity. To give an
   idea of the magnitude of the phenomenon, it can be estimated as a
   reduction by a factor of 100 in 30 years. This is the reason why we can
   consider postponing reactor dismantling operations after definitive
   shutdown. The time factor must therefore be included in all decisions
   concerning the calendar, particularly at the back end of the nuclear
   cycle. For instance, if we decide to re-process, when should we do it?
   If deciding whether to dispose of spent fuels now or later, when do we
   dismantle the nuclear installations? Each decision will have huge
   repercussions on the economic cost of the different scenarios. *
   Reprocessing now or later? Immediate reprocessing is necessary to
   separate out those materials that are suitable for re-use within a few
   years at most (as it is done today with plutonium). Immediate
   reprocessing involves having to handle the spent fuel while it is still
   very hot and separating the materials (particularly the plutonium) for
   interim storage. As we have chosen the option of not stockpiling
   plutonium in its separated form, it has to be used quickly. This poses
   the question whether it is appropriate to reprocess a spent fuel now,
   or later if we do not wish to recover any of its materials in the
   short-term, but might wish to re-cycle them later, in the medium or
   long-term. when the americium content in the plutonium exceeds a
   certain percentage, that plutonium is no longer authorised for use in
   the manufacture of MOX fuels. (1) Removal of americium : separating the
   americium from the plutonium in order to be able to use the plutonium.
   - 25 - - The legacy from the past for France - With deferred
   processing, however, the spent fuel can be handled after cooling and
   the materials wanted for recycling can be recovered in a directly
   usable, pure form. The formation of americium from a fissile isotope of
   the plutonium (Pu 241) however results in a progressive degradation of
   the energy content of the spent fuel. * Disposal now or later?
   Long-term storage is a logical solution for materials present in spent
   fuels earmarked for re-processing (either to use their residual energy
   or reduce their volume or toxicity). It may, however, seem merely a way
   to postpone implementation of definitive disposal solutions for
   materials if it has been decided to evacuate (for instance, spent fuel
   in the open cycle without recycling option, or category B and C waste,
   in the reprocessing option). No country has yet implemented a
   definitive disposal solution, either for spent fuel or category C waste
   from civil electricity production. In reality, the long-term interim
   storage of such wastes can be explained by the advantage obtained in
   allowing them to cool down for several decades. That waiting period
   reduces the final costs of disposal and poses no particular technical,
   economical or safety problems. Interim storage of the spent fuel in a
   pool is needed initially, with the option of dry storage afterwards,
   for several decades or more. * Dismantling now or later ? The
   introduction of a delay between definitive shutdown of an installation
   and the start of tear down operations significantly reduces the
   radiological impact of dismantling, especially for the personnel in
   charge of drainage and final dismantling operations. That waiting
   period, which has the additional advantage for the operator of
   deferring half of the costs, is the solution preferred by industry.
   Some operators envision a 50-year wait (standpoint of EDF) or even
   100-year wait (standpoint of the British operators) before final
   dismantling. That solution however involves a risk (both in terms of
   safety and economics) due to lost memory of the installation. That is
   why the nuclear regulatory authorities in France particularly now ask
   the operator to examine in detail solutions for the immediate (20-year)
   dismantling for two prototype reactors : EL4 and Chooz-A. The debate in
   fact basically concerns the reactors, where the radioactive «
   environment », after definitive shutdown, is principally due to
   material- - 26 - - The legacy from the past for France - activating
   products that are short-life elements (i.e. with a radioactive period 1
   of under 30 years, such as cobalt 60 whose radioactive period is five
   years). In the fuel cycle facilities, the absence of activation
   products and presence of long- life radionuclides (i.e. more than 30
   years and sometimes as much as several hundreds of thousands of years)
   does not justify waiting. Immediate dismantling is therefore envisioned
   for enrichment and fuel manufacturing facilities and for the
   reprocessing plants. In the analysis that follows, we do not take into
   account the possible influences on nuclear plant management of the
   level of electricity demand or emergence of technological progresses.
   Moreover, the possible interaction between the existing nuclear plants
   and those of the future will be analysed in the chapter on future
   facilities. We will, however, when relevant, mention those points on
   which options taken up for the future fleet might affect the decisions
   to be taken on the existing nuclear plants. 2. Presentation of the
   current fleet of nuclear plants Overall, the French fleet consists of
   relatively young and highly standardised nuclear plants. With the
   exception of Phoenix 2 it uses only one system : Pressurised Water
   Reactors (PWR) (réacteurs à eau pressurisée, or REP in French) and has
   only three reactor models corresponding to different development
   stages. The infrastructure development program has progressed rapidly
   in France : whereas the first two PWRs were commissioned in 1977, there
   are 58 today 3. The cumulative total production by the entire fleet
   amounted to 5 486 TWh at end 1999, increasing from 1.1 TWh for 1977 to
   a total annual production of 350 to 400 TWh inclusively in recent
   years. (1) See definition of « period » in the glossary. (2) Although
   the Phoenix reactor, currently shut down, is theoretically capable of
   contributing to national energy production, its current status is that
   of a reactor dedicated for use in a research program : after the
   definitive shutdown of SuperPhoenix, the role of the Phoenix reactor,
   if operation resumes, will be to enable experiments on the incineration
   of actinides in rapid neutron reactors. (3) The last one, Civaux 2, was
   connected to the grid at end 1999. However, as industrial commissioning
   of the N4 reactors has not yet been announced, France currently has 58
   reactors connected to the grid, but only 54 in operation, in terms of
   being fully commissioned for industrial operation. - 27 - - The legacy
   from the past for France - The 58 light water reactors connected to the
   grid are divided as follows : 34 reactors belonging to the 900 MWe
   stage varying in age from 11 to 22 years (average of 17 years) ; 20
   reactors of the 1 300 MWe stage varying in age from 6 to 15 years
   (average of 11 years) and four N4 reactors of 1 450 MWe varying in age
   from 0 to 3 years. Breakdown of electricity production capacity of

   for France - Building up of the French nuclear plants During the
   1950's, the Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l'énergie
   atomique, CEA) developed a wholly French nuclear technology, the
   natural uranium graphite gas system (NUGG), and 9 reactors of that type
   with an overall gross capacity of 2 ,388 MWe were connected to the grid
   between 1956 and 1972 : those reactors were loaded with natural uranium
   in the form of metal ; they were moderated with graphite using
   compressed carbon dioxide (at 30 bar, 400°C) as the coolant. The first
   three NUGG reactors were operated by the CEA with the aim of producing
   nuclear material for military uses, the six other reactors were
   operated by EDF. Over the period 1968 to 1994, all of those reactors
   have been disconnected from the grid : six are currently being
   dismantled 1 (five in level 2, one in level 1) and definitive shutdown
   is in progress for the remaining three. That fleet of NUGG units
   produced a total 13,000 tonnes of spent fuel (most of which was
   reprocessed either at the Marcoule UP1 facility, or at the La Hague
   facility) for a total electricity production of 227 TWh  working out at
   an average combustion rate of 2.5 GWj/t. The PEON Commission (the
   consultative commission for electricity production using nuclear
   energy) was set up in 1955 to evaluate the costs involved in the
   construction of new nuclear units. In view of the poor competition of
   the NUGG reactors compared with the economics of the PWR system, and
   the difficulties encountered in obtaining a power of more than 500 MWe,
   the PEON Commission voted in favour of the construction, of 4 to 5
   light water reactors over the period 1970 to 1975 with a unit power of
   900 MWe. The programme picked up speed in March 1974 when Pierre
   Messmer's government adopted a two-year plan to implement sixteen new
   light water units of 900 MWe. Efforts continued in 1975 with a
   commitment for 1976 and 1977 to a 12,000 MWe programme before a skip to
   a higher stage (1 300 MWe). It was estimated at that time that a
   further 12 900 MWe capacity will be needed to meet the demand for
   electricity in France. In 1977, the rate of construction slowed again
   to 5,000 MWe for the next (1) Strict terms govern the shutdown of
   installations: definitive shutdown of production is followed one year
   later by the definitive cessation of operations, then three years later
   by preparation for dismantling (MAD level 1) and lastly by carrying out
   the dismantling process (MAD level 2 then 3) over 56 years, a 40-year
   storage period being considered between MAD2 and MAD3. The dismantling
   levels defined by the IAEA differ particularly in the degree of
   monitoring required: level 1 corresponds to monitored shutdown (nuclear
   materials confined to the nuclear core); level 2 the partial release of
   the site (reduction of the containment areas); level 3 its complete
   release. - 29 - - The legacy from the past for France - two years. In
   the early 1980's there were 18 reactors in operation and 33 under
   construction. The program was pursued over the entire decade of the
   eighties, however forecasts of a slow down in growth of the electricity
   demand resulted in the program being cut back in 1985, though it
   reached the higher power stage of 1,450 MWe per reactor. We should also
   mention the first pressurised water reactor in France (Chooz A), the
   EL4 reactor, a prototype of the heavy water and natural uranium
   reactor, and SuperPhoenix the sodium reactor, all of which are now no
   longer in operation. 3. Materials balance and economic balance
   associated with the current fleet of nuclear plants 3.1. Methodology To
   evaluate the consequences of past choices and implications of the
   various options for the future, we sought to describe as clearly as
   possible the materials balance and economic balance for each of the
   options. To achieve that, we chose to collate past data and describe
   possible scenarios arising out of the current situation and the options
   available for management of the nuclear plants and fuel cycle. That
   description has been made with sufficient accuracy to enable us, in a
   first step, to calculate the annual flow of materials. Then those
   material flows were used, in the second step, to evaluate the
   associated annual economic flow based on unit costs supplied by the
   operators (or estimated costs when the relevant information was
   lacking). Choice of scenarios The choice of variables used to
   differentiate between scenarios was guided by the determination to
   outline a few realistic options, without unnecessarily multiplying the
   number of forecasts. We thus distinguished between scenarios, using two
   criteria whose impact on the materials balance and economic balance of
   the existing fleet and the future fleet of nuclear plants we considered
   to be of particular importance : * Firstly, the service life of the
   nuclear plants : Operating the power plants for several years over and
   above the anticipated service life increases the materials balance and
   alters the economic balance by increasing production and expenditure on
   upkeep in a way that may or may no longer be favourable. Above all,
   extending the service life of the power plants - 30 - - The legacy from
   the past for France - impacts the availability of future options for
   the facilities : the longer the current capacity can be kept going, the
   longer it will be before new reactors need to be built, which works in
   favour of technological innovation and therefore the availability of
   alternatives to the pressurised water reactors currently used to
   replace the obsolete plants. We selected two major hypotheses for the
   average service life of the power plants, 41 and 45 years. This 10 %
   variation may seem slight compared to the spans usually practised (from
   the minimum 30-year lifetime to the 50 or 60-year value anticipated by
   the operator when the reactors were first designed). In fact, those two
   values reflect differences in reactor ageing (the average of 41 years
   reflects lifetimes of 35 to 45 years, the average of 45 years reflects
   lifetimes of 35 to 50 years). The four-year differential accounts for
   the impact of this parameter on the balance of materials and on the
   economic balance. Service life of the current nuclear plants Two main
   elements condition the technical service life of a nuclear plant : the
   core of the reactor and the reactor containment building. The other
   equipment can if necessary be changed, depending on their ageing,
   obsolescence or the mandates of the nuclear safety authorities. The
   expenses incurred to keep the nuclear plants running are considered as
   upkeep. The clauses contained in the definitive safety reports on the
   900 and 1300 MWe reactors recommend that the maximum duration of
   irradiation be 40 years at 80 % of nominal power in the initial
   conditions of fuel loading, i.e. the equivalent of 32 years at full
   power. That recommendation is without prejudice to the result of
   periodical inspections or specific requests made by the safety
   authorities. Following that recommendation would result in a gross
   cumulative electricity production by French nuclear plants of 18,250
   TWh. That accumulated production is compatible with the first chosen
   hypothesis of an average service life of 41 years for the fleet and a
   hypothesis of a continuing improvement in the production rate of the
   nuclear plants (rising from 70 % in 2000 to 85 % in 2032). However,
   various parameters are likely to impact the lifetime of the plants in a
   positive manner. Those parameters include : - the implementation of
   so-called "low leakage" fuel loading plans, intended to reduce the flow
   of neutrons inside the vessel and consequently, for the same maximum
   flow value at the internal wall of the vessel, to increase the lifetime
   beyond 32 years at full power. The operator hopes to be able to
   implement those new loading plans sometime during this decade ; - the
   possibility of carrying out heat treatment on the reactor vessel. This
   kind of - 31 - - The legacy from the past for France - treatment has
   already been performed on 12 reactors of soviet design and on some
   propulsion reactors belonging to the American navy, under an R&D
   program on PWR reactors being conducted in the United States. The
   hypothesis of better combustion rates for the fuels in use by the year
   2010 that we selected for our various scenarios in line with EDF and
   Framatome forecasts leads to the manufacture of new fuels. By reducing
   fluence on the inside wall of the vessel, those new fuels result in a
   longer service life. Given the age distribution of the reactors when
   those new fuels will be brought into use, a 20 % reduction in fluence
   should be obtained, enabling a concomitant 10 % increase in the reactor
   service life up to approximately 45 years. By choosing 45 years as the
   average lifetime, we allow margin for possible improvements, assuming
   the vessel receives heat treatment when it reaches approximately 35
   years of age. That explains why some nuclear plant operators anticipate
   lifetimes in excess of 50 years for their existing reactors of similar
   technology to that of the French fleet. * The second is the strategy
   for the back end of the cycle : the many strategies possible can be
   divided into two main options : reprocessing the spent fuel and
   recycling the recovered materials (plutonium in this case) or the open
   cycle assuming interim storage then the direct disposal of the spent
   fuel. The choice of one of the two options will have repercussions on
   the entire cycle, from front-end (savings in raw materials) through to
   the back- end of the cycle (quantitative and above all qualitative
   balance of the waste materials). France's chosen strategy at present is
   the « reprocessing-recycling » of UOX fuel, during which the plutonium
   is recycled once only in the form of MOX fuel. Some of the UOX fuel is,
   however, temporarily at least managed in open cycle, since it is placed
   in interim storage and not reprocessed immediately. The three
   hypotheses we have imagined for the back end of the cycle are : -
   continuing with current situation and maintaining reprocessing within a
   proportion of 65 to 75 % inclusively of the spent UOX fuel and using
   MOX in approximately 20 reactors (the 20 reactors of the 900 MWe stage
   currently authorised to load MOX) ; - 32 - - The legacy from the past
   for France - - extending reprocessing to all unloaded UOX fuel, which
   corresponds to using MOX in 28 reactors (the 28 reactors of the 900 MWe
   stage that are technically capable of burning MOX) ; - abandoning
   reprocessing altogether and switching to an open cycle strategy. We
   preferred a progressive abandonment scenario rather than one with a
   sudden change 1, which would raise many technical obstacles (storage of
   the spent fuel) as well as legal and social problems. In this scenario,
   reprocessing stops in 2010. MOX would continue to be used at the
   current level for 2 to 3 years after 2010 in order to use up the stock
   of separated plutonium. Purpose and advantage of reprocessing 2
   Reprocessing has two goals. It aims first at separating those
   substances in the spent fuel that possess real or potential
   energy-related value (i.e. uranium and plutonium) and second at
   conditioning the ultimate waste (fission products and minor actinides)
   in a form suitable for several thousand-years "permanent" storage.
   Using the vitrification process, radiological waste is incorporated by
   melting into a glass, which is certain to retain the radioactive
   substances because of the chemical combination of its constituent
   parts). Reprocessing enables more than 99.8 % of the plutonium content
   to be extracted from the spent fuels. Although plutonium accounts for
   only approximately 1 % of the spent fuel, it is accountable for nearly
   90 % of the overall radiological toxicity of the spent fuel after
   100,000 years. This is why it is desirable to reduce the plutonium for
   definitive storage as much as possible. This is the reason why the
   extraction rate of plutonium from the spent fuel is so high, and thus
   does not correspond to the economic optimum. The result of the actions
   undertaken by the law passed on December 30th, 1991 relative to
   research on long-life radioactive waste management will enable
   confirmation of the conservative rate we work to at the present time.
   Plutonium is now recycled as a MOX fuel. Recycling significantly slows
   the overall quantity of plutonium produced each year in French NPP's.
   Indeed, a reactor whose core consists of 30 % of MOX assemblies and 70
   % of standard fuel assemblies using enriched uranium oxide does not
   produce plutonium, whereas a reactor composed of 100 % of standard fuel
   assemblies produces approximately 200 kg a year. Moreover,
   reprocessing, as any industrial activity, generates waste and releases.
   (1) We have also considered in "Le parc nucléaire actuel", a scenario
   in which reprocessing is abandoned in 2001, the scheduled date when the
   reprocessing contracts signed between EDF and Cogema come up for
   renewal. (2) Excerpts from « 110 Questions on Nuclear Energy »,
   published by the French General Directorate for Energy and Raw
   Materials. - 33 - - The legacy from the past for France - As with any
   other nuclear facility, these liquid and gaseous releases and waste
   from reprocessing units are governed by limits set by the safety and
   radioprotection authorities. The authorised limits do not, however,
   constitute thresholds beyond which health is jeopardised. The
   environment of the La Hague reprocessing plant is particularly
   stringently monitored by the radioprotection authority. The controls
   and surveys performed around the La Hague site have revealed no
   evidence of an impact on health. Reprocessing also generates solid
   waste. During plant operation, the quantity of long- life waste
   generated by the reprocessing operations carried out by COGEMA
   currently represents nearly 1 cubic metre per ton of re-processed fuel,
   whereas direct storage would generate 2 cubic meters of waste per ton
   of spent fuel. By the year 2000, COGEMA's objective is to bring that
   volume down to 0.3 to 0.5 m3 per ton of re-processed fuel. Last, the
   dismantling of reprocessing facilities will generate significant
   volumes of waste, the majority of which will be only slightly
   radioactive. Anyhow, the overall radioactivity of that waste will be
   far below that which would result from the direct storage of the spent
   fuel. A definitive method of disposal for these low activity wastes, on
   a design similar to that of a conventional dump yet specific to this
   type of waste, is currently being studied. By cross-matching the
   different hypotheses, we obtain the following six scenarios : Average
   service life Average service life 41 years 45 years Reprocessing stops
   in 2010 S1 S4 Partial reprocessing 20 MOX units S2 S5 100 %
   reprocessing 28 MOX units S3 S6 Aside of those scenarios, a seventh
   scenario is detailed in the annex. It is based on the hypothesis of the
   total absence of reprocessing (i.e. with no investments in the La Hague
   reprocessing facility or in the MOX manufacturing facility) and enables
   a better grasp of the difference between balances with and without
   reprocessing. A few hypotheses are common to all scenarios for the
   current set of nuclear power plants, such as no reprocessing of MOX, no
   recycling of the depleted uranium obtained from the reprocessed UOX
   (URT)13, the period of interim storage prior to disposal in deep
   storages (which is the chosen solution in every - 34 - - The legacy
   from the past for France - scenario for the evacuation of medium and
   long-life high-level radioactive waste). A few more hypotheses were
   selected, i.e. : - on fuel performance : we assumed an improvement in
   the combustion rates, whether for UOX or MOX up to a ceiling of 55
   GWj/t for UOX and 49 GWj/t for MOX (average values). For comparison
   purposes, the maximum allowed values are currently 52 GWj/t for UOX and
   41 GWj/t for MOX ; - on nuclear plant performances : currently they are
   handicapped in France by over-capacity of the electricity production.
   The capacity factor (Kp) of the nuclear plants is low compared with the
   Kp achieved by nuclear plants in other countries. In our scenarios
   therefore, we hypothesised a gradual re- absorption of that
   over-capacity, enabling a favourable evolution of Kp, from 70 % now to
   85 % by the year 2030 ; - on the recycling of URT (uranium obtained
   from the reprocessing of UOX) : we opted for interim storage of URT in
   anticipation of more favourable economic conditions for possible
   recycling later ; - on leaving Eurodif, the depleted uranium is
   transformed into U3O8 and placed in long-term storage in Bessines where
   a storage facility of 200 000 tonnes capacity has been in operation
   since 1998) ; - on the shutdown procedure for the nuclear facilities of
   the fuel cycle, except in scenarios S1 and S4 where reprocessing stops
   in 2010 and recycling is phased out in 2012-2013, we considered that a
   full industrial tool (reprocessing + recycling) can no longer be
   maintained once the annual need for reprocessing drops below 500 tonnes
   and/or the annual need for MOX drops below 50 tonnes. Clearly, in this
   respect, however, no decision on shutdown can be taken in the light of
   the current reactor fleet alone, ignoring the future fleet ; - on the
   dismantling of the nuclear installations, we opted for immediate
   dismantling of all nuclear installations belonging to the fuel cycle,
   and dismantling in two stages for nuclear reactors (having already
   calculated the cost of the alternative : dismantling in a single
   phase). The material balance of the fleet (front-end and back-end of
   cycle) The objective here is to explain in detail the evolution of the
   physical flows relating to the electricity production, fuel cycle and
   total waste generated by the - 35 - - The legacy from the past for
   France - fleet of nuclear plants over their lifetime. What we refer to
   as nuclear waste are « those substances abandoned on completion of the
   nuclear cycle, an abandonment that may only be transient since it
   depends on the technical and economic conditions at the time ». The
   materials balance takes into account : * at the front-end, those
   elements needed to manufacture the loaded fuel, namely : - natural
   uranium (U3O8) ; - those needed for conversion (from U3O8 to UF6) ; -
   those needed for enrichment, expressed in separation work units (SWU) ;
   - those needed to manufacture the UOX assemblies ; * at the back-end,
   those elements resulting from the processing of the unloaded fuel,
   categorised according to their life and activity level, i.e. : -
   reprocessed UOX and nuclear materials separated during reprocessing,
   i.e. reprocessed uranium (URT) and above all plutonium ; - materials
   required to manufacture MOX assemblies ; - depleted uranium obtained
   from enrichment which is converted either for use in the MOX or for
   long-term storage ; - non-reprocessed spent UOX and MOX ; - category B
   waste produced by reactor operations and category B waste from
   reprocessing ; - category C (vitrified) waste resulting from
   reprocessing. The radioactive waste categories used in our report Two
   main criteria are taken into account when categorising waste for
   management purposes : - firstly the life time of the waste, calculated
   on the period of the radioactive products contained in the package used
   to define the duration of potential toxicity of the waste. Waste is
   generally categorised as short- or long-life, according to whether
   their "period" is under or over 30 years 1 ; (1) The existence of such
   a « period » is related to a fundamental property of radioactive decay:
   the period of the wastes refers to the time needed to reduce their
   radioactivity by half. It depends on the radionuclides present in the
   waste packages : each of them has a characteristic, fixed period or
   life during which its quantity, - 36 - - The legacy from the past for
   France - - secondly, their activity level, i.e. the intensity of
   radiation produced by the package. This factor determines the
   protective measures needed in order to define the appropriate method of
   storage. The waste is distinguished according to the different activity
   thresholds (alpha, beta and gamma radiation) into very low level,
   low-level, medium-level or high-level waste. By cross-matching these
   two criteria, we obtain eight categories of waste, the main ones  those
   corresponding to the largest quantities of waste produced by the
   nuclear industry  being grouped as : - minor residues, i.e. materials
   produced in large quantities by the extraction of uranium ore ; - very
   low-level radioactive waste, essentially produced during the
   dismantling of nuclear installations. This category particularly covers
   construction materials used in potentially contaminated areas during
   the active phase of the installations (reinforcing steels and other
   debris). Their radioactivity amounts to approximately a few becquerels
   per gram, however the pose a specific storage problem because of the
   large volumes involved ; - short-life low- and medium-level waste
   (category A waste), characterised by an activity due principally to
   beta and gamma radiation. Nuclear reactors, spent fuel processing
   facilities, nuclear research centres particularly produce this category
   of waste, consisting mainly of waste from manufacture, used equipment
   and materials and also the products of nuclear installations liquid and
   gaseous effluents treatment ; - long-life medium-level waste (category
   B) which in particular contains a significant quantity of products that
   emit alpha radiation and have a low thermal output. These products
   derive mainly from the maintenance and operation of the reprocessing
   facilities. Because of its very long life, this waste requires very
   long-term disposal solutions ; - short or long-life high level waste
   (category C) containing large quantities of alpha radiation emitters
   characterised by a high thermal output. They generally contain a mix of
   highly radioactive short-period elements and low or medium-level
   radioactive elements of long period. Category C waste generally
   consists of fission and activation products (plutonium and minor
   actinides) contained in the spent fuels (products that will eventually
   be recovered when reprocessing those fuels). Management of this
   category of waste poses problems in terms of length of storage.
   Research into categories whatever that may be, is halved. The period of
   radionuclides can vary from a time of under one-second to a time of
   over a billion years. - 37 - - The legacy from the past for France - B
   and C waste are being conducted within the framework of the law on
   waste management passed on December 30th 1991 1 ; - non-reprocessed
   spent fuels : this may include spent UOX, if not considered for
   reprocessing, or spent MOX. These spent fuels contain highly active
   long-life products (plutonium, minor actinides, and fission products).
   They require long-term storage (50 years for UOX, 150 years for MOX)
   until their thermal output has cooled sufficiently to allow definitive
   disposal. In presenting that balance of materials, we are particularly
   seeking to compare scenarios in terms of the final plutonium balance
   (plus the existing americium continually formed in the plutonium from
   its isotope 241). The plutonium balance is of specific interest
   inasmuch as French research and development efforts for the management
   of the back end of the cycle are based, initially, on the determination
   to leave no plutonium in definitive disposal, (because of its long life
   and much higher radiotoxicity than that of the other radioactive
   products stored and/or because of its high potential as a source of
   energy). Thus, the impact of the plutonium balance is classically
   presented as one of the main advantages 2 of the "reprocessing-recycle"
   strategy over direct disposal. The balance of materials results from
   the interaction of many and continually changing parameters. Those
   parameters principally affect : - fuel cycle management options that
   impact the front end of the cycle and fuel quality (e.g. the materials
   used and the enrichment rate) and the back end of the cycle and the
   share-out of materials (reprocessing-recycle or direct disposal, waste
   characteristics) ; - the characteristics of the industrial processes
   implemented (reject rate, volume of waste per production unit,
   performance of the reactor steam supply system, etc.) ; - the quality
   of nuclear fleet operation, whether as regards the fuel (combustion
   rate, management of the combustion cycle) or the reactors,
   (availability, scheduled outages, etc.) ; - management of the fuel
   cycle calendar (cooling period, particularly between different stages
   of the cycle, even before the last stages of the cycle) and of (1) See
   end of glossary for the main elements of that law. (2) See box in
   chapter 2, on the respective advantages of reprocessing and direct
   disposal. - 38 - - The legacy from the past for France - the nuclear
   plants themselves (lifetime of the plants, dismantling now or later).
   Based on the parameters associated with the different possible
   evolutions of the nuclear fleet, we calculated the corresponding
   balances of materials. Economic balances The economic balances are
   calculated from the material balances. We use them to calculate or
   verify the consistency of results based on the information in our
   possession on unit costs of production, operation, interim storage,
   disposal, etc. Then, based on the annual physical flows, we evaluate
   the economic flows corresponding to the necessary exchanges of
   materials and services. The exercise was divided into two periods : *
   The past (1977  1999), 1977 being the year the first pressurised water
   reactors (PWR) 1 were commissioned. Over that period, we have been able
   to establish a balance of material flows using real historical data on
   the fleet and the fuel cycle ; the balance obtained therefore
   represents a fairly accurate estimate of real past results, although it
   cannot be an absolutely true reflection. In particular, the
   fluctuations in some of the parameters were levelised and some marginal
   operations were left out. Similarly, we were able to reconstitute the
   history of expenditure associated with the development of the nuclear
   plants over the period. Those itemized details of expenditure over time
   enabled us to establish an overall economic balance of the cost of the
   existing fleet over the entire period from their launching until now. *
   The future period, from now to the end of the lifetime of the existing
   nuclear fleet. We sought to calculate the balance of materials for the
   six scenarios described earlier. Although only two variables are used
   to differentiate between the scenarios in our definition, this does not
   necessarily mean that all other parameters were fixed : the scenarios
   forecast changes in some parameters, for instance the gradual increase
   in capacity factor or combustion rates, however these parameters are
   identicals in all of the scenarios. (1) With the exception of Chooz A
   PWR prototype, commissioned in 1967. - 39 - - The legacy from the past
   for France - To simulate the costs associated with the existing fleet
   in the different scenarios for the future period, we reconstituted the
   annual history of expenditure item by item, based on informations
   supplied to us, whenever possible by the operators themselves,
   concerning the unit costs of the different services or materials. 3.2.
   Critical examination of the selected hypotheses The hypotheses we
   selected for the combustion rate or capacity factor are subject to
   uncertainty. They reflect improvements that may never happen. Failure
   to meet those targeted improvements may weigh heavily on the material
   balances and the corresponding economic balances : - Concerning the
   evolution of the capacity factor, we studied the influence of a faster
   or slower variation, leading in the former case to a capacity factor of
   85 % in 2020 (instead of 2030) and in the latter case to a capacity
   factor of 81 % at the end of the lifetime of the current power plants.
   For scenario S6 for instance, those new hypotheses regarding the Kp
   would result in a gap in cumulative production between now and 2050 of
   6.3 % (- 4 % to + 2.3 % below or above the reference situation). In
   fact, the evolution of the capacity factor will depend primarily on how
   long it takes EDF to reabsorb its over-capacity for base-load
   production (as the fleet of plants is designed to supply the maximum
   power demand) which in turn will depend heavily on the evolution of the
   electricity sector 1 in Europe ; - Concerning the evolution of
   combustion rates, the main stake bears on the ability of the MOX to
   achieve the envisioned values. That factor for MOX figures essentially
   in scenarios S2, S3, S5 and S6 in the hypothesised increase in the
   combustion rate up to 49 GWj/t. According to EDF, that economic
   condition is necessary if they are to continue the long-term use of
   MOX. In the case of UOX assemblies, some nuclear plant operators have
   already achieved the proposed values. The other hypotheses are
   generally favourable too (although from time to time we introduced a
   few damaging hypotheses). Indeed, all scenarios are based on (1) We can
   particularly envision an electrical organisation in which the use of
   the fleet of power plants would be optimised at European level. The
   operators would, for instance, organise « swaps » so that nuclear power
   would be used for the base-load, which would enable a favourable
   evolution of the production capacity in the nuclear reactors. - 40 - -
   The legacy from the past for France - an optimum management of the
   nuclear plants and fuel cycle (for a given strategy), without setbacks
   or industrial problems. For instance, the La Hague facility is shut
   down when reprocessing needs fall below a certain threshold or when the
   facility becomes unprofitable ; the combustion rates are increased with
   ease ; the new interim storage facilities are designed of the ideal
   size ; all category B wastes can be compacted and conditioned in an
   appropriate manner ; MOX manufacturing rejects are fully recycled ;
   cooling and storage periods between stages are always ideal (never
   excessive) etc. These examples may make our forecasts seem optimistic
   in the light of experience gained over the period 1977-1999, however we
   got now the benefit of hindsight and feedback on the installations,
   most of which are still in operation today. The impact on the material
   balances is evident. For instance, we adjusted the scenarios so that
   there would be no leftover stock of separated plutonium. Similarly,
   some of the hypotheses on costs are optimistic : for instance, the cost
   of reprocessing used for the La Hague facilities is the cost when
   running at full capacity. 3.3. Material balances associated with the
   scenarios We calculated the balance of materials on a yearly basis for
   each of the selected scenarios. The heading of "waste" comprises not
   only ultimate waste (categories B and C) but all spent fuels in interim
   storage awaiting a decision on possible later recycling. For the back
   end of the cycle, we hypothesised that : - the different spent fuels
   will either be reprocessed to recover the re-usable uranium and
   plutonium content, or packaged and sent for definitive disposal ; -
   category B waste from reactor operations and category B waste from
   reprocessing operations will be stored and conditioned prior to
   definitive disposal ; - category C waste will be packaged in glass
   molds essentially containing fission products and minor actinides
   (actinides other than uranium and plutonium). Finally, we hypothesised
   that a storage centre for very low level waste will be available some
   time between 2005-2010, a definitive disposal facility will be in - 41
   - - The legacy from the past for France - place for category B waste by
   2020 and a definitive solution will be ready for the disposal of
   category C waste by 2040-2050. The installations necessary for the
   interim storage and definitive disposal of spent fuels will be
   envisioned as appropriate to each of the scenarios. The chosen solution
   will take into account the intended use for the plutonium contained in
   the spent fuels. In the long term, after depletion of the conventional
   fissile resources, use of that plutonium may be justified. This poses
   the problem of the reversibility of the definitive disposal solution. A
   reversible solution is much more advantageous in that it allows room
   for a U-turn in the event of a major problem, for instance, recovery of
   the stored elements in the event of significant water infiltration, or
   recovery of materials not necessarily for re-use but for elimination if
   transmutation-incineration solutions are found at a later point in
   time. - 42 - - The legacy from the past for France - Balance of

   group on the « Existing Fleet of Nuclear Plants » We draw a number of
   conclusions based on, the cumulative materials balance up until 2050,
   prepared from the annual balances : * Front end The materials balance
   provides information on needs for uranium, units of enrichment and UOX
   fuels. We note that the differentiation between the scenarios has no
   major repercussions on the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle. The
   cumulative needs for natural uranium vary by 5 % between scenarios
   where reprocessing stops in 2010 and scenarios with 28 units running on
   MOX fuel. The period 2020-2030 should correspond to the shutdown of the
   current enrichment plant run by Eurodif : if the date is 2020, the
   current fleet of nuclear - 43 - - The legacy from the past for France -
   plants will need an additional 57 to 92 MUTS (6 to 9 years production
   with Eurodif running at maximum capacity) ; if 2030, the additional
   needs would be between 15 and 32 MUTS inclusively (2 to 3 years
   production by Eurodif at maximum capacity). Ten years before shutting
   down Eurodif therefore, decisions will have to be made on the
   enrichment technology option or whether to purchase UTS on the
   international market 1, however those decisions will also depend on the
   needs of the future power plants. Concerning the fuel manufacturing
   capacity, the annual needs for UOX remain in excess of 800 tonnes up to
   around 2025. If the nuclear fuel manufactories run by FBFC (Romans,
   Dessel) the joint French/Belgian company act satisfactorily, they will
   not need replacing before that date ; as for MOX, the capacity of the
   Melox and Dessel will be sufficient to meet the needs except in
   scenario S6 (a service life of 45 years and 28 units running on MOX)
   where it would be necessary to increase the capacity of the Melox
   facility to manufacture MOX fuel for use in PWRs. Conversely, scenarios
   S1 and S4 assume shutting down the Melox factory after 2010. * Back end
   More options are open to choice as regards the back end of the cycle,
   where the avenues of choice are more distinctive and also the physical
   and economic uncertainties are greater. Options for the back end of the
   cycle (reprocessing + MOX or open cycle) have a diversity of
   consequences on the nature and quantities of wastes to be stored for
   the short and the long-term. For several years, EDF has been committed
   to the reprocessing of its spent fuel, however? to avoid building up
   stocks of separated plutonium for which no use can be found, EDF
   reprocesses only when it has outlets for the plutonium that is
   produced. For each individual scenario, the materials balance provides
   information on needs for MOX 2, on the cumulative waste (in terms of
   both quantity and (1) In both cases, when preparing the economic
   balances, we will not take into account the initial investment in the
   enrichment plant, as this is included in the price of the UTS. (2) We
   should recall that the use of MOX enables reducing the need for fuels
   for if six UOX assemblies have to be reprocessed to obtain the
   necessary Pu to manufacture a MOX assembly, then that MOX assembly can
   replace a UOX assembly in a « MOX » reactor (i.e. able to burn up to 30
   % of MOX). - 44 - - The legacy from the past for France - quality), on
   storage capacity needs for spent fuels and other recyclable materials,
   on reprocessing-recycling needs and on definitive disposal conditions
   for certain types of waste. There is a strong differentiation between
   the cumulative needs for MOX between the scenarios (from 2 kt in S4 to
   4.8 in S6). We will look with particular interest here at the waste
   directly related to management of the back end of the fuel cycle, that
   is category B waste (long- life waste of medium radioactivity) and C
   (long-life highly radioactive waste) resulting from the reprocessing of
   UOX fuels and, inasmuch as they are not reprocessed immediately, of
   spent UOX and MOX fuels. The other waste produced by the nuclear
   industry (very low-level waste, category A and category B waste from
   operations) result in approximately similar balances in the difference
   scenarios for the back end of the cycle. Plutonium + Americium content
   of non-reprocessed spent fuels Concerning the stock of non-separated
   plutonium and americium contained in the stored spent fuels, the
   differences between the various scenarios are fairly insignificant.
   That stock would culminate at 602 tonnes in S4 (service life of 45
   years and reprocessing ceased in 2010) 1, compared to 514 tonnes in S6
   (service life of 45 years and 28 units running on MOX). Scenario S6
   therefore results in 15 % smaller stock of non-separated Plutonium +
   americium, as shown in the following graph. (1) It would have reached
   667 tonnes in case study S7, the scenario in which there would have
   been no reprocessing over the lifetime of the existing fleet. See annex
   for a presentation of scenario S7. - 45 - - The legacy from the past

   diversity in the nature and quantity of the spent fuels for short- and
   long-term storage in each of the scenarios (cf. the 2 following
   graphs). Thus, in scenario S4 for instance, the one in which
   reprocessing is ceased, it would be necessary to store 41,000 tonnes of
   UOX whereas in scenario S6, only as third the quantity (17,600 tonnes)
   needs to be stored. However, in S4, only 2,000 tonnes of spent MOX
   needs to be stored, compared to 2.4 times more (4,800 tonnes) in
   scenario S6. - 46 - - The legacy from the past for France - Spent UOX

   from the past for France - In fact, between those scenarios, we note
   transfer phenomena operating between the different categories of waste,
   which makes it difficult to compare the different strategies. Between
   the scenarios of continuing or ceasing to reprocess, we however see a
   slight reduction in the cumulative stock of plutonium or uranium, a
   slight reduction in the cumulative thermal output and a big cumulative
   reduction in the volume (or total tonnage) of highly radioactive
   long-life waste. This therefore reveals a transfer : reprocessing plus
   recycling of the plutonium in MOX concentrates the activity and thermal
   output into a less volume ; on the other hand, it leads to considerably
   longer times for cooling the MOX fuels prior to definitive storage.
   Waste in categories B and C Here again, the final situations are
   totally different. Category B waste As the material balances show, the
   volume of category B waste produced during operation of the reactors
   (20, 000 m3 between now and the end of the service life of the current
   power plants, including the older ones) is the same in all scenarios.
   Opening the operation of the storage centre somewhere around 2020 would
   enable the evacuation of those wastes at the time of the definitive
   shutdown of the first reactors, without requiring any intermediate
   storage capacity. As for the category B waste produced during
   reprocessing operations, they fluctuate, as illustrated in the
   following graph, from 11,800 m3 in scenario S4 (reprocessing ceased in
   2010) to 18,000 m3 in S6, on condition that the compacting installation
   scheduled to start up in 2000 achieves the anticipated performances. -
