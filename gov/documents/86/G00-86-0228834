   voids play a crucial role in the initiation sensitivity. When subjected
   to a compressive wave, the voids collapse giving rise to localized
   peaks in the temperature field called hot spots. Reaction rates are
   extremely sensitive to piston temperature. As a consequence, hot spots
   dominate the initiation of a detonation wave. Weak preshocks can close

   Prompt initiation, within a few microseconds, would occur if reaction
   were included in the simulation. For explosive applications, the
   feasible cell size is much greater than the scale of a grain. The
   limited resolution necessitates using a homogenized constitutive
   relation for the explosive. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations on
   the scale of a grain are eliminated by the homogenization and burn
   models are needed to account for the effect of hot spots on the
   reaction rate. Mesoscale simulations are a tool for gaining an
   understanding of the physics at small spatial and temporal scales
   needed to develop better burn models. More details can be found in the
