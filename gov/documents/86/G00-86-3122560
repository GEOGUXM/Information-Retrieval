      The research challenges of an international Global Tropospheric
      Chemistry Program (GTCP) demand a broadly-based program. The resources
      required are distributed among several federal agencies, scores of
      universities, and a variety of scientific disciplines--including
      atmospheric science, biology, land processes, and oceanography. It was
      already clear in 1984 that the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) would play a leading role in such a program. Some
      GTCP objectives require large-scale field studies and the most advanced
      instrumentation. NASA brings together unique research facilities,
      strength in atmospheric science, technical expertise, and management
      skills needed to address the challenges of the GTCP.

      The Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) utilizes large, extensively
      instrumented aircraft as primary research tools. However, GTE also
      draws heavily upon satellite observations of meteorology, land use, and
      atmospheric chemical species to aid in experiment design and in the
      scientific analyses of results obtained from aircraft and ground-based
      measurements. The GTE, managed through the Tropospheric Chemistry
      Program in the Earth Science Enterprise, at NASA Headquarters, was
      initiated in the early 1980s. Implementation of the GTE Project is via
      a Project Office in the Atmospheric Sciences Division at the NASA
      Langley Research Center.
