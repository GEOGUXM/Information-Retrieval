   Barley Yellow Dwarf Disease: Recent Advances and Future Strategies


An international symposium

                              CIMMYT, El Batan,

Texcoco, Mexico

                             Sept 1 – 5, 2002

Organized by CIMMYT, Mexico

                  and University of California, Davis, US.



   Barley yellow dwarf is a worldwide disease of cereal crops, including
   barley, wheat, oat, rice, rye, triticale and maize. The last workshop
   on BYDV was organized by ICARDA and held in Morocco in 1989. Since, C .
   D’Arcy and P. Burnett published a monograph summarized 40 years of
   progress on BYDV. A lot of progress has been done on the understanding
   of the biology, epidemiology of the disease and new strategies have
   been developed for its control. This symposium would give the
   scientists working in the field an opportunity to tell and hear about
   the recent advances on BYDV research and the strategies for its control
   and interact with their colleagues.






Suggestions for the topics covered are:


   ·              BYDV biology

   ·              Virus/vectors relationship

   ·              Epidemiology

   ·              Control Methods

   ·              Source and mechanisms of resistance/tolerance (including
   transgenics)

   ·              Country reports / Progress on BYDV research in
   developing countries
