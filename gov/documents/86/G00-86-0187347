      The solar interior is separated into four regions by the different
      processes that occur there. Energy is generated in the core. This
      energy diffuses outward by radiation (mostly gamma-rays and x-rays)
      through the radiative zone and by convective fluid flows (boiling
      motion) through the outermost convection zone. The thin interface layer
      between the radiative zone and the convection zone is where the Sun's
      magnetic field is thought to be generated.

                                     The Core

      The Sun's core is the central region where nuclear reactions consume
      hydrogen to form helium. These reactions release the energy that
      ultimately leaves the surface as visible light. These reactions are
      highly sensitive to temperature and density. The individual hydrogen
      nuclei must collide with enough energy to give a reasonable probability
      of overcoming the repulsive electrical force between these two
      positively charged particles. The temperature at the very center of the
      Sun is about 15,000,000° C (27,000,000 ° F) and the density is about
      150 g/cm³ (about 10 times the density of gold or lead). Both the
      temperature and the density decrease as one moves outward from the
      center of the Sun. The nuclear burning is almost completely shut off
      beyond the outer edge of the core (about 25% of the distance to the
      surface or 175,000 km from the center). At that point the temperature
      is only half its central value and the density drops to about 20 g/cm³.

      In the process of fusing hydrogen to form helium, the nuclear reactions
      also produce elementary particles called neutrinos. These elusive
      particles pass right through the overlying layers of the Sun and, with
      some effort, can be detected here on Earth. The number of neutrinos we
      detect is but a fraction of the number we expect. This problem of the
      missing neutrinos is one of the great mysteries of solar astronomy.

                                The Radiative Zone

      The radiative zone extends outward from the outer edge of the core to
      the interface layer at the base of the convection zone (from 25% of the
      distance to the surface to 70% of that distance). The radiative zone is
      characterized by the method of energy transport - radiation. The energy
      generated in the core is carried by light (photons) that bounces from
      particle to particle through the radiative zone. Although the photons
      travel at the speed of light, they bounce so many times through this
      dense material that an individual photon takes about a million years to
      finally reach the interface layer. The density drops from 20 g/cm³
      (about the density of gold) down to only 0.2 g/cm³ (less than the
      density of water) from the bottom to the top of the radiative zone. The
      temperature falls from 7,000,000° C to about 2,000,000° C over the same
      distance.

                                The Interface Layer

      The interface layer lies between the radiative zone and the convective
      zone. The fluid motions found in the convection zone slowly disappear
      from the top of this layer to its bottom where the conditions match
      those of the calm radiative zone. This thin layer has become more
      interesting in recent years as more details have been discovered about
      it. It is now believed that the Sun's magnetic field is generated by a
      magnetic dynamo in this layer. The changes in fluid flow velocities
      across the layer (shear flows) can stretch  magnetic field lines of
      force and make them stronger. There also appears to be sudden changes
      in chemical composition across this layer.

                                The Convection Zone

      The convection zone is the outer-most layer. It extends from a depth of
      about 200,000 km right up to the visible surface. At the base of the
      convection zone the temperature is about 2,000,000° C. This is "cool"
      enough for the heavier ions (such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium,
      and iron) to hold onto some of their electrons. This makes the material
      more opaque so that it is harder for radiation to get through. This
      traps heat that ultimately makes the fluid unstable and it starts to
      "boil" or convect. These convective motions carry heat quite rapidly to
      the surface. The fluid expands and cools as it rises. At the visible
      surface the temperature has dropped to 5,700° K and the density is only
      0.0000002 gm/cm³ (about 1/10,000th the density of air at sea level).
      The convective motions themselves are visible at the surface as
      granules and supergranules.
