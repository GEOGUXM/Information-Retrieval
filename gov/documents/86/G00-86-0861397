   Berkeley Lab embarks on its research quest as part of a network of
   national laboratories predominantly funded by the U.S. Department of
   Energy (DOE). The Lab was founded on the University of California at
   Berkeley campus in 1931 and moved to its present site in the hills
   above the campus in 1940. Today, the Lab is a multiprogram scientific
   facility operated by the University of California system for DOE.
   Charles V. Shank is the director of the Laboratory.

   The Laboratory, which stresses collaboration in everything we do,
   includes 15 divisions that are organized within the areas of Computing
   Sciences, Energy Sciences, Biosciences, General Sciences, and Resources
   and Operations.  Many research projects are staffed and supported by
   multiple divisions, with computational and engineering integrated
   across the biosciences, general sciences and energy sciences.
