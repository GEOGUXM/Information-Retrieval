   About Elections Divison
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Secretary of State Elections and Voter Information Page.
   We are still developing some portions of this site. Ultimately by
   browsing through this site, you will find information on ballot
   initiatives, candidate filing, and voter registration.

   The Secretary of State's Elections Division has a wide variety of
   responsibilities in administering elections in California. Our division
   is responsible for everything from certifying the official lists of
   candidates to determining which types of voting systems are acceptable
   for use in California.

   The Elections Division advises candidates and local elections officials
   on the qualifications and requirements for running for office, provides
   guidance on choosing acceptable candidate ballot designations, and
   determines the order of the candidates on the ballot.

   The Elections Division tracks and certifies ballot initiatives. If a
   state measure goes on the ballot, the Elections Division has verified
   that it has met the requirements for placement.

   Once those candidates are placed on the ballot, the Elections Division
   coordinates the tabulation of the votes from each county on election
   night. The Elections Division is responsible for producing the official
   Statements of Vote after each election. These are the official
   compilation of vote totals for a given election.

   Our Division also has a comprehensive Voter Registration and Outreach
   Team. This team's scope of responsibilities include printing
   registration forms, encouraging registration and voter turnout, and
   producing several voter information publications.

   Please visit us often as we add more information to this site for this
   and future elections.
