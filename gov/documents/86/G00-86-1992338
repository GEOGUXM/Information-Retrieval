   Starting a Business> Selecting a Business Structure
     __________________________________________________________________


   Woman reading a book. When beginning a business, you must decide what
   structure to use. Legal and tax considerations enter into this
   decision. Only tax considerations are discussed here. For legal
   considerations, consult the Small Business Administration's Selecting
   the Legal Structure for Your Business (PDF).

   The most common forms of business are the sole proprietorship,
   partnership, corporation, and S corporation. A more recent twist to
   these forms of business is the introduction of the Limited Liability
   Company (LLC) or the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Partners in a
   partnership are not employees, but a spouse in a husband and wife
   business may be treated as either a partner or as an employee. For
   further details, refer to our information for Husband and Wife
   Business, Family Help, or Employees.
