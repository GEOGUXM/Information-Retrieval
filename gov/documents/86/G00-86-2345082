                                  Status Page

   On this page we will post messages on the status of the page. These
   will include messages about the availability of data input to the
   processing on this page, explanations of recent dropouts as well as
   messages concerning future events that may effect processing.

Current Status

   Tue Nov 20 08:09:26 2001: Back to normal operation after Leonids
   shutdown over the weekend. I restarted the overlays at 14:00 PST
   yesterday but waited until this morning to start the animations since
   they depend on 12 hours of data.
     __________________________________________________________________

Upcoming Events

   During the week of Jan 28 2002, I will upgrading the hardware and/or
   software of both the processing machine and the webserver. While the
   processing machine is being upgraded no new products will be made, so
   the webpage will be stagnant for that time. Also the data will be
   unavailable.

   While the web server is being upgraded, the website will be down.

   My hope is to upgrade the processing machine on Jan 28 and the
   webserver on 29th or the 30th. I hope it won't take more than a day
   each, but you never know.

Past Messages

     * Nov 17 - 19, 2001: Leonid Meteor Showers Activities
       To mitigate any problems QuikSCAT may have while traversing the
       region of the sky which gives rise to the Leonid meteor showers,
       the following activities are planned. The TWT will be turned off
       and the instrument switched to receive only mode Saturday, Nov. 17,
       18:09 UT (10:09 PST). It will remain in that mode until Monday,
       Nov. 19, 15:27 UT (07:27 PST) when we will again resume taking
       data.
       Since we won't be getting any data, this website will not be
       updated during this time frame.
     * Wed Oct 24 07:56:52 2001: The QuikSCAT data processing computers
       are down for most of today for upgrades, so there will be an
       interruption in processing for this website.
     * Tue May 15 08:39:42 2001: Back online as of about 4 (pdt) yesterday
       afternoon. I waited until this morning to restart the processing,
       so it'll take about a day to fill out the page.
     * Fri May 11 10:50:42 2001: As of 17:00 UT, (10:00 PDT) QuikSCAT has
       been in 'Acquire Sun' mode with the solid state tape recorder
       turned off. This means that no science data is being recorded.
       There is no estimate for when the S/C will return to normal
       operations. The upshot? No data until further notice. This being
       the case, I've turned all Value Added processing off.
     * Fri May 11 10:23:19 2001: GPS receiver hiccup. Starting about 08:00
       UT (1:00 PDT) May 11, the GPS receiver on QuikSCAT has been unable
       to maintain lock on *any* GPS satellites. All wind processing will
       be offline for the foreseeable future.
     * O/S upgrade downtime!
       Wed Apr 4 08:17:19 2001: Our processing computer has been taken
       down for operating system upgrade. The current forcast is for the
       processing to resume Friday evening, but it may have to wait until
       Monday, Apr 9. During this time, no data will be produced and so
       this page will not be updated!
     * Thu Nov 16 11:10:06 2000 (PDT): TWT turned off because of the
       Leonids. No data until Saturday, about noon PDT.
       Leonids!
       Because of the possibility of damage to instrument, the transmitter
       will be turned off at approximately Nov 16 12:00 (PDT). It will be
       turned back on in about 48 hours. There will be no wind data taken
       in this interval.
     * Network Down!
       The network to this computer will be down on Saturday Nov 18
       between 6 am and 6 pm (PDT). This page will be unavailable during
       that time.
     * QuikSCAT is back online July 19 ~3:00 UT. Approximately 16 hrs
       (July 18, ~10:25 UT through July 19, ~03:00 UT) of wind
       observations were lost.
     * Wed Jul 18 ~10:00 UT: The QuikSCAT satellite started experiencing a
       problem with the 1553 BUS at approximately 10:35 UT 7/18, which is
       causing problems in the communication between the satellite and the
       SeaWinds instrument. The concerned authorities are checking into
       the problem now. There is no firm prediction for when the data will
       come back online but it appears we're looking at a 24 hour outage,
       at least.
       GMS5 data is also unavailable.
     * Mon May 15 07:56:00 2000: Goes data (east and west) was unavailable
       between May 14, 8:00 and May 15, 14:00.
     * Thu May 4 16:32:01 2000: On Monday May 1, our processing machine
       suffered a catastrophic motherboard failure. It was down from then
       until 12:00 noon today. Since then, we have been runing as usual.
       It will take about a day for all of the elements of the page to get
       back up to speed.
     * Mon Apr 17 08:12:20 2000 GMS5 data continues to be intermittant.
       For instance, yesterday data was only available between 20:00 and
       23:00.
     * Tue Apr 11 08:24:06 2000: For the last 5 days the GMS5 data has
       been very intermittant with outages for most of Saturday and bits
       of Sunday, Monday and today. I suspect that this state of affairs
       will continue.
     * Fri Apr 7 09:28:19 2000: Four passes were mangled, so the page will
       be a bit odd today until we can get other downlink stations to
       re-dump those passes and I can stir that data into the Vap stew.
