   Lingering oil from 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill still injuring wildlife:
   Sea otter and Harlequin duck populations have failed to completely
   recover in heavily oiled areas of Prince William Sound. Evidence of
   chronic exposure to hydrocarbons, liver damage and elevated mortality
   will be presented by USGS scientist Jim Bodkin to the Exxon Valdez Oil
   Spill Trustee Council on Dec. 11. Drue Pearce, Senior Advisor for
   Alaska Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, and the other 5
   members of the Council will hear this evidence along with results from
   a 2001 NOAA survey that located at least 20 acres of oil-contaminated
   beaches in western Prince William Sound, 11 years after the Exxon
   Valdez oil spill. The Council will decide what further research to
   fund, following these surprising results. USGS has been pioneering
   research in biomarkers and other population assessment techniques as
   part of these studies. (Dede Bohn, Anchorage, AK 907-786-3685)

   Buff-breasted Sandpipers Migration: Each year Arctic-nesting shorebirds
   migrate from their wintering grounds in Central and South America,
   Australia, and southeastern Asia to their nesting grounds in Alaska,
   Canada, and the Russian Far East. The Shorebird Sister Schools Program
   (http://sssp.fws.gov/sssp.html) enables students to track the migration
   and share their experiences with other "sister schools" around the

   Humpback whale Humpback Movement in Glacier Bay Related to Presence of
   Prey and Vessels: In response to concerns at Glacier Bay National Park
   and Preserve about the potential impacts of changing food supplies and
   vessel traffic on endangered humpback whales, the USGS initiated a
   pilot study on whales and their prey in cooperation with the National
   Park Service (NPS). During the past few weeks, USGS and NPS biologists
   identified and tracked individual whales (identified from known fluke
   patterns) as they moved around Glacier Bay and fed on prey in different
   oceanographic settings. Behavior of whales in the presence of prey
   schools and with respect to the movements of tourist vessels was
   monitored continuously. Preliminary results indicate that whales move
   rapidly between turbulent areas that support dense prey patches
   (herring, pollock, euphausiids, etc.), rest or sleep in calm waters,
   and actively respond to the presence of large vessels (including the
   research vessel). More extensive surveys are planned for next year.

   coho salmon New Technology To Help Answer Questions about Salmon: USGS
   research biologists Jennifer L. Nielsen and Derek Wilson successfully
   released 57 coho salmon smolts implanted with new microcomputer
   archival tags that will be used to monitor fish behavior and migration
   patterns throughout their marine life stage. The coho smolts used in
   this initial experiment were hatchery fish raised and released near
   Anchorage earlier this month where their natural downstream migration
   will lead them into Cook Inlet. This is the first application of a new
   electronic tagging technology that will allow us to document and study
   marine migrations in salmon throughout the North Pacific Ocean. This
   technology provides the opportunity to ask questions about the "black
   box" of salmon oceanic migrations and their impact on salmon
   productivity and sustainability. USGS will study salmon performance in
   different marine habitats, critical environmental oceanic conditions,
   and aspects of salmon migration and behavior in relationship to
   changing ocean and climatic conditions that were inaccessible with
   previous technologies. This study is a three-year collaboration between
   USGS, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, and the Alaska Department of

   sockeye salmon Why Pacific Salmon Have Declined: USGS scientist Dr Eric
   Knudsen has been invited to speak at the "Restoring Nutrients to
   Salmonid Ecosystems" conference, in Eugene, Oregon, April 24-26. Recent
   research has shown that a key factor contributing to Pacific salmon
   declines is a reduction in freshwater productivity due to fewer salmon
   carcasses delivering nutrients to the freshwater ecosystem. Eric was
   invited to address the topic of changes needed in spawner escapement
   management to allow adequate fertilization of freshwater systems. His
   presentation, and later book chapter, will focus on how traditional
   salmon population modeling has inadvertently contributed to population
   declines, and he will present some new ideas for an ecosystem-based
   approach to salmon population modeling. The presentation includes a

   polar bear cub Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) Technology Meets the
   Polar Bear: Stumbling into an active polar bear den will ruin your day!
   In addition, disturbing a bear in her maternal den could result in
   death of the new-born cubs that are too small to go outside in winter.
   To prevent both, researchers from the USGS are working with British
   Petroleum in Alaska to test whether thermography (Forward Looking
   Infrared, or FLIR) might be a key to den avoidance in the oil field.
   This fall, a dozen polar bears were radiocollared and followed to their
   dens. The researchers are now testing whether a FLIR imager can detect
   the temperature difference between the snow over a polar bear den and
   the adjacent snow drifts. FLIR images taken over these dens have shown
   that most do stand out against the cold landscape. Through the FLIR,
   dens look like small tufts of white cotton on a dark gray or black
   background of cold snow. In the course of this work using FLIR, the
   researchers discovered four dens of bears that were not radio-collared.
   By testing the FLIR on known dens in a variety of weather conditions,
   researchers hope to determine the circumstances needed to clearly
   detect other unknown polar bears under the snow. If the circumstances
   when FLIR is effective at detecting dens can be quantified, then it
   could be determined when it is possible to tell for certain whether
   there are any denned bears near a proposed activity. That ability would
   provide a tool to prevent unintentional disturbance of polar bears by
   winter exploration and development activities as well as to prevent
   human injuries. ( Steven Amstrup , Anchorage, AK, 907-786-3424)

   New Zealand, October 19-November 1, 2000. Links between arctic breeding
   waders and the same birds that spend the austral summer in New Zealand
   were investigated. Gill reported on his research on Bar-tailed Godwits
   ( Limosa lapponica ) and Bristle-thighed Curlews ( Numenius tahitiensis
   ) in Alaska, focusing on their breeding ecology and southward
   migration. For godwits, the latter entails a nonstop flight across the
   Pacific Ocean in which over 50% of a bird's body mass is fat. The
   migration is initiated during predictable weather systems in the Bering
   Sea/North Pacific that provide favorable tailwinds from Alaska to New
   Zealand. During his 17 days in New Zealand, Gill gave five, hour-long
   lectures on various aspects of shorebird research in Alaska, was
   interviewed by two newspapers, and conducted three radio interviews,
   including a 15-minute live (call-in) program over New Zealand Public
   Radio. He also participated in marking and capture of godwits as part
   of an international cooperative shorebird research project. Gill helped
   develop several joint research efforts concerning migration and
   stopover ecology, especially identification of key sites at both ends
   of the migration corridor as well as at sites in China, Korea, and the

   PRESS/MEDIA INQUIRIES

   chickadee Birdwatchers Assist USGS Research on Deformed Chickadees: The
   Anchorage Daily News (November 7) featured the ongoing bird studies by
   USGS researchers Steve Matsuoka and Colleen Handel. They are again
   seeking help from local birders and feeder-watchers as they try to
   determine what is causing an epidemic of bill deformities in
   black-capped chickadees and other Southcentral Alaska songbirds. Since
   1991, Alaska bird-watchers have reported seeing almost 500 birds with
   deformed bills, with an exponential rise in sightings over the past
   couple of years. This time, the researchers are looking for banded
   birds that are part of a nest-box study begun last April. Among
   preliminary findings was an alarming statistic: Out of 100 black-capped
   chickadee parents, five had deformed bills. More information on
   deformed-bill chickadees and other birds can be obtained by visiting
   the USGS Web site at http://www.absc.usgs.gov and clicking on
   "Chickadee Alert."      ( Colleen Handel , Anchorage, AK, 907-786-3418)

   earth Sharing Research Tools with the State: At the request of the
   Alaska Department of Fish and Game, USGS ecologist Philip Hooge
   presented his Animal Movement Analyst program to a meeting of State
   fish and game biologists on October 9-10. This meeting was designed to
   teach the biologists how the new capabilities of Geographic Information
   Systems can be applied to their research. The Animal Movement Analyst
   is an extension to ESRI's widely used ArcView GIS software. This
   extension analyzes the positions and movements of tracked animals,
   performing a broad range of spatial statistics, home range analysis,
   and modeling. The extension is used around the world on a variety of
   terrestrial and aquatic species, and is also used by law enforcement
   agencies to analyze crime patterns. The extension is available on the
   web at http://www.absc.usgs.gov/glba/gistools/index.htm (Philip Hooge,
