   Washington State contracts with nonprofit agencies, local governments
   and private companies to provide a wide range of social services. These
   contracting relationships are essential for the effective delivery of
   services to state residents. In most cases, the system of contracting
   for services works well. However, problems do occur and Washington has
   begun a process to examine how it might improve current practices and
   do a better job of ensuring that its nonprofit contractors are able to
   successfully provide services and meet complex contracting
   requirements.

   The Task Force on Agency Vendor Contracting Practices was created as a
   result of a bill passed by the 1998 Legislature (E2SHB 2880). Its
   charge is to study state social service contracting practices and to
   provide recommendations for improving the management of fee-for-service
   and client services contracts with nonprofit organizations. The
   nine-member Task Force was appointed and staffed by the Office of
   Financial Management. The Task Force presented its findings and
   recommendations to the Legislature and the Office of Financial
   Management on November 1, 1999. A supplemental document addressing the
   fiscal impact of implementing the recommendations was delivered to the
   Legislature and the Office of Financial Management in December 1999.
