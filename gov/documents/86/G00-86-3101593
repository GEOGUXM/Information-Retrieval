                          NHC/TPC Privacy Statement
       _______________________________________________________________

     This policy establishes how the National Hurricane Center/Tropical
     Prediction Center will use information we gather about you from your
     visit to our website. The privacy of our customers is of utmost
     importance to the NHC/TPC.

     If you visit the NHC/TPC website...
     * To read or download information with a web browser:
       We collect and log information from our webservers for statistical
       purposes. For example, we count the number of visitors to the
       different sections of our site. This helps us make the site more
       useful to visitors. The information collected is limited to the
       information logged by our webservers. Here is an example of a
       typical logged visit, with explanations of the information
       gathered:


   Client IP number Date/Time of request Specific server request
      0.0.0.0 - - [12/Nov/2000:01:26:37 +0000] "GET /graphics/test2.gif
                                  HTTP/1.0"

       status code and item size Referring web address Client browser
                                 information
     200 12925 "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE
                             5.01; Windows NT)"

       In this case a client connected to the Internet with IP number
       0.0.0.0, using Microsoft Internet Explorer^® on a Windows NT^®
       system requested the spinning cyclone graphic "test2.gif" that
       decorates the NHC/TPC homepage. (Microsoft Internet Explorer and
       Windows NT are trademarks of the Microsoft Corporation).
       We do not set or use browser "cookies" in any form or fashion at
       the NHC/TPC website.
       Browser "cookies" are records stored by webservers on a client's
       computer. Cookies are often used to record information about a
       user's visit to a website.
     * To send us an E-mail:
       By sending us an electronic mail message, you may be sending us
       personal information (e.g., name, address, E-mail address). We may
       store the name and address of the requester in order to respond to
       the request or to otherwise resolve the subject matter of your
       E-mail. At most this data is held for six months, then deleted.
     * To register for the automated tropical cyclone advisory email:
       To register for our advisory email, we ask visitors to fill out an
       on-line registration form. We require only that a valid email
       address be used to register. This information is stored on the
       email server. No copies of your email address are made other than
       backups of the email server software. Your email registration is
       not made available to any other systems. We calculate statistical
       information such as total number of subscribers from the subscriber
       lists, but no individual information is included in these reports.
       Individual subscribers control their subscriptions to the service,
       and their email address is automatically deleted from the system
       when they cancel their subscriptions. Only active subscriber email
       addresses are kept on the server. No long-term records of deleted
       subscribers are kept.

     We want to be very clear on this: regardless of the information
     being transmitted to the NHC/TPC, we will protect all such
     information consistent with applicable law.
