  Elevation area-volume curve for Great Salt Lake

   Great Salt Lake is located on a shallow playa. Consequently, small
   changes in the water-surface elevation result in large changes in the
   surface area of the lake. This is particularly evident when the lake
   spills into the west desert at an elevation of about 4215 feet, greatly
   increasing its area. The satellite imagery shows changes in the area of
   the lake from 1972, through the high-runoff period of 1983-87, and
   ending in 1996. At the historic average (1847-1986) surface elevation
   of 4,200 feet (1975 is an "average year" shown in the images), the lake
   covers an area of about 1,700 square miles. At the historic low
   elevation of 4,191.35 in 1963, the lake covered only 950 square miles.
   The drop of about 8.5 feet in elevation resulted in a loss of about 44
   percent in surface area. During 1986 and again in 1987, the lake
   reached an elevation of 4,211.6 feet and had a surface area of about
   3,300 square miles. The relation between water-surface elevation and
   corresponding surface area and volume of the lake is shown on an
   elevation-area-volume curve, also called a hypsographic curve (from the
   Greek, hypsos, meaning height).

  Great Salt Lake (GSL) is:

     * The largest U.S. lake west of the Mississippi River
     * The 4th largest terminal lake (no outlet) in the world
     * A remnant of Lake Bonneville, a prehistoric freshwater lake that
       was 10 times larger than GSL
     * About 75 miles long, and 28 miles wide, and covers 1,700 square
       miles
     * Has a maximum depth of about 35 feet
     * Typically 3 to 5 times saltier than the ocean
     * Fish free, the largest aquatic critters are brine shrimp and brine
       flies
     * One of the largest migratory bird magnets in Western North America

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has measured the elevation of Great
   Salt Lake since 1875 and conducted many studies on the hydrology,
   salinity, water quality, and ecology of the lake. Currently, the USGS
   operates lake elevation gages at Saltair Marina, Saline (north arm),
   and on the railroad causeway near Promontory Point. The USGS is
   studying the ecology of brine shrimp in the lake in cooperation with
   the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (requires Frames compatible
   browser) and researchers from the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife
   at Utah State University.

Hydrology

   In addition to measuring changes in lake elevation, since the early
   1960s the USGS has conducted detailed studies of the physical and
   chemical hydrology of the lake. These have included investigations of
   the prehistory of the lake, general hydrology of closed-basin lakes,
   effects of human activities on the lake, and a detailed accounting of
   the water budget.

Salt industry

   The salts of the lake are primarily sodium chloride (common salt),
   although small amounts of other elements and salts are also present,
   including magnesium, potassium, sulfate, and carbonate. There are about
   4.5 to 4.9 billion tons of salt in the lake, and about 2.2 million tons
   of salt enter the lake annually from surface- and ground-water flow.
   The salt industries extract about 2.5 million tons of sodium chloride
   and other salts and elements from the lake annually.

  Industries extracting salt and other minerals from the lake:

     * Great Salt Lake Minerals and Chemicals
     * Morton International
     * Cargill
     * Akzo Nobel Salts
     * Magcorp
     * North American Salt Co.
     * Northshore Limited Partnership (Mineral Resources International)

Ecology

  Brine shrimp

   Brine shrimp are not only the most visible inhabitants of Great Salt
   Lake and are very important to the ecology of the lake, serveing as a
   major source of food for migratory birds. They are also valuable for
   the hard-walled eggs they produce, which are commercially harvested and
   used worldwide in the aquaculture industry.

  Birds

   Great Salt Lake supports between 2 and 5 million shorebirds, as many as
   1.7 million eared grebes, and hundreds of thousands of waterfowl during
   spring and fall migration. Because of its importance to migratory
   birds, the lake was designated a part of the Western Hemisphere
   Shorebird Reserve Network in 1992. The lake and its marshes provide a
   resting and staging area for the birds, as well as an abundance of
   brine shrimp and brine flies that serve as food.

  Planktonic and benthic habitats

   The planktonic habitat in Great Salt Lake consists of the open water
   inhabited by brine shrimp, phytoplankton (algae), bacteria, and other
   small zooplankton. These organisms are all free-swimming or float in
   the water. The benthic habitat consists of the bottom substrate of the
   lake and its associated organisms. These organisms are primarily
   brine-fly larvae and benthic algae.
