GENERAL INFORMATION
This form is in a "fillable" PDF format. If you have Adobe Acrobat
software, you may either fill it out and print it, OR just print a
blank copy. To bring the form to your screen, click on the icon above.
You may also download the form before use by right clicking on that
icon and selecting either the "Save Link As" option if using Netscape,
OR the "Save Target As" option if using Internet Explorer. If
downloaded, you may exit your Internet browser and access the form from
an Adobe Acrobat 4.0 (or later) product. Adobe Acrobat Reader* is free
for download from: http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/acrwin.htm.
There is very little validation, computation or verification of the
information you enter on this form. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
VERIFICATION such as making sure: (1) ALL required INFORMATION is
ENTERED AND ACCURATE; (2) NONE of your text OVERWRITES any court text;
AND (3) since at times you may be able to enter more text in a field
than will actually print, be sure that ALL your TEXT actually SHOWS UP
in the field AFTER you tab past it and that it PRINTS on the paper
version of the form (i.e., you may have to do some editing as this is
NOT "What You See Is What You Get")!
*NOTE: Adobe Acrobat Reader only allows you to fill out and print a
form. However both Adobe Acrobat, and Adobe Acrobat Business Tools,
allow you to fill out and print a form, AND save the changes.
NAVIGATION
•To begin: Press <Tab> or mouse click to the first field (i.e., the
debtor's name).
•To accept text and/or move to the next field : Press <Tab>, or mouse
click.
•To return to a previous field : Press <Shift+Tab>, or mouse click.
•To check boxes: Use space bar, <Enter> key or mouse click to place an
"X" in the box.
CAUTION: You should NOT use the <Enter> key to move to the next field.
It can randomly move you to an undefined area, delete all highlighted
text, etc. NOTE: If you accidently delete highlighted text, try using
the <Esc> key to bring it back.
PRINTING
•After filling out the form: Press <Tab> from the last field and then
press the space bar or click on the printer icon.
•Before filling out the form (i.e., to print a blank form for filling
out): Click on the printer icon at the bottom of the form.
IMPORTANT: For the best quality output, UNCHECK ALL boxes located in
the upper right side of the Print window (e.g., "Fit to page" should
NOT be selected). Press OK or the <Enter> key to print.
