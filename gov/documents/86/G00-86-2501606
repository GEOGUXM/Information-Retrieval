   The U.S. Senate's web server is a joint service of the Senate Committee
   on Rules and Administration, the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms,
   and the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. All Senate member and
   standing/select/special/other committee offices are authorized to place
   files on these servers at their discretion.

   All Senate offices' use of the U.S. Senate's web server is governed by
   Senate Internet Services Usage Rules and Policies established by the
   Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Included in these
   guidelines are provisions prohibiting Senators from posting most
   information files during a sixty-day period preceding an election
   primary in which the Senator is a candidate, as well as during a
   sixty-day period before every biennial general federal election in
   which the Senator is a candidate. This restriction is in keeping with
   existing Senate policies regarding Senators' use of other outreach
   services provided by the Senate.

   If you wish to inquire about or comment on a specific Senate office's
   participation in this service -- for example, if you have questions
   about a press release posted on this service or want more information
   about a legislative summary -- you must direct your inquiry to the
   specific Senate office in question. Such inquiries can be directed
   using the procedures outlined elsewhere for writing or calling a Senate
   office. Electronic mail messages will NOT be forwarded to any
   individual Senate offices by the administrators of this service. Please
   do not send comments or questions regarding an individual office or its
   information postings to the administrators of this service.

   If you have a general question about the Senate's web service or wish
   to relay a comment or suggestion about these services, you can send
   this via Internet e-mail to: webmaster@sec.senate.gov

   Any messages sent to this address requiring follow-up or interaction
   with another Senate office will not be processed or forwarded; such
   inquiries must be directed to the Senate office or offices in question
   following the procedures described elsewhere in this FAQ listing.
