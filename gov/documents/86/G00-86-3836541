      The SEL has produced a rich collection of experience reports, data
      analyses, guidebooks for software engineers, and Proceedings of our
      annual Software Engineering Workshop. Based on project data, research
      results, and local experience, we've identified key practices and
      technologies and how best to apply them in the software production
      environment. We've captured that experience in our document series,
      which is designed to support the work of software practitioners in our
      organization and elsewhere.

      The entire collection, described in the Annotated Bibliography of SEL
      Literature, is available in hardcopy form. See also the Standard
      Bibliography of SEL Literature (PDF, 71KB), which contains all current
      SEL titles.
