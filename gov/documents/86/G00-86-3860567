Elected Officials

   Houston has a strong Mayor-Council form of government. The City's
   elected officials, serving concurrent two-year terms, are: the Mayor,
   the City Controller and the 14 members of City Council.

   In this section we provide information on your elected officials as
   well as ways to communicate with them. Citizens have the right and
   responsibility to get to know the Council Member representing their
   district and the City Controller, charged with maintaining watch over
   public funds. Use these resources as your starting point.
