   Article III of the United States Constitution establishes the judicial
      branch as one of the three separate and distinct branches of the
     federal government. The other two are the legislative and executive
                                  branches.

    The federal courts often are called the guardians of the Constitution
    because their rulings protect rights and liberties guaranteed by the
   Constitution. Through fair and impartial judgments, the federal courts
   interpret and apply the law to resolve disputes. The courts do not make
     the laws. That is the responsibility of Congress. Nor do the courts
    have the power to enforce the laws. That is the role of the President
           and the many executive branch departments and agencies.

    The Founding Fathers of the nation considered an independent federal
      judiciary essential to ensure fairness and equal justice for all
    citizens of the United States. The Constitution they drafted promotes
     judicial independence in two major ways. First, federal judges are
    appointed for life, and they can be removed from office only through
    impeachment and conviction by Congress of "Treason, Bribery, or other
    high Crimes and Misdemeanors." Second, the Constitution provides that
     the compensation of federal judges "shall not be diminished during
    their Continuance in Office," which means that neither the President
      nor Congress can reduce the salary of a federal judge. These two
     protections help an independent judiciary to decide cases free from
                  popular passions and political influence.
