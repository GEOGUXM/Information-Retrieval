   . . . A HISTORY OF SERVICE

   Building 1 The Albany Research Center was established on June 2, 1942,
   as part of the U.S. Bureau of Mines.   Its purpose was twofold:  (1) to
   find methods for using the abundant low-grade resources of the area,
   and (2) to develop new metallurgical processes using electrical energy.
   It was known then as the Northwest Electro-development Laboratory.
   Under Public Law 645 of the 77th Congress, $500,000 had been
   appropriated to establish the laboratory. The campus of the recently
   vacated Albany College was chosen from among several possible sites
   because it offered some clear advantages. Its 42 acres provided ample
   space for expansion; it was near Oregon State University, an invaluable
   source of technical knowledge; and it could be purchased for only
   $134,500, leaving enough money to renovate the existing buildings into
   laboratories.

   During the early years, one of the Albany Research Center's landmark
   achievements was a process for producing zirconium. Dr. William J.
   Kroll, an eminent scientist from Luxembourg, played a major role in
   formulating the research program at the Albany Research Center. It was
   his work on the lesser known reactive metals that led to the birth of
   both the titanium and zirconium industries, which employ processes that
   bear his name. In 1948, when zirconium was the metal chosen for use in
   the reactor of the first nuclear-powered submarine (the Nautilus), the
   Albany Research Center cooperated with the U.S. Navy and the Atomic
   Energy Commission to test and finally produce the zirconium needed for
   this purpose. The Center continued this production work until 1955,
   when private industry took over.

   Under the U.S. Bureau of Mines, the Albany Research Center continued to
   be involved in a variety of metals and minerals related research areas,
   including atmospheric corrosion, wear, vitrification of solid municipal
   wastes, sulfurcrete, titanium casting, liquid emulsion membranes for
   minewater cleanup, thermodynamics, cold-wall induction melting, and
   many others. Albany Research Center scientists have been granted a
   number of patents over the years, and have contributed extensively in
   the fields of metals and minerals research. In 1985, the Center was
   named an historical landmark by the American Society for Metals.

   Technology transfer has long been one of the primary goals for the
   research done at the Center. By the early 90's the Center was heavily
   involved in partnership programs, not only with other Federal and State
   agencies and academia, but also with private companies.

   In 1995, Congress closed the U.S. Bureau of Mines, but the Materials
   Partnership Program at the Albany Research Center was transferred into
   the Office of Fossil Energy of the U.S. Department of Energy. The
   cooperative partnerships that the Albany Research Center has generated
   with other groups and agencies continue to be a major part of the
   Center's research efforts.
