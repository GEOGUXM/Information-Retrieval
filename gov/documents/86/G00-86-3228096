   DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE REAL PROPERTY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION, SPECIFICATION
   AND WORK STATEMENT PART I - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK
   STATEMENT PAGE C-1 SECTION C August 20, 1999
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT C.1 DESCRIPTION C.1.1
   Procurement Overview The purposes of this procurement are to: (1)
   accomplish a "proof-of-concept" demonstration of the RPS, and (2)
   achieve Department-wide implementation of this system--in the event
   this demonstration is evaluated to be successful. Department-wide
   implementation of the planned RPS will be pursued in phases, requiring
   the acquisition of optional and required software, related training,
   and optional technical/implementation support services. C.1.1.2 Guiding
   Vision 1. The real property community envisions a dynamic system that
   will grow, change, and remain current with available technology,
   changing philosophy, changing regulations, and reporting requirements.
   2. Ultimately the RPS will be a fully Internet based system that may be
   integrated with other DOC systems using an ORACLE data base. 3. The RPS
   will provide real-time capture, validation, processing and recording of
   real property data. 4. The RPS will be user-friendly, provide flexible
   processing, easy to change, and readily accommodate the addition and
   deletion of users. 5. The RPS will encompass all phases of the real
   property management process from acquisition through general
   administration and reporting. 6. The RPS will interface with the
   General Services Administration's (GSA) RENT system for validation of
   charges and space inventory the GSA Worldwide Inventory of Real
   Property Owned by and Leased to the U.S. Government for annual
   reporting purposes. C.1.1.3 Initial Concept of Operation 1. DOC expects
   the real property management software to be single source code. The DOC
   Real Property User's Group will coordinate suggested changes to the
   software, to ensure that any modifications will not adversely impact on
   the rest of the system. 2. The ultimate objective is "single-entry,
   source capture of data" (i.e. one-time capture of procurement and
   payment information). 3. A mechanism of data validation and edits will
   be used throughout the real property management module to ensure the
   accuracy of data input. Pre-defined data entry screens will
   automatically generate transactions to seamlessly balance procurement
   of real property between the CFS, procurement and real property
   management modules. The cost savings realized through reduced data
   reconciliations and error correction is an expected benefit of an
   integrated system. PART I - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK
   STATEMENT PAGE C-2 4. Up-to-date real property data will be available
   for on-line query and reporting based on user security level. Real
   Property data will be maintained as close to the source as possible,
   and data integrity will be enhanced by the elimination of data entry
   redundancy and extensive data reconciliation. 5. Real Property data
   managers will have ready access to all data and information needed to
   satisfy these requirements. 6. If deployed on more than one platform,
   the RPS will have the capability of uploading selected files to a
   central repository for central reporting requirements. C.1.1.4 Current
   Environment DOC is comprised of 14 bureaus (i.e., operating units), the
   Office of the Secretary, and a number of administrative offices charged
   with carrying out a wide range of disparate programs and administrative
   support tasks. These programs encompass such areas as patent and
   trademark, research and testing, weather forecasting, economic
   development, international trade, economic forecasts, fishery
   management, mapping, and many others. DOC has approximately 30,000
   employees located worldwide. It is expected that the RPS will be
   implemented by the Office of the Secretary, three bureaus and four
   administrative support centers. The ultimate goal is for the RPS to be
   a fully Internet-Based Application, accessible through any standard
   internet browser. C.1.1.5 Hardware/Operating Systems Environment The
   DOC performs financial management in a decentralized manner. The major
   bureaus currently operate financial systems on their own computer
   platforms, while some smaller bureaus are cross-serviced by other,
   larger bureaus. The bureaus operate a variety of hardware, principally
   VAX and IBM/IBM-compatible. C.1.1.6 Scope. The Contractor will provide
   the necessary personnel, materials, and services to meet the
   requirements of the real property management module as defined in this
   document. C.1.1.7 Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software (COTS) Package for
   the Real Property System (RPS) "COTS Package." The DOC RPS will be
   implemented through the acquisition and firm-fixed- price modification
   of a Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software (COTS) Package. This COTS
   package must meet all of DOC's "Mandatory Technical Requirements" and
   "Mandatory Functional Requirements" (described in Section C.4.1,
   "Minimum Mandatory Requirements") and "Critical Functional
   Requirements" (described in Section C.4.2.1) before it is accepted and
   deployed to operating units within DOC. Further, the COTS package must
   substantially meet the "Critical Technical Requirements" described in
   Section C.4.2.2. before it is accepted. PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-3 C.1.1.8 Required
   Modifications "Required Fixed-Price Modifications and System
   Acceptance." DOC requires that the selected COTS package fully meet all
   of the Minimum Mandatory and Critical Functional Requirements before it
   will be accepted according to Section E, "Inspection and Acceptance."
   Therefore, contractor's COTS package will include any required
   modifications--i.e., those necessary to fully comply with all of the
   Minimum Mandatory and Critical Functional Requirements. Modifications
   to a contractor's COTS package pursuant to this requirement are called
   "Required Modifications." C.1.1.9 Required Support Software "Required
   Support Software." This includes any additional software for the
   operation, maintenance, or management of the COTS package necessary to
   meet contract requirements, as well as to ensure the efficiency and
   effectiveness of the package. For example, this may include: Relational
   Database Management Systems (RDBMS), Report Generators, Fourth
   Generation Language Screen Generators (4GLs), 4GL runtime licenses
   necessary for users to run terminal screens and reports on client
   personal computers (PCs), Query Generators, Query Utilities, System
   Monitoring Software Utilities, User Management Software Utilities,
   Communications Software necessary for Client-Server operations, Memory
   Managers necessary to operate Clients on PCs, Utilities necessary to
   run queries under Windows, Utilities necessary to facilitate message
   generation (e.g., error messages, action messages) from the COTS
   package to system users over networks, Computer Aided Systems
   Engineering (CASE) Tools used to support software maintenance, and
   Utilities that support software configuration management. The
   Government reserves the option to require the contractor to provide all
   required support software identified above, as well as required support
   software identified in the contractor's proposal. Software identified
   by the contractor as a product not manufactured by the contractor must
   be commercially available from a third party vendor. DOC seeks to
   acquire each necessary software product under a Department-wide blanket
   license agreement with the respective software vendor. However, until
   such time as the successful contractor's modified COTS package is
   evaluated for Department-wide implementation, DOC will be responsible
   only for purchasing a license sufficient to authorize those uses for
   which DOC is employing the package. C.1.1.10 Documentation
   "Documentation." Modified COTS Package software must be completely
   documented. This includes both technical and user manuals that
   incorporate all changes made to the contractors basis software package.
   C.1.1.11 Training Courses and Materials "Training Courses and
   Materials." These include formal classroom instruction, computer-based
   training software, and self-study courses as required in Section C.5,
   "Training." C.1.1.12 Additional Documentation PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-4 "Additional
   Documentation." Contractor is required to supply additional copies of
   documentation to DOC on delivery orders as requested. Additional
   Documentation includes extra copies of all of the different types of
   documentation, manuals, and training material required for the COTS
   Package as specified in Section C.4, "Software Package Requirements"
   and Section C.5, "Training". Additional Documentation also includes
   extra copies of documentation, manuals for all support software
   supplied by the contractor--to the extent that documentation is
   available from suppliers, if the software vendor is other than the
   contractor. "Extra copies" means additional copies above the number
   required to be delivered as part of the fixed-price for products
   specified elsewhere in Section C. C.1.1.13 System Maintenance Support
   "System Maintenance Support." This is required as described in Section
   C.6, "System Maintenance Support." C.1.1.14 Technical Services
   "Technical Services." These include all contractor support necessary
   for the implementation of the RPS. (See Section C.7, "Technical
   Services" below). C.1.2 Implementation Strategy The strategy for
   implementing the RPS follows a multi-layered approach, beginning with
   the acquisition, installation and vendor modification of a stand-alone
   commercial off-the-shelf software package. Once the modified package is
   accepted and a successful implementation of it is achieved within the
   pilot bureau(s), the package may be deployed, in phases, to the
   remaining DOC bureaus/organizations. At a future date, the RPS may be
   integrated with other systems. C.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS The
   contractor's project management approach will ensure that: (1) the COTS
   software package is modified on schedule, per the contractor's approved
   Software Modification Plan; (2) the modified package is accepted on
   schedule; and (3) all delivery/task orders are completed successfully
   and on time. All task deliverables will be presented to the contracting
   officers technical representative (COTR) in accordance with the
   approved plan for that task. The contractor will provide professional,
   technical and office support staffing sufficient to assure the timely
   completion of all milestones and all other contractual
   responsibilities. All products, including memoranda, records, reports,
   computer programs and inventions developed by the offeror under the
   contract will become the property of the DOC, including the proprietary
   rights therein. Additionally, the contractor will meet the specific
   project management requirements given in Section H.12, "Optional
   Delivery/Task Orders." C.3 THIS SECTION INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK PART I
   - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-5 C.4
   SOFTWARE PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS As part of the Department-wide CAMS, the
   DOC requires a real property management module that will maintain a
   current inventory of all DOC's land, buildings, and structures. This
   module will eventually be fully integrated with the CFS and the
   procurement system. This document defines the functional requirements
   for the real property management module. C.4.1 Minimum Mandatory
   Requirements C.4.1.1 Minimum Mandatory Functional Requirements The
   contractor's proposed software package solution will satisfy fully each
   of the following minimum mandatory functional requirements: C.4.1.1.1
   This section intentionally left blank . C.4.1.1.2 General Requirements
   The contractor's proposed baseline COTS package--i.e., commercially
   available but without DOC required modifications--will be a fully
   supported, production version as of the date of contract award.
   C.4.1.1.3 Commerce-specific Requirements C.4.1.1.3.1 The contractor's
   proposed software package solution will support the entry of data in an
   interactive mode. C.4.1.1.3.2 Documentation for the contractor's
   proposed RPS software will be current, complete and delivered to the
   DOC in hard copy, and, if available, in on-line electronic form. It
   will be of a quality sufficient to allow Commerce-wide RPS end users,
   bureau RPS administrators and operators, and responsible Departmental
   technical designers/programmers to readily identify, understand, and
   effectively operate, maintain and enhance all aspects of the system.
   The documentation should contain the information as categorized below,
   but does not have to include the detailed items as specific titles; and
   the contractor will provide a cross-reference of their documentation to
   the following list. This documentation will include, at a minimum: (1)

   Minimum Mandatory Technical Requirements The contractor's proposed
   software package solution will satisfy fully each of the following
   minimum mandatory technical requirements: C.4.1.2.1 Be operable on DEC
   hardware/operating system software, with both data and processing fully
   distributable across DEC processors (on systems with multiple
   processors) and across DEC system clusters. The version of the DEC
   operating system (and any other DEC support software) will be the most
   current version as of the date of the release of the solicitation.
   C.4.1.2.2 Be operable on IBM-compatible hardware/operating system
   software, with processing fully distributable across processors (on
   such systems with multiple processors). The version of the operating
   system (and other support software) will be the most current version as
   of the date of the release of the solicitation. C.4.1.2.3 The exact
   same version of the contractor's proposed software package will run on
   all sizes of computer platforms. C.4.1.2.4 The client/server version,
   the decentralized version, and the host-based version of the package
   will use the same source code--so that changes coordinated centrally at
   the DOC-Implementation Center will apply, without modification, to all
   versions of the application software in use throughout DOC. C.4.1.2.5
   Allow DOC to leverage its existing technology architecture while
   migrating to its planned architecture, by including each of the
   following technical capabilities as an integral part of the system
   design: C.4.1.2.5.1 Be operable on each system conforming to the IEEE
   1003.x "POSIX" family of standards not more than 18 months after
   operating systems PART I - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK
   STATEMENT PAGE C-7 meeting those standards are released for hardware
   platforms used by DOC to operate the contractor's proposed software
   package. C.4.1.2.5.2 Support direct queries based on the use of the
   FIPS-127-1, "Structured Query Language" by providing appropriate
   certification of compliance to the standard. Provide a definitive plan
   for achieving compliance to FIPS-127-2 with proposed CFS software
   solution. C.4.1.2.5.3 Be implemented within a relational data base
   management system (RDBMS). C.4.1.2.5.4 Be implemented using a
   "normalized" data structure: i.e., one that is in third-normal form
   (3NF), optimized for both performance and platform. C.4.1.2.6 Allow the
   DOC or third-party contractor personnel to maintain, modify, enhance or
   upgrade the contractor's proposed software system to meet additional,
   new or changing DOC requirements--without requiring any assistance
   whatever from the contractor. C.4.1.2.7 Provide the DOC all application
   source code; program, system and design documentation; CASE tool/data
   dictionary information; and any and all other documentation and
   information needed by the DOC to maintain the contractor's proposed
   software without any assistance whatever from the contractor. C.4.2
   Critical Requirements The functional and technical requirements listed
   below are considered by DOC to be critical to its RPS operations.
   C.4.2.1 Critical Functional Requirements The DOC's real property
   management function encompasses the total structure of methods and
   procedures used to record, classify and report information on the real
   property holdings of each DOC bureau. Each of the requirements listed
   below is critical to the successful performance of this function, and
   therefore each must be fully supported by the Department's planned RPS.
   The contractor's proposed software package solution will either satisfy
   fully each of the critical functional requirements defined below, or
   else will be modified by the contractor--as part of the DOC's purchase
   price--to fully satisfy each. NOTE: The numbering system used within
   Section C.4.2.1, Critical Functional Requirements, does not define
   hierarchical relationships between requirements. Each requirement is
   individually defined and will be evaluated separately. C.4.2.1.2. Real
   Property Management Network The DOC utilizes a distributed delegation
   of authority for providing real property operational services. This
   authority has been granted to DOC's Director, Office of Real Estate
   Policy and Major Programs; the Director, Bureau of the Census; the
   Commissioner, Patent and Trademark Office; the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration Chief Financial Officer/Chief Administrative
   Officer and each Administrative Support Center PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-8 Director, for DOC
   bureaus within their respective service areas. As a result, the same
   pattern is to be followed concerning data entry into the RPS.
   C.4.2.1.2.1. Management Offices. The RPS will provide the capability to
   record the appropriate management office responsible for each real
   property record entered into the system. While each installation record
   can have only one valid management office, it is possible that the
   occupants (bureaus) located at any particular installation may have a
   management office that differs from the office listed at the
   installation level. Valid real property management offices are: 1.
   Office of Real Estate Policy and Major Programs (R) 2. Bureau of the
   Census (S) 3. Patent and Trademark Office (P) 4. NOAA Facility
   Management Division (N) 5. Eastern Administrative Support Center (E) 6.
   Central Administrative Support Center (C) 7. Mountain Administrative
   Support Center (M) 8. Western Administrative Support Center (W)
   C.4.2.1.2.2. Mass Changes. The RPS will provide the capability to
   perform mass changes within or between bureau system of assignment of
   property items. Types of mass changes would include reassigning the
   management office responsible for a particular installation or occupant
   within an installation. C.4.2.1.3. Data Validation The RPS will have
   validation tables to establish valid codes that may be used for various
   data elements. Valid codes are included in Appendix A, Data Dictionary.
   C.4.2.1.3.1. Standard Description Codes. 1. The RPS will require the
   assignment of standard description codes for each installation and
   property record, and include the following: - Agency Bureau Codes;
   Four-digit numeric codes established and required by GSA. - Estate
   codes; Two-digit codes established internally at DOC. - Property Type
   Codes; Two-digit codes established and required by GSA. - Acquisition
   Codes - Usage Codes Appendix A contains lists of all valid standard
   description codes. 2. Standard Description Codes will be available to
   browse and select from a pop-up window or other mechanism to allow for
   on-screen access to the table. PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-9 3. The RPS will be
   capable of `crosswalking" DOC standard Description Codes to GSA codes.
   C.4.2.1.3.2. Transaction Edits: The RPS will include transaction edits
   that will: 1. Insure all mandatory data elements are entered into all
   real property records. See Appendix A, Data Dictionary for additional
   information on mandatory data elements. 2. Automatically verify for
   each real property transaction the validity of all Standard Description
   Codes. Appendix A contains lists of all valid codes. 3. As an aid to
   data entry, automatically assign default values to the following data
   elements, but allow the defaults to be overridden by the user: Lease
   Type Indicator (O = Operating) Lease to Purchase Indicator (N = No) Out
   lease Indicator (N = No) GSA 1166 Indicator (N = No) Utilization Data
   (1166) Baseline (N=No), Deferral (N=No) GSA Assistance Needed (N=No)
   Seismic Safety Standards Met (UK = Unknown) Fixed Escalator Indicator
   (N=No) NPR Lease Indicator (N=No) Historic Building Code (Seismic) (
   H2= Non-historic) Heritage Asset Indicator (N=No) Federal mission
   indicator (N=No) 4. Automatically system-generate values in history
   records for the following data elements: Date Property Record
   Established in RPS Management Control Point 5. Prevent unauthorized
   users from entering data. See Section 4.2.2.3 of this document on
   Security. C.4.2.1.3.3. On-Screen Messages: The RPS will produce
   appropriate error messages, informational messages and tutorial
   information. 1. Error Messages: The RPS will generate error messages to
   notify the system user of the following conditions: a. Required data
   elements have not been entered. PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-10 b. Data element
   content requirements (validity checks) are not met. c. User doesn't
   have proper security authorization to proceed with inquiry,
   transaction, or report production. d. Improper or unrecognizable key
   has been pressed. 2. On-line Assistance: The RPS will include
   user-activated assistance which will include, at a minimum, the
   following capabilities. a. The RPS will provide an extensive on-line,
   context-sensitive HELP facility which provides valid data values, error
   codes, data element definitions, and the addition of examples, policy
   and general guidance. b. The RPS will provide a comprehensive, on-line
   active data dictionary, which an end user may query without exiting the
   current application screen. This data dictionary must contain, at a
   minimum, a glossary of data elements, their definitions and
   relationship to screens, data fields, system prompts, and edits.
   C.4.2.1.4. Recording Real Property The RPS will provide the capability
   to record the data elements for each accountable real property holding
   as indicated in the Data Element Dictionary in Appendix A. C.4.2.1.4.1.
   Categories of Real Property. The RPS will provide the capability to
   track and differentiate between the following categories of real
   property: 1. Capitalized real property: All real property with an
   initial acquisition cost that meets a user-defined capitalization
   criteria, capitalization threshold and an estimated service life of two
   years or greater is capitalized real property. Capitalized real
   property carried in the RPS will agree with capitalized real property
   in the general ledger. The RPS will provide the capability for the
   capitalization threshold to be easily modified. The current
   capitalization threshold is $25,000. 2. Non-capitalized accountable
   real property: All real property with a service life of less than two
   years or real property not meeting the capitalization criteria or
   minimum capitalization threshold. 3. Leased real property: All real
   property leased directly by the DOC regardless of cost. The RPS will
   provide the capability to identify and categorized leases as either
   capital or operating. C.4.2.1.4.2. Methods of Acquisition. PART I -
   SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-11 Real
   Property is acquired by the Government through various methods. The RPS
   will be capable of identifying the method of acquisition for each real
   property holding as indicated below. 1. The RPS will generate the
   appropriate general ledger entries to record property acquired through
   donations; gratuitous agreement; transfer; easement; condemnation;
   reserved; withdrawal from public domain; license to DOC; or interagency
   support agreement. 2. Purchased property: The RPS will provide the
   capability to record the data elements necessary to properly record
   real property holdings and related improvements (See Appendix A for
   data elements). 3. Leased-non-capitalized: The RPS will provide the
   capability to complete the data elements necessary to properly record
   real property holdings leased by DOC that are non-capitalized
   (operating leases) when the lease document and payment data are
   processed through the CFS. 4. Leased-capitalized: The RPS will provide
   the capability to complete the data elements necessary to properly
   record real property holdings leased by DOC and their related
   improvements that are capitalized when the lease, procurement document,
   and payment data are processed through the CFS. 4.a. Real property
   acquired through lease agreements will be capitalized if the lease
   meets the defined criteria for a "capital lease." (See Appendix B for
   checklist.) Such property will be depreciated from the beginning of the
   lease term when the property was initially acquired, (See Appendix A,
   Data Dictionary for the definition of Lease Effective Date.) 4.b. Any
   improvements made to real property acquired by lease agreement will be
   capitalized only if they meet the definition of a "capital improvement"
   (See Appendix C for details.) Such improvements will be capitalized
   beginning on the date when the improvement is completed only if the
   improvement's value is equal to or exceeds the amount set for
   capitalization and life expectancy of a capital improvement. 5. GSA
   Assignments: The RPS will provide the capability to complete the data
   elements necessary to properly record real property holdings acquired
   through GSA assignment. C.4.2.1.4.3. Adding Real Property Records The
   DOC Real Property record consists of installations, under which there
   can be multiple properties. Under each property, there can be multiple
   occupants and under each occupant, multiple space classifications. The
   RPS will be capable of associating multiple space classifications with
   a single related occupant, multiple occupants with a single related
   property, and multiple properties with a single related installation.
   The requirements outlined below indicate how the data elements are
   associated with each of these. The RPS will contain the necessary data
   elements to: PART I - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK

   utilized. C.4.2.1.8.18 Execute any query or report against either
   current data or prior period data including, but not limited to,
   previous day, previous week, previous month, previous quarter, and
   previous year; and accomplish these queries in an interactive manner.
   C.4.2.2 Critical Technical Requirements A contractor's proposed
   software package could meet most of the above "critical functional
   requirements" and yet still not represent a satisfactory solution for
   the Department's planned RPS. This is because, in the future, the RPS
   is intended to be an integrated with the CFS. In view of this
   objective, the contractor's proposed system solution will have, apart
   from the specific required functional capabilities, a variety of other
   capabilities and characteristics which address basic system operations,
   program management support, Commerce user-community expectations,
   security and control, external regulations and policies, and data
   handling characteristics. These other capabilities are reflected in the
   "critical technical requirements" identified below. C.4.2.2.1 Ability
   to Cost-effectively Maintain, Modify, and Enhance the System
   C.4.2.2.1.1 Provide a system which, over its expected life (of at least
   ten years), allows the DOC to cost-effectively: (1) maintain it for
   ongoing, Department-wide use; (2) interface it to various other
   systems; and (3) enhance it to add significant new functionality. The
   contractor will: (1) provide at least 3 detailed references that
   substantiate that the proposed version of its software can be
   maintained (provide reference to type of maintenance and support for
   the previous three years); (2) that the software has been interfaced to
   other systems (provide a detailed breakdown for these three references
   of the systems that have been interfaced); and (3) that the system is
   extensible--that it has the ability to add new functionality (provide 2
   detailed references--including how and what was done to add additional
   functionality). C.4.2.2.1.2 Furnish the DOC with an ASCII tape
   cartridge or CD ROM version of all of the application source code,
   including a detailed listing of PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-23 all files on the
   tape, comprising the proposed software solution, in a form adequate for
   DOC personnel to readily access and modify. C.4.2.2.1.3 Provide the DOC
   limited access to the current version of any CASE tool (and its
   associated models), for the sole purpose of the DOC performing impact
   analyses of its proposed software changes. C.4.2.2.1.4 Code all modules
   of both the proposed on-line and batch subsystems in a 4GL. C.4.2.2.1.5
   Code any proposed subsystem not done in a 4GL in an ANSI Standard 3GL,
   with no extensions. C.4.2.2.1.6 Provide a system which employs
   contemporary technology extensively, including, but not limited to: (1)
   Applications implemented within a RDBMS and making effective use of its
   features and capabilities. (2) Graphical User Interfaces implemented
   for all end-user devices capable of supporting such interfaces. (3)
   Standards implemented sufficient to offer the DOC a clear migration
   path to an Open Systems Environment (OSE) for its Financial Management
   function. C.4.2.2.1.7 Provide sufficient data recovery features to
   assure the recovery of all data in the event of any hardware or
   software failure; these features may include the use of a combination
   of roll-back/roll-forward, checkpoint/restart, journalizing, and other
   techniques to assure the availability of accurate, consistent data in
   the database. C.4.2.2.1.8 Operate a "Hot Line", available on each DOC
   workday from 8:00 AM EST until 7:00 PM EST, staffed by personnel
   specifically familiar with the DOC implementation of the contractor's
   proposed system, including all changes that the contractor has made to
   the proposed system at the request of DOC. C.4.2.2.2 Data Management
   C.4.2.2.2.1 The proposed on-line transmission processing and on-line
   query systems will use a single integrated database. C.4.2.2.2.2 A
   single integrated database will support all proposed system modules and
   functions, and it will be implemented as part of the proposed on-line
   system. C.4.2.2.2.3 Multiple users of the proposed system will be able
   to read and write each table, or file, with changes to the table, or
   file, being made only after a user's transaction successfully
   completes; and other users PART I - SECTION C
   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT PAGE C-24 will be allowed to
   concurrently read/update other table/file entries during the update.
   C.4.2.2.2.4 The proposed system will be implemented with an active data
   dictionary which supports all operations of the system and which is
   also available to DOC-Implementation Center staff to support changes to
   the system. C.4.2.2.2.5 The DOC will have the ability to readily add
   data elements to the database and data dictionary used with the
   contractor's proposed system. C.4.2.2.2.6 The proposed system will
   support the use of synonyms and aliases (for data elements, screen
   labels, report/query column titles, file/table names, etc.) to allow
   the bureaus to tailor screens and documentation to bureau-specific
   naming conventions, without requiring customization of the applications
   code or documentation. C.4.2.2.2.7 The proposed system will support
   Query-by-Example (QBE), Query- by-Form (QBF), and Graphical User
   Interface point-and-click methods of specifying ad hoc queries.
   C.4.2.2.2.8 The proposed system will support SQL-based and table-driven
   ad hoc query capabilities. C.4.2.2.2.9 The ad hoc query capability will
   be available under MS Windows and will support both off line entry
   (OLE) and direct data entry (DDE). The release numbers for OLE and DDE
   are the latest production release number as of the date the
   solicitation is issued. C.4.2.2.2.10 The proposed system will provide
   an integrated, table-driven report writer for end users that gives them
   the capability to: (1) Create and generate reports. (2) Save report
   specifications. C.4.2.2.3 System Security C.4.2.2.3.1 Access security
   for the proposed system will be provided at the screen, record, and
   field level for all information in the data base. C.4.2.2.3.2 Only each
   bureau's System Administrator will have the ability to modify
   bureau-related system tables. C.4.2.2.3.3 Users of the proposed system
   will be able to delegate their authorities subject only to security and
   access controls. C.4.2.2.3.4 The proposed system will restrict access
   (input or query) down to the data element level for each user-ID. All
   unauthorized log in attempts, and all unauthorized access attempts,
   will be written to a log file with the date and time, terminal ID, User
   ID, table(s) and PART I - SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK
   STATEMENT PAGE C-25 function(s) ID recorded. This information should be
   accessible via query and report. C.4.2.2.3.5 The proposed system will
   generate and maintain audit tra
