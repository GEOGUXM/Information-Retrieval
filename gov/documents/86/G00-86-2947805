   Mission Objectives:

             Click here for Additional Info on STS-95

             The primary objectives include conducting a variety of science
             experiments in the pressurized SPACEHAB module, the deployment
             and retrieval of the Spartan free-flyer payload, and operations
             with the HST Orbiting Systems Test (HOST) and the International
             Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH) payloads being carried in
             the payload bay.

             The SPACEHAB module being flown on STS-95 is provided by
             SPACEHAB Inc. a private company which provide single or double
             module Spacehabs to support NASA's space flight efforts. The
             SPACEHAB system provides additional pressurized workspace for
             experiments, cargo and crew activities. SPACEHAB modules have
             supported various Shuttle science missions along with several of
             the joint Shuttle-Mir missions.

             For STS-95 a single-module SPACEHAB will fly in the forward
             portion of Discovery's payload bay with the crew gaining access
             to the module through the airlock tunnel system. A variety of
             experiments sponsored by NASA, the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA)
             and the European Space Agency (ESA) will focus on life sciences,
             microgravity sciences and advanced technology during the flight.

             The Spartan 201 free-flyer that will be deployed and retrieved
             using the Shuttle's mechanical arm and is designed to
             investigate physical conditions and processes of the hot outer
             layers of the Sun's atmosphere, or solar corona. While deployed
             from the Shuttle, Spartan will gather measurements of the solar
             corona and solar wind. Information collected during this mission
             will lead to a much better understanding of the solar winds that
             directly influence orbiting satellites and weather conditions on
             Earth which in turn impact television and phone communications.
             This is a reflight of the Spartan payload flown on Mission
             STS-87 in November 1997 which developed problems shortly after
             being deployed from the Shuttle.

             The Hubble Space Telescope Orbiting Systems Test (HOST) platform
             is carrying experiments to validate components planned for
             installation during the third Hubble Space Telescope servicing
             mission and to evaluate new technologies in an earth orbiting
             environment. There are four experiments on the HOST platform.
             The NICMOS Cooling System will allow zero-g verification of a
             Reverse Turbo Brayton Cycle Cooler which should allow longer
             life operation than the current dewar system. (2) The HST 486
             Computer will allow the identification of any radiation
             susceptible parts in the DF-224 replacement and demonstrate
             hardware and software responses to Single Event Upsets (SEU's).
             (3) Solid State Recorder will compare on-orbit operation of the
             flight spare solid state recorder with the current HST unit. (4)
             Fiber Optic Line Test will use the same 4 kbps data stream that
             is sent to the orbiter's Payload Data Interrogator (PDI) and
             will be routed to a laptop computer for post-flight comparison.

             The International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH) payload
             involves a half dozen different experiments mounted on a support
             structure being carried in Discovery's payload bay. The six
             experiments that make up the IEH payload are (1) Solar Extreme
             Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (SEH) payload that will obtain EUV and
             FUV fluxes that are required when studying the Earth's upper
             atmosphere; (2) Ultraviolet Spectrograph Telescope for
             Astronomical Research (UVSTAR) payload designed to measure EUV
             fluxes which can be used to form images of extended plasma
             sources (ex. Jupiter, hot stars, etc.); (3) STAR-LITE payload
             which will make observations of extended and diffused
             astrophysical targets; (4) CONCAP-IV payload designed to grow
             thin films via physical vapor transport; (5) Petite Amateur Navy
             Satellite (PANSAT) payload which is managed by the Department of
             Defense Space Test Program and involves a small deployable
             satellite that will store and transmit digital communications to
             PANSAT ground stations; and (6) a Get-Away Special (GAS) payload
             which is still TBD.

             Since the aging process and a space flight experience share a
             number of similar physiological responses, a series of
             experiments sponsored by NASA and the National Institute on
             Aging will be conducted during the STS-95 mission. The
             investigations will gather information which may provide a model
             system to help scientists interested in understanding aging.
             Some of these similarities include bone and muscle loss, balance
             disorders and sleep disturbances.

   Launch:

             October 29, 1998 2:20:19 p.m. EST Launch Window 2 hours 30
             minutes

             On Thursday, 10/29/98, the countdown continues on schedule. The
             crew was woken up at 8:30am EST and served breakfast. After
             breakfast, the crew received a 15 minute weather briefing,
             suited up and departed the Operations and Checkout Building for
             Launch Pad LC-39B at 10:45am EST. After arriving at the pad, the
             crew proceeded to the 195ft level where one by one, they
             ingressed into the orbiter. The hatch was closed at 12:30pm EST,
             just as President Clinton's Air Force One plane touched down at
             the landing strip on Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS). The
             countdown proceded to the T-9 minute mark but was kept an
             additional 8.5 min at thee T-9 minute hold while the launch team
             discussed the status of a master alarm heard during cabin leak
             checks after hatch closure. At 2:00pm EST, the launch team was
             polled and Discovery was given a "go" to proceed past the
             T-minus 9 minute mark. At 2:03pm the Orbiter Access Arm was
             retracted but the Range Safety Officer (SR0) requested a hold at
             the T-minus 5 minute mark due to an aircraft in the no fly zone.
             At 2:14pm EST, SRO gave the all clear signal and the countdown
             proceeded. At 2:14pm EST, a go was given for auto sequence start
             and launch occured at 14:20:19 pm EST.

             On Wednesday, 10/28/98, Preparations for Thursday's 2 p.m.
             launch of Shuttle Discovery continue on schedule and launch
             managers are not working any major technical issues at this
             time. This morning workers completed efforts to install the
             SPACEHAB experiments in the orbiter payload bay and the airlock
             has been closed for flight. Discovery's communication systems
             will be activated today and flight crew equipment late stow
             activities begin at about 3:30 p.m. The Rotating Service
             Structure will retract away from the Shuttle at 8 p.m. today and
             the launch countdown will resume counting at T-11 hours at 11:40
             p.m. External tank loading operations begin at about 5:40 a.m.
             tomorrow. Air Force weather forecasters continue to indicate a
             zero percent chance that weather could prohibit launch on
             Thursday. The forecast calls for few clouds at 4,000 feet;
             visibility at 7 miles; winds at 10 knots gusting to 15 knots
             from the northeast; temperature at 79 degrees F; relative
             humidity at 64 percent. Hurricane Mitch is still drifting
             westward away from Florida's coast and will not impact
             Thursday's launch attempt. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             10/28/1998)

             On Tuesday, 10/27/98, The launch countdown for STS-95 proceeds
             on schedule for Thursday's 2 p.m. liftoff of Shuttle Discovery.
             Mission managers are not working any significant technical
             concerns at this time and launch preparations continue at Launch
             Pad 39B. At 4 a.m. workers began loading the orbiter's power
             reactant storage and distribution system with cryogenic
             reactants and that operation concluded at about noon. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 10/27/1998)

             On Monday, 10/26/98, the launch countdown for mission STS-95
             began on time today at 8 a.m. Launch managers are not working
             any significant technical issues at this time and preparations
             for Thursday's 2 p.m. launch continue on schedule. Final vehicle
             close-outs are in work and Discovery's backup flight systems
             will be loaded into the orbiter's general purpose computer
             today. Tonight the orbiter's navigational systems will be
             activated. Loading of the power reactant storage and
             distribution system (PRSD) with cryogenic reactants begins
             tomorrow morning. Air Force weather forecasters are indicating a
             40 percent chance that weather could prohibit launch on
             Thursday. The forecast calls for scattered to broken clouds at
             4000 feet and scattered clouds at 20000 feet; visibility at 7
             miles; winds at 16 knots gusting to 23 knots from the northeast;
             temperature at 79 degrees F; relative humidity at 62 percent.
             The primary concerns are low level winds, a slight chance of
             showers and a low cloud ceiling.

             Currently, the 24-hour and 48-hour scrub turnaround forecast
             indicates a 40 percent chance of weather violation. Managers
             continue to monitor the progress of Hurricane Mitch in the
             Caribbean, currently moving in a west-northwesterly direction
             away from Florida's east coast. Mitch is not expected to affect
             Thursday The STS-95 flight crew arrived at the Shuttle Landing
             Facility at 3:30pm. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/26/1998)

             On Sunday, 10/25/98, preparations to begin the STS-95 launch
             countdown continued on schedule. Yesterday, workers began
             stowing the flight crew's equipment onboard Discovery.
             Forecasters are monitoring the progress of Hurricane Mitch in
             the Caribbean, but preliminary weather forecasts indicate
             generally favorable conditions for Thursday's launch of Shuttle
             Discovery. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/25/1998)

             On Saturday, 10/24/98, Final preparations to begin the STS-95
             launch countdown are on schedule. At the launch pad yesterday,
             workers successfully completed torque verifications in the
             external airlock. Payload bay closeouts are complete and the
             payload bay doors are closed for flight. Flight crew equipment
             stowage is in work today. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status

             On Tuesday, 10/13/98, HOST end-to-end testing was in work and on
             Monday workers completed the HOST payload Interface Verification
             Test (IVT). Discovery's midbody umbilical connections were made
             10/12/98 and leak checks are complete. Technicians have also
             removed a faulty mass memory unit (MMU) and replacement of MMU
             No. 2 is slated for Thursday. During Tuesday evening, workers
             installed the astronaut contingency space suits into the
             orbiter. Payload closeout activities are scheduled through the
             remainder of the week. Shuttle managers have gathered at KSC
             today for the STS-95 Flight Readiness Review and announced Oct.
             29 as the official launch date for Shuttle Discovery. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 10/13/1998)

             On Friday, 10/9/98, the KSC test team and the STS-95 flight crew
             successfully completed the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test
             at about 11 a.m. The launch day dress rehearsal culminated with
             a simulated Shuttle main engine cutoff at T-3 seconds on the
             countdown clock. TCDT allows the launch team and crew to
             practice launch day activities and to validate emergency egress
             procedures. Afterwards, the crew returned to their homes in
             Houston, TX and will complete their mission training at Johnson
             Space Center. Preparations to replace Discovery's mass memory
             unit No. 2 were under way. At pad 39B, the Rotating Service
             Structure will be retracted for Saturday's KSC Open House and
             extended in place around the Shuttle immediately following the
             event. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/09/1998)

             the SPACEHAB IVT was completed and the orbiter's payload bay
             doors were closed. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/05/1998)

             Over the weekend, workers performed weight and center of gravity
             tests on Space Shuttle Discovery before lowering it onto the
             orbiter transfer vehicle. At about 10 a.m. Monday, September 14,
             1998 Discovery rolled out of KSC's Orbiter Processing Facility
             (OPF) bay 2. The orbiter arrived in the Vehicle Assembly
             Building (VAB) a short while later and was lifted from the
             orbiter transfer vehicle at about 4:30 p.m. Discovery will be
             soft mated to the external fuel tank (ET) at about 6 a.m.
             tomorrow. Hard mate connections will follow Tuesday and
             interface verification tests (IVT) will be conducted prior to
             next Monday's rollout to Launch Pad 39B. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 9/14/1998)

             On Thursday, September 10, 1998, technicians completed checks of
             Discovery's Ku-band antenna system and final stowage.
             Pressurization of the landing gear tires for flight is also
             complete. Checkout of the robot arm concluded earlier this week
             and orbiter midbody close-outs continue on schedule.
             Preparations were under way for Friday night's payload bay door
             closure. Workers conducted aft compartment structural leak
             checks and completed forward compartment close-outs. Saturday,
             Discovery's weight and center of gravity determination tests are
             scheduled and Sunday the vehicle will be placed on the orbiter
             transfer vehicle for Monday's rollover to the Vehicle Assembly
             Building. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/10/1998)

             On Monday, August 31, 1998, Installation of the integrated
             vehicle health monitoring (IVHM) system brackets are complete
             and IVHM sensor installation is nearing completion. Today,
             technicians are conducting orbiter integrated hydraulic testing
             and preparing for tunnel adapter installation slated to occur
             later today. Closeouts of the orbiter's midbody compartment
             continue in preparation for Wednesday's Crew Equipment Interface
             Test. Testing of the Ku-band antenna continues. In high bay 1 of
             the Vehicle Assembly Building, external tank and solid rocket
             booster mating closeouts are ongoing. (Reference KSC Shuttle

             During the week of 8/17/98 - 8/21/98, Discovery's main engines
             were installed. On Saturday, KSC technicians began precautionary
             efforts to secure Discovery, Endeavour and Columbia in their
             respective OPF bays due to the threat of Hurricane Bonnie.
             Discovery's payload bay doors were closed and the orbiter was
             powered down. Managers will continue to monitor the hurricane's
             status and hope to resume processing later today. Once the
             decision to proceed is made, workers will power up the orbiter
             and launch processing system, open the payload doors and deploy
             the Ku band antenna. Also, main engine securing and pump torque
             checks are scheduled. Payload premate testing will follow
             payload bay door opening. Work delays due to hurricane
             preparedness efforts are not expected to impact any major
             Shuttle processing milestones. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status

             On Monday 7/27/98, Thruster replacement work on Discovery's
             right-hand orbital maneuvering system (OMS) pod and subsequent
             leak checks and X-rays were completed. Functional checks of
             Discovery's newly installed crew seats were also completed. Over
             the weekend, technicians removed the leaky fuel cell No. 3 water
             relief valve and today, installation of a replacement valve is
             scheduled. Discovery's forward reaction control system was
             delivered to the OPF for installation into the orbiter later
             this week. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/27/1998)

             On Monday, 7/6/98, Functional testing of Discovery's main
             propulsion system were in work. Last week, the power converter
             units that supported the STS-91 payloads were removed from
             Discovery's cargo bay. Preparations are under way to remove the
             Shuttle main engines later this week. Today, main engine heat
             shield removal is continuing. Postflight waste management system
             servicing is in progress. Installation of the integrated vehicle
             health monitoring system (IVHM) begins this week. The IVHM
             upgrade, already installed on Columbia, provides real-time
             Shuttle system monitoring capability to ground and flight
             controllers. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/06/1998)

             On Monday, 6/22/98, validation of Discovery's electrical power
             systems and payload removal efforts in OPF Bay 2 were complete.
             Preparations to drain the orbiter maneuvering system (OMS)
             reactant storage tanks are in work and OMS thruster replacement
             efforts are scheduled to begin this week. Leak checks of the
             flash evaporator system and post flight inspections of the
             Shuttle main engines are ongoing. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status

   Landing:

             November 7, 1998 KSC, 12:04pm EST. Shuttle Landing Facility
             (SLF) Runway 33. No Drag Chute deployed Just after landing,
             Astronaut John Glenn said "1 G and I feel fine". Main Gear
             Touchdown 8 days 21 hours 43 minutes 57 seconds, Nose Gear
             Touchdown 8 days 21 hours 44 minutes 7 seconds. Wheel Stop at 8
             days 21 hours 44 minutes 56 seconds.

             The payload bay doors were closed at 8:17 a.m. EST and the 4
             minute 40 second deorbit burn occured at 10:53 am. At 11:30a.m.
             EST, Discovery began its Entry interface while at 400,000ft and
             at a speed of Mach 25. At 11:34am EST, Discovery was at an
             altitude of approximately 65 miles and was 4,500 miles from the
             landing strip. At 11:42, Discovery was just under 1800 miles
             from KSC and dropping at 73 mph. At 11:53pm, Discovery was over
             the Gulf of Mexico traveling at Mach 7, 26 miles in altitude
             decending at 190 mph. At noon, the distinctive dual sonic booms
             were heard just as Discovery decended past the speed of sound
             650mph, 8 miles altitude. Touchdown at 12:04am EST.

             While Discovery took the 1st KSC landing opportunity, there were
             2 landing opportunities at KSC and two to Edwards Air Force
             Base, California . Discovery has a second chance to land at KSC
             at 1:45 p.m. EST or could have landed at Edwards at either 1:35
             p.m EST. or 3:17 p.m. EST. The astronauts will spend the night
             at KSC before returning to leaving KSC for Houston around 10am
             EST on Sunday to a welcome at Ellington Field.
