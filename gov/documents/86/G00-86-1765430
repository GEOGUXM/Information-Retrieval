                 Census 2000 Redistricting Data Map Products

                                    rule

   Three types of maps were prepared to accompany the Census 2000
   Redistricting Data:  County Block Maps (Census 2000), Voting
   District/State Legislative District Outline Maps (Census 2000), and
   Census Tract Outline Maps (Census 2000).

   Redistricting Data Map Products will not be available for:  American
   Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands
   (Midway) and the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, Census 2000 Block and
   Census 2000 Census Tract Outline maps will be available at a later date
   for these areas.

   The letters PDF or symbol PDF indicate a document is in the Portable
   Document Format (PDF). To view file you will need the Adobe(R)
   Acrobat(R) Reader which is available for free from the Adobe web site.
     The maps were created as 33" x 36" sheets, however, the Adobe Reader
   allows one to pan and zoom within the image on your computer screen.

   These PDF maps are arranged in sub-directories by map type. Within each
   map type sub-directory, the map files are stored in county
   sub-directories within the appropriate state sub-directory. Within each
   county folder there will be an index sheet file to help the user
   identify individual maps. Map Sheet Corner Point Coordinate files are
   geo-referenced listings of individual map sheets.

    P.L. 94-171 COUNTY BLOCK MAPS (CENSUS 2000)  PDF

     * For each county or statistically equivalent entity, the Census
       Bureau's block maps show the greatest detail and most complete set
       of geographic information. These large scale maps depict the
       smallest geographic entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau
       presents data - the census block - by displaying the features that
       form block boundaries and the numbers that identify them. The
       intent of this map series is to produce a map for each county, on
       the smallest possible number of map sheets, at the maximum
       practical scale. The maps show the boundaries, names and codes for
       American Indian areas/Alaska Native areas/Hawaiian home lands,
       county sub-divisions, places, voting districts, census tracts,
       block groups, and census blocks.

   FINDING THE MAPS YOU NEED:

   The map access system described below is a basic no-frills approach.
       However, we decided to speed up the process of getting the maps
       on-line rather than delay their release until we had the resources
       to design a more appropriate system. A more user-friendly system
       may be developed at a later date.
       Go to the appropriate county subdirectory and download or view
       on-line the county index map. The county index map (see a sample)
       will show the county boundaries and the boundaries of any places
       within the county. It also will have an overlay of a grid of
       squares. Each square represents the area covered by one of the maps
       for that county. Using this grid, you can determine which map or
       maps cover the area of interest. At the center of each grid square
       you will find a map sheet number. This number is also a part of the
       file name for the PDF file of the map(s). It is in the last three
       positions before ".pdf". For example - pb25001_004.pdf is sheet
       number 4, shown in grid number 4 for Barnstable county,
       Massachusetts. With this information you can download or view the
       appropriate maps(s).
       NOTE:  There may be instances in which the entire county is shown
       on a single County Block Map. For these counties, a single map file
       will appear in the appropriate county sub-directory. Download or
       view the map on-line. If there is more than one map file in the
       appropriate sub-directory, download or view the county index map
       on-line. A county sub-directory also may also have a parent sheet
       and one or more inset maps. In this case, there is no index sheet.
       Download or view the parent sheet to identify the inset maps.

   File naming convention:

   State - stSS_statename (e.g. st25_massachusetts);

   County - cSSCCC_countyname (e.g. st25001_barnstable);

   Sheet/File - pbSSCCC_####.pdf (e.g. pb25001_004.pdf).

    P.L. 94-171 VOTING DISTRICT/STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT OUTLINE MAPS (CENSUS
    2000)  PDF

     * For each county or statistically equivalent entity, these
       county-based maps show the boundaries and codes for Voting
       Districts and/or State Legislative Districts as delineated by the
       participating states in Phase 2, Voting District Project, of the
       Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program; the features underlying
       these boundaries; and the names of these features. These maps also
       show the boundaries and names of American Indian areas/Alaska
       Native areas/Hawaiian home lands, counties, county sub-divisions,
       and places. The maps will be available only for those states and
       counties that participated in the Voting District Project. Some
       states did not participate in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data
       Program and there are no Voting District/State Legislative District
       maps for these states.
