                        Visualization Lab @ LBNL, NERSC
     __________________________________________________________________

   A variety of computer graphics equipment is available in the
   Visualization Lab located in 50B/1232: Visualization/VR Hardware and
   Color Printers. This equipment is available for general use by the
   Laboratory community. Most of this equipment is available for use if
   you have a valid UNIX account on the ICSD machines. The UNIX
   workstations are available for users with visualization applications.
   You need to contact Nancy Johnston or Wes Bethel for accessing them.

Visualization/VR Hardware

          [greenball.gif] judgedee.lbl.gov: Silicon Graphics Onyx with
          Infinite Reality graphics. There are 4 200MHz R4400 processors
          with 256 MB memory. Judgedee is running IRIX Release 6.5. The
          system has both C-language and Fortran compilers. Available
          applications include AVS, Khoros.

          [wall.small.jpg]
          The Wall: Using "judgedee", you have access to a 6x8 foot screen
          with rear view projector capable of producing stereographics
          output.

          [3dmouse.small.jpg]
          3D mouse: Connected to "judgedee" is a 3D mouse from Division,
          Inc. The 3D mouse has 6 degrees of freedom (position and
          orientation) and provides a very easy way of moving around and
          controlling 3D objects.
          [haptic.small.jpg]
          Haptic display: A PHANToM point-force haptic device is connected
          to an SGI Indigo. From a high-level point-of-view, the haptic
          device is used in a two-fold manner. First, the PHANToM acts as
          an input device, providing positional information. The position
          of the tip of the "stylus" in three-space can be obtained by
          querying the encoders. Second, the PHANToM acts as a output
          device by giving the user force-feedback in three dimensions.
          The feedback is a variable resisting force which can be used to
          understand or feel various surface types (e.g., smooth, rough),
          to understand viscosity or flow, carve a surface, etc.

          [greenball.gif] Tracy: A Silicon Indigo 2 with Solid Impact
          Graphics and 64MB memory controls the haptic device. Tracy also
          has a video capture board and camera for mbone access.

          [immersa.small.jpg]
          Immersadesk: The Immersadesk from Pyramid Systems is a
          drafting-table style, projection-based virtual reality tool.
          Users, wearing special glasses, view a large screen (4 feet by 5
          feet) on which high-resolution images are displayed. Audio and a
          3D input device add to the sense of immersion.

Color Printers

          These printers, with the exception of the Codonics, take
          PostScript only. Printers are located in 50B, room 1232. See
          cost breakdown.

          [greenball.gif] Tektronix Phaser IIsdx: dye sublimation, 300
          dpi, paper & transparencies, no AppleTalk access, access via
          Unix or VMS with lpr -Psd1

          [greenball.gif] Tektronix Phaser 340: hot crayon, 300 dpi, paper
          & transparencies, AppleTalk name 50B-1232-Tek_Phaser340_tp340 in
          icsd-50B zone, access via Unix or VMS with lpr -Ptp340

          [greenball.gif] Codonics NP-1600: dye sublimation,300 dpi,
          24-bit, continuous-tone, true color, paper & transparencies, no
          AppleTalk access, access via Unix or VMS with cpr.

Remote Visualization Server (Escher.nersc.gov)

          The  NERSC Visualization Server allows NERSC users to perform
          visualizations from  remote locations. The Visualization Server,
          escher.nersc.gov, is a Silicon Graphics Onyx 2 with 8 195 MHz
          R10000 processors,  5 GB Memory, 2  Infinite Reality Engine
          Graphics Pipes, ATM, HIPPI, 100BT Network Connectivity, and 100
          GB Disk Array. Its dual graphics pipes allow for two
          simultaneous graphics displays to be driven by the system for a
          minimum of two simultaneous video streams.

          The NERSC Visualization Server is also a platform that will
          allow the Visualization Group to explore and develop new
          techniques in remote visualization, large data visualization and
          collaboration. It is connected to a high speed network testbed
          and the Visualization Group's ImmersaDesk.
