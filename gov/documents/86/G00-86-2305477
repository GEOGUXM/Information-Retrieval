   ANSWER Solutions Edu

        customized IT procurement courses designed with a focus on
                         GSA FTS contract offerings

   Solutions Edu is a nationwide innovative educational paradigm designed
   to bring acquisition training to FTS professionals, clients, and
   industry partners through customized courses constructed around FTS
   contract offerings. Rooted as a joint initiative among the FTS SDCs,
   the ANSWER SDC provides the strategic leadership for Solutions Edu. The
   salient characteristics of Solutions Edu are:

     * NEED: Solutions Edu provides custom-built FTS acquisition courses
     * TIMING: Solutions Edu provides responsive, "just in time" training
     * GEOGRAPHY: Solutions Edu is fully mobile and is positioned to
       provide training nationwide.

   Solutions Edu provides unique training benefits to FTS in the form of
   first-ever customized, custom-built acquisition training courses.
   Heretofore, acquisition classes have focused on esoteric clauses and
   examples fully unrelated to FTS interests. Solutions Edu changed that
   by bringing a focus to FTS contracts and FTS solutions. Course
   relevancy is of the utmost importance to Solutions Edu and it is
   created and sustained by using FTS contracts as the foundation of class
   lectures, discussions, and workshops. In addition to the academic
   element, Solutions Edu brings unique opportunities for providing FTS
   solutions in the form of networking. Since the classes include students
   from FTS, its clients, and its industry partners, a physical element of
   interchange and interaction is created. More interestingly, however, is
   that these current and potential business partners are brought together
   to learn about acquisition in the context of FTS contract offerings.
   What better way is there to share a contract offering than in a venue
   that is fully focused on the contract?

                        what the students are saying

   "The mix of ITMs, COs, Contractors and clients was excellent."

   "Thanks!!! Great course and outstanding instructor. I hope all ITMs,
   and other contracting personnel, including Managers around the Region,
   and the country for that matter, take this course."

   "The instructor had a wealth of knowledge. Excellent useful information
   was obtained from the course."

   "Instructor excelled in meeting the audience on a collective and
   individual basis-according to their needs. Very motivational!!!"

   "In my opinion, this class was one of the best classes I have had to
   date because the instructor was knowledgeable, flexible and willing to
   get into controversial discussions."

   "Most productive and enjoyable class I've been in."

   "I definitely came away from this class with a better understanding of
   the requirements needed to review, assess, and hopefully determine my
   customers needs, based on the information provided."
