   aeroCOMPASS Version 1.4 now in operation
   Release 1.4 of aeroCOMPASS was put into production on December 4,
   2001.  Several notable changes have been made to the server-side
   applications for this release, and are listed below.  The next major
   release of aeroCOMPASS is tentatively scheduled for March 2002, and
   will probably be designated version 2.0.  Additional minor releases may
   be made in the interim, as need is indicated by the aeroCOMPASS user
   community.

   Upgrades included in aeroCOMPASS version 1.4 (released for production
   December 2001):
   Change to aeroCOMPASS main application:
      - Hostname of the current server is now displayed in the aeroCOMPASS
   page banner

   Changes to DMS in version 1.4:
      - Notes in the Interactive Notes utility can now be browsed by their
   creation date
      - A new access level, Administrator, has been added to allow site
   owners to grant other users the ability to modify folder access lists
      - Site owners and administrators can now allow access to any group
   in which they are members, instead of only the groups that they own

   Changes to Test Planning in version 1.4:
      - The LaRC Exit Questionnaire for Wind Tunnel Testing has been
   automated and included as part of the Test site.
      - Several supervisor groups have been added to the system to allow
   supervisory personnel to have read-only access to any test sites which
   are under their specific areas (for example, Facility Managers can now
   view all test sites for tests run in their particular facility).

   Upgrades included in aeroCOMPASS version 1.3 (released for production
   November 2001):
   Significant changes to server-side applications included in version
   1.3:
       - New DMS Site Search
       - New Interactive Notes utility
       - Improved user interface
           - Document-type-specific icons (i.e., Word icon, Adobe icon,
   etc.) replace generic icons used in previous versions
           - File size indication
           - 508 compliance
       - tighter coupling with WTTDMAS
       - various internal updates to database, security, minor cosmetic
   changes, and operational logic

   Significant changes to client-side Test Execution Management System
   (TEMS) included in version 1.3:
       - Integration of TEMS and MIDAS
       - Options to automate printing and file transfers when generating
   RUN sheets
       - Integration of TEMS, DAS, and WTTDMAS, to provide automated
   metadata for wind-tunnel data archived in WTTDMAS to improve search
   capabilities of all reduced data.
       - Removal of TPMS interface

   TPMS Test Plan Data ported to aeroCOMPASS
   In preparation for the release of aeroCOMPASS 1.3, a request was sent
   to all users who owned test plans which still existed in the old Test
   Plan Management System (TPMS) database.  These users were asked to
   identify any TPMS test plans which contained data that was still
   current or to which they still needed access.  All tests which were so
   identified by the former TPMS users were ported to the aeroCOMPASS
   database.  Updates can now be performed using DMS.  This task was
   completed in September 2001.

   aeroCOMPASS Team Receives Space Act Award
   In August 2001, the aeroCOMPASS team received a Space Act Award for
   "the creative development of a technological contribution which has
   been determined to be of significant value in the advancement of the
   space and aeronautical activities of NASA".  The team is honored to
   have received this award, and is committed to continuing in the
   development and enhancement of tools which further advance NASA's
   mission.

   History.
