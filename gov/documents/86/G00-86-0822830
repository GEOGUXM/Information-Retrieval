                             LTC Berdan's VISION

   I envision the premier directorate within the Military Department,
   establishing the ideal in state personnel leadership for others to
   follow, focusing on quality, recognizing achievement, remaining open to
   innovation, and insisting on accountability.

                                   MISSION

   To develop and administer state personnel practices that recruit, hire,
   train, develop, and retain a diverse and qualified work force that is
   consistent with state and federal  laws and consistent with the unique
   of operating in a military environment.

                                 PHILOSOPHY

   Accomplish the mission of the State Military Department by hiring,
   training and retaining those skilled and capable individuals, without
   bias and based on merit, who are essential to providing cost effective,
   quality service to State Active Duty and State Civil Service personnel;
   to provide services in an efficient and courteous manner; and to insure
   that the state employees of the Military Department work in an
   environment where they are encouraged to strive for excellence, and
   recognized when they achieve it.

                                   VALUES

   Integrity - Make no promise or commitment I cannot reasonably expect to
   fulfill, and to maintain appropriate social, ethical and organizational
   norms in job related activities.

   Ethics - Maintain the highest standards of professional behavior and to
   comply with the laws, regulations, and policies under which we operate.

   Respect - Respect the diversity of employees, provide fair and
   equitable treatment in all areas of employment, encourage personal and
   professional growth, and foster the personal well being and dignity of
   each employee.

   Accountability - Take responsibility for personal actions and the
   directorate's performance.

                                    MOTTO

   Mission driven and employee centered.
