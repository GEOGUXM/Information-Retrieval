   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

      FAA is actively searching for well-qualified Americans for exciting
      international assignments with the International Civil Aviation
      Organization (ICAO).

      ICAO is a United Nations (UN) organization that is dedicated to
      increasing the safety and security of international civil aviation. The
      organization addresses fundamental issues ranging from air navigation
      and capacity to emerging environmental concerns such as engine noise
      and emissions.

      ICAO positions are primarily located in Montreal, Canada, a vibrant
      city that offers a wide variety of cultural and recreational
      activities, including jazz, opera, ballet, film festivals, skiing, and
      auto racing. Job attractions include the diverse working environment, 6
      weeks of annual leave, exemption from U.S. and Canadian taxes, and
      reimbursement of educational expenses for dependent children. A
      recruitment incentive allowance was recently approved to ensure that
      FAA employees who return to employment in the agency are equitably
      compensated for years of service with ICAO.

      A skills bank has been developed through which applicants can submit
      job profiles based on years spent in a variety of occupation
      categories. When an ICAO vacancy announcement opens, the skills bank is
      queried for candidates whose expertise matches the job requirements.
      The candidates are notified of the announcement and encouraged to
      submit an application through the Office of Policy, Planning, &
      International Aviation (API).

      Salaries, benefits, and allowances under the UN personnel system are
      similar to those offered to employees who transfer to FAA overseas
      positions. When reviewing ICAO job announcements, note that the salary
      is quoted as net pay free of tax.

      Contact us for information about ICAO vacancies or the UN personnel
      system.
