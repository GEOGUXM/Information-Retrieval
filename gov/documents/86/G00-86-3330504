      USGS ROLLA MAPPING CENTER RECEIVES VICE PRESIDENT'S HAMMER AWARD

   The 350 employees of the U.S. Geological Survey's Mid-Continent Mapping
   Center, U.S. Department of the Interior, received Vice President Al
   Gore's Hammer Award in Rolla on September 4. The Mid-Continent Mapping
   Center employees were honored for their team-based approach to
   streamlining operations and making them more responsive to customers.

   The Hammer Award is Vice President Al Gore's special recognition for
   contributions in support of the President's National Performance Review
   Principles. Those principles are: putting customers first, cutting red
   tape, empowering employees, and getting back to basics.

   The actual award consists of certificates signed by Gore and a $6
   hammer with red ribbon, which is the Vice President's answer to the
   $600 hammer of yesterday's government. The award recognizes new
   standards of excellence achieved by teams helping to reinvent
   government. More than 350 Hammer Awards have been presented to teams
   comprised of federal, state and local employees, and citizens who are
   working to build a better government. The Mid-Continent Mapping Center
   employees were presented the award by USGS Director Gordon Eaton at a
   ceremony that also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the agency's
   presence in Rolla, Mo.

   Eaton recognized the Mapping Center employees for the "fundamental
   changes" in their "approach to taking care of business, whether it is
   revising a map, completing a travel voucher, filling a customer order,
   exploring a new process, or typing a letter."

   The center's reinvention efforts, which took place over four years,
   focused on empowerment of employees, elimination of red tape and
   streamlining of procedures, and being more responsive to customer
   needs. Process teams were created to examine all facets of center
   operations and arrive at recommendations for improvement.

   A product resulting from the center's activities was previously awarded
   the Department of the Interior's Unit Award for Excellence of Service.
   The Digital Raster Graphic (DRG), a new national product, is a digital
   map image that can be readily displayed on various computer systems and
   used for many different purposes. The Unit Award citation cited
   aggressive customer involvement in the design and prototype stages of
   development, as well as the speed with which the DRG was brought to
   market.

   "It is this kind of effort that will ensure that we achieve our vision
   of being an earth science organization that is recognized worldwide as
   scientifically credible, objective, and demonstrably relevant to
   society's needs," Eaton said.

   The Mid-Continent Mapping Center in Rolla, Mo., is a major field
   production facility in the National Mapping Division of the U.S.
   Geological Survey. With approximately 350 employees, this Center
   produces paper and digital maps. An Earth Science Information Center
   (ESIC), where walk-in and phone orders for USGS products are processed,
   is also part of the Mapping Center.

   The U.S. Geological Survey is the federal government's largest civilian
   mapping agency and largest water resources science and information
   agency. It is dedicated to providing the nation with reliable,
   impartial information to describe and understand the Earth. This
   information is used to minimize the loss of life and property from
   natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral
   resources; enhance and protect the quality of life; and contribute to
   wise economic and physical development.
