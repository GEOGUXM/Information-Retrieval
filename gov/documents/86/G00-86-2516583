             Synopsis of Section 508 Accessibility Requirements:

      Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure,
    maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), Federal
      employees with disabilities have comparable access to and use of
     information and data as Federal employees who have no disabilities,
   unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also
     requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the
     public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have
     comparable access to and use of information and data as the public
    without disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the
                                   agency.

   Although Federal agencies have an explicit statutory obligation to make
   all EIT that they develop, maintain or use compliant with Section 508,
       the current emphasis is on newly procured EIT because it is the
    category that is explicitly enforceable by legal action. Procurement
   awards made on or after June 25, 2001, are subject to Section 508 (see
                              FAR Final Rule).

     According to the Access Board, the Section 508 requirements do not
    apply retroactively to pre-existing EIT. Specifically, the Electronic
        and Information Technology Accessibility Standards: Economic
   Assessment, states that "The standards are to be applied prospectively
   and do not require Federal agencies to retrofit existing electronic and
   information technology. As agencies upgrade and change their electronic
   and information technology, they must comply with the standards." (See
                        Chapter 2.1 Final Standards)

       It should be noted, however, that other Federal regulations and
   guidelines (e.g., Section501 and Section504 of the Rehabilitation Act)
     require equal access for individuals with disabilities. Therefore,
   Federal agencies are required, upon request, to provide information and
    data to individuals with disabilities through an alternative means of
                 access that can be used by the individuals.
