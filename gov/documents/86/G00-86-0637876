   Abuse of vulnerable adults (people who need help to care for
   themselves) can happen anytime, anywhere. As a responsible citizen, do
   your part to protect vulnerable adults.
   There are many signs that can indicate abuse or neglect. Below are just
   a few.

  Abuse

   (physical, mental, sexual, or emotional) is a deliberate action or lack
   of action that causes harm. Some signs include:
     * The adult reports being abused
     * The adult has unexplained injuries
     * The adult fears the caregiver
     * The caregiver refuses to allow visitors

  Abandonment

   is leaving the vulnerable adult without means of caring for self.
   Some signs include:
     * The adult is deserted in their home
     * The adult reports being abandoned

  Neglect

   is the failure to maintain the health and safety of the adult.
   Self-neglect is the person's own failure to maintain health and safety.
   Some signs include:
     * Sudden decline in physical appearance
     * Untreated injuries or health problems
     * Unsafe living conditions

  Exploitation

   occurs when someone takes advantage of a vulnerable adult.
   Exploitation may be financial or personal.
   Some signs include:
     * Disappearance of possessions or property
     * Sudden transfer of money; unexplained or unusual use of bankcards.
