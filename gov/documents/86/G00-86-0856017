                        Grantee Contract Negotiations
     Grantee contract negotiations will commence soon. Your proposal has
    been assigned to a GO SERV staff representative who will call you to
      discuss your program design and program budget. Because this is a
   time-intensive process, it may be a few days before your collaboration
   is called. If you have any questions in the interim, please contact the
      Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning Programs Coordinator by
                 sending an email to ccdhelp@goserv.ca.gov.
