   Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke (posted 8/17/01)
   _____________________________________________________

   Illness:
   With several deaths profiled in the news recently, heat-related
   emergencies such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke are receiving
   increased attention. When exercising or working in a hot environment
   the body attempts to cool itself of excess heat by sweating and
   dilating the skin's blood vessels. Dilation of the blood vessels brings
   blood to the skin surface and increases the rate of radiation of heat
   from the body. When these mechanisms are overwhelmed and the body is no
   longer able to tolerate the excessive heat, heat exhaustion will
   result. If this condition is not corrected, heat exhaustion can quickly
   develop into life threatening heat stroke. The conditions are
   principally brought on by climate, i.e., heat and humidity, and
   dehydration. With proper precautionary measures and self-awareness, it
   is possible to prevent heat related illnesses

   Signs and Symptoms:
   Heat exhaustion typically occurs while exercising or working in hot
   weather without sufficient fluid intake. It results when the body
   cannot produce enough perspiration to cool itself. Heat exhaustion
   usually produces heat cramps, which are painful muscle spasms that
   result from an electrolyte imbalance and dehydration.
   Heat Stroke is the most serious of heat related illnesses and requires
   emergency treatment. Heat stroke occurs when the body is exposed to
   very hot conditions for a prolonged period and the body's normal
   cooling mechanisms become overloaded and stop functioning. Once this
   happens the body's core temperature can quickly rise to dangerous
   life-threatening levels. Just because one stops perspiring does not
   mean the danger is over, immediate cooling is necessary. The skin is
   usually hot, dry, and flushed. However, in the early signs of heat
   stroke, the body may still be sweating and the skin may be moist or
   wet. Left untreated heat stroke can result in death.
   The following are general signs and symptoms associated with
   heat-related illnesses:
   Muscle cramps
       Weakness or exhaustion
       Dizziness or faintness
       Altered level of consciousness; seizures
       Unresponsiveness
       Rapid heart rate
       Moist, pale skin that is normal to cool
       Hot, dry or moist skin

   Suseptibility:
   People who are at the greatest risk for heat related illnesses include
   not only the elderly and children, who may exhibit poor
   thermoregulation, but anyone who is not acclimated to hot, humid
   weather and who overexert themselves ignoring signs and symptoms of
   early heat illness. Newborns and infants are especially susceptible to
   heat illness due to their reduced ability to compensate for temperature
   extremes and regulate body temperature.
   Certain medical conditions such as heart disease, chronic obstructive
   heart disease (COPD), diabetes, dehydration and/or obesity are
   predisposing factors for developing heat-related illness. Physical
   fatigue and some infections causing fevers are also contributing
   factors for heat stress.
   Certain medications may also facilitate heat illness. As with all
   medications, potential side effects and susceptibilities should be
   discussed with your physician or pharmacist. Alcohol, especially in
   combination with some medications, can decrease ones ability to
   perspire thereby increasing one's predisposition to heat illness.

   Prevention/Recommendations:
     * Move the victim to a cooler environment
     * Sit or lie down and elevate the feet; loosen any tight fitting
       clothes and remove sweat soaked clothing
     * Place cool wet cloths on the torso and forehead and/or use a sponge
       bath
       Use a fan to increase airflow and cooling
     * Rehydrate, water works best
     * DO NOT use an alcohol rubdown to cool the victim down
     * DO NOT force the person to drink; NEVER give alcoholic or
       caffeinated drinks
     * A heat stroke victim may be unconscious, NEVER give anything by
       mouth to an unconscious individual.

   Whenever working in a hot environment be sure to drink plenty of water,
   do not wait until you feel thirsty to drink. If you can, set up a
   sprinkler system to assist overall body cooling. Dress appropriately.
   Light colored clothing that allows air to pass through works best. This
   may not be appropriate for all work environments so use your best
   judgment. Most importantly, stay aware of your environment and how you
   feel. Stop whatever you are doing and seek a cooler environment if you
   begin to experience the symptoms listed above. Remember to drink plenty
   of fluids before you begin work or exercise. Warm weather can be a fun
   time for everyone if we practice a little common sense and take the
   appropriate precautions.
