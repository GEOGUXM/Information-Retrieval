   The West Virginia-DOE Partnership is Now Official

   DOE's Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) and the State of West
   Virginia held the 5th Industries of the Future - West Virginia
   Symposium on December 5th - 6th, 2001 at the Charleston Town Center
   Marriott Hotel in Charleston, West Virginia. The symposium featured the
   signing of a "Memorandum of Understanding" (MOU) as well as keynote
   speakers, workshops, short courses, and breakout sessions. The
   symposium also provided participants the opportunity to discuss ways to
   develop scientific and operational steps to increase production, save
   energy, cut costs, and bolster market competitiveness.

   The Symposium opened with IOF-WV industry group reports given by the
   following:
     * Aluminum - Ric Love, Century Aluminum
     * Chemicals/Polymers - Rick Hodge, DuPont Chemicals
     * Glass - Berri Fox, Marble King
     * Metal Casting - Pat Minehardt, HK Castings
     * Mining - Scott Rotruck, Consol Energy
     * Steel - Tim Duke, Steel of West Virginia
     * Wood/Forest Products - Lori Hamer, Hamer Pellet Fuels
     * Cross Cutting Technologies - Jan Berkow, Applied Industrial
       Solutions, Inc.

   OITs Denise Swink, Governor Bob Wise, and State IOF Coordinator Carl
   Irwin participated in a ceremonial MOU signing at the West Virginia IOF
   Symposium.

   West Virginia State Senators Books McCabe and Vic Sprouse, and Governor
   Robert E. Wise all presented luncheon speeches addressing West
   Virginia's low energy costs and recruited business, environmental,
   labor, and education leaders to draft a 20-year state energy plan.
   Senator Sprouse said, "I look at Industries of the Future as being a
   role model that we can use in many other areas of the state. It is a
   model of academics, the public- and private-sector, in partnerships,
   all working and striving together to move our State forward in
   particular industries."

   West Virginia Governor Bob Wise and DOE's Deputy Assistant Secretary
   for Industrial Technologies Denise Swink, signed the MOU in a ceremony
   at the symposium. The MOU signifies an intent to expand cooperative
   efforts through the national IOF program on energy efficiency projects
   and new technologies for West Virginia's energy-intensive manufacturing
   companies. Governor Wise stated, "Industries of the Future is a vital
   part of economic development, because one of our main goals is the
   retention of business. It's easier to help retain a business that has
   been here for a number of years and help it expand, than it is to lure
   a new business to our state."

   "West Virginia was the first state to launch an IOF program," said Carl
   Irwin, West Virginia's IOF Director and West Virginia Director of
   Market Enhancement and Program Development at WVU's National Research
   Center for Coal and Energy. "After West Virginia became a State IOF, 25
   additional states then initiated and established their own IOF
   programs."
