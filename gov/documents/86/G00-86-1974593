   Docket Office, you must clearly identify your electronic statement by
   name, date, and subject, so that we can attach the materials to your

  Forum Questions: The forums will consider the three questions listed
below.

   Question 1: What is an ergonomics injury? the Department of Labor is
   interested in establishing an accepted definition that the Occupational
   Safety and Health Administration, employers and their employees can
   understand and apply.

   Question 2: How can the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
   employers and employees determine whether an ergonomics injury was
   caused by work-related activities or non-work-related activities; and,
   if the ergonomics injury was caused by a combination of the two, what
   is the appropriate response?

   Question 3: What are the most useful and cost-effective types of
   government involvement to address workplace ergonomics injuries (e.g.,
   rulemaking, guidelines, best practices, publications/conferences,
   technical assistance, consultations, partnerships or combinations of
   such approaches)? The agency particularly invites comment on the
   advantages and disadvantages of each approach or combination of
   approaches.
