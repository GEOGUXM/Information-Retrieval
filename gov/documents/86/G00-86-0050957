   Do you have a job-related problem?

   The National Labor Relations Board administers the National Labor
   Relations Act (NLRA) which oversees private sector labor relations,
   i.e., the relationship between employers, unions and employees, and the
   rights of employees to form, join or assist a labor organization and to
   bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing or
   to refrain from such activities. The NLRB's primary mission is:
     * Preventing and remedying unfair labor practices by employers or
       unions, and
     * Holding elections at which employees decide if they wish to be
       represented by unions.

   more information.

   If the NLRB does not appear to have jurisdiction over your issue,
   perhaps another agency does. Click the topic(s) below closest to the
   type of issue of concern to you and we will try to steer you in the
   right direction.
