                             Tax and Loss Bonds

   United States Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Company Tax and Loss Bonds,
   commonly referred to as Tax and Loss Bonds, are purchased by companies
   involved in mortgage guaranty insurance, lease guarantee insurance, and
   insurance of state and local obligations against loss on their loans.
   State insurance commissions may require the insurance companies to
   create a contingency loss reserve for use when losses exceed a specific
   percentage of premiums. A federal tax deduction is allowed on the funds
   put into this reserve if the company purchases Tax and Loss Bonds in
   the amount of the tax benefit and in accordance with applicable laws.

   Tax and Loss Bonds are non-interest bearing book-entry securities that
   mature 10 or 20 years from the designated issue date. The bonds are
   issued in a minimum amount of $1,000 or in any larger amount, in
   increments of not less than $1.00.

   Subscribers may purchase Tax and Loss Bonds by sending an application
   form, PD F 3871 to:
