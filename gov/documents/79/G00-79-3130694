      A copier program, not just a copier

      Need copiers? Want the best quality, most reliable machines available?
      Want them QUICKLY at the lowest possible price? FAST makes acquiring
      copiers easy and affordable. Our copier management team carefully
      assesses your needs - copy volume, types of copy jobs, and personnel -
      and then prepares and submits a Copier Proposal based on your specific
      requirements. Our team then negotiates the best price from a pool of
      leading copier manufacturers and service providers.

      Delivery, installation and operator training as well as maintenance and
      repair are included in your price. Toners and consumable supplies,
      excluding paper, are provided free of charge. Additional programs are
      available for flat rate pricing, purchase, and lease-to-purchase
      (LTOP).

      [q-02.jpg] Leading technology from leading manufacturers
      With FAST's Copier Management Services you get the equipment you need
      from the worlds' most respected manufacturers. And you get it at an
      incredibly low, competitive price - a price that our Copier Management
      Services team negotiates for you with your requirements and budget in
      mind. From 1,500 copies to more than 1,000,000 copies per month, from
      Volume Bands I through X; FAST has a copier program that's right for
      your unique document duplication requirements.

      Alternate technology
      FAST can also procure for your agency an array of copiers, printers,
      and systems that include such technologies as network connectivity,
      digital input, print-on-demand, and color imaging.

      All supplies included in our price, excluding paper
      Your price covers the costs of supplies, including staples, toner,
      everything, except paper. It also includes the delivery of those
      supplies to one or more of your copier locations.

      Superior service, delivery and installation
      If one of our copiers malfunctions or needs servicing, FAST will get a
      technician on site within 6 hours. We will relocate each of your
      copiers once per fiscal year - at no charge. And FAST will arrange
      delivery, installation and training. It is all included in your single
      cost-per copy price.

      A simple Interagency Agreement or Task Order is all it takes to get
      your copiers within 30 days!
      With FAST, you can say farewell to the costly competitive bidding
      process, the red tape, and the endless waiting. We will assess your
      needs, negotiate a competitive price on your behalf, manage your
      contract, and get you the equipment and supplies you need on site
      quickly.
