   About the California Department of Corporations

   The Department of Corporations is California's Investment and Financing
   Authority, and has exclusive authority to bring both civil and
   administrative actions under the laws subject to the jurisdiction of
   the California Corporations Commissioner.

   We license and regulate a variety of businesses that affect the lives
   of Californians and represent a significant part of the state's
   economy, including securities brokers and dealers, investment advisers
   and financial planners, and certain fiduciaries and lenders. We also
   regulate the offer and sales of securities, franchises and off-exchange
   commodities.

   The Department reports to the Business, Transportation and Housing
   Agency and the Governor. We are the last line of defense for many of
   the most significant financial transactions that Californians make,
   from mortgages to retirement plans.

   mortgage bankers to make nearly $3.5 million in refunds to consumers.

   1999. The Department also regulates the mortgage banking market that

   that assisted Californians in the purchase of a home.

   Under Governor Davis, the Department has brought more than 1,200

   making misrepresentations, and pursuing predatory practices.

   The Mission of the California Department of Corporations

   The California Department of Corporations has a three-part mission:

    1. To rigorously enforce the laws of the state, ensuring that all of
       California's financial services consumers enter the marketplace
       with confidence,
    2. To open the door to financial security for all Californians by
       educating vulnerable populations about the risks and rewards of
       investing, and
    3. To provide businesses with a financial services marketplace that is
       transparent, cost-effective and efficient.
