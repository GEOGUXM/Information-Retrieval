                            Do-It-Yourself Investing!

            Buying and managing Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in a
     TreasuryDirect account is as simple as clicking a mouse or punching the
                         buttons on a touch-tone phone.

      With TreasuryDirect Electronic Services, you call the shots from the
                          privacy and comfort of home.

      If you're an established TreasuryDirect customer, here's what you can
        do by 1) visiting our virtual lobby, or 2) calling 800-722-2678,
        choosing Option No. 1 for TreasuryDirect Electronic Services, and
                             following the prompts:

   Buy Direct® (8 a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday)

   To buy Treasury bills, notes, and bonds through this security-protected
   service, you will need to enter your TreasuryDirect account number and
   Taxpayer Identification Number. (Cash management bills and 4-week bills
   cannot be purchased in TreasuryDirect.)

   Request a Statement of Account (8 a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday
   through Friday)

   You'll need your TreasuryDirect account number. Typically, we print
   statements at the end of each week and mail them the following week; in
   this scenario, the balance on your statement is accurate as of the
   close of business on Friday.

   Check your account balance(s) (8 a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday
   through Friday)

   You'll need your TreasuryDirect account number and your Social Security
   or Employer Identification Number for each account. Your account
   balance will be current as of the minute you request it. If you have
   more than one account, you'll be able to get the balances for all of
   them during the same call to our toll-free phone number or during a
   single visit to the virtual lobby. The virtual lobby also offers
   detailed CUSIP balances.

   Order a duplicate IRS 1099-INT (8 a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday
   through Friday)

   You'll need your TreasuryDirect account number. We mail duplicate
   1099-INT forms the business day following your request. This service is
   available from Feb. 1 to Nov. 30. You can request duplicate forms only
   for the current tax year (for 2001, the current tax year is 2000). If
   you need forms for earlier years, call your TreasuryDirect office.

   Reinvest Direct® (24 hours a day, seven days a week)

   About 45 days before your Treasury bill, note, or bond matures, you'll
   receive a Reinvestment Request form. Once you have it, pay us a visit
   at our virtual lobby or pick up the phone and call us toll free. You'll
   need your TreasuryDirect account number, the CUSIP you want to
   reinvest, the validation number from your form, the security term
   you've chosen, and the number of reinvestments (for bills).

   Change your mailing address or phone number -- available on the web (8
   a.m.-8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday)

   Now you don't have to call your TreasuryDirect office or fill out a
   paper form to change the mailing address or phone number on your
   account. Just visit our virtual lobby, have your account number and
   Taxpayer Identification Number handy, and you'll be in business. (If
   you have multiple accounts, you need to change your address or phone
   number under all of your account numbers. Entering the new information
   once won't change it for every account.) NOTE: This service isn't
   available on TreasuryDirect Electronic Services on the phone, but you
   can change your address and phone number on the phone: dial
   800-722-2678 and choose Option No. 5 to speak to a customer service
   representative.

   Pay your account maintenance fee -- by phone (24 hours a day, seven
   days a week)

   If your Treasury bill, note, and bond holdings in TreasuryDirect exceed
   $100,000 on the annual snapshot date for this fee, you'll be assessed
   $25. Once you receive a Fee Assessment Notice, simply call
   800-722-2678, choose Option No. 1 for TreasuryDirect Electronic
   Services, and follow the prompts. You'll need to enter your
   TreasuryDirect account number and punch in the fee remittance number
   from your notice. We will then deduct $25 from your account at the
   financial institution you designated for TreasuryDirect. It's that
   simple! NOTE: This service isn't available on the web.
