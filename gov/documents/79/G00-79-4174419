                         INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
                      Expedition Four Science Operations

                             Weekly Status Report
                           Thursday, Jan. 24, 2002

     The Experiment on Physics of Colloids in Space (EXPPCS) team has
     expanded its research from studying colloid behavior to building
     fractal structures with them.

     The ground-based science team this week continued its fractal test
     run aboard the Space Station that began on Jan 16 and will continue
     for five weeks.  The fractal sample being studied is a gel made from
     colloids.  It is made mostly of liquid but with enough binding
     material to prevent it from flowing.  Gelatin is a common example.
     A fractal is something that appears to have the same structure under
     different degrees of magnification.  One example is the coastline of
     a continent.  Maps showing 25 miles or 250 miles of coastline will
     appear somewhat similar in the apparent amount of roughness.

     Scientists are interested in studying the fractal structure of this
     colloid gel, which is 99.992 percent water and only 0.008 percent
     colloid.  Among their questions is whether something with so little
     material will be able to form a gel.  They are also studying aging
     of the gel.

     Fractal gels are of interest to manufacturers and materials
     specialists on Earth.  A primary mechanism for degradation of motor
     oil is the formation of fractal clusters of soot.  Another example
     is the aging and spoilage of food.  Fractal gels are also found in a
     specialized material known as aerogel, which is only 0.5 percent
     solid and possibly the best thermal insulator known.  EXPPCS is
     managed by NASAs Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.  The principal
     investigator is David Weitz of Harvard University.

     The colloids experiment team last week concluded its 120-hour
     reexamination of the crystallization of the AB6 binary colloid, then
     conducted a successful follow-up 24-hour run and were successful in
     obtaining high quality data.  The experiment has been extended from
     Expedition Four to Expedition Five.

     The Active Rack Isolation System ISS Characterization Experiment
     (ARIS-ICE) ground team continued testing the experimental ARIS
     vibration dampening device during the past week.  Located in EXPRESS
     Rack 2, ARIS is designed to protect delicate microgravity
     experiments from vibrations caused by crew motion, operating
     equipment, etc.  The experiment was launched in April 2001 on the 6A
     Shuttle flight.  Although not completed, ARIS-ICE has to date spent
     over 10 successful months on the Station, logged more than 2,300
     hours on the ground station console, transmitted more than 15,000
     commands from ground to the Station to conduct more than 1,446
     ARIS-ICE on- orbit tests.

     The experiment has helped enhance the vibration dampeners
     performance by improving the power umbilical design, validating its
     performance over a wide frequency range and resolving several other
     technical issues.  On Tuesday, Jan. 22, the crew began tests in
     which they use a small hammer to tap on the Stations Z-panel
     containing power, data, fluid and other utility umbilical lines into
     the EXPRESS Rack 2, while the ground team measures the dampeners
     response.  Those tests will continue through the end of the month.
     The science team would like more data synchronized with crew
     exercise periods and exercise equipment.

     On Saturday, Jan. 19, the crew during their normal maintenance
     checks noticed and removed an ice buildup in the Biotechnology
     Refrigerator containing several cell science samples processed
     earlier in the mission and now awaiting transfer to Earth.Locations
     on a list of possible targets for the Crew Earth Observations
     program during the past week have included ice fields in the South
     Sandwich Islands, Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean where a major
     volcanic eruption was occurring on the island east of Madagascar, a
     severe tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean , smog in southeastern
     Africas industrialized heartland of the Vaal River, Patagonian ice
     fields in Chile,  American Samoas reefs and coral structures, and
     the Marquesas Islands.

     Flight Engineers Dan Bursch and Carl Walz performed their Crew
     Interactions surveys on Wednesday, Jan. 23.

     Also on Wednesday, the Expedition Three team was reunited during a
     teleconference for a post-mission debriefing with the Expedition
     Three crew in Houston.  The science team uses these meetings to get
     feedback on procedures and improve instructions, planning and
     timelines for future missions.

     Thursday, Jan. 24, is expected to be a light duty day for the crew
     in preparation for a Russian EVA scheduled for Friday.  On Saturday,
     Jan. 26, Bursch will follow up his scheduled Friday spacewalk with a
     lung function test with the Pulmonary Function in Flight
     experiment.  Walz also will perform PuFF for his regular monthly
     test.

     Editors Note: The Payload Operations Center at NASAs Marshall Space
     Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages all science research
     experiment operations aboard the International Space Station.  The
     center is also home for coordination of the mission-planning work of
     a variety of international sources, all science payload deliveries
     and retrieval, and payload training and payload safety programs for
     the Station crew and all ground personnel.
