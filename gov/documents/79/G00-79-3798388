                             Linder Internships

   U.S. House of Representatives Seal Thank you for your interest in the
   John Linder Congressional Internship Program.  It is always exciting
   for me to learn of so many college students eager to participate in
   American politics.  While classroom learning is invaluable, there is
   simply no substitute for hands-on experience, where you not only study
   the material, but actually take part in the process.  Things often
   operate differently in reality than they do in theory--especially when
   it comes to politics.  If you have ever wondered how Congress really
   works and what happens behind the newspaper headlines, I want to
   encourage you to apply for an internship in my office.  I look forward
   to hearing from you soon.

   Here's what some of our interns had to say about their experience:

   "It was an incredibly insightful program--I learned the intricate
   details of working on a Congressional staff, got an inside view of
   politics and also had fun."

   "I enjoyed being included...I felt like a part of the office, instead
   of an intern."

   "It was fantastic! It was one of the greatest experiences of my life
   and I have had some very good ones!"

   "I cannot thank you enough for my introduction to Capitol Hill!"
