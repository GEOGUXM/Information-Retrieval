    REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

   Redevelopment agencies must report annually on their housing activities
   and maintenance and use of the Low & Moderate Income Housing Fund
   (Health and Safety Code Section 33080.1). A copy of this report must be
   filed with the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
   (Section 33080.3). HCD must compile and publish annually a report of
   redevelopment agencies' housing activities (Section 33080.6).

   HCD's RDA On-Line Reporting System
   for annual reporting is now fully operational. This system enables
   redevelopment agencies to electronically report data that is annually
   collected from agencies on HCD's Schedules A - E. HCD requests agency
   data to fulfill a legislative requirement to produce an annual report
   on Housing Activities of California Redevelopment Agencies.

   HCD's On-Line Reporting System was designed for three primary purposes:
    1. Enable agencies to report data to the database used by HCD to
       produce its annual report of agency activities so that agencies
       have an early opportunity to review data for accuracy before HCD
       publishes agency data,
    2. Simplify agency reporting (e.g. data can be entered throughout the
       year by several staff simultaneously and common data such as agency
       name and name of project area and project/program does not have to
       be re-entered), and
    3. Increase the accuracy of reported data (e.g. system calculates and
       validates certain data and provides help and error messages). We
       encourage you to use HCD's On-Line Reporting System.

   In order to access the system, the Agency's Executive Director (or the
   Director's designee) must send an email requesting a password. The
   email request must contain the following:
     * Full Name, Title, Email Address and Telephone Number of the
       designee
     * If the email is sent by the Executive Director's designee, it must
       also include:
          + A statement that he/she has been authorized by the Executive
            Director as the Online System contact person for that RDA
          + Send a copy of the request to the Executive Director.

   The email must be sent to Glen Campora (gcampora@hcd.ca.gov). Once Glen
   has assigned a password to the Executive Director or his/her designee,
   he or she will be able to assign a password to other agency staff, if
   desired, to access the system.

    EXCESS SURPLUS

   Each Redevelopment agency's annual report on housing activity includes
   a calculation to determine how much excess surplus exists. "Excess
   surplus" is defined as any unexpended and unencumbered amount that
   exceeds the greater of either $1,000,000 or the aggregate amount
   deposited into the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund during the
   preceding four fiscal years (Health & Safety Code Section 33334.12).
