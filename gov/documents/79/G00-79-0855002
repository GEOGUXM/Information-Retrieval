             Nonindigenous Coelenterate Distribution Information
     __________________________________________________________________

   Coelenterates (Phylum Coelenterata or Cnidaria) include jellyfish,
   anemones, corals, and hydras. The phylum is characterized by a
   gelatinous body, tentacles, and stinging cells called nemadocysts. Most
   species are found in marine waters, but some occur in brackish or even
   fresh water. Coelenterates may be either sessile or free swimming,
   depending on the species and/or stage of the life-cycle. Standard
   methods of introduction include ship fouling or transportation in
   ballast water of ocean-going vesse ls. Potential impacts include
   competition with native species for suitable substrate or food,
   negative effects on organisms to which they attach, utilizing native
   species as a food source, and "swarming", where thousands of jellyfish
   mass in an area and can affect the local fauna. An example of an
   introduced coelenterate is the Black Sea jellyfish, Maeotias
   inexspectata. These small purple jellyfish were introduced via ballast
   water from Russian ships into San Francisco Bay in 1993. They underw
   ent a population explosion and infested tributaries of the bay. This
   outbreak caused considerable public alarm and inspired news headlines
   like "Jellyfish Jam the Petaluma River".
