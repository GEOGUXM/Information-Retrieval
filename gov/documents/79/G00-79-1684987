   until 7 days PRIOR to the scheduled hearing date, you have the option
   of a mitigation or contested hearing by mail. If you decided to proceed
   with a hearing by mail, you will not be required to appear in court

   Defendant's Statement Form and mail it to the court prior to your
   scheduled hearing. A copy of the Defendant's Statement Form is

   statement and render a decision. In the case of a mitigation hearing,

   determined. The finding will be reported to the Department of
   Licensing. In the case of a contested hearing, if the court finds that
   the infraction has been committed, it will impose a monetary penalty
   and the finding will be reported to the Department of Licensing. The

   time ordered by the judge. You will be notified by mail in a form

   decision.

   scheduled hearing date.

   Statements which are not received 7 days prior to the scheduled hearing
   date will not be considered. Postmarks will not be considered. If the
   court does not receive your statement and you fail to appear for the
   hearing, the infraction will automatically be found committed and a $48
   default penalty will be added. Your failure to appear (FTA) or pay the
   fine and assessed penalty will be reported to the Department of
   Licensing (DOL), and DOL will suspend your driver's license or
   privilege to drive. In addition, your unpaid fine and penalty will be

   fees.

   In all cases please print your mailing addresss on the bottom of your
   response and sign the request. You will be notified of a court date by
