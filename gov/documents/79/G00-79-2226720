     Filing Information

     General Information

     OTS regulation 12 CFR 563.180 requires the completion of the Thrift
     Financial Report (TFR) by all savings associations as defined in 12
     CFR 561.43. The TFR is filed electronically on a quarterly basis and
     is due no later than 30 days after quarter end, except for Schedule
     HC, Thrift Holding Company, and Schedule CMR, Consolidated Maturity
     and Rate, which are due no later than 45 days after quarter end.

     The TFR contains 14 schedules, which include financial statements
     and supplemental information filed for the reporting savings
     association consolidated with its subsidiaries. All information on
     the TFR, including income and expense and cash flow data, is
     reported for the quarter, not year to date. Most information on the
     TFR is available to the public for individual institutions; however,
     certain information is considered proprietary and is not released.
     All data are released in aggregate form. See this list of TFR
     schedules and their availability to the public. Schedules for 2001

     For questions or comments concerning the forms and instructions,
     contact the Financial Reporting Division at
     tfr.instructions@ots.treas.gov. For questions concerning a
     particular institution, contact our dissemination branch at
