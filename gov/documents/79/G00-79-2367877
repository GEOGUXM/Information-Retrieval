   Cost Performance Index (Efficiency) CPI = BCWP / ACWP Schedule
   Performance Index (Efficiency) SPI = BCWP / BCWS Percent Complete =
   BCWPc / BAC Percent Spent = ACWPc / BAC VARIANCES Cost Variance CV =
   BCWP - ACWP Schedule Variance SV = BCWP - BCWS Cost Variance % CV% =
   (CV / BCWP) * 100 Schedule Variance % SV% = (SV / BCWS) * 100 Variance
   Completion VAC = BAC - LRE ESTIMATE AT COMPLETION (EAC) EAC = BAC /
   CPIc EAC = BAC / CPI3 EAC = BAC / CPI6 EAC = ACWPc + (BAC - BCWPc) /
   [(CPIc)( SPIc)] EAC = ACWPc + (BAC - BCWPc) / CPIc EAC = ACWPc + (BAC -
   BCWPc) / [(CPIc)(.8) + (SPIc)(.2)] EAC = ACWPc + (BAC - BCWPc) / CPIm
   EAC = ACWPc + (BAC - BCWPc) / CPI3 EAC = ACWPc + (BAC - BCWPc) / CPI6
