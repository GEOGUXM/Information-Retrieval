   Dave Cox, District 5

   Welcome
   Thank you for visiting my web page. I have included a biography so that
   you can get to know me better. I invite you to take a look at our
   recent press releases and editorials. I have also included a way for
   you to track the legislation that I have authored. In addition, I would
   ask that you take the survey of currently hot issues.

   Again, thank you for visiting. Please let me know how we can better
   serve you in the California State Assembly.
