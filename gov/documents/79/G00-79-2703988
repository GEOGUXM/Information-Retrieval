                       WITS FOR SOJOURNER HEADQUARTERS
                  (WITS version 4.1, released January 1997)

   WITS version 4.1 for Sojourner was the first public release of the WITS
   software and provided an interactive, "hands-on" experience of Mars
   exploration to thousands of users.  It enabled these users to interact
   with a simulated Sojourner rover in data acquired by the real rover,
   and taught them about the execution of a actual Mars mission.  While
   this version of WITS does not have the sophisticated features of the
   latest versions of WITS for FIDO and the Mars Polar Lander, it is still
   an exciting way to look at data from the historic 1997 Mars Pathfinder
   mission.  Below is the page that provided WITS to the public in 1997.

                    Pathfinder Sojourner Rover Simulation



   Welcome to the Web Interface for Telescience (WITS) rover simulation
   system for the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner rover, running at the Sun
   Microsystems, Inc. sponsored site. WITS has been developed by NASA's
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to enable scientists to participate in
   planetary lander and rover missions from anywhere in the world using
   the Internet. WITS will be used in the 1998 lander and 2001 rover
   missions to Mars for command generation, and is used in this Pathfinder
   mission as a public outreach tool to enable you too to be a planetary
   scientist.

   With WITS acting as your window on Mars, you can view the actual images
   Pathfinder beams back to Earth and interact with the rover just as a
   Scientist or Mission Planner would. Tell the rover where to go. What to
   do. See what it sees. The only difference is that you'll be interacting
   with a simulated rover. But everything else is real.

   WITS has been tested on Netscape Navigator 3.0.1 and Microsoft Internet
   Explorer 3.0.1 Web browsers on Unix and Windows 95/NT platforms. It
   should also run on Web browsers of other platforms that support Java.

   Getting Started!
    1. Use a Java enabled browser
       You will need to use a Java enabled browser to use the WITS applet.
    2. Download the WITS applets
       If you don't use option A above, then download the complete WITS
       applet on your computer directly each time you want to explore
       Mars, such as on different days. It might take 5 or 10 minutes to
       download with a 28.8K modem.
          + Sojourner version .
          + Rocky7 version .
    3. Read the WITS User's Guide and Tutorial.
       Get the most out of your Mars exploration. Make sure to read the
       WITS User's Guide and WITS Tutorial.
