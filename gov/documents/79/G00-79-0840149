   DSHS Client Data FY 2000

   The Client Services Data Base assembles client and service data, from
   17 DSHS program data systems. Differences in the way the systems record
   services and client names are resolved so each person is matched to all
   the services they receive and no one is counted as more than one
   person.

   The tables below show, for FY 2000, by age group:
     * How many person used one or more DSHS services
     * How many person used one or more DSHS services from a particular
       part of the agency (for example, from the DSHS Mental Health
       Division)
     * How many person used each one of 60 specific DSHS service groups
       (for example, psychiatric inpatient services at the state mental
       hospitals).

   These counts are reported below for the state as a whole, by county,
   and by legislative districts.
