                   The Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program;
                                   Final Regulations
                                       Synopsis

          On December 28, 2001, the Social Security Administration (SSA)
          published final regulations implementing the "Ticket to Work and
          Self-Sufficiency Program" (the Ticket to Work program) authorized by
          the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L.
          106-170). The Ticket to Work program provides Social Security
          disability beneficiaries and disabled or blind Supplemental Security
          Income beneficiaries with expanded access to employment services,
          vocational rehabilitation services, or other support services. This
          program will enable these beneficiaries to obtain, regain or
          maintain employment and to reduce their dependency on cash
          assistance. Under this program, SSA will pay the providers of those
          services, called employment networks (ENs), after the beneficiaries
          achieve certain levels of work and earnings.

          These final regulations:
          * Explain in section 411.105 that the purpose of the Ticket to Work
            program is to expand the universe of service providers available to
            SSA beneficiaries with disabilities in obtaining the services
            necessary to find, enter and retain employment;
          * Explain in section 411.110 how SSA will implement the program in
            graduated phases in sites around the country. The Ticket to Work
            program will be available in every State not later than 2004. The
            preamble to the final regulations includes an explanation of the
            three phases of implementation. This information also can be found
            on this page under "Phase In of Ticket to Work Program States."
          * Provide in section 411.125 that most beneficiaries receiving
            disability-based cash benefits from SSA will receive tickets if
            they are at least age 18 but not yet age 65;
          * Explain in section 411.140, how a beneficiary receiving a ticket
            can assign it to an EN or State vocational rehabilitation agency to
            obtain services, and in sections 411.145 and 411.150 how the
            beneficiary can take the ticket out of assignment and reassign it
            to a different EN or the State VR agency;
          * Explain beginning in section 411.160 our rules about continuing
            disability reviews for beneficiaries who are "using a ticket."
            These sections explain what is meant by the term "using a ticket"
            and how "using a ticket" protects a beneficiary from initiation of
            a medical review to determine whether he or she continues to meet
            SSA's definition of disability;
          * Explain in section 411.245 what the Program Manager (PM) does to
            assist SSA to administer the Ticket to Work program. The PM's
            duties consist of recruiting, recommending and monitoring
            employment networks (ENs); facilitating access by beneficiaries to
            ENs; facilitate payments to ENs; and other administrative tasks.
          * Describe beginning in section 411.310 the qualifications and
            responsibilities of ENs, and beginning in section 411.360 how State
            vocational rehabilitation agencies participate in the Ticket to
            Work program;
          * Describe beginning in section 411.500 when an EN or State
            vocational rehabilitation agency is paid under the Ticket to Work
            program, and the two systems for paying ENs for assisting
            beneficiaries to go to work. Section 411.525 describes how we
            calculate payments to ENs under both the outcome payment system and
            the outcome-milestone payment system;
          * Explain beginning in section 411.600 how we will settle disputes
            arising in the Ticket to Work program between beneficiaries and
            ENs, beneficiaries and State vocational rehabilitation agencies,
            and ENs and the Program Manager. A process is available that will
            assure each party of a full, fair and timely review of a disputed
            matter; and
          * Explain beginning in section 411.700 how implementation of the
            Ticket to Work program will affect the alternate participant
            program.
