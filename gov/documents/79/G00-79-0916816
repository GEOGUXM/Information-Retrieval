   hubble space telescope NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration, sent a brave seven-member crew about 370 miles (595.33
   Kilometers) above Earth to tune-up the Hubble Space Telescope. The
   astronauts replaced equipment to keep Hubble healthy through the rest
   of its 20-year mission.

   hubble space telescope A faster main computer and six new gyroscopes
   are some of the things that will now make Hubble stronger and better.
   The gyros help Hubble point at stars and other heavenly objects. To do
   its scientific work, the telescope needs three of its six gyros working
   at any time. Broken wires inside four had left Hubble with only two
   usable gyros and no back-ups. Because Hubble could not easily turn
   around to point at what it wants to see, it was placed in safe hold in
   November 13, 1999 until the gyros were replaced on December 22, 1999.

   continue to explore the mysteries of the Universe as it searches for
   black holes, nebulae, galaxies, stars and planets around other suns!
