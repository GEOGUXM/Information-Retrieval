U.S. Board on Geographic Names Logo United States Board on Geographic Names

   The U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) is a Federal body created in
   1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947.
   Comprised of representatives of Federal agencies, appointed for 2-year
   terms, the Board is authorized to establish and maintain uniform
   geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. Sharing its
   responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board has
   developed principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of
   both domestic and foreign geographic names as well as underseas and
   Antarctic feature names. Although established to serve the Federal
   Government as a central authority to which all name problems, name
   inquiries, and new name proposals can be directed, the Board also plays
   a similar role for the general public.
