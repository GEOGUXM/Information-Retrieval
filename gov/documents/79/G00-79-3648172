                                  Licensing

   The Securities Division licenses broker-dealers, investment advisers,
   securities salespersons, investment adviser representatives, agents of
   issuers and franchise brokers that operate in Washington state. Staff
   review firm applications for such factors as qualifications of
   principals, firm disciplinary history and financial solvency.
   Salesperson and representative applications are generally reviewed for
   qualifying examinations and disciplinary background.

   Special attention is placed on firms and individuals with significant
   disciplinary histories, to ensure that proper safeguards are in place
   to protect investors. Extra assistance is also provided to new firms,
   to help applicants better understand licensing obligations and record
   keeping requirements.

                                 Examination

   The Securities Division examiners conduct on-site examinations of
   broker-dealer and investment adviser business locations. The examiners
   conduct exams on a routine basis through a regular examination cycle.
   They also conduct examinations "for cause," in response to complaints
   or other indications that violations may be occurring. Most of the
   examinations conducted are routine.

   During Broker-Dealer examinations, the examiners look for sales
   practice abuses such as:
     * Unsuitable recommendations
     * Misrepresentations
     * Churning
     * Unauthorized transactions

   They routinely look at:
     * The complaint file
     * The correspondence file
     * The high activity list (exception reports)
     * Margin runs
     * Account Statements
     * Order error files

   During Investment Adviser examinations, the examiners look at both
   operations and sales practices. The most common problems we find
   include:
     * Disclosure problems
     * Conflict of interest problems
     * Custody problems
     * Suitability problems
     * Misleading advertising or performance claims

   The records that the examiners usually look at are:
     * Journals and auxiliary records such as cash/check receipts and
       disbursement records
     * General and supporting ledgers such as cash flow, income
       statements, and profit and loss ledgers
     * Check books, bank statements, canceled checks, and other bank
       documents
     * Bills and documents pertaining to the expenses of the firm
     * Trial balances, financial statements, and internal working papers
     * Correspondence and complaints
     * Account information including contracts, disclosure, and
       transaction activities
     * Documents pertaining to discretion and custody of customer
       securities and cash

   Most exams result in a letter to the firm examined describing the
   examination findings and requesting a response from the firm. When the
   Securities Division examiners find significant violations, they refer
   their findings to the Division's enforcement staff for investigation
   and possible administrative or civil action or, in cases where customer
   funds have been converted, criminal referral.
