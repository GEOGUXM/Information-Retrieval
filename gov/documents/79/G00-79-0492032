     __________________________________________________________________

   NOTE: All forms on National's form page are in Word 97/2000 format. If
   you have version 6 or 7 of MS Word, you can install the converter
   program shown below to allow your version of Word to work with the
   newer versions' documents.

   Forms on National's "Publications" page (in the E-Business area) are
   often in Adobe Acrobat form. These files can't be modified (i.e., you
   can't fill in the blanks with your computer). On the other hand, they
   are easier to produce, and thus are often released sooner than the Word
   version. The reason for this is that someone has to hand create the
   Word version, a tedius process. In the case of Adobe Acrobat files, you
   can simply use a document scanner to create the Adobe Acrobat file.

   Idaho Wing publications will be posted in Word format when available,
   otherwise, in Adobe Acrobat.

   The following are Idaho Wing forms. There has been a problem with the
   web server we use that complicates the use of Netscape for downloading
   these files. We have been working with our provider to resolve this. In
   the meanwhile.... if you are get gibberish when clicking on any of the
   following forms, please "right-click" on the desired form, and select
   "Save Link As...". Then save the file. We apologize for the
   inconvenience.
