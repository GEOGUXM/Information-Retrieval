     The Methodology Series produced by SAMHSA's Office of Applied
     Studies  (OAS) addresses methodological issues concerning data
     collection systems conducted by OAS. These reports include studies
     of new statistical techniques and theories, survey methods, sample
     design, survey instrument design, and objective evaluations of the
     reliability of collected data.  Other OAS Methodology Reports are
     available only on the web and provide more technical background for
     specific OAS data collection systems such as the National Household
     Survey on Drug Abuse and the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN).
