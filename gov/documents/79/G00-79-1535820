   Wetlands Reserve Program

        The Wetlands Reserve Program, established in 1990, is one of the
   most innovative agricultural programs established this decade.
   Enormously popular, a successful WRP will ensure that agriculture as a
   sector is able to achieve the goal of no net loss of wetlands to
   agriculture. Greater program flexibility would help WRP achieve that
   goal.

   Discussion
        The WRP authorizes the Secretary to restore not more than 975,000
   acres to wetland status by the year 2000, through permanent or
   long-term easements. Certain changes can be made to make the program
   easier and less costly to administer while maintaining high program
   quality.

   Guidance
        To take advantage of these opportunities, the program could be
   amended as follows:
     * Modify WRP provisions to give the Secretary flexibility in timing
       compensation payments to achieve maximum program efficiency.
     * Give the Secretary the authority to work with other agencies to
       ensure the most efficient management of the Department’s
       responsibilities for the easements acquired under the program.
     * Broaden land-types eligible for WRP to include critical
       environmentally sensitive acres associated with wetlands and
       riparian zones that the Secretary determines suitable for
       protection with long-term or permanent easements.
     * Encourage state and local interests, through the Natural Resources
       Conservation Service and state technical committees, to help
       establish wetland enrollment priorities and offer matching funds.

   Wetlands Reserve Program
        WRP is a voluntary program to restore and protect wetlands on
   private property. WRP offers landowners financial incentives to enhance
   wetlands in exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land.

   How Does WRP Benefit You?
     * Receive financial compensation;
     * Enhance wetland values that benefit you and society;
     * Reduce problems associated with farming potentially difficult
       areas;
     * Practice conservation stewardship; and
     * Provide recreational opportunities.

        Congress authorized WRP under the Food Security Act of 1985, as
   amended by the 1990 and 1996 Farm Bills. The U.S. Department of
   Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service administers the
   program in consultation with the Farm Service Agency and other Federal
   agencies. Funding for WRP comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation.

   Sign-up
        States were authorized to begin a continuous sign-up as of October
   1, 1996. Check with your local USDA Service Center or conservation
   district office for the sign-up schedule in your state.
     * Provide fish and wildlife habitat;
     * Improve water quality by filtering sediments and chemicals;
     * Reduce flooding;
     * Recharge groundwater;
     * Protect biological diversity; and
     * Furnish educational, scientific, recreational and esthetic
       benefits.

   How the Program Works
        Landowners who choose to participate in WRP may sell a
   conservation easement or enter into a cost-share restoration agreement
   with USDA to restore and protect wetlands. The landowner voluntarily
   limits future use of the land, yet retains private ownership. The
   landowner and NRCS develop a plan for the restoration and maintenance
   of the wetland.
        The program offers landowners three options: permanent easements,
   30-year easements, and restoration cost-share agreements of a minimum
   10-year duration.

   Permanent Easement:
   conservation easement in perpetuity. Easement payment will be the
   lesser of: the agricultural value of the land, an established payment
   cap or an amount offered by the landowner. In addition to paying for
   the easement, USDA pays 100 percent of the costs of restoring the
   wetland.

   30-Year Easement:
   a conservation easement lasting 30 years. Easement payments are 75
   percent of what would be paid for a permanent easement. USDA also pays
   75 percent of restoration costs.

   Restoration Cost-Share Agreement:
   an agreement (generally for a minimum of 10 years in duration) to
   re-establish degraded or lost wetland habitat. USDA pays 75 percent of
   the cost of the restoration activity. This does not place an easement
   on the property. The landowner provides the restoration site without
   reimbursement.

        Other agencies and private conservation organizations may provide
   additional assistance for easement payment and wetland restoration
   costs as a way to reduce the landowner’s share of the costs. Such
   special partnership efforts are encouraged.

   Landowner Eligibility
        The landowner must have owned the land for at least one year prior
   to enrolling the land in the program unless the land was inherited or
   the landowner can prove the land was not obtained for the purpose of
   enrolling it in the program.

   Land Eligibility
        To be eligible for WRP, land must be restorable and suitable for
   wildlife benefits, including:
     * Wetlands farmed under natural conditions
     * Farmed wetlands
     * Prior converted cropland
     * Farmed wetland pasture
     * Farmland that has become a wetland as a result of flooding
     * Rangeland, pasture, or production forestland where the hydrology
       has been significantly degraded and can be restored
     * Riparian areas which link protected wetlands
     * Lands adjacent to protected wetlands that contribute significantly
       to wetland functions and values
     * Previously restored wetlands

   Ineligible Land
        Ineligible land includes wetlands converted after December 23,
   1985; lands with timber stands established under a CRP contract;
   Federal lands; and lands where conditions make restoration impossible.

   Uses of WRP Land
        A landowner continues to control access to the land—and may lease
   the land—for hunting, fishing, and other undeveloped recreational
   activities. At any time, a landowner may request that additional
   activities be evaluated to determine if they are compatible uses for
   the site. This request may include such items as permission to cut hay,
   graze livestock or harvest wood products.
       Compatible uses are allowed if they are fully consistent with the
   protection and enhancement of the wetland.

   Cooperating Agencies
        Additional information on WRP is available from USDA Service
   Centers, State Cooperative Extension offices, and local conservation
   districts.

                          WRP Questions and Answers

   How can I get involved in WRP?
   Check with your USDA Service Center or Conservation District for the
   sign-up schedule. NRCS, with input from FWS and State wildlife
   agencies, will determine if the acres you offer are eligible for the
   program. Landowners with high priority acres - based on competitive
   selection - will receive an offer.

   How much will I get for my land?
   WRP offers landowners three options: permanent and 30-year easements
   and restoration cost-share agreements of at least 10-years.

   Permanent Easement: This is a conservation easement in perpetuity.
   Easement payment will be the lesser of: the agricultural value of the
   land, an established payment cap or an amount offered by the landowner.
   In addition to paying for the easement, USDA pays 100 percent of the
   costs of restoring the wetland.

   30-Year Easement: This is a conservation easement lasting 30 years.
   Easement payments are 75 percent of what would be paid for a permanent
   easement. USDA also pays 75 percent of restoration costs.

   Restoration Cost-Share Agreement: This is an agreement (generally, at
   least 10 years) to re-establish degraded or lost wetland habitat. USDA
   pays 75 percent of the cost of the restoration activity. This does not
   place an easement on the property. The landowner provides the
   restoration site without reimbursement.

   What can I do with my land once it is in WRP?
   The plan you developed with NRCS identifies the activities necessary to
   restore, enhance, protect, maintain and manage the wetland. You
   continue to control access to the land - and may lease the land - for
   hunting, fishing and other undeveloped recreational activities. At any
   time, a landowner may request that additional activities be evaluated
   to determine if they are compatible uses for the site. This request may
   include such items as permission to cut hay, graze livestock or harvest
   wood products. Compatible uses are allowed if they are fully consistent
   with the protection and enhancement of the wetland.

   How much land may I enroll?
   Once your eligibility has been determined, we will discuss with you the
   eligible wetland and surrounding area necessary to restore and sustain
   the ecosystem. Ideally a mix of wetland and upland acres is desired to
   meet the needs of the wildlife community and other objectives such as
   water quality, flood reduction and groundwater recharge.

   Do I need to hire a closing agent, appraiser, surveyor, or lawyer?
   No. Before an easement is recorded, NRCS will arrange for closing
   services to conduct searches, acquire title insurance and any other
   activities necessary to clear the title and complete the easement.

   Will I still have to pay taxes on the easement area?
   The amount of taxes you pay on the easement area is determined by the
   local taxing authority. Landowners should seek this information before
   entering the WRP.

   How can I reduce my local property tax when I enroll land in WRP?
   NRCS has no authority regarding tax issues. However, we can provide
   written documentation of the easement to help the landowner discuss
   this issue with a tax consultant.

   Wetlands Functions and Values

   Introduction
        Wetlands are some of the most productive and dynamic habitats in
   the world. The physical, chemical, and biological interactions within
   wetlands are often referred to as wetland functions. These functions
   include surface and subsurface water storage, nutrient cycling,
   particulate removal, maintenance of plant and animal communities, water
   filtration or purification, and groundwater recharge. Similarly, the
   characteristics of wetlands that are beneficial to society are called
   wetland values. Perhaps these can best be thought of as the importance
   of a wetland function to an individual or group. Some examples of
   wetland values include reduced damage from flooding, water quality
   improvement and fish and wildlife habitat enhancement.
       It is important to maintain and restore wetland functions and
   values because wetlands contribute to the overall health of the
   environment.
       Some basic wetland functions and their associated values are listed
   below.
       Spawning grounds for 60 to 90 percent of U.S. commercial fish
   catches. Many species of plants and wildlife require wetlands to
   thrive. Forested wetlands are also an important source of timber from
   such valuable trees as white cedar, bald cypress and tupelo.

   Values to Society
        There are a number of other values society receives from wetlands.
   Some of these values are providing sites for hunting, fishing,
   trapping, photography, outdoor classrooms or environmental education
   and the enjoyment of open spaces. The ecological diversity and high
   productivity of wetlands make them one of the most scenic features on
   any landscape.

   For More Information
        The Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency,
   Cooperative Extension Service, or your local conservation district can
   provide more information. Your USDA Service Center is listed in the
   telephone book under U.S. Department of Agriculture.

             Wetlands Functions and Values Questions and Answers

   Introduction
   The answers to these questions only address the provisions in the Food
   Security Act of 1985 (FSA, 1985 Farm Bill) and the Food, Agriculture,
   Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (FACTA, 1990 Farm Bill) concerning
   USDA program benefits. Other federal, state and local permits may still
   be required. (Note: provisions in the 1996 farm bill may alter the
   definition and handling of abandoned land.)

   Can existing drainage ditches be cleaned out?
   Yes. Existing drainage ditches can be maintained but not be made deeper
   or larger than the original design, unless the entire field is labeled
   Prior Converted. Spoil material cannot be placed in a wetland area.
   NRCS can define legal maintenance. Landowners need to contact NRCS
   prior to drainage maintenance so the scope and effect of the original
   system can be documented.

   What about trees along ditches?
   Wetlands are identified through the confirmation of hydric soil,
   hydrology and hydrophytic vegetation. Check with NRCS or District
   Conservationist to see if wetland determinations are completed in your
   county. In some circumstances, trees along ditches may not be
   determined a wetland. In other circumstances, trees along ditches under
   natural conditions may be determined wetlands.

   I have an area on hydric soil that was cleared before Dec. 23, 1985,
   and never cropped. Current vegetation includes some woody vegetation.
   May I clear this area now?
   No. Removal of woody vegetation in these areas would constitute
   conversion of a wetland. However, wetlands can be farmed under natural
   conditions using "normal" farming equipment. Consult NRCS before
   farming these areas. For FSA, an area is considered abandoned if there
   is no attempt at growing a crop for five years.

   May an area designated as wetland pasture or farmed wetland pasture be
   farmed?
   Farmed wetland pasture may be cropped but woody vegetation cannot be
   removed, nor can drainage be improved. Contact your NRCS office for
   assistance with this procedure.

   Can a wetland be cleared and planted to pasture?
   When FSA was signed, it provided that persons shall be ineligible for
   USDA benefits "if an agricultural commodity was planted on a wetland
   that was converted after Dec. 23, 1985." Wetlands converted between
   Dec.12, 1985 and Nov. 28, 1990 could be planted to permanent forages
   without affecting USDA program benefits. When FACTA was signed,
   additional restrictions were imposed for land converted after Nov. 28,
   1990. After that date, if a wetland is cleared so production of an
   agricultural commodity is made possible, this will result in a
   converted wetland and may affect USDA program benefits.

   Is cleaning a fence row on a hydric soil allowed?
   Yes. A single row of trees (not determined a wetland) may be cleared
   without any loss of USDA benefits. However, the Corps of Engineers
   should be contacted concerning Clean Water Act permit requirements.

   Will designation as Wetland, Wetland Pasture or Farmed Wetland Pasture
   affect grazing?
   Areas designated as wetlands, wetlands pasture or farmed wetland
   pasture may be grazed without penalty.

   An area in my crop field cannot be farmed during wet years, it is a
   Farmed Wetland. May I crop it?
   You may continue to crop Farmed Wetland areas as you have before Dec.
   23, 1995. Drainage cannot be improved or the site will be reclassified
   as converted wetland.

   I have a wooded area that is a wetland. May I harvest timber?
   Yes. You may harvest timber in wetland areas without violating the
   Swampbuster provision of the 1985 and 1990 Farm Bills, as long as the
   area is not dozed and tree stumps are not removed. The area may not be
   converted to another land use.

   May I clear, fill, drain and put it into crop production a wooded area
   NRCS determined is not a wetland?
   Yes. This would not be a violation of Swampbuster regulations, but
   Clean Water Act regulations may apply.

   May I mitigate a wetland on my farm?
   Sites eligible for a mitigation exemption are frequently cropped
   wetlands that have not been converted; or wetlands converted between
   Dec. 23, 1985 and Nov. 28, 1990 that have not had an agricultural
   commodity planted on the area in any year since 1985 for which the
   person received USDA benefits. Mitigation plans must be approved prior
   to any manipulation.

   How can this be a wetland? It has been farmed for 50 years!
   Cropping has little effect on wetland determinations. Farmed Wetlands
   are those manipulated and used to produce an agricultural commodity
   prior to Dec. 23, 1985 but meet certain hydrology criteria and;
   therefore, are not prior converted croplands. You may continue to farm
   a farmed wetland, but may not improve drainage or change the hydrology
   of the area.

   May I clear a wetland to build a house and a road?
   Yes. This may be considered Converted Wetland for Non-Agricultural
   purposes. Conversion of a wetland for these purposes after Nov. 28,
   1990, is not a violation.

   Am I allowed to clear the trees in this borrow pit?
   Artificial Wetlands and most borrow pits are not subject to FSA or
   FACTA. AWs are defined as land that was formerly non-wetlands under
   natural conditions or prior converted cropland, but now exhibit wetland
   characteristics because of human activities. AWs can be drained and
   woody vegetation can be removed and manipulated without causing
   ineligibility for USDA benefits. However, many AWs are regulated under
   Clean Water Act guidelines.

   May I make a fish pond out of this wetland?
   Yes. As long as production of an agricultural commodity crop is not
   made possible. Contact NRCS to document your purpose. Clean Water Act
   regulations may apply.

   What is a converted wetland?
   A converted wetland meets one or more of the following criteria: was a
   wetland, FW or FWP under natural conditions, but after Dec. 23, 1985
   has been drained, dredged, filled, leveled or otherwise manipulated,
   including any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow,
   circulation or reach of water.

   What is meant by "making an agricultural commodity crop possible?"
   Making an agricultural commodity crop possible means manipulation that
   allows or would allow production of an agricultural commodity where
   such production was not previously possible; or, making an area
   possible for farming more years than previously possible; or
   manipulation that reduces crop stress and allows increased crop yields;
   or manipulation after Nov. 28, 1990 that allows forage production or
   pasture and hay land use; or removal of woody vegetation, including
   stems and stumps.

   What is Prior Converted Cropland/Wetland and what may I do with it?
   An area designated PC on a wetland determination was, at one time, a
   wetland that had been altered, converted, drained, filled or otherwise
   manipulated; was cropped before Dec. 23, 1985; and had not been
   abandoned. The majority of cropland on wet soils in Arkansas has been
   altered to make it PC. PC cropland may be farmed and maintained or
   improved in any way, as long as it is not abandoned. Abandonment occurs
   when cropping is discontinued or no attempt is made to maintain the
   area for at least five years. If abandoned, the area can be
   reclassified as wetlands.
