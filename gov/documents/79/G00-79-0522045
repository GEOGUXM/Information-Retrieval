Current Regional and National Weather Conditions
     __________________________________________________________________

   For your convenience, we are providing links to Internet sites at Ohio
   State and Unisys, which offer a variety of weather-related products
   generated from National Weather Service data. On this Web page, you
   will find links to images that characterize the current weather
   picture. If you are interested in what the weather might do in the
   future, see the weather forecast products section.

   OSU and Purdue provide explanatory text on many of their products.
   Notice that the products are time stamped in Universal Time; 00 Z on
   December 2 is 1700 MST on December 1, and 12 Z on December 2 is 0500
   MST.

   Disclaimer: Some of the Internet images we link to may contain
   commercial advertisements. The availability of these images on the LANL
   Weather Machine is not an endorsement by ESH-17 or the laboratory of
   the products and services so advertised.

   Surface Weather Map
   The surface weather map, which is updated hourly, shows current
   conditions across the U. S. The map legend explains the "station plot"
   and related symbols.

   Satellite Images
   The satellite images given here are from the Research Applications
   Program (RAP) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
   Three types of satellite images are common: visible, infrared, and
   water vapor. They differ in the waveband of light detected by the
   satellite.

   Images in the visible waveband show how the earth would look if you
   were looking down from the satellite. You won't see very much during
   the night. In the visible waveband, it is difficult to distinguish
   between snow cover and cloud cover.

   The infrared images are really a temperature map of the earth and
   atmosphere beneath the satellite. Cold regions appear light gray and
   warm regions appear dark. Infrared images help determine the extent of
   vertical development in convective clouds; the higher the cloud top,
   the lighter the image.

   Water vapor images show where the moisture is in the atmosphere.
   Regions having abundant water vapor appear light in color; dry air will
   look dark. Since the type of weather we have depends on the available
   moisture, these images are very useful.

   Albuquerque Doppler Radar
   The Doppler Radar images out of ABQ give the most recent radar "echoes"
   for a large portion of Northern New Mexico, including the Los Alamos
   area. Albuquerque is located at the center of the plot, and can often
   be seen by the semi-permanent "ground clutter" that exists due to the
   buildings of the city of Albuquerque giving the radar "false echoes."
   Los Alamos county is the small boot-shaped county to the NNE of the
   center of the map (Albuquerque). Real radar echoes can sometimes
   consist of suspended precipitation in a cloud, or precipitation which
   is evaporating before it can reach the ground (virga). Also, snow is
   much less easily detected on radar, and usually appears as low
   intensity (low dbZ level) echoes. Be careful to note the "mode" that
   the radar is in. If the skies are clear, but echoes are showing up on
   the plot, then it is in "clear air" mode, where the Doppler radar is
   able to look at the atmospheric motions within the boundary layer by
   detecting the Doppler shift in the return signal.
