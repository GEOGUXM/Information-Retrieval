   Overview

      T-10, the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos
      National Laboratory, is composed of approximately 20 Ph.D.-level
      researchers working in theoretical and computational biology,
      bioinformatics, and biophysics. Research interests in T-10 range from
      modeling complex biological systems, such as the immune system and its
      interaction with pathogens (e.g., HIV and HCV), receptor-ligand
      interactions, and receptor signaling pathways, to sequence analysis,
      phylogenetics and evolution, and prediction of macromolecular structure
      and dynamics. T-10 is engaged not only in basic research but also
      several projects involving the development and maintenance of valuable
      resources for the scientific community, including the HIV and influenza
      sequence databases.

      T-10, founded in 1974, was one of the first, and remains one of the
      largest, research groups in the world devoted to mathematical and
      computational analysis of problems in cellular and molecular biology.
      T-10 also played a key early role in the Human Genome Project,
      establishing the GenBank sequence database. T-10 has a long and
      distinguished history, including a record of close collaboration with
      leading experimental laboratories, and an even more promising future.
      T-10, with its experienced group of computational biologists and
      bioinformaticists, is uniquely prepared to address the theoretical and
      computational aspects of the 21st century's grand challenge: unraveling
      the intricacies of the cell machinery. These theoretical and
      computational issues are becoming increasingly important as the field
      of biology matures.

      In addition to our regular staff, we host many visiting scientists,
      postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and interns. If you plan a
      visit to T-10, see our information for visitors. You might also want to
      read about life in northern New Mexico.

   History of T-10

      T-10 was founded in 1974 by George I. Bell, a student of Nobel Laureate
      Hans Bethe. The founding vision for T-10 was to apply the special
      expertise of physicists at LANL to solve problems in immunology,
      providing a theoretical research direction to complement the scientific
      community's mostly experimental efforts. Over time, T-10's research
      expanded into other areas of computational biology and bioinformatics,
      but immunology remains an area of research strength. Four of the ten
      most cited LANL publications between 1995-1999, including the most
      cited article, were contributed by members of T-10 working in
      theoretical/computational immunology. T-10 also has the distinction of
      having developed the first versions of the GenBank sequence database
      and many other sequence databases.

   Visitor Information

      T-10 is housed in three buildings at the corner of Diamond Drive and
      Eniwetok. Visitors should report to the group office in Building 480
      upon arrival.

      The local weather is usually sunny and pleasant.

      Also see the visitor information site maintained by LANL.

   Life in Northern New Mexico

      Los Alamos is a small but dynamic community located in the beautiful
      Jemez mountains. Nearby cities include Taos, where you can enjoy the
      Taos Talking Picture Festival, metropolitan Albuquerque, where you can
      be part of the Kodak International Balloon Fiesta, and Santa Fe, the
      cultural center of the Desert Southwest. Outdoor recreational
      activities abound, including snowboarding at Ski Pajarito in Los
      Alamos, world-class skiing at Taos Ski Valley, hiking at nearby
      Bandelier National Monument, rock climbing at the local crags in White
      Rock, and rafting on the upper Rio Grande. Other attractions include
      the renowned Santa Fe Opera, the art galleries, marketplaces, and fine
      dining of Santa Fe, and numerous museums, including the Bradbury
      Science Museum and Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.
