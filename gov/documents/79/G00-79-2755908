     * Department of Defense Announces New Telework Policy and Telework
       Guide for Civilian Employees of All DOD Components - Excerpts from
       the Policy as follows:
       It is DoD policy that:
         a. the maximum number of positions be identified as eligible for
            regular and recurring telework;
         b. the maximum number of employees who exhibit characteristics
            suitable for telework, and who occupy positions identified as
            eligible for teleworking, be permitted to telework
     The International Telework Association & Council (ITAC) Announces Key
       Findings of Its Annual Survey
       ITAC's study, sponsored by AT&T, found that there are now 28.8
       million teleworkers in the USA, up almost 17% during the past year.
       Most work on the road (24.1%) or from home (21.7%). A smaller
       percentage work at telework centers (7.5 %) or at satellite offices
       (4.2%). The typical teleworker works at least one full day per week
       away from the traditional office environment, lives in the
       northeast or western regions of the U.S, has a college education,
       is 35 to 44 years of age and married. More than two-thirds of
       teleworkers express greater job satisfaction. An overwhelming
       majority (almost 80%) feels a greater commitment to their
       organization and most say they plan to stay with their employer.
       Notably, almost three-quarters of at-home teleworkers reported a
       major increase in productivity and work quality.

     The General Services Administration (GSA) Releases New Report on
       Telework - "Expert Consensus on Recommended Practices for Telework"
       Responding to the need for substantiated information on effective
       practices for establishing successful telework programs, the Office
       of Governmentwide Policy, US General Services Administration (GSA)
       undertook a study to assess the validity of recent recommendations
       on telework program practices. The practice recommendations
       targeted for assessment in this study were obtained from the work
       of a blue ribbon panel established by the International Telework
       Association (ITAC). The study, conducted in the fall and winter of
       2000, utilized 62 experts with specializations in telework. These
       experts were asked to assess the value of 33 telework practices
       recommended by the BRP.
     * Internal Revenue Service "Report on Flexiplace and Hoteling Pilot"
       includes Cost/Benefit Analysis
       The Winter 2000 edition of IRS' Leader's Digest described the
       growing number of employees servicewide who successfully work apart
       from their manager and work group. Flexiplace is a work option,
       however, that is underutilized in Information Systems (renamed
       Information Technology Services but referred to as IS for this
       report only) despite the fact that many IS work activities are
       conducive to telecommuting. To demonstrate the benefits of flexible
       work arrangements for both the organization and its employees, IS'
       Office of Information Resources Management (OIRM) conducted a
       Flexiplace/Hoteling Pilot from June to October, 2000. Hoteling is
       an alternative work option often combined with flexiplace since
       telecommuters spend a significant percentage of time away from the
       conventional office. For the pilot, telecommuters worked at home
       and reserved an available workstation only on those days they were
       at the New Carrollton, MD facility.

                            Congressional Hearing
                           on Telework - Testimony
         ______________________________________________________________


     * From "Issues of Merit" Publication, December, 2000 (U.S. Merit
       Systems Protection Board) - Telecommuting Important to Federal
       Employees
       Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Merit Principles Survey of
       2000 shows: 47% of federal employees surveyed consider
       telecommuting important to them personally; 20% have it available
       to them; 44% of those that consider telecommuting important and do
       have it available plan to leave federal service; and 55% of those
       that consider telecommuting important but do not have it available
       plan to leave federal service.
       Of family friendly programs, telecommuting stood out because: (a)
       it is one of the most desired but least available programs; and (b)
       it is the only work/life program that appeared to have a
       relationship with federal employees' intention to retire or look
       for another jobs in the coming year. MSPB concludes that
       telecommuting "is a program that supervisors should include among
       their strategies for retaining valued employees who might otherwise
       leave their jobs."

     * Patent and Trademark Office wins the "2001 Commuter Connections
       Employee Recognition Telework Award"
       On June 27, 2001, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
       received the Award for its Trademark Work-at-Home Program from the
       Metropolitan Council of Governments. Today, over 90 of the agency's
       400 trademark examining attorneys are telecommuting from home using
       workstations supplied by USPTO.
     * New OPM Study Highlights Telework Successes
       (News Release Dated June 15, 2001) - Excerpt:
       Washington, D.C. -- Telework Works: A Compendium of Success
       Stories, provides examples of successful federal telework
       experiences. The recently released study by the Office of Personnel
       Management (OPM) offers an insider's look into what is right with a
       program that has become an important tool in the array of flexible
       work/life programs used in the federal government.
       Employees in the study had formal agreements to work at least one
       day a week away from the traditional office. Based on their
       experience, employees cited:
          + Increased productivity due to uninterrupted time to plan their
            work
          + Reduced tension levels by eliminating the commute
          + Improved quality of life due to time saved not commuting

     * OSHA Instruction on Home-Based Worksite Inspections
       (dated February 25, 2000) - Excerpt:
          + The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will
            not conduct inspections of employees' home offices.
          + OSHA will not hold employers liable for employees' home
            offices, and does not expect employers to inspect the home
            offices of their employees.
          + If OSHA receives a complaint about a home office, the
            complainant will be advised of OSHA's policy. If an employee
            makes a specific request, OSHA may informally let employers
            know of complaints about home office conditions, but will not
            follow-up with the employer or employee.

       2590, the FY 2002 Treasury and General Government Appropriations
       Bill. In the Conference Report accompanying H.R. 2590, Congress

       Office of Personnel Management on their efforts to use
       telecommuting centers. Under Section 630(a), these agencies were
       authorized to use at least $50,000 in FY 1999 and each year
       thereafter to establish programs under which employees could
       perform some or all of their duties at a telecommuting center.
