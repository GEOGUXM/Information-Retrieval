                      Today's Research in Beam Physics



   Today research is being conducted here at the Center for Beam Physics
   and institutions all over the world that require a knowledgeable use
   and understanding of beam physics. Today's research will surely shape
   the future of technology and our understanding of the universe around
   us tomorrow.

   This section of the site is devoted to some of the research and
   applications of beam physics in research here at The Center for Beam
   Physics. There are several aspects we will focus on in this section of
   the site:



     * Using Strong Electric Fields to Accelerate Electrons in a Laser
       Wakefield Accelerator
          + What is Plasma?
          + Why Plasma?
          + Accelerating Electrons
     * Producing New Types of Radiation Sources
          + Femtosecond X-Ray Pulses
          + Uses of Femtosecond X-Ray Pulses
     * Fusion Research
     * Using Particle Beams and Laser Beams in Astrophysics and Cosmology
       Research
