   Since 1992, the INEEL has managed the Math and Science Equipment Gift
   Program on behalf of the Department of Energy, Idaho (DOE-ID), through
   a Memorandum of Understanding between DOE-ID and the Idaho State
   Department of Education (ISDE). When functioning federal computers and
   related educational equipment (including printers, modems, servers and
   routers, and equipment used for technology education) become available
   at the INEEL, it is declared excess and placed in the gift program.
   ISDE then helps Idaho school districts meet their equipment needs by
   generating a list of recipient schools to which the equipment can be
   gifted. In establishing this list, the ISDE selects the schools and
   identifies the proportion in which the excess equipment is to be
   distributed among the schools throughout Idaho.

   School and non-profit personnel are able to apply for the equipment by
   completing and submitting an application request to ISDE. Upon
   notification, personnel can pick up the equipment at INEEL Central
   Facilities. Any costs incurred to transport the equipment are the
   responsibility of the recipient.
