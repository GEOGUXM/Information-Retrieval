   Once issued, audit reports are public documents. The intent of an audit
   report is to serve as a management tool to review and improve
   government operations. These independent reviews provide valuable
   information to both entity management and citizens on the financial
   activities of all state agencies and local governments in Washington.

   To receive a copy of an audit report call (360) 902-0370. You'll need
   to tell us the name of the entity and the audit period you want. The
   report will be mailed to you. There is no charge for the first copy.
   Additional copies can be made for ten cents a page.

   We also accept requests via e-mail. These should include the above
   information, as well as your name, address and phone number. To order
   an audit report via e-mail, click here, auditreq@sao.wa.gov.

   Please note that the Electronic Audit reports available via this
   WebPage do not include the financial statements but are otherwise the
   entire issued audit report. Since these files are in Adobe Acrobat
   format (PDF) and MS Word format (DOC), it requires you have the Adobe
   Acrobat Reader which you can download from here and the MS Word Viewer
   which you can download from here.

   Also note that reports and findings are available starting with a
   release date of September 1996 to the present.
