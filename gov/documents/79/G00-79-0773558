   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies, depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession, base pay entry date
   (BPED), geographic location of your duty station, and dependency
   status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for an environmental
   health officer in the PHS Commissioned Corps is O-2 (LTJG).  T & E
   credit is determined by undergraduate education, graduate training, and
   experience considered to be professionally qualifying for appointment
   to the particular category.  It is earned for time spent after receipt
   of the qualifying degree in degree-related activities such as:
     * employment (paid or voluntary)
     * research
     * teaching at college or university level
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research

   For further information on pay, click
   Pay on the home page.  For further information on T & E and how an
   officer's starting rank is calculated, click the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   Am I eligible for any bonuses and/or special pay?

   Yes, environmental health officers are eligible for the monthly special
   pay, Non-Physician Board Certified Pay (NPBCP).

   NPBCP is a monthly special pay for officers who possess specialty board
   certification in Radiological Physics from the American Board of
   Radiology (ABR) and who have a post baccalaureate degree in a
   clinically appropriate discipline (MPH degrees are not NPBCP qualifying
   degrees).  The creditable service entry date (CSED) reflects the
   officer's years of active duty as an environmental health officer in
   any of the Uniformed Services.  Rates range from $2,000 to $5,000
   annually based on years of CSED.  In order to receive NPBCP, you must
   provide documentation of the certification.

   All special pays are taxable income.

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Environmental Health
   Officer Professional Advisory Committee (EHOPAC).  The EHOPAC exists to
   provide advice and consultation to the Surgeon General on issues
   related to the professional practices and personnel activities of all
   PHS environmental health officers.  The EHOPAC also provides advisory
   assistance to the Chief Environmental Health Officer and to the agency
   and/or program heads where environmental health officers work.  All
   members of the environmental health category may express their concerns
   and voice their opinions through the EHOPAC.  The current members of
   the EHOPAC represent a cross-section of interests, professional
   experiences and responsibilities.  The more environmental health
   officers who contribute to PAC projects and activities, the more
   representative the products and policy recommendations will be.  If
   interested in joining, contact the EHOPAC Chairperson, CAPT Craig
   Shepherd at (615) 467-1535 or Craig.Shepherd@mail.ihs.gov.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officer Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill", COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and an annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting,
   usually held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet
   colleagues from other agencies/programs, to exchange scientific and
   career information, and to earn continuing education credits.  For
   membership information, please call (301) 731-9080 or visit COA's web
