FOUR TROPICAL STORMS DEVELOPED IN OCTOBER...ONE OF WHICH BECAME A
HURRICANE.  IN ADDITION...THERE WAS ONE TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

LORENA DEVELOPED FROM A TROPICAL WAVE EARLY ON THE 2ND...BECOMING A
DEPRESSION ABOUT 400 MILES SOUTHWEST OF ACAPULCO MEXICO.  MOVING
SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...THE DEPRESSION STRENGTHENED INTO A
TROPICAL STORM LATER THAT DAY ABOUT 500 MILES SOUTH OF MANZANILLO
MEXICO.  LORENA TURNED NORTHWESTWARD ON THE 3RD AND MOVED PARALLEL
TO THE COAST OF MEXICO.  IT PEAKED AT 50 KT LATER THAT DAY ABOUT 200
MILES SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO.  AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING
TURNED THE CYCLONE TOWARD THE NORTH AND ALSO INDUCED STRONG VERTICAL
SHEAR ACROSS THE CYCLONE.  LORENA RAPIDLY WEAKENED BACK TO TROPICAL
DEPRESSION STATUS EARLY ON THE 4TH AND EVENTUALLY SHEARED APART AND
DISSIPATED LATER THAT SAME DAY ABOUT 140 MILES SOUTHWEST OF PUERTO
VALLARTA MEXICO.  THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF DAMAGE OR CASUALTIES.

SHORT-LIVED TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOURTEEN-E DEVELOPED FROM A
DISTURBANCE IN THE INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE...BECOMING A
DEPRESSION ON THE 3RD ABOUT 800 N MI SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS.
THE DEPRESSION MOVED TO THE WEST AND DISSIPATED THE NEXT DAY.

MANUEL WAS A WEAK AND DISORGANIZED SYSTEM THAT FORMED FROM THE
REMNANTS OF ATLANTIC HURRICANE IRIS...BECOMING A DEPRESSION ON THE
10TH ABOUT 175 N MI SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF ACAPULCO MEXICO.  MOVING TO
THE WEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST...THE SYSTEM BECAME A TROPICAL STORM ON
THE 11TH ABOUT 200 N MI SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO.  A
FIRST PEAK INTENSITY...45 KT...WAS REACHED LATER THAT DAY.  PLAGUED
BY WIND SHEAR...MANUEL WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ON THE
12TH.  LITTLE CHANGE OCCURRED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WHILE
MANUEL MOVED TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST AND SLOWED.  AFTER TURNING TO THE
NORTHWEST...IT BECAME A TROPICAL STORM AGAIN ON THE 15TH AND REACHED
ITS PEAK INTENSITY OF 50 KT THE NEXT DAY ABOUT 550 N MI SOUTHWEST OF
CABO SAN LUCAS.  MANUEL MOVED OVER COOLER WATERS AND WEAKENED TO A
DEPRESSION ON THE 17TH AND DISSIPATED EARLY ON THE 18TH.

NARDA BECAME A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ON THE 20TH A LITTLE MORE THAN
1000 N MI SOUTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA AND
QUICKLY BECAME A TROPICAL STORM.  NARDA MOVED TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST AND WEST AND INTENSIFIED...REACHING A PEAK INTENSITY
OF 75 KNOTS ON THE 22ND.  IT MAINTAINED HURRICANE STATUS FOR 24
HOURS BUT THEN WAS RAPIDLY WEAKENED BY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WINDS.
NARDA DISSIPATED ON THE 25TH JUST AFTER CROSSING 140 W INTO THE
CENTRAL PACIFIC TROPICAL CYCLONE BASIN.

OCTAVE DEVELOPED OUT OF LARGE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER ABOUT 1000 N
MI SOUTHWEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS ON THE 31ST.  AT MONTHS END IT WAS
MOVING TO THE NORTHWEST AND GAINING STRENGTH.
