     The Appalachian Regional Commission was established by Congress in
   1965 to support economic and social development in the Appalachian
   Region.

   The Commission is a unique partnership composed of the governors of the
   13 Appalachian states and a presidential appointee representing the
   federal government. Grassroots participation is provided through local
   development districtsÂ—multi-county organizations with boards made up of
   elected officials, businesspeople, and other local leaders.

   ARC PROJECTS

   ARC undertakes projects that address the five goals identified by ARC
   in its strategic plan:

   1. Developing a knowledgeable and skilled population

   2. Strengthening the Region's physical infrastructure

   3. Building local and regional capacity

   4. Creating a dynamic economic base

   5. Fostering healthy people

   To meet these goals, ARC helps fund such projects as education and
   workforce training programs, highway construction, water and sewer
   system construction, leadership development programs, small business
   start-ups and expansions, and development of health-care resources.

   HOW ARC WORKS

   Each year Congress appropriates funds, which ARC allocates among its
   member states. The Appalachian governors submit to ARC their state
   spending plans for the year, which include lists of projects they
   recommend for funding. The spending plans are reviewed and approved at
   a meeting of all the governors and the federal co-chairman.

   The next step is approval of individual projects by the ARC federal
   co-chairman. After the states submit project applications to ARC, each
   project is reviewed by ARC program analysts. The process is completed
   when the federal co-chairman reviews a project and formally approves
   it.
