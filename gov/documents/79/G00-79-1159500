   Attorney General Mike Fisher Now in his second four-year term as
   Pennsylvania's top law enforcement agent, Mike Fisher has always been
   clear that his number one responsibility as Attorney General is to
   ensure that our state continues to be a safe place for people to live
   and work.

   Attorney General Fisher has a key role in the struggle against
   terrorism - serving on Governor Mark Schweiker's new Task Force on
   Security and also on the federal Anti-Terrorism Task Forces which have
   been formed by Pennsylvania's three U.S. Attorneys.

   Attorney General Mike Fisher Fighting drugs also remains a top priority
   for Mike Fisher, who has stressed that there will be "no holiday for
   drug dealers" in Pennsylvania because of our national focus on
   terrorism. He also emphasizes education and outreach - telling police,
   community groups and school students about new drug threats like "club
   drugs," heroin and the prescription pain-killer OxyContin.

   Mike Fisher has also been a strong watchdog on health issues. He not
   only helped to negotiate the national $206 billion tobacco settlement,
   but also fought vigorously to ensure that every cent of Pennsylvania's
   share is spent on public health services. In addition, Mike Fisher's
   Health Care Unit has now saved consumers more than $2 million by
   requiring health insurance companies and HMO's to provide vital
   services.

   Attorney General Mike Fisher A Pittsburgh native, Mike Fisher spent 22
   years in the Pennsylvania General Assembly representing the South Hills
   suburbs. He is a graduate of Georgetown University, earning a
   bachelor's degree in 1966 and a law degree in 1969.

   Attorney General Fisher and his wife Carol are the parents of two
   children, Michelle, an attorney in Pittsburgh, and Brett, a recent
   graduate of Penn State.
