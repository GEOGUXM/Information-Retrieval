   Description: The skies over Northern India are filled with a thick soup
   of aerosol particles all along the southern edge of the Himalayan
   Mountains, and streaming southward over Bangladesh and the Bay of
   Bengal. Notice that the air over the Tibetan Plateau to the north of
   the Himalayas is very clear, whereas the view of the land surface south
   of the mountains is obstructed by the brownish haze. Most of this air
   pollution comes from human activities. The aerosol over this region is
   notoriously rich in sulfates, nitrates, organic and black carbon, and
   fly ash. These particles not only represent a health hazard to those
   people living in the region, but scientists have also recently found
   that they can have a significant impact on the region's hydrological
   cycle and climate (click to read the relevant NASA press release).

   This true-color image was acquired on December 4, 2001, by the
   Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), flying aboard
   NASAÂ’s Terra satellite. It is interesting to compare the image above
   with this earlier MODIS image over the region, acquired on October 23,
   2001. Notice the difference in the clarity of the air over the region
   in the earlier image.

   Under the thick plume of aerosol, the Brahmaputra (upper right) and
   Ganges Rivers are still visible. The many mouths of the Ganges have
   turned the northern waters of the Bay of Bengal a murky brown as they
   empty their sediment-laden waters into the bay. Toward the upper
   lefthand corner of the image, there appears to be a fresh swath of snow
   on the ground just south of the Himalayas.
