The FEMCI Book
     __________________________________________________________________

   If you have questions about any of these methods, then send me a
   message and your question will be forwarded around until an answer can
   be found.

   As always, if you can contribute to the Book, then please do (even if
   you're not a Goddard structrual analyst!). The sole purpose of these
   pages is to educate people in the art of finite element modeling and
   analysis. Any and all assistance will be appreciated.

   We have received a few requests for a "copy" of the FEMCI Book. You're
   reading it! There is no physical book, but rather this web page. It
   started out a few years ago as a three-ring binder "book" but was made
   100% electronic with the creation of the FEMCI website.
