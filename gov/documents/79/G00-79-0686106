       Cox Sole Californian Given Top Marks For High-Tech Friendliness

                         The Bulletin's Frontrunner

   March 20, 2001

   The Alameda Times-Star (3/19, Friedman) reported that after "months of
   watching members of Congress try to position themselves as tech-
   friendly, a computer-industry research tank has named only one
   Californian as a high-tech powerbroker. And he's not even from Silicon
   Valley."

   Rep. Christopher Cox (R- CA) of Newport Beach "raked in the highest
   marks from Forrester Research Inc., for his work pushing tax- free
   Internet services and using his position on the House Energy and
   Commerce Committee to do it."
