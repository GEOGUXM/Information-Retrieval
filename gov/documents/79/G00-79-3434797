   Photography of Jupiter began in January 1979, when images of the
   brightly banded planet already exceeded the best taken from Earth.
   Voyager 1 completed its Jupiter encounter in early April, after taking
   almost 19,000 pictures and many other scientific measurements. Voyager
   2 picked up the baton in late April and its encounter continued into
   August. They took more than 33,000 pictures of Jupiter and its five
   major satellites.
