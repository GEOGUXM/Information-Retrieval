   HURDAT Web App
   [hurdat_small.gif]
   Lead Developer:
   Nicholas Carrasco
   Year: 2001 The HURDAT Web App is being used as a feasiblity
   study/protoype for the future of H*Wind. Used to determine the power of
   Sun Microsystems Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). The goal
   is to move H*Wind to a Web-based application viewable/usable from
   almost any standard web browser. There are no known requirements needed
   to run the HURDAT Web App, but it is best viewed from a broswer with at
   least the dimensions of 800X600.
   HRD Best Track Storm Page
   [besttrack2.gif]
   Lead Developer:
   Luis Amat
   Year: 1997 This demo was used as a feasiblity study to determine
   whether Sun Microsystems Java Platform would be a suitible platform for
   moving HRD's Surface Wind Analysis Application (WANDA) to. Although
   reading the documentation itself does not require it, exploration
   beyond the textual level may require that your browser have the
   capability to run Java applets. We suggest downloading the latest
   version of a Java enabled browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer
   that supports a 1.1.x Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

                       Get Netscape! or Get Explorer!
