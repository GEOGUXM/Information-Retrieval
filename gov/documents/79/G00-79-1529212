Surface Water

     The USGS currently maintains around 88 full time stream-gaging
     stations in Alaska and about 40 "partial-record" stations used for
     peak flow data collection.

Ground Water

     The USGS currently monitors ground-water levels at around 189
     locations in Alaska. The USGS maintains a computerized data base
     which contains information on more than 18,000 wells or springs
     located through Alaska.

Water Quality

     The USGS collects water-quality data at several locations in Alaska.
     The USGS data base contains chemical-analysis information on more
     than 2,100 surface-water sites and more than 2,300 ground-water
     sites in Alaska

Water Index

     This index is a list of sites throughout Alaska at which streamflow,
     lake-level, and water-quality data have been collected by the USGS

Glaciers

     The USGS collects meteorological, mass balance, and runoff data on
     selected glaciers.

Water Use

     The USGS collects, stores, and disseminates water-use data that will
     complement water-availability and water-quality data currently
     collected under ongoing programs for Alaska and the nation.

Hydrologic Data Reports

     Every year an annual report is published on the water resources for
     Alaska.

Projects

     The USGS frequently collects or compiles additional specialized data
     for specific projects such as glacier data or environmental data
