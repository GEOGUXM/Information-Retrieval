  Tips on searching effectively
     __________________________________________________________________

   You may use a single word or multiple words when searching the MedPAC
   website. Each search will check documents, including reports and public
   meeting agendas, as well as other material. Here are some guidelines to
   follow.
     * Searches are not case sensitive.
     * Search criteria may include a phrase such as "access to care"
     * To identify documents containing all of several individual words,
       use the AND operator. For example, the search criteria "access AND
       care" will identify documents that contain both words, whether they
       appear separately or together.
     * Other operators available when searching documents include OR and
       NOT, as well as the * and ? wildcard operators. For example, the
       search criteria "polic*" will return documents containing "police",
       "policy" and "policies". The search criteria "polic?" will return
       only "police" and "policy" but not "policies".

   The documents found as a result of your search will be listed in
   descending order based on the search engine's estimate of their
   relevance to your search criteria. At the end of the list, links to
   additional relevant website content, if any, will be displayed
   Note: In above examples, the quotes are simply to highlight criteria.
   Quotes are not required when searching.
