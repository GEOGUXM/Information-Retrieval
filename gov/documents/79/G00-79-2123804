   FEATURED PROJECT:
          In 1998, a 5-mile reach of the Jacks Fork from the town of
          Eminence to its confluence with the Current River was included
          on Missouri's list of impaired waters as required by Section
          303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act. The U.S. Geological
          Survey, in cooperation with the National Park Service and
          Missouri Department of Natural Resources, is conducting a study
          to better understand the extent the intense recreational use of
          the Jacks Fork may be having on the river. (For more
          information, contact Jerri V. Davis@ (573) 308-3829).
