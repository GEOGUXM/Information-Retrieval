   Background

      For over sixty years, the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
      system has served as the structure for the collection, aggregation,
      presentation, and analysis of the US economy. An industry consists of a
   group of establishments primarily engaged in producing or handling the
   same product or group of products or in rendering the same services.
   Industry definitions used in BLS programs come from the 1987 Standard
   Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual. Because the SIC is used by many
   other federal government statistical programs, it is possible for users
   to assemble a comprehensive statistical picture of an industry.

   The SIC system was developed in the 1930's at a time when manufacturing
   dominated the US economic scene. Over the last 60 years, there have
   been numerous revisions to the SIC system, reflecting the economy's
   changing industrial composition. However, despite these revisions, the
   system has received increasing criticism about its ability to handle
   rapid changes in the US economy. Recent developments in information
   services, new forms of health care provision, expansion of services,
   and high tech manufacturing are examples of industrial changes that
   cannot be studied under the current SIC system.

Introducing NAICS

   Developed in cooperation with Canada and Mexico, the North American
   Industry Classification System (NAICS) represents one of the most
   profound changes for statistical programs focusing on emerging economic
   activities. NAICS, developed using a production-oriented conceptual
   framework, groups establishments into industries based on the activity
   in which they are primarily engaged. Establishments using similar raw
   material inputs, similar capital equipment, and similar labor are
   classified in the same industry. In other words, establishments that do
   similar things in similar ways are classified together.

   NAICS provides a new tool that ensures that economic statistics reflect
   our Nations changing economy. However, improved statistics will result
   in time series breaks. Every sector of the economy has been
   restructured and redefined: A new Information sector combines
   communications, publishing, motion picture and sound recording, and
   online services, recognizing our information-based economy.
   Manufacturing is restructured to recognize new high-tech industries. A
   new sub-sector is devoted to computers and electronics, including
   reproduction of software. Retail Trade is redefined. In addition,
   eating and drinking places are transferred to a new Accommodation and
   Food Services sector. The difference between Retail and Wholesale is
   now based on how each store conducts business. For example, many
   computer stores are reclassified from wholesale to retail. Nine new
   service sectors and 250 new service industries are recognized.

NAICS Coding Structure

   NAICS uses a six digit hierarchical coding system to classify all
   economic activity into twenty industry sectors. Five sectors are mainly
   goods-producing sectors and fifteen are entirely services-producing
   sectors. This six digit hierarchical structure allows greater coding
   flexibility than the four digit structure of the SIC. NAICS allows for
   the identification of 1,170 industries compared to the 1,004 found in
   the SIC system. See also: Report on the American Workforce, Chapter 3.
