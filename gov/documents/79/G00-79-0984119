   BNL Physics Applications Software (PAS) Group
                                BNL Physics Dept

   The Physics Applications Software (PAS) Group in the BNL Physics
   Department provides physics software development capability and
   expertise to the BNL HEP program and in particular the ATLAS
   experiment. The group plays a leading role in the U.S. ATLAS software
   project; contributes to the detector development and physics analysis
   activities of BNL ATLAS; and provides software support and expertise
   for the U.S. ATLAS community, complementing the U.S. ATLAS Tier 1
   Computing Facility at BNL. Many members of the group participated (or
   still participate) in software development and management in the STAR
   experiment at RHIC.

  Group activities

   Principal participants are indicated; see the list of group members
       below. Many activities take place in collaboration with the Omega
       group, particularly with Hong Ma and Srini Rajagopalan. Also
       participating is Victor Perevoztchikov of the BNL STAR core
       software group who spends part of his time working with the PAS
       group.
