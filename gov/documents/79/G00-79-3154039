   International Lunar Workshop Declaration

                                           Science Experiment on Lunar Surface

   On the initiative of Switzerland and the European Space Agency,
   representatives from space agencies, scientific institutions and
   industry from around the world met in Beatenberg, Switzerland from 31
   May to 3 June 1994 to consider plans for the implementation of
   internationally coordinated programmes for robotic and human Lunar
   Exploration.

    THE MEETING WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE RICH OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY THE
    EXPLORATION AND UTILISATION OF THE MOON.

                               [turqline.gif]

     * The uniqueness of the Earth-Moon system was emphasised and the
       potential of the Moon as a natural long-term space-station was
       recognised.
     * The Workshop agreed that the time is right, scientifically and
       technologically, for a staged lunar programme implemented in
       evolutionary phases, the first phase involving science, technology,
       and resource exploration missions. The initial phases of the
       programme, involving Moon orbiters and landers with roving robots,
       are within the capabilities of the various individual space
       agencies technically and financially; but the benefits,
       scientifically and technologically, would be greatly enhanced by
       close coordination. Each phase should set the task for the next
       one, but will be fully justified on its own merits without being in
       any way dependent on the follow-on.
     * Strong interest was expressed in the science of the Moon
       (illuminating the history of the Earth-Moon system), from the Moon
       (for astronomical projects), and on the Moon (biological reactions
       to low gravity and the unique radiation environment).
     * The phased evolutionary approach allows the differences of opinion
       over the role of humans in space and the economic utilisation of
       the Moon to be assessed later in the light of results from earlier
       phases. As the programme progresses, it is possible that the
       attractions and benefits of human presence on the Moon will become
       clearly apparent. It is evident, however, that the Moon would
       represent the next logical step and a testbed in any plans of human
       expansion into the solar system.
     * The Workshop concluded that existing launcher systems would permit
       the implementation of the initial phases. The significant
       technological advances required in areas such as robotics,
       telepresence, and teleoperations will certainly find scientific and
       industrial applications on Earth.
     * The Workshop agreed that the objectives of the programme can be
       accomplished while at the same time protecting the lunar
       environment.
     * The Workshop concluded that current international space treaties
       provide a constructive legal regime within which to conduct
       peaceful scientific exploration and economic utilisation of the
       Moon, including
       the establishment of permanent scientific bases and observatories.

   In conclusion the Workshop agreed that this is the right time:

     * to begin the first phase of the lunar programme
     * to prepare for future decision on later phases
     * to implement international coordination and cooperation
     * to establish, at a working level, a mechanism for regular
       coordination of activities.

   A second International Lunar Workshop will be held in mid-1996 to
   review progress and plans.
