           Carson Secures $1.75 Million For Second District Roads
              Projects Included In Transportation Approps. Bill

   Washington, D.C. --
        Second District Congressman Brad Carson (D-OK) announced today the
   funding of two major road improvement projects in Northeast Oklahoma.
   The funding was included in the FY 2002 Transportation Bill that passed
   the United States House of Representatives on Thursday and the bill is
   expected to pass the Senate later this week.

         Included in the Transportation Appropriations bill was $1.5
   million dollars for the improvement of over-all traffic flow for the
   U.S. Highway 412 between Insterstate 44 East to County Road 414 at Port
   33. The money will be used for preliminary engineering studies to
   improve the existing overpass at the U.S. Highway 412 and Interstate
   44, as well as to add a new overpass for the access entrance to Port
   33.

         U.S. Highway 412 is a National High Priority Corridor from Tulsa
   to Memphis, Tennessee. The National High Priority Corridors were
   developed to provide safe and efficient movements for commercial
   vehicle increases anticipated from the North American Free Trade
   Agreement.

         I cannot even count the number of workers who travel highway 412
   to work or the small business who send goods up and down this highway
   who have contact me asking that attention be paid to U.S. 412, said
   Congressman Brad Carson. This corridor is a dangerous road to travel
   and there are definite steps that can be taken to improve the safety
   and the traffic flow. I am pleased to announce that this $1.5 million
   will be a major step in achieving those goals of safety and efficiency.

         Also included in the Transportation Appropriations Bill was
   $250,000 to begin an initial study to be done on the Grand Lake
   Recreation Area. This study will look at the traffic flow along state
   highway 82, as well as the general traffic flow around the Grand Lake
   Recreation Area during the peak traffic season.

         The Grand Lake is the fastest growing part of Oklahoma, said
   Congressman Carson. This area has done an excellent job in building
   themselves as a first rate place to visit, shop, and live and we have
   to give them the infrastructure help they need to continuing expanding
   their local economy. We have to plan for the long term infrastructure
   needs of North and South Grand lake.
