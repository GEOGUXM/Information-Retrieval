   January 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   January 2001

   During January 2001, all of the index stations showed increases in
   monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Rainfall amounts of as
   much as 4 inches occurred over parts of the State and helped to sustain
   the monthly streamflow. In January, monthly streamflow in the northern
   part of the State increased from the previous monthly flows (35-50
   percent), and ranged from about 40-65 percent of normal. Monthly
   streamflow in central Georgia showed increases from the previous
   monthly flows (35-65 percent), and ranged from about 35-55 percent of
   normal. Monthly streamflow in the southern part of the State showed
   increases from the previous monthly flows (15-50 percent), and ranged
   from about 25-55 percent of normal. For the month of January, none of
   the 15-index streamflow stations recorded new minimum monthly flows of
   record or an all time minimum daily flow. This was only the second
   month since May 2000 that no record low-flows were recorded at any of
   the index sites.

   February 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   February 2001

   During February 2001, most of the index stations showed decreases in
   monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. No significant
   rainfall occurred to help sustain the monthly streamflow. In February,
   monthly streamflow in the northern part of the State decreased from the
   previous monthly flows (40-65 percent of normal), and ranged from about
   40-55 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in central Georgia showed
   decreases from the previous monthly flows (35-55 percent of normal),
   and ranged from about 30-50 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in
   the southern part of the State showed decreases from the previous
   monthly flows (25-55 percent of normal), and ranged from about 15-35
   percent of normal. For the month of February, only 2 of the 15-index
   streamflow stations recorded new minimum monthly flows of record.
     * Upatoi Creek near Columbus - 250 cubic feet per second (cfs),
     * Ichawaynochaway Creek near Milford - 373 cfs.

   No index stations recorded an all time minimum daily flow.

   March 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   March 2001

   During March 2001, all of the index stations showed a significant
   increase in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received about 3-5 inches of rain for the month, which helped
   to raise monthly streamflow across the State. In March, monthly
   streamflow in the northern part of the State increased significantly
   from the previous monthly flows (40-55 percent of normal), and ranged
   from about 60-160 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in central
   Georgia showed significant increases from the previous monthly flows
   (30-50 percent of normal), and ranged from about 100-160 percent of
   normal. Monthly streamflow in the southern part of the State showed
   significant increases from the previous monthly flows (15-35 percent of
   normal), and ranged from about 80-130 percent of normal. For the month
   of March, no new minimum monthly or minimum daily streamflow were
   recorded. In fact, this was the first month since about May 1999 that
   the streamflow across the State was near or above normal.
                 __________________________________________

   April 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   April 2001

   During April 2001, all of the index stations showed a significant
   decreases in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received less than the normal amount of rainfall for the
   month, which caused lower monthly streamflow across the State. In
   April, monthly streamflow in the northern part of the State decreased
   significantly from the previous monthly flows (about 60-160 percent of
   normal), and ranged from about 45-100 percent of normal. Monthly
   streamflow in central Georgia showed significant decreases from the
   previous monthly flows (about 100-160 percent of normal), and ranged
   from about 50-115 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in the southern
   part of the State showed significant decreases from the previous
   monthly flows (about 80-130 percent of normal), and ranged from about
   40-120 percent of normal. For the month of April, no new minimum
   monthly or minimum daily streamflow were recorded. This is only the
   second month since about May 1999 that the streamflow across the State
   was near or above normal.

   May 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   May 2001

   During May 2001, all of the index stations showed a significant
   decreases in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received less than the normal amount of rainfall for the
   month, which caused lower monthly streamflow across the State. In May,
   monthly streamflow in the northern part of the State decreased
   significantly from the previous monthly flows (about 45-100 percent of
   normal), and ranged from about 35-60 percent of normal. Monthly
   streamflow in central Georgia showed significant decreases from the
   previous monthly flows (about 50-115 percent of normal), and ranged
   from about 35-55 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in the southern
   part of the State showed significant decreases from the previous
   monthly flows (about 40-120 percent of normal), and ranged from about
   4-50 percent of normal.

   For the month of May, only 1 of the 15-index streamflow stations
   recorded new minimum monthly flows of record.
     * Chattooga River near Clayton - 282 cubic feet per second.

   No index stations recorded an all time minimum daily flow.

   June 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   June 2001

   During June 2001, all of the index stations showed a significant
   increases in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received greater than the normal amount of rainfall for the
   month, which caused higher monthly streamflow across the State. In
   June, monthly streamflow in the northern part of the State increased
   significantly from the previous monthly flows (about 35-60 percent of
   normal), and ranged from about 40-160 percent of normal. Monthly
   streamflow in central Georgia showed significant increases from the
   previous monthly flows (about 35-55 percent of normal), and ranged from
   about 70-180 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in the southern part
   of the State showed significant increases from the previous monthly
   flows (about 4-50 percent of normal), and ranged from about 25-140
   percent of normal. For the month of June, none of the 15-index
   streamflow stations recorded a new monthly or daily minimum flow of
   record.

   July 2001 streamflow at selected gages for Georgia

   July 2001

   During July 2001, all of the index stations showed a significant
   decreases in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received about the normal amount of rainfall for the month,
   which resulted in lower monthly streamflow across the State. In July,
   monthly streamflow in the northern part of the State decreased
   significantly from the previous monthly flows (about 40-160 percent of
   normal), and ranged from about 40-100 percent of normal. Monthly

   During August 2001, most of the index stations showed a significant
   decrease in monthly mean streamflow from the previous month. Most of
   the State received less than the normal amount of rainfall for the
   month, which resulted in lower monthly streamflow across the State. In

   September 2001

   During September 2001, most of the index stations showed no significant
   increase or decrease in monthly mean streamflow from the previous
   month. Most of the State received less than the normal amount of
   rainfall for the month, which resulted in somewhat lower monthly
   streamflow across parts of the State. In September, monthly streamflow
   in the northern part of the State remained about the same as for the
   previous monthly flows (about 35-75 percent of normal), and ranged from
   about 40-75 percent of normal. Monthly streamflow in central Georgia
