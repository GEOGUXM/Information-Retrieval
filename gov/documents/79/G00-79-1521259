   Energy Crossroads is Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's
   contribution to organizing a wide array of pointers to
   energy-efficiency resources on the World Wide Web. Energy Crossroads
   currently contains about 700 links to other Web sites.

   It is our wish to make this site the best qualified and annotated list
   of Internet resources on energy efficiency. To do this we invite your
   help. As you find energy-efficiency resources on the Internet that are
   not on Energy Crossroads please send the name, URL and a brief
   description of the site you would like listed. (Submissions
   pre-formatted in HTML are encouraged.) We will then add it to the list
   and everyone will benefit. Energy Crossroads is compiled by Evan Mills.

   Thank you.
