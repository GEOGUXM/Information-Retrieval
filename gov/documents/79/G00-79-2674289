   This is the "Table of Contents" for the Sassafras Online Documentation
   set. Each listed item points to a document containing information on a
   particular aspect of installing and running a KeyServer. Each document
   contains internal "hyperlinks" that allow you to move easily between
   the different sections of that document, or to link to other documents
   in the set.

   In practice, it's probably easiest to think of the documentation "set"
   as one large document that you navigate with the mouse. You're already
   in that document and are free to move about as you wish.

     NOTE: Hold down the option key as you click on a link between
     documents. Doing so opens the new document in a separate window, and
     you can then move back and forth between windows without having to
     re-open the original each time.

   documentation.
