   How is Financial Aid Awarded?

   Student financial aid programs are a valuable financial resource for
   eligible students to access postsecondary education; however, families
   still are responsible for assisting with their students' total
   educational costs.

   Student financial aid is based on demonstrated financial need, academic
   achievement, ability, or academic major. Financial need is calculated
   by a standard federal formula:

     Cost of Attendance
     - Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
     = Financial Need

   Your cost of attendance, determined by each school, includes tuition,
   fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other school-related
   expenses.

   Your expected family contribution is what the federal government
   expects you and your family to contribute toward your educational
   expenses.
     * Your EFC is calculated when you complete the Free Application for
       Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
     * Your EFC is not the amount you must pay your school.
     * You can estimate your EFC with the College Board's EFC Estimator

   Some financial aid programs base awards on academic achievement,
   abilities (like athletic or artistic talents), or your academic major.
   Eligibility for each of these programs normally is based on standards
   determined by the school, a state agency, or a private organization.

   Application Procedures and Guidelines

   First-time students: To apply for most financial aid, you must complete
   a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You can obtain a
   copy of the FAFSA from your high school counselor, from a college or
   university financial aid office or by calling (800) 4-FED-AID or you
   can also complete the FAFSA online . You should complete and submit the
   FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1. Most schools have an
   application deadline early in the spring before the start of the
   upcoming academic year. Check with the school you plan to attend about
   application deadlines and submitting the FAFSA. Once the FAFSA is
   processed, you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) in the mail.
   Submit the signed SAR to your school as soon as possible, keeping a
   copy for yourself.

   Transfer students:

   If you received financial aid at a previous school, it will not
   automatically transfer to your new school. If you already completed a
   FAFSA during the current academic year and you decide to transfer,
   notify your new school of your previous attendance at another school so
   they can obtain your student financial aid history.  You may be
   required to provide a copy of your SAR. As a transfer student, you must
   follow these procedures even if:
     * you did not complete your program of study at your previous school,
     * you did not receive financial aid at your previous school, or
     * your previous coursework will not count toward your new degree
       program.

   Renewal students:

   If you completed a FAFSA last year and are returning to the same
   school, contact your school's financial aid office about renewal
   application procedures. Most returning students will receive a renewal
   FAFSA. If you receive one, correct or complete it as necessary and
   return it as instructed. If you do not receive a renewal FAFSA by
   February, you will need to complete an original paper FAFSA or complete
   a FAFSA online.
