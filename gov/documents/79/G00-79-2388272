                                        [SAPHIRE]
                                 SAPHIRE Training Course
         The purpose of this area is to provide details about the SAPHIRE Basics
                                    training course.


       In addition to providing the SAPHIRE software and support, the SAPHIRE
      Users Group offers a comprehensive training course on the operational
      of the software. Interspaced with details on usage of the sotware, we
      provide instruction on the theory behind many of the analysis aspects
      of fault tree and event tree development.
      The SAPHIRE Basics course is taught on a periodic basis. Alternatively,
      organizations with five or more students may elect to conduct a
      training session tailored exclusively for your organization, with the
      class taught at your facility. Other User Group training sessions will
      be conducted at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
      Laboratory facilities in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
      Currently, the course costs $800 per person for those classes taught in
      Idaho Falls. For inquiries on training dates and costs associated with
      a course at your facility, please contact John Schroeder at (208)
      526-8755 or ROE@INEL.GOV.
