                    Labrador Sea - Ocean Winds Experiment
   In March of 1997, a field experiment was conducted over the Labrador
   Sea to gather polarimetric microwave radiometer data under high ocean
   wind conditions. The NASA Wallops Flight Facility P3-B aircraft,
   carried a sensor suite consisting of two scanning polarimetric
   radiometers (PSR and KaSPR), a down-looking polarimetric radiometer,
   and an uplooking radiometer. Also aboard were two microwave radars to
   provide comparisons between passive and active measurements of surface
   conditions.
