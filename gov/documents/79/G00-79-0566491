                    PLEASE NOTE: IMAGE FILE FORMAT CHANGE

  Beginning August 2000, the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of South
  Carolina now stores all document images in a new format. The new format,
  Portable Document Format (PDF), can be viewed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. The
  viewer software is free and can be downloaded from this site or from
  www.adobe.com.

   PDF is the format chosen by the Administrative Office of the U. S.
   Courts for use with the implementation of the Case
   Management/Electronic Case File (CM/ECF) system which will replace the
   existing BANCAP case management system and will include the ability to
   file cases electronically. Implementation of this new system is planned
   for the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of SC within the next
   12-24 months.

   The format change is necessary in order to be ready to implement the
   new system and to be compatible with other Administrative Office
   initiatives which also use PDF.

              TIPS ON VIEWING PDF FILES WITH INTERNET EXPLORER.
