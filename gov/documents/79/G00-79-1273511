   FY2000 Inaugurating the annual
   Institutional Awards for Science and Technology

   Awards for the discovery of element 114 and groundbreaking work in 3D
   simulation were presented to two teams of LLNL employees on October 31.
   Director Bruce Tarter and Deputy Director Jeff Wadsworth presented
   certificates, special memorabilia, and cash awards of $1000 to the team
   members. The FY2000 prize was the first of what will become an annual
   institutional award for notable Laboratory achievements in science and
   technology.

   Element 114 became the heaviest yet detected when a team of Russian
   scientists at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna,
   in collaboration with LLNL scientists, produced the superheavy element
   by bombarding a ^244plutonium target with a 48 calcium ion beam. The
   isotope of element 114 lasted 30 seconds, a huge lifetime when compared
   with the element 112-the heaviest superheavy element created
   previously-that decayed a hundred thousand times faster.

   This breakthrough result, achieved in December 1998 at the end of a
   40-day experiment, provided the first experimental evidence to confirm
   long-standing predictions that a small group, or "island," of stable
   superheavy elements might exist beginning at element 114. Such an
   island of nuclear stability among neighboring highly unstable elements
   would give scientists enough time to study their nuclear structure and
   chemistry. The discovery of a relatively stable element exactly where
   predicted at 114 indicates that the island exists.

   Laboratory scientists have been collaborating with the Russians on the
   quest for element 114 since 1989. At JINR, the Russians have the
   accelerator required to produce the very high intensity 48calcium ion
   beam and the magnetic separator needed to isolate the reaction
   products. The LLNL team provided the exotic isotope 244plutonium and
   sophisticated detection and data acquisition systems. Using LLNL data
   codes, the Livermore team also performed independent data analysis of
   the results. The LLNL team was supported, in part, by Laboratory
   Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program funding.

   Earlier this year the LLNL team was honored for this discovery by both
   Chemical Engineering Newsand by Popular Science. Since the discovery of
   element 114, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory have produced
   superheavy elements 116 and 118.

   Using ASCI's high-performance supercomputing resources, a team of
   computer scientists, led by LLNL, won supercomputing's prestigious 1999
   Gordon Bell Prize for performance for their 3D simulation of fluid
   turbulence at an unprecedented level of resolution. The Gordon Bell
   Prize recognizes the most significant achievements in applying
   high-performance computers to scientific and engineering problems.

   The LLNL team, collaborating with the University of Minesota and IBM,
   conducted a series of 3D simulations using the ASCI IBM RS/6000 ST
   computer to emulate Richtyer-Meshkov mixing, which is the instability
   that occurs when a shock wave passes through the interface of two
   fluids with different mass densities. "Such high-resolution 3D
   simulations, when linked with experimental data, have the potential to
   lead to scientific breakthroughs in the study of supernova evolution,
   combustion physics and supersonic vehicle propulsion and dynamics,"said
   Bill Dannevik, prinicipal investigator on the project.

   Using nearly 6,000 of the supercomputer's processors, the calculations,
   which represent over 3 00 quadrillion arithmetic operations, took more
   than a week. to perform at a speed of 1.18 teraflops (trillion fl
   oating point operations per second).

   Meet the LLNL team

   The DOE has more than 600,000 drums of radioactive waste stored at 30
   sites across the nation, with thousands more containers on their way as
   more weapons complex facilities are dismantled. An LLNL-developed
   system that assays containers safely, accurately, and without having to
   open them has won an R&D 100 award for LLNL and its commercial partner,
   Bio-Imaging Research, Inc. (BIR) of Lincolnshire, IL. This prestigious
   award is presented each year by R&D Magazine to "the 100 most
   technologically significant new products and processes of the year."

   The award-winning Waste Inspection Tomography for Non-Destructive Assay
   (WIT-NDA) system was developed by a team of engineers and physicists
   headed by LLNL's Patrick Roberson and Harry Martz. The system combines
   active and passive computed tomography and nuclear spectroscopy to
   accurately quantify all detectable gamma rays emitted from waste
   containers. As recently as 10 years ago, researchers could accurately
   assays the contents of a waste drum only by sampling. For that they had
   to open the containers, which posed a risk to the workers and the
   public. Beginning in 1990, physicists Harry Martz and David Camp (now
   retired from LLNL) headed a team to research ways to measure the
   radioactivity of drum contents from the outside. The WIT-NDE system is
   the result. "This system is unique in that we don't need to open the
   container, we don't need any prior knowledge of the radioactive waste
   inside, and we don't have to calibrate the system to a specific waste
   stream," explains Roberson.

   WIT-NDA is part of BIR's mobile Waste Inspection Tomography system that
   provides waste assays for DOE and corporate customers. "The WID-NDA is
   an excellent example of successful technology transfer between a DOE
   national laboratory and a small private business," says Richard
   Bernardi, WIT program manager for BIR.
