   Landslide

   Landslides are termed the sleeper of all the geologic hazards. Though
   incited by snowmelt, rain, poor excavation or earthquakes, they
   sometimes startle the unsuspecting homeowner with the ferocity of their
   rapid movement, or the slow stretching of the once peaceful terrain.
   Landslides occur in all 50 states -- it is estimated that they cause
   between 25 and 50 deaths each year in the US and thousands more in
   vulnerable areas around the globe.
