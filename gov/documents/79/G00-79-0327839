   The Motor Pool controls the purchase, assignment and maintenance of
   (198) vehicles within the department.  The department employs one
   mechanic to provide most general service work, with other major repairs
   contracted out to private repair shops.  The vehicle fleet is managed
   daily by one Patrol Sergeant.  Our vehicle fleet consists of marked
   patrol units, unmarked units, motorcycles, vans and special DARE
   vehicles for parades and displays.
