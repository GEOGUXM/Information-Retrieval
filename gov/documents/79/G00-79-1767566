                          A program of the New York
State Archives, Rediscovering New York History & Culture aims to improve  the
    coverage and content  of New York's documentary heritage  and make it
 accessible to all.  We want to make sure that all the diverse communities,
   peoples, and events in  New York history are fully documented and that
  documentary evidence is  easily accessible for research and learning.  We
  want to help you to learn about your state, community and family history.
          You can also contribute information that may help others.
