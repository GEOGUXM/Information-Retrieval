   [clearspc.gif] Cantor Receives a Security Update from Richmond
   International Airport

   Airport officials led Cantor and the Seventh District Congressional
   Safety and Security Council on a tour of RIC to investigate and assess
   security readiness

   Richmond, VA, Jan. 10— Today, Richmond International Airport (RIC)
   officials led Congressman Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) and the Seventh
   District Congressional Safety and Security Council on an investigative
   tour of the airport.

   From inside the airport security checkpoint, surrounded by National
   Guard officials and security personnel, Cantor and airport officials
   described the safety upgrades that have taken place at the airport
   since September 11. Cantor, RIC President Jon Mathiasen, and Chairman
   of the Capital Region Airport Commission, Art Warren, also addressed
   airport plans to use two million dollars from this year’s Congressional
   transportation bill to widen the airport security checkpoint,
   increasing safety and reducing the waiting lines for passengers.

   Congressman Cantor echoed the message from President Bush that people
   in the community should feel safe to fly. Cantor added, "Just prior to
   the holiday traveling season, the President signed the new aviation
   security bill. As a result, several new security steps have been taken
   to enhance safety, which include moneys provided for additional air
   marshals to secure airlines and airports across America and a
   requirement that all security personnel be U.S. citizens."

   Cantor praised RIC for the steps the airport has already taken to beef
   up security. "Already, the Richmond airport has doubled the number of
   its security personnel," Cantor said. "With a new two million dollar
   appropriation in this year's transportation bill, this checkpoint will
   be widened and security enhanced even further."

   "Enhancing the security of our airport is an essential step toward
   rebuilding our Commonwealth’s and our nation’s economy. The Richmond
   airport’s management should be commended for their leadership in facing
   the challenges posed in the post-September 11 environment," Cantor
   concluded.

   Today’s visit is the first of several site visits the council will
   conduct to gather information for the public report that will be
   released early this year regarding recommendations for ways to guard
   against terrorism targets and vulnerabilities in the Seventh District.
   The Honorable Richard Glover of the Henrico County Board of Supervisors
   serves as Chairman of the Congressional Safety and Security Council,
   and Mr. Johnny Johnson of Market Place Holdings serves as Vice
   Chairman.
