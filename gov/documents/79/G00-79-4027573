     TIB News Archive - December 2001

     The following news items have previously appeared on the TIB web
     site.

     FY 2004 Priority Array Criteria Review

     December 6, 2001 - As part of TIB's on-going process, the criteria for
     selecting projects in our five funding programs (Arterial Improvement
     Program, Transportation Partnership Program, Small City Program, Small
     City Pedestrian Safety & Mobility Program, and Urban Pedestrian Safety
     & Mobility Program) are being reviewed this winter and spring. Once an
     analysis has been completed by TIB staff, the proposed changes in the
     criteria will be circulated among our local agency customers in
     February and March 2002 for comment. Once those comments are reviewed,
     a final recommendation will be presented to the Board in May, and will
     apply to the projects submitted in September 2002 for the FY 2004
     funding programs.
     If you would like to offer general comments prior to the draft changes
     being circulated, please contact Bob Moorhead, Assistant Director for
     Operations, at (360) 705-7593, or via e-mail at RobertM@tib.wa.gov.

     TIB’s 2002 Legislative Agenda

     December 5, 2001 - The TIB has set several focus points for its 2002
     Legislative Agenda.  This agenda consists of the following points:
       * The TIB is seeking re-appropriation of existing Transportation
         Improvement Account (TIA) and Urban Arterial Trust Account (UATA)
         fund balance. Additional appropriation authority is needed to meet
         expected level of grant reimbursements.
       * The TIB proposes a new program funded by new TIA revenue to address
         local projects in excess of $10 million. Local governments
         currently have great difficulty funding larger projects, yet such
         projects often offer significant transportation and land use
         benefits, particularly in urban centers.
       * Additional transportation funding for the state's smallest cities
         and towns. Small jurisdictions do not receive sufficient direct
         distributions of gas taxes to fund costly transportation projects.
       * Funding for the City and County Advanced Right of Way Account. The
         account allows agencies to purchase right of way in advance of
         construction.


     The Transportation Agencies Grant Team issues its report on
     transportation coordination

     December 5, 2001 - In its final recommendation, the Blue Ribbon
     Commission on Transportation (BRCT) recommended creating a one-stop
     funding center where all competitive funds, whether federal or state,
     are disbursed. In response, the Highways and Local Programs Service
     Center of the Department of Transportation, the Transportation
     Improvement Board, the County Road Administration Board, the Freight
     Mobility Strategic Investment Board, the Association of Washington
     Cities, and the Association of Washington Counties entered into a
     memorandum of understanding creating the Transportation Agency Grant
     (TAG) Team. Section 603 of ESSB 5327 gave legislative direction to the
     coordination of the efforts of the TAG Team.
     The TAG Team has set a goal of improving coordination and gaining
     efficiencies between state agencies that provide transportation
     funding. All of the agencies that entered into the agreement are
     committed to improving their own internal processes and have been
     successful in doing so. The goal of the TAG Team is to make continuous
     coordinated improvements to the benefit of our collective customers.
     This is a shift in perspective, away from pursuing local improvement to
     one in which we seek global improvements. It has been said the “devil
     is in the details”; the TAG Team believes that within the details are
     the opportunities for improvement.
     A number of items have already been accomplished:
     • Construction and marketing of the Infrastructure Assistance
     Coordinating Committee’s infrastructure funding web site. The website
     contains a number of features that simplify the search for funds and
     technical assistance.
     • Coordinated staff training on all state grants and loans available.
     Every staff member of the agencies in the TAG Team will be able to
     direct local agencies to additional funding and technical sources.
     • A pilot program to swap state and federal funds is being developed by
     the TIB and H&LP. This would remove the delay and costs associated with
     federal funds in what would otherwise be a state and locally funded
     project.
     • Local agencies have been surveyed to determine what time of year is
     most convenient when applying for grants and loans. Through the survey,
     it has been determined that given enough notice, local agencies can
     incorporate a grant submittal into their work schedule.
     • Expand the TAG Team to include the expertise of the Public Works
     Board.
     The TAG Team is targeting a number of significant improvements:
     • Complete the pre-proposal process where local agencies can submit a
     one page application for funding and be directed to the correct state
     funding partners. Applications will be packaged to be more competitive,
     increasing their potential for state funding. This item addresses the
     concerns local agencies have regarding the complexity of the current
     application process.
     • Coordinate local agency training and support. Training workshops will
     be offered providing local agencies with a global perspective of
     available technical and funding sources.
     • Develop a process for an earlier notice of project calls. Local
     agencies will be given earlier notice of future funding programs so
     they can schedule the development of an application within their
     existing work plan.
     • Establish a team of program experts that would be responsible for
     answering questions from local agencies and other interested parties.
     The members of the TAG Team are committed to local and global
     improvements. This is a process of continuous improvement that will
     provide significant improvements to our local agency customers. As
     these incremental improvements gain mass, the system as a whole will
     reap the benefits.

     SeaTac’s South 28th/24th Avenue Project

     December 5, 2001 - SeaTac Mayor Shirley Thompson and other guests will
     cut the ribbon at 10 a.m. Wednesday, December 12th on the newly
     constructed South 28th/24th Avenue Project.
     The project widened and improved this arterial which connects 200th
     Street with SeaTac International Airport at 188th Street. The
     improvements addressed a longstanding need for a more complete local
     arterial network in the area south of the airport. The project also
     provides for connections in the future to the proposed extension of
     State Route 509. A grant from the Washington State Transportation
     Improvement Board (TIB) provided $9.6 million of the $20 million cost
     of the improvements, with the balance of the funding coming from the
     City of SeaTac, the Port of Seattle, a local improvement district, and
     private utilities.

     Council (IACC)

     Conference, TIB employee Gregg Plummer was given a plaque for his
