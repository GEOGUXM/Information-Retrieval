   California City and County Sales and
              Use Tax Rates

   California has many special taxing jurisdictions (districts), which are
   funded by a transactions (sales) and use tax rate that is added to the
    standard statewide rate of 7.25%, effective January 1, 2002. The tax
    rates for these districts range from 0.125% to 0.50% per district. In
    some areas, there is more than one district tax in effect. In others,
                     there is no district tax in effect.

   As a seller, you are required to report and pay the applicable district
     taxes for your taxable sales and purchases (for more information on
    district taxes and how they are applied, you should read Publication
   44, Tax Tips for District Taxes or Publication 105, District Taxes and
                              Delivered Sales.)

     Publication 71, California City and County Sales and Use Tax Rates,
   provides information about errors which can occur when using a Zip Code
      or mailing address to determine a sales tax rate, recent tax rate
    changes, the history of sales and use tax rates, rates and effective
   dates of district taxes, and the combined sales, use, and district tax
            rate in certain cities and communities in California.
