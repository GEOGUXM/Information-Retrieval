   Education:
     * 1973-75 Sierra College; major, Mathematics; A.A. 1975
     * 1975-77 San Jose State University; major, Meteorology; B.S. 1977
     * 1977-82 Utah State University; major, Biometeorology; M.S. 1980;
       Ph.D. 1982
     * 1991-92 USDA Graduate School, Systems Engineering Training Program

   Research Goals:
     * To determine the impact of insect emergence and dispersal in
       areawide pest infestations
     * To develop predictive models of insect emergence and dispersal
     * To develop algorithms for applying new operational technologies,
       such as NEXRAD Doppler weather radars, for the surveillance of
       migrating insect pests, and
     * To design areawide pest management systems for field crop insect
       species.

   Duties:

     Dr. Westbrook conducts meteorological and remote sensing
   investigations of the build-up and dispersal of insect populations.  He
   coordinates the operation of several entomological (X-band) radars,
   atmospheric radiosonde systems, automatic weather stations, and
   videographic recorders.  He develops insect emergence and dispersal
   models which are incorporated with field measurements of plant
   distributions, weather, insect populations, and geophysical
   characteristics for analysis and display in a geographic information
   system.  He currently serves as the coordinator of the USDA/ARS Virtual
   Project on Migration and Dispersal of Heliothis / Helicoverpa.
