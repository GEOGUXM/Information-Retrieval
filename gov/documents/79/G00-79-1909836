                             ARM Value-Added Products

      Many of the scientific needs of the ARM project are met through the
      analysis and processing of existing data products into "Value-Added"
      products or VAPs. Despite extensive instrumentation deployed at the ARM
      CART sites, there will always be quantities of interest that are either
      impractical or impossible to measure directly or routinely. Physical
      models using ARM instrument data as inputs are implemented as VAPs and
      can help fill some of the unmet measurement needs of the program.
      Conversely, ARM produces some VAPs not in order to fill unmet
      measurement needs, but instead to improve the quality of existing
      measurements. In addition, when more than one measurement is available,
      ARM also produces "best estimate" VAPs. A special class of VAP called a
      Quality Measurement Experiment (QME) does not output geophysical
      parameters of scientific interest. Rather, a QME adds value to the
      input datastreams by providing for continuous assessment of the quality
      of the input data based on internal consistency checks, comparisons
      between independent similar measurements, or comparisons between
      measurement with modeled results, and so forth.

      Value-Added Products:
        Aerosols
        Atmospheric State
        Cloud Parameterization and Modeling
        Cloud Properties
        Instantaneous Radiative Flux
        Quality Control / Quality Measurement Expermiments (QME)
