   Mission Objectives:

             Click here for Additional Info on STS-101

             The primary mission objectives for STS-101 is to deliver
             supplies to the International Space Station, perform a spacewalk
             and then reboost the station from 230 statute miles to 250
             statute miles.

             Detailed objectives include ISS ingress/safety to take air
             samples, monitor carbon dioxide, deploy portable, personal fans,
             measure air flow, rework/modify ISS ducting, replace air
             filters, replace Zarya fire extinguishers and smoke detectors.
             Critical replacements, repairs and spares will also be done to
             replace four suspect batteries on Zarya, replace failed or
             suspect electronics for Zarya's batteries, replace Radio
             Telemetry System memory unit, replace port early communications
             antenna, replace Radio Frequency Power Distribution Box and
             clear Space Vision System target.

             The mission also includes incremental assembly/upgrades such as
             assembly of Strela crane, installation of additional exterior
             handrails, set up of center-line camera cable, installation of
             "Komparus" cable inserts and reseating the U.S. crane. Assembly
             parts, tools and equipment will also be transfered to the
             station and equipment stowed for future missions.

             The station will also be resuppled with water, a docking
             mechanism accessory kit, film and video tape for documentation,
             office supplies and personal items. Crew health maintenance
             items will also be transfered including exercise equipment,
             medical support supplies, formaldehyde monitor kit and a passive
             dosimetry system.

             If there is sufficient shuttle propellant following Atlantis'
             undocking from the ISS, a flyaround inspection will be performed
             prior to the Shuttle's final separation maneuver.

   Launch:

             Launch May 19, 2000 6:11 a.m. EDT. Launch window was 5 min

             On Friday, May 19, 2000 1:12 a.m. EDT, the crew had their
             pre-flight snack in the Operations and Checkout Building. At
             2:20 a.m EDT, they departed the Operations and Checkout Building
             (O&C) for Launch Pad 39-A. By 3:40 a.m. EDT, all communication
             checks between the Atlantis and the ground were completed and at
             3:56 a.m. EDT, the hatch was closed and locked for flight. At
             4:48 a.m. the white room crew closeout was complete and the
             closeout crew departed for the fallback area. Launched ontime at
             the opening of the window.

             On Wednesday, May 17, 2000, launch controllers added 23 1/2
             hours to the launch count at the T-11 hour built-in hold,
             slipping the launch of Shuttle Atlantis to Friday at about 6:12
             a.m. The decision followed a Tuesday evening postponement of the
             Air Force Atlas III launch and was part of an preplanned
             agreement between NASA and the Air Force. The Rotating Service
             Structure at the pad will move away from the vehicle at about 10
             a.m. on Thursday. Loading of the external tank with more than
             500,000 gallons of liquid propellant begins at about 8:47 p.m.
             5/18/2000. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 5/17/2000)

             On Tuesday, May 16, 2000, the launch date was rescheduled for
             Friday, May 19th, due to the scrub of the Atlas III/EUTELSAT
             launch.

             On Monday, May 15, 2000, the countdown clock picked up the count
             at the T-43 hour mark at 9:30 a.m. The seven member flight crew
             arrived at KSC on Sunday, May 14, 2000. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 5/10/2000)

             At 6:03 a.m. EDT on Wednesday April 26, fueling of the external
             tank began for the 3rd consecutive launch attempt and was
             completed at the T-minus 3 hour 20 minute mark at 9:11 a.m. EDT.
             At 9:31 a.m. EDT a red repair team was sent to the launch pad to
             restore redundancy to a heater system located in the base of the
             pad used to recirculate air as part of the liquid oxygen gaseous
             vent arm system. The crew replaced a blown fuse. At 10:29 a.m.
             EDT the crew sat down for a crew breakfast in the O&C building
             and prepared for a weather briefing. At 11:13 a.m. EDT, the
             weather briefing concluded with favorable weather forcasted at
             the launch site but marginal weather forcasted at the contigency
             landing sites. At 11:14 a.m. EDT, the crew began suit up
             operations. At 11:39 a.m. EDT, the crew departed the astronauts
             quarters and left for launch pad 39A. By 2:06 p.m. EDT the crew
             were all in their seats, the hatch closed and comm checks
             complete. At 2:24pm EDT (18:24 GMT) the countdown clock came out
             of the hold at the T-minus 20 minute mark and counted down to
             T-minus 9 minutes and holding. The mission management team was
             polled and the only issue being tracked was weather concerns at
             the TAL sites. During the hold at the T-minus 9 minute mark, the
             mission management team decided to scrub the 3:29 pm launch
             attempt for 4/26/2000 due to weather constraints at the TAL
             sites.

             At 6:30 a.m. on April 25, 2000, fueling of the external tank
             began in order to support a launch attempt at 3:52 pm.
             Communication checks were complete with the crew at 1:16pm EDT.
             At 1:24pm EDT a go was given to close the hatch. At 2:18pm EDT,
             at the T-minus 38 minute mark, Launch director Dave King called
             a scrub due to high winds at the SLS and launch pad. The launch
             team was told to prepare for a 24 hour scrub turnaround.

             At 4:07 p.m. the call was given to scrub the launch attempt for
             April 24, 2000, because of a cross wind violation at the Shuttle
             Landing Facility (SLF). A weather briefing will be conducting in
             order to determine if a 24, or a 48 hour scrub turn around would
             offer better weather conditions for the next launch attempt.

             At 2:04 pm on Monday, April 24, 2000. The hatch to Atlantis was
             closed in preparation for an on time launch at 4:15 PM EDT. The
             launch window is 5 minutes and 2 seconds. Therefore, the last
             opportunity for launch today will be at 4:22:19pm EDT.

             On Wednesday, April 19, 2000. Prelaunch processing efforts are
             going well at Launch Pad 39A. Ordnance installation and
             preliminary tests are complete. Last night, workers replaced two
             quick disconnects on gaseous nitrogen lines for auxiliary power
             units (APU) No. 1 and No. 2. The APU flight pressurization tests
             are complete and good. Pressure tests on the orbiter's reaction
             control system are also complete. Orbiter aft engine compartment
             close-outs are ongoing and managers expect the aft doors to be
             installed Friday. Launch controllers continue countdown
             preparations in the Launch Control Center. The crew arrives
             April 21 at 3 p.m. EDT and launch countdown begins at 7 p.m. on
             the same day.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/19/2000)

             Over the weekend (April 15-16,2000), Shuttle engineers completed
             the frequency response test that was required after the
             rudder/speed brake power drive unit replacement effort.
             Preliminary evaluation indicates that Shuttle Atlantis'
             hydraulic system is operating normally and that the PDU
             replacement was a success. Shuttle engineers continue to analyze
             the cause of the initial PDU failure to ensure that it was an
             isolated incident. At about 1 a.m. today, engineers completed a
             hot fire test of auxiliary power unit (APU) No. 1 confirming a
             successful hydraulic flex hose replacement. Tomorrow,
             technicians will also replace a quick disconnect located on an
             APU No. 2 gaseous nitrogen line. All three APUs will be brought
             up to flight pressure on Wednesday as part of standard prelaunch
             testing.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/17/2000)

             On Wednesday, March 29, 2000, program managers have selected
             April 24 as the target launch date for STS-101. This one-week
             delay will allow Mission Commander Jim Halsell to complete
             planned training activities, primarily T-38 and Shuttle Training
             Aircraft flights, which were delayed due to an ankle injury that
             occurred on March 15. Today's decision, made at the request of
             Halsell's management, provides additional time to complete that
             training prior to the scheduled launch. Halsell's recovery from
             what was termed a "moderate sprain" has been proceeding on or
             ahead of schedule. He will be evaluated for T-38 and Shuttle
             Training Aircraft flight status next week. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 3/29/2000)

             On Saturday, March 25, 2000, Shuttle Discovery was rolled out of
             the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A. Main engine No.
             1 leak checks are complete and the Flight Readiness Test is in
             work today. The Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test at KSC
             remains targeted for April 6 and 7. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 3/29/2000)

             On Friday, February 18, 2000, Atlantis' main propulsion system
             leak checks are complete. Today work began to install the
             transfer tunnel adapter in the orbiter's payload bay. Orbiter
             electrical wiring inspection, repair and protection continue.
             Managers named a modified STS-101 crew today to prepare the
             space station for the arrival of the Zvezda service module. The
             STS-101 crew includes Commander Jim Halsell, Pilot Scott
             Horowitz, and Mission Specialists Mary Ellen Weber, Jeffrey
             Williams, James Voss, Susan Helms and Yuri Usachev. Edward Tsang
             Lu, Yuri Ivanovich Malenchenko, and Boris Morukov had previously
             been assigned to the mission. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             2/18/2000)

             On Wednesday, January 26, 2000, This week, technicians removed a
             thruster from Atlantis' orbiter maneuvering system and
             installation of the new thruster is under way. Ammonia system
             leak and functional testing continues. Orbiter fuel cell tests
             are also ongoing. Wiring inspections and repairs continue in the
             orbiter's aft and midbody compartments. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 1/26/2000)

             On Friday, October 29, 1999, Shuttle managers announced that the
             launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-101 will occur
             no earlier than March 16. The wiring inspections and repair
             efforts that remaining on the orbiter, along with the unplanned
             replacement of the ammonia boiler will require time to
             accommodate the Shuttle's processing needs. Inspections of
             Atlantis' ammonia boiler this week revealed corrosion, which
             lead to the replacement decision. Evaluation of the orbiter's
             damaged elevons continues. The damaged parts will be replaced
             over the next several days with no additional impact to the
             schedule. Installation of the right hand orbital maneuvering
             system pod occurs this week (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             10/29/1999)

             On Thursday, October 7, 1999, with wiring inspections and
             repairs of Discovery and Endeavour nearing completion and
             similar work beginning on Atlantis, Shuttle program managers set
             new planning target launch dates for the next three Space
             Shuttle missions. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 10/7/1999)

             Orbiter Atlantis is being temporarily stored in VAB high bay 2,
             awaiting the departure of Shuttle Endeavour from OPF bay 2.
