Previous Directors for Our Camp



   Debra Jockisch  - Camp Director

   Debrah is a sixth grade science teacher at Orinda Intermediate School.
   Instead of a strict curriculum, the summer brims with a potpourri of
   activities. Jockisch follows a loose program that keeps the kids
   engaged in each session's scientific theme. "We have a lot of fun
   together," says Jockisch. "You're much freer with the kids over the
   summer since there are no tests."


   Gordon Ferguson - Camp Director

   Gordon has been a science teacher for twelve years and currently is
   chairperson of the Science Department at Chaboya Middle School in San
   Jose. Gordon's philosophy of teaching science to children is to "learn
   science by doing science". His goal for the camp is to create an
   environment rich in discovery with plenty of hands-on science
   activities and visits to the laboratories and experiments of Berkeley
   Lab researchers.
