   GAMS, the Guide to Available Mathematical Software, is a cross-index
   and virtual repository of mathematical and statistical software useful
   in science and engineering. For more information see background on the
   Gams project.

  HotGAMS!

   New! Improved! Slight UI improvements, and finally using the Jar
   format, so it should startup quicker.

   HotGAMS is our Java^(TM) powered GAMS client. Taking advantage of Java
   allows us to improve interactivity in conducting searches or exploring
   the problem hierarchy. We are particularly interested in is the
   situation where many similar, but not identical, pieces of software
   appear to meet the user's criterion. This issue of `refining' the
   search will be the subject of further research, with HotGAMS serving as
   the testbed - watch for future versions.

   Currently two variations on the theme are operational; They both
   require a Java enabled browser. They differ essentially in how they
   present the main interaction window, and where the URL's (for
   documentation, subroutine sources, etc) are displayed in the browser.

   o HotGAMS. This version appears on its own web page and displays URL's
          on the `next' page.

   o HotGAMS in a Frame. A compact HotGAMS that appears within a
          Netscape^(TM) Frame, the URL's are displayed in a separate frame
          on the same window. This allows you to select a sequence of
          URL's while keeping the HotGAMS applet visible and operational.

   The above versions are `generic'; I have an address-hacked version that
   solves some problems for users behind firewalls. However, it does not
   work under Microsoft's Internet Explorer. If you have trouble with the
   above versions and are in a firewall protected intranet, try this
   version: HotGAMS behind firewall.

   Java promises a lot; platform-independence, etc, but it is still a
   little rough around the edges. If you are experiencing problems with
   HotGAMS you might want to check these notes to see if you should update
   your browser, or report a problem to us.

   If you are interested in various tools and widgets developed for
   HotGAMS, see my Java page.
