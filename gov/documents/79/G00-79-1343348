                               The BA Program
      ________________________________________________________________

     The Bankruptcy Administrator's Program is the counterpart to the
     U.S. Trustee program. The Bankruptcy Administrator oversees the
     administration of estates and supervises trustees and other estate
     fiduciaries. The program operates in six federal judicial districts
     in Alabama and North Carolina. The Bankruptcy Administrator operates
     as a non-judicial independent officer of the Judiciary who operates
     with a full time staff and is completely independent of the
     bankruptcy and district courts and the clerks of those courts.

     In performing a bankruptcy estate oversight function, some of the
     duties of the Bankruptcy Administrator include:

        - supervision of all bankruptcy trustees

       - supervision of all chapter 11 debtors

        - referral of suspected criminal activities to the U.S. Attorney
     and F.B.I for investigation.

       - appearance in bankruptcy, district and circuit courts on issues
     in bankruptcy cases

       - review and object (if necessary) to all requests for
     professional employment and compensation

       - review and move for dismissal of all cases of substantial abuse
     of the bankruptcy system.
