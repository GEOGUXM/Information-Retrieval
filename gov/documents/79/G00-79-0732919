Introduction to CFC

   The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) is the annual fund-raising drive
   conducted by Federal employees in their workplace each fall. Each year
   Federal employees and military personnel raise millions of dollars
   through the CFC that benefits thousands of non-profit charities.
