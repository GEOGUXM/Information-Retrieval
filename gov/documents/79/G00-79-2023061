   Introduction

   In 1957 noted climatologist, Roger Ravelle, wrote: "Thus human beings
   are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind
   that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the
   future. Within a few centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and
   oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over
   hundreds of millions of years..."

     Revelle and Suess, "Carbon Dioxide Exchange between Atmosphere and
     Ocean and the Question of An Increase of Atmospheric CO[2] during
     the Past Decades," Tellus IX (1957) pp.19-20.

   Roger also encouraged Charles Keeling to make measurements of carbon
   dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The resulting so-called Keeling Curve
   showed dramatically the rise of CO[2] above pre-industrial levels.
   Figure 1 shows this rise from a combination of ice-core
   (pre-industrial), and atmospheric measurements as well as estimates of
   fossil fuel burning in recent times. Perhaps, more than anything else,
   this documented atmospheric concentration rise in a powerful greenhouse
   gas (GHG) has served to bring the possibility of human warming of the
   climate. In fact, this rise makes warming a certainty since the physics
   is well understood and GHG warming is an observational fact. The only
   questions are how much and how soon.

   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

   To get the earliest possible answer to these questions the United
   Nations with the World Meteorological Organization formed the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and tasked it with:

   (1) getting the best answer to the two questions above, and

   (2) communicating it to policy people in terms that they can understand
   and use. Most of the controversy over the answers the IPCC has been
   publishing probably results from the urgency associated with carbon
   increase in the atmosphere. Because CO[2] has a residence time in the
   atmosphere of over a century, it is important to get the earliest
   warning of how much and how soon any warming might be. Thus, climate
   scientists find themselves trying to see a small signal in a noisy,
   chaotic climate. The IPCCs 1996 very guarded statement that we are
   beginning to see this signal is an attempt to give the earliest
   possible warning commensurate with our understanding. But, there is
   plenty of room to take exception, because it is such a low confidence
   warning, for those who think we still have not seen a human influence.
   This was exactly the motivation for establishment of the IPCC with its
   ability to reflect a consensus without undue influence from extreme
   positions. It is my reading that the IPCC got the answer to the two
   questions about right when it said, "the balance of evidence suggests a
   recognizable human influence on climate." This is far from the 95%
   confidence statements employed in previous IPCC reports and represents
   not only an increase in our understanding of climate change, but also a
   shift from 95% confidence statements (which are incompatible with an
   early warning philosophy) to a more risk-based "preponderance of
   evidence" level. In terms of communication between scientists and
   policy makers this represented a step forward; however, because of a
   failure to adequately communicate this change in standards to the
   community, there has been considerable controversy. Some saw it, not as
   a new approach to communication, but rather a power play by the editors
   of the IPCC document to make a more positive statement than the
   scientific community was ready for. Upon request, I can make available
   a fairly detailed chronology of how the changes took place that should
   lay this controversy to rest.

   The Debate

   On October 27th of 1998 I debated Fred Singer at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory (IEEE sponsorship) on the subject of whether the science has
   found that "the balance of evidence" allows us to attribute a human
   influence to climate change. I made it clear that the climate community
   is nowhere near the "95% confidence level," and thus there is no dearth
   of statements from scientists to the effect that they can't yet
   attribute (with 95% confidence) warming to humans. (These same people
   would, however, agree with the IPCCs "balance of evidence" statements.
   Therefore, my goal in the debate was not to show very high confidence,
   but only to show that the IPCCs summary statement (balance of
   evidence) is easily defensible and, as such, represents the first
   formal advanced warning that policy makers need to consider.

   In actuality the debate centered around the arguments made in Singer's
   new book, Hot Talk Cold Science: Global Warmings Unfinished Debate. I
   had agreed to the debate because of my many-year interest in the
   subject (I teach a university course on the subject), but was not
   prepared for the enormous amount of work necessary to first sort out
   Freds objections and then to answer them. In the actual debate I was
   able to answer each objection with a mass of evidence from the
   published literature and from discussions with climate scientists (all
   of whom were extremely generous with their time in tutoring me on the
   latest thinking on issues involved in this complicated subject). In
   fact, Singer had very little to say in rebuttal but went off into
   policy and politics instead. Thus, it is clear to me that the science
   of climate change is on increasingly firm ground as problems are solved
   in succession that support the problems that it poses, thereby
   understanding the climate and the human influence on it better and
   better.

   But this debate gave me an appreciation for how nearly impossible it is
   for the interested reader to understand how wrong or misleading
   Singers arguments are. And it was this recognition that was the
   impetus for me to write up my answer to Singer's book here at this web
   site and perhaps elsewhere as the opportunity arises. To me this is of
   the utmost importance because at this time society is in a quandary as
   to its best response to global warming predictions. Increasing numbers
   of people are beginning to see that it is potentially a large problem
   and that at the very least a measured response is called for. But the
   appearance of Singers book could delay an apparently inevitable change
   in attitude towards recognizing the growing human influence on the
   climate. As an example, consider the recent news report from the Wall
   Street Journal (editorially no friend of global warming):

     "The coalitions of oil, automobile, utility and other companies that
     opposed last year's global-warming treaty are showing some strain as
     talks to complete the pact are set to resume next week in Buenos
     Aires.

     Some members are leaving the coalitions or repositioning themselves
     on the issue. One sign of the changed landscape is the American
     Automobile Manufacturers Association, whose members helped fund an
     anti-treaty television campaign on the eve of last fall's treaty
     deliberations in Kyoto, Japan. Now the AAMA is about to dissolve,
     and its largest member, General Motors Corp., has begun to work with
     environmental groups and joined a pro-treaty lobby association.

     "Our main direction is to be constructive on this issue," explained
     John Williams, leader of GM's climate-issues team. "We need to be
     active in a wide variety of issues. It helps us influence the way
     things are going."

     The Wall Street Journal Interactive EditionOctober 30, 1998
     Opposition to Global-Warming Treaty Splinters as Talks Resume Next
     Week
     By John J. Fialka Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

   To show how those opposed to actions to reduce dumping of carbon
   dioxide into the atmosphere have successfully garbled the situation
   consider the totally inaccurate statement from later in that same
   article (either due to mistaken reading of other rhetoric or possibly
   conscious obfuscation):

     "The U.S., which may have to cut its emissions by 30% below 1990
     levels to meet its treaty obligations starting in 2008, wants
     unlimited trading to ease the cut's economic impact and provide
     incentives for more-efficient uses of fossil fuels."

   This is a totally false statement. Kyoto proposed that the US reduce
   emissions to some 7% below 1990 levels (which, because it can take
   credit for reductions in CFC gases, amounts to essentially returning to
   1990 levels of carbon dioxide emissions a mere 9% reduction from
   present levels). The "30%" value comes from a recognition that, if the
   US were to do nothing to reduce its emissions, by 2010 it would be
   about 30% above 1990 levels, but no one is seriously calling for
   reductions of 30% below the 1990 level.

   In the face of such confusion and counter claims Singers book enters
   as a potentially significant force, and, having been able to counter
   its arguments in debate, I feel some obligation to do so in print.

   Outline

   This document will follow the general outline I made up for the debate
   in that it will answer four basic questions:

   I.   How Real is 20th Century warming?
   II.  How Special is it?
   III. How well can we Model it?
   IV. What might we expect in the 21st Century?

   In the course of answering these questions I will deal with specific
   points made in Singer's book citing them by page as an aid to those who
   have read it.

   I hope to show that the warming is both real and significant, and that
   recent models, though needing continued improvement, are already
   adequate to understand the important features of the warming.
