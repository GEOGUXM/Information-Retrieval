     Links to "Real-time" Leonid data and information:
     SpaceWeather.com:  Will be receiving data from sites in Florida,
     Alabama,  New Mexico, Hawaii and Guam. Observations will also be
     made from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, but poor communications will
     probably prohibit frequent updates. Expect hourly updates from other
     sites, weather permitting.
     Leonids Live, 2001!:  Will be receiving data from the FISTA aircraft
     flying over the Western U.S., and ground sites in Arizona,
     California, Australia. Frequency of updates is "whenever a new count
     arrives."

     MSFC Forward Scatter Meteor Radar:  Uses TV station transmitters to
     monitor the meteoroid environment round the clock. Look for the
     Leonid peaks against the normal meteor background, which has a
     maximum somewhere around 6 AM Central time, and a minimum about 6
     PM.

     Sino-Dutch Expedition 2001:  The Dutch Meteor Society will be
     observing the Leonids from several sites in the U.S. and near
     Beijing, China. Frequency of updates is unknown.
     The North American Meteor Network:  NAMN will be providing real time
     raw visual counts as observers around the country (along with China
     and India and maybe some other places) email in their data.


     DISCLAIMER: This forecast is based on the best available meteor
     stream models.  However, stream modeling is a relatively new science
     and there are large uncertainties in the actual fluxes of meteors to
     be encountered.  This forecast can be used to develop a general
     operational mitigation strategy but the user must realize that the
     fluxes and times of maxima could be in error.  Operational decisions
     should consider the inherent uncertainty in these predictions.

        Figure 1. 2001 Leonid Forecasts. Creation year of streams are
                        indicated over activity peaks.

     Summary: All accepted dynamical models of Leonid activity indicate
     that a meteor storm with multiple peaks will take place over a 19
     hour interval beginning at approximately 05:00 UT on November 18 of
     2001.  Depending on the model chosen, hourly rates are expected to
     peak between 1,300 (over Hawaii) and 8,000 Leonids per hour (over
     China and that part of the Pacific Rim).  All models indicate that
     the west coast of the United States may also see greatly-enhanced or
     storm level Leonid activity at about 10:00 UT on the 18^th.  Despite
     the order of magnitude difference in the maximum predicted ZHRs, all
     three models are in good agreement on the best estimate of risk to
     satellites, the fluence, which is expected to be 4.5 to 9 Leonids
     km^-2 down to a meteoroid mass of 10 micrograms. This value is 5
     times greater than the fluence measured during the meteor storm of
     1999, with a corresponding increase in risk, so operators are urged
     to adopt mitigation procedures and strategies similar to those
     implemented in that year.

     On Earth and in LEO: There is generally good agreement between the
     Leonid forecasts of Asher/McNaught and Lyytinen/Van Flandern* as to
     the level of activity in 2001; both predict a much larger storm than
     that seen in 1999, with a peak ZHR around 8000. These models
     indicate a moderate peak (800 - 2,000 ZHR) at 10:00 UT, and much
     higher levels of activity (8,000 ZHR) between 17 and 19 hours on
     November 18th.  The Brown/Cooke model has two very broad peaks, the
     first being at about 13 hours UT, predominately due to material from
     the 1799 trail.  The second, smaller peak occurs near 17 hours UT
     and is produced by meteoroids ejected during the 17^th century, with
     some contribution from the 1866 trail.  A comparison of the stream
     center locations is shown in figure 2; note that the 1799 trail lies
     almost exactly on top of Earth in the Brown model.

     * The Asher/McNaught and Lyytinen/Van Flandern ZHR profiles (and the
     resulting fluences) have been constructed from an expression given
     by Brown in his 1999 paper on historical Leonid observations.  It
     should be emphasized that Asher/McNaught predict only the maximum
     ZHRs of the trails (no durations are given), and that Lyytinen has
     his own ZHR profiles, located at
     http://www.sci.fi/~fmbb/astro/meteorit.htm

     The model of Peter Jenniskens, while following a profile somewhat
     similar to that of Lyytinen/Van Flandern, differs from the other
     forecasts in that it places the maximum activity over the
     continental United States, at roughly 10 hours UT, with a peak ZHR
     of approximately 4200 Leonids per hour.  This is the result of a
     recent analysis (for details, see
     http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/1998.html) in which he adjusts the trail
     distances based on observations made during the past few years.  In
     particular, the Jenniskens model has the 1766 trail closer to the
     Earth than in the other forecasts, resulting in larger activity over
     North America.

     .

     In order to facilitate assessments of risk, the ZHR profiles of
     figure 1 have been integrated and converted to fluences following
     Cooke (1999); the results are given in table 1 below.  By way of
     comparison, the Leonid storm of 1999 had a fluence of just over 1
     Leonid km^-2, so we are expecting at least a factor of 5 more
     activity than that experienced two years ago.  Put another way, the
     level of risk per satellite should increase by roughly a factor of 5
     above that calculated for 1999.

     GEO:
     As of this time, stream locations and ZHR fits are published for the
     Brown and Asher/McNaught models, so only they can be used for the
     calculation of Leonid fluences along the geostationary band.  The
     Brown/Cooke model indicates slightly more activity for satellites
     located over the western hemisphere, with a peak fluence** of about
     7.5 Leonids km^-2 and a maximum ZHR of 1,350 Leonids per hour.  In
     contrast, the Asher/McNaught model predicts significantly more
     activity in the western half of the GEO belt, with fluences as high
     as 9 Leonids km^-2 and a maximum rate of nearly 11,000 Leonids per
     hour.  These model calculations are summarized in figure 3.

     Even though the Brown fluence varies by about 32% (from 5.4 to 7.5
     Leonids km^-2), the Asher/McNaught fluences swing dramatically from
     1 to 9 Leonids km^-2, with a similar trend in the ZHRs.  The reason
     for this lies in the fact that the streams in the Brown model are
     more "spread out" than in Asher/McNaught, which tends to have very
     compact streams, even for those a few centuries old.

     ** All fluences in this paper are given to a visual magnitude of
     6.5, which for the Leonids corresponds to a mass of approximately 10
     micrograms.

                                  Elsewhere:
     As is easily seen from the wide range of Leonid activity with
     geostationary longitude, the fluence experienced by a spacecraft
     some distance away from Earth must be calculated for that vehicles
     trajectory during November 17-18 of this year; it cannot be obtained
     by simply glancing at the terrestrial positions.  The Space
     Environments team belonging to Marshall Space Flight Centers
     Engineering Directorate has developed a program that will calculate
     ZHRs and fluxes (and integrate the fluxes to produce a fluence) for
     any spacecraft, given an ephemeris of vehicle positions in
     Earth-centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates.  Projects concerned about
     this years Leonid activity are encouraged to contact the author or
     one of the two team members listed below if such an evaluation is
     required.

     Whats Changed:
     Decrease in maximum ZHR by an order of magnitude from 13,000 to
     1300; however, the activity is so broad that the fluence in LEO has
     only diminished by a factor of 4, from approximately 26 km^-2 to 7
     km^-2 (down to a meteoroid mass of 10 micrograms).

     2) Revised fit to be of form

                                  equation ,

     where ZHR[max] is determined by an elaborate polynomial fit to
     figure 6.25 in Browns dissertation (the T-7 forecast used a linear
     fit between log(relative density) and log(age)), beta allows for a
     systematic error in the radial geocentric distances of the trail
     nodal crossings, and sigma measures the dispersion, given by a
     linear fit with age (similar to Browns equation 6.2). Lorentzian
     fits were also tried, but none yielded satisfactory results.

     3) Fit all 12 models and the average of these to the observed data
     to determine which gave the best fit. Past forecasts only used the
     average.

     Of these, Model 1-2 (velocity dispersion 1 the Crifo production
     distribution - in Browns thesis, with a meteoroid density of 0.8 g
     cm^-3) fit past ZHR curves best (see figures below). The adopted
     model is able to reproduce the higher 1^st peak seen in 2000, as
     well as the general duration of Leonid activity. It also reproduces
     the main peak in 1999, though the duration is a bit broader than
     observed (this is common; Lyytinens model shows the 1999 activity
     lasting 4 hours or so). Also, the much smaller secondary peak is not
     reproduced well, indicating once again that the uncertainty in these
     forecasts is such that predicting peaks on the order of 100 ZHR is
     nigh impossible at present. This is bolstered by the 1998 results,
     which fail to match the secondary ZHR maximum due to the 1932 trail
     (0 activity modeled for 1998, as the 13^th century material was not
     included).

     2000 Leonoids

     1999 comparison

     Reasons for believing revision:
    1. Model 1-2 is a reasonable description of the Leonids, especially
       given that the density (0.8 g cm^-3) seems concordant with light
       curve and radar measurements.
    2. The little historical information available does not show a major
       Leonid storm (ZHRs in the tens of thousands) this far past the
       comet nodal crossing. The new activity curve seems more in line
       with past records (see reference 2).
    3. We have drawn upon more reliable observational data from the IMO
       and the NASA/UWO/USAF ground-based campaigns, especially from 1999
       and 2000, in formulating this revision. This has made possible the
       more elaborate (and more physical) gaussian fit described above.
       The uncertainties in the 18^th and 19^th century ZHRs are so large
       as to make them useless in distinguishing between Browns 12 models
       (with the possible exception of 1866).
    4. A fit involving Model 2-2 performed in December of 2000 last year
       yielded a similar profile. Model 2-2 uses a particle ejection
       distribution developed by Jones, but has the same particle
       densities as Model 1-2 (0.8 g cm^-3).
