   Introduction

      The Hanford Site Ecosystem Monitoring Project is operated by the
      Ecology Group, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the
      U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This project evaluates effects on
      flora and fauna from Hanford Site Operations, identifies and maps
      significant habitats and species, and provides information to support
      ecological compliance.

      The project has primary responsibility for:
        * maintaining biotic inventory data for the Hanford Site
          (Washington),
        * monitoring the status of plant and animal populations, and
        * assisting the DOE in implementing its Ecosystem Management
          Policies.

      Current data sets include information on:
        * long-term monitoring records of nesting Canada geese, spawning
          salmon, wintering bald eagles, nesting Buteo hawks, and elk
        * species lists of vascular plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, fish
          and insects

      The data are available in topical sets. Detailed descriptions of the
      data can be found through the topics listed to the left. Additional
      data sets will be offered as information becomes available.

      Information and charts provided as part of this web site are intended
      to supply the user with summary information on Hanford Site biological
      resources. Charts generally show population trends for several high
      profile species. Other resource-based maps provide information derived
      from both inventory and monitoring data. Those maps identify habitats
      and species that receive special protection management, and are of
      potential use for Hanford Site operations, future facilities site
      selection and land-use planning.
