                   Natural Rsource Montioring Workshop

              January 30-February 1, 2002 - Palm Springs, CA

   Background:

   Monitoring is a common element of all the DOI, DOD and State land
   management plans in the California deserts. The National Park
   Service (NPS) expects to receive funding through the Natural
   Resource Challenge to develop and implement a comprehensive
   monitoring program for plants and animals on NPS units in the Mojave
   Desert. BLM is currently working with Geological Survey to develop
   monitoring programs to address the impacts of off-highway vehicle
   use. BLM also has programs to assess range-land health as part of
   its livestock and burro management programs. The Department of
   Defense installations in the desert have/are developing monitor
   programs to assess the condition of their lands. USGS and FWS have
   developed monitoring programs for wetland resources and desert
   tortoise, respectively. Cal State Parks is also in the early stages
   of developing monitoring programs for their lands. A goal of the DMG
   is to coordinate/integrate these efforts by identifying and
   developing compatible objectives, methodologies and data management
   systems.
   Workshop Purposes:

   1. Increased awareness among land and resource managers of the
   scope, objectives and status of existing/planned
   inventory/monitoring programs for the California desert
   2. Identify common goals/objectives and information needs.
   3. Develop recommendations for coordinating/integrating inventory
   and monitoring programs

   There is no cost for attending the workshop.
   Monitoring Information Sheet: Workshop presenters are requested to
   complete the attached Information Sheets for each
   inventory/monitoring program in the California desert. Please return
   the completed worksheet in a Word format by January 23, 2002 to:
   Cyn LeFever
   Email: clafever@mojavedata.gov
   Phone: 760-255-8886
   The Information Sheets will be complied and made available to all
   workshop participants.
   Field Trip: Cameron Barrows will lead a field trip to the Thousand
   Palms Preserve on February 1, from 8:30 am until 11:30 am. The
   Coachella Valley Preserve System was created in 1986 to protect
   critical habitat for the federally threatened/California state
   endangered Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard, and the federally
   endangered Coachella Valley milkvetch. Both species are restricted
   to the active aeolian sand habitats (sand dunes) in the valley.
   While the cool winter temperatures will make seeing lizards
   doubtful, the field trip will allow an up close and personal view of
   these last remaining sand dunes. Sand dunes, due to their dynamic
   character, and the cryptic and secretive nature of the lizards
   present challenges to developing a monitoring program. Nevertheless,
   a monitoring program has been in place for 16 years and has evolved
   to encompass more species and more community and landscape scale
   measurements. The field trip will allow us to see the problems and
   solutions to monitoring desert species and ecosystems first hand,
   and provide an opportunity for discussions on how to maximize data
   value within limited budgets.
   The weather is usually cool clear and breezy this time of year, but
   be ready for anything. Participants should be ready for a walk over
   soft sand for up to a mile.
