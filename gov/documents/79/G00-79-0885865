U.S. Export Sales Reports
JANUARY 25, 2002

   The next week's report will be released on Thursday, January 31, 2002.

   If you have any questions, please call (202) 720-9209 or email Export
   Sales.

   Weekly export sales reports serve as a timely early warning system on
   the possible impact of agricultural obligations on U.S. supplies and
   prices. The data can be used, for example, to assess the level of
   export demand, to determine where markets exist, and to assess the
   relative position of different commodities in those markets.

   The majority of the principal U.S. agricultural exports, which reached
   $50.9 billion in fiscal year 2000, are monitored on both a daily and
   weekly basis by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through its
   export sales reporting system. This monitoring system provides a
   constant stream of up-to-date information on the quantity of U.S.
   agricultural commodities that are sold abroad.
