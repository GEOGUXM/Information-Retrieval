   NWHIC Web Site Privacy Policy Notice
        __________________________________________________________________

        Thank you for visiting the National Women's Health Information
        Center (NWHIC) web site and for reviewing our Privacy Policy. Our
        policy is clear:

        We collect no information about you, other than information
        automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our
        web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   Information Automatically Collected and Stored:

        When you browse through any web site, certain personal information
        about you can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily
        store the following information about your visit:
        * the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
          aol.com, if you are using an American Online account, or
          stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
          domain);
        * the date and time of your visit;
        * the pages you visited; and
        * the address of the web site you came from when you came to visit.

        We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make
        our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated
        otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.

   Personally Provided Information:

        You do not have to give us personal information to use this web
        site.

        If you choose to provide us with information about yourself through
        an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the
        information as long as needed to respond to your question or to
        fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

   Disclosure:

        NWHIC does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal
        information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement
        or statute.

   Intrusion Detection:

        This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
        various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18
        are subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

        For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
        available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor
        traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
        information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized
        law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal
        process, information from these sources may be used to help identify
        an individual.

   Systems of Records:

        Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
        submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and
        information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically
        submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the
        Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy
        Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act
        system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.
