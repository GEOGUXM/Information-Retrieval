   In December 1942, legendary industrialist Henry J. Kaiser was drawn to
   what is now the Inland Empire by its central location, ideal
   transportation network, excellent work force, and abundance of
   available, affordable land. Kaiser chose San Bernardino County as the
   location for his giant west coast steel mill, which helped win the war
   by turning out a navy ship every six days during World War II. The
   Speedway Industrial Center, now located on that very same site, has a
   truly remarkable tradition as the center of visionary industrial
   development in the Inland Empire.

   Today, fueled by the powerhouse growth of the Inland Empire and sparked
   by the $100 million, 529-acre California Speedway project, Speedway
   Industrial Center again is on the fast track to business opportunity.

   There are 2,806 acres in the Speedway Industrial Center - and every
   square inch is allocated for industrial, planned multi-use, or
   commercial development.

   Take a look at what the Speedway Industrial Center has to offer - take
   a tour of the site, and see where you fit in! Then discover the
   advantages of moving your business to San Bernardino County, a
   fast-growing part of California's Inland Empire.
