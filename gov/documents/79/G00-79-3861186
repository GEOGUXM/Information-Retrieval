   The strength of America, the true greatness of America, is in the moral
   fiber of her people, in the integrity of her leaders, and is revealed
   by how we treat those who are least capable of helping themselves.
   There are none more vulnerable in our society, none heard less, than
   children suffering from abuse and neglect. We must be their voice. We
   must speak loudly, and speak out, with our time, our resources and our
   love. Get involved.
