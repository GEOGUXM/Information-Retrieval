   There is no question but that the issue of affordable housing is one of
   the most serious problems facing communities throughout America -- one
   where millions of low income elderly, disabled, and families with
   children are increasingly unable to afford privately-owned low income
   housing units. According to HUD, about 5.4 million Americans today are
   paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing or living in
   severely substandard housing.

   Since 1990, the number of families who have "worst case" housing needs
   has increased by 12 percent -- that's 600,000 more American families
   who cannot afford a decent and safe place to live. For these families
   living paycheck to paycheck, one unforeseen circumstance, a sick child,
   a needed car repair, or a large utility bill can send them into
   homelessness.

   To begin to address this crisis, I have introduced H.R. 2349, the
   National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act. This legislation is being
   co-sponsored by 159 bipartisan Members of Congress and has been
   endorsed by over 1,800 organizations.

   According to the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, profits generated
   by the Federal Housing Administration are expected to exceed $26
   billion over the next seven years. H.R. 2349 would use this surplus to
   allow states and non-profits to build affordable housing rental units
   in mixed-income locations, to construct affordable homes for low to
   middle income citizens, and provide rental subsidies to low-income
   individuals.

   According to experts, if the FHA surplus was used to build affordable
   housing we could more than triple affordable housing construction next
   year and provide accommodations to more than 200,000 families.

   Not only would a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund help solve the
   affordable housing crisis in the United States, it would also generate
   1.8 million decent paying new jobs and nearly $50 billion in wages
   according to a recent study by the Center for Community Change. As
   today's economy continues to sputter with layoffs up over 600% from
   last year, and as millions of Americans are paying 40 to 50% of their
   limited incomes on housing, the creation of a National Affordable
   Housing Trust Fund is needed now more than ever.
