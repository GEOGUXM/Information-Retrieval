      The Office of Homeland Security

      Latest Homeland Security Developments President Increases Budget for
      Border Security
      President Bush Friday said, "Under this budget, we're spending $11
      billion for controlling of our borders. It is so important for our
      nation to work with our friends to the north, Canada, and our friend to
      the south, Mexico, on border initiatives -- that one doesn't tie up
      commerce but, on the other hand, prevents illegal drugs, terrorists,
      arms from flowing across our border."

   Home-Actions on the Home Front Border Security: Smart Borders for the
   21st Century
   America's borders -- land, air or sea -- are the boundaries between the
   United States and the rest of the world. The massive flow of people and
   goods across our borders helps drive our economy, but can also serve as
   a conduit for terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, illegal
   migrants, contraband, and other unlawful commodities. The new threats
   and opportunities of the 21st century demand a new approach to border
   management. President Bush envisions a border that is grounded on two
   key principles:
     * First, America's air, land, and sea borders must provide a strong
       defense for the American people against all external threats, most
       importantly international terrorists but also drugs, foreign
       disease, and other dangerous items.
     * Second, America's border must be highly efficient, posing little or
       no obstacle to all legitimate trade and travel.

   The President's 2003 Budget begins the process of achieving this vision
   of the border of the future.

   First Responders - America's Frontline Soldiers
   Police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical teams are
   America's front-line soldiers in the event of a terrorist attack. With
   the right training and equipment, these first responders have the
   greatest potential to save lives and limit casualties. Even the
   best-prepared States and localities lack adequate resources to respond
   to the full range of terrorist threats this country faces. Many areas
   have little or no capability to respond to terrorist attacks using
   weapons of mass destruction.

   President Bush proposes to spend $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2003 to
   dramatically enhance the homeland security response capabilities of
   America's first responders -- a greater than 10-fold increase in
   Federal resources.
