Step 1.


   Telecommunications vendors provide critical telecommunications facility
   lists to the NCS. Also, States can identify State facilities that
   support critical missions and provide this information to the NCS. The
   NCS will determine the telecommunications vendor and specific telephone
   company facilities that support each State site. Such telephone company
   facilities can then be enrolled in the TESP system.

Step 2.


   This information is input to the TESP database.

Step 3.


   The NCS separates the facilities by state and distributes the lists to
   the appropriate entity in each State (e.g., Emergency Management Office
   or Public Utility Commission) and requests that the facilities be added
   to utilities' ESP plans.

Step 4.


   The appropriate State entity distributes a critical telecommunications
   facility list to electric utilities in each facility's area.

Step 5.


   Electric utilities modify their ESP plans to include the critical
   telecommunications facilities they serve among the highest priority
   categories.

Step 6.


   Point-of-contact information from the electric utilities is returned to
   the NCS via State entities for inclusion in the TESP database.

Step 7.


   During an electric power disruption, electric utilities normally
   proceed with priority restoration to critical telecommunications
   facilities only upon the request of the telecommunications company,
   while some may elect to proceed with priority restoration
   automatically.
