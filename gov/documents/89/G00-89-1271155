   Welcome to the home page of the LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National
   Laboratory) BaBar group. BaBar is a particle physics experiment on the
   PEP-II B-Factory at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). BaBar
   was designed primarly to study the (a)symmetries of the neutral B-meson
   system, but its rich physics program includes a variety of other
   b-quark, tau-lepton, and other particle physics topics.
