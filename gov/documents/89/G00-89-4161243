Success Stories

   The goal of the Space Product Development Program is to help American
   business explore the potential  and reap the rewards  of doing
   business in space. Doing this helps bring the benefits of space down to
   Earth where it can, and does, enrich the everyday lives of the American
   public. From improved engine blocks and other cast automotive parts to
   drugs that help fight diseases, commercial space research is helping
   businesses of all sizes improve existing products, develop new
   products, and find new or innovative ways of doing business  to the
   benefit of all.

   The following pages detail some of the successes obtained by industry
   partners and the Commercial Space Centers. As you read about them, it
   is important to remember that the research was not done by NASA, but
   was developed and paid for by the businesses involved. The Space
   Product Development Program helped these companies get the time in
   microgravity they needed to do *their* research, but the concepts,
   preparations, operations, and analysis were done by the companies
   involved.
