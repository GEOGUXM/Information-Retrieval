   You can gain access to sounds and bandscans by first choosing a
   geographic area on the map to the right. You can access tutorials and
   RMS network status via the links below the map.

   IBB operates a network remote monitoring systems [RMSs] in order to
   determine and demonstrate the audibility of its own and others'
   broadcasts.

   Each RMS consists of a radio and computer attached to the internet, an
   ariel and some power. A simple text file script is used by the computer
   to collect and encode sound samples and bandscan information from the
   radio. Data collected by each RMS is then sent to one or more servers
   via email and made available on a webpage. For the more graphically
   oriented user, we have this diagram of how the whole monitoring network
   functions.

   More RMSs will be deployed as we find willing and suitable hosts.
