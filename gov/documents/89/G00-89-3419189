   Search Tips

   Click any place in the search box and type a word or phrase that
   describes the education topic you want to find. Then click on the "Find
   Documents" command button. The system will display a list of documents
   that contain these words and order them based on the number of times
   the word or words appear anywhere in the text.

   If you are looking for documents that contain more than one word, use
   the Boolean operators: and, or, near. If the document must contain each
   word in the search then use and. If the words should be closely related
   use near. If any of the words is sufficient, use or. For example,
   suppose you want to find information on standards and assessments. You
   can enter in the search box:

                          standards and assessments

   The system will list all documents that contain both terms. You may
   decide to limit the search further since you only are interested in
   standards and assessments in elementary education. In this case click
   on New query and enter:

                  standards and assessments and elementary

   The system will list all documents containing all three terms.

   Parentheses affect the selection and will help refine the search.
   Suppose you want information on either standards or assessments in
   elementary education. Click on New query and enter:

                  (standards or assessments) and elementary

   The system will list all documents containing the words standards and
   elementary. The system also will list all documents containing the
   words assessments and elementary.

   The near operator refines a search by finding words that are less than
   50 words apart in the document. The near operator is of particular
   value when searching larger documents. Suppose you still want
   information on either standards or assessments in elementary education.
   The system lists many documents discussing the three topics: standards,
   assessments and elementary education, but not standards or assessments
   in elementary education. Click on New query and enter:

                 (standards or assessments) near elementary

   The system will list all documents where standards and elementary are
   within 50 words of each other. The system also will list all documents
   where assessments and elementary are within 50 words of each other.

   Excluding Words from the Request

   You also can exclude documents containing certain words with the
   Boolean operator and not. Suppose that you want information on all
   schools except high schools. In this case click on New query and enter:

               standards and assessments and not high schools

   General Search Rules

   The search engine has rules governing word lists, case, special words,
   special characters and punctuation.
     * Multiple consecutive words are treated as a phrase; they must
       appear in the same order within a matching document.
     * Requests are not case sensitive, so you can type words in uppercase
       or lowercase.
     * You can search for any word except those in the exception list (for
       English, this includes a, an, and, as, and other common words),
       which are ignored during a search.
     * Words in the exception list are treated as placeholders in phrase
       and proximity requests. For example, if you searched for "Word for
       Windows", the results could give you "Word for Windows" and "Word
       and Windows", because for is a noise word and appears in the
       exception list.
     * Punctuation marks such as the period (.), colon (:), semicolon (;),
       and comma (,) are ignored during a search.
     * To use specially treated characters such as &, |, ^, #, @, $, (, ),
       in a request, enclose your request in quotation marks (").
     * To search for a word or phrase containing quotation marks, enclose
       the entire phrase in quotation marks and then double the quotation
       marks around the word or words you want to surround with quotes.
       For example, "World-Wide Web or ""Web""" searches for World-Wide
       Web or "Web".
     * The wildcard character (*) can match words with a given prefix. The
       request esc* matches the terms "ESC," "escape," and so on.
