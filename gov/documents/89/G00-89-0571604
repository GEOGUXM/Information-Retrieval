   Subject: Telephone Dissemination

   REFERENCE: Chapter C-61. Telephone Dissemination, dated May 19, 1977

   At stations operating NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), a brief statement of
   its availability may be added to messages put on NWS leased telephone
   recordings during periods of good weather. This provides another source
   of needed publicity for the NWR program.

   Some examples of such statements are:

   "Have you heard of our continuous weather broadcasts on VHF-FM. For
   information, ask us or your local radio shops."

   "The Weather Service also makes continuous weather broadcasts on a
   special VHF-FM frequency of__________megahertz. Ask your radio dealer
   about a proper receiver."

   Other possibilities may be explored within the framework of these
   examples.

   This policy must be restricted to the recording systems leased by the
   National Weather Service. There may be isolated cases where NWS
   services telephone recordings leased, on a seasonal basis, by
   agricultural groups. A statement of this type may be added if written
   permission is obtained from the organization leasing the lines.
