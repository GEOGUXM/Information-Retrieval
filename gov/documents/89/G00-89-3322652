Kinship Caregivers in Washington State

                                                                   [kincare.gif]
    _______________________________________________________________

Between 1990 and 2000, the number of children in Washington State
living in a household run by a grandparent or relative increased 56
percent (from 55,118 to 85,991) according to the U.S. Census.  The
reasons for the increase in kinship care are varied and complex but
include situations involving substance abuse, teen pregnancy, death or
incarceration of parents, financial difficulties, and child abuse and
neglect.

The 2001 Legislature directed the Institute to:
examine the prevalence and needs of families who are raising related
children and shall compare services and policies of Washington state
with other states that have a higher rate of kinship care placements in
   lieu of foster care placements.  The study shall identify possible
   changes in services and policies that are likely to increase
   appropriate kinship care placements.

   The study will address the following research questions:
     * What are the number and profile of relative caregivers in
       Washington State (family composition, income, health status)?
     * How do outcomes for children living with related foster parents
       compare to non-relative placements?
     * What are the greatest needs among kinship caregivers?
     * What are the costs/benefits of policy options to support kinship
       caregivers in Washington State?

   The study will rely on representative statewide data from the Office of
   Financial Management.  Focus groups and follow-up surveys with relative
   caregivers will also be conducted.   A final report is due to the
   Legislature by June 2002.
