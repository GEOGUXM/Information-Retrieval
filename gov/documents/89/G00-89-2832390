   Nighttime Lights Posters:
        Maps have long been used to imagine events occurring on the ground
   from an airborne perspective. Satellites now record a similar view of
   actual events for scientists to study. The Defense Meteorological
   Satellite Program (DMSP) currently operates four satellites carrying
   the Operational Linescan System (OLS) in low-altitude polar orbits.
   Three of these satellites record nighttime data. The DMSP-OLS has a
   unique capability to detect low levels of visible-near infrared (VNIR)
   radiance at night. With the OLS "VIS" band data it is possible to
   detect clouds illuminated by moonlight, plus lights from cities, towns,
   industrial sites, gas flares, and ephemeral events such as fires and
   lightning-illuminated clouds. The Nighttime Lights of the World data
   set is compiled from the October 1994 - March 1995 DMSP nighttime data
   collected when moonlight was low. Using the OLS thermal infrared band,
   areas containing clouds were removed and the remaining area used in the
   time series.

   There are presently two Nighttime Lights posters available:

       The Nighttime Lights of the World poster depicts the lights from
   cities, fires, gas flares, and fishing boats, each in a separate color.
   Source data collected October 1994 - March 1995. The poster measures
   51"x26.25" and costs $25 + Service and Handling.

       The Nighttime Lights of the USA poster depicts the lights from
   cities and gas flares (off the coasts of Southern California and
   Louisiana) in white. Source data collected October 1994 - March 1995.
   The poster measures 36"x24" and costs $18 + Service and Handling.
