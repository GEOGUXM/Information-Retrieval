                            Environmental Review

   The State Clearinghouse is the State of California's central point of
   contact for the distribution of environmental documents prepared under
   the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). These environmental
   documents include Negative Declarations and Environmental Impact
   Reports (EIRs). Sections 15205 and 15206 of the CEQA Guidelines
   identify circumstances under which an environmental document must be
   submitted to the Clearinghouse for state review. The State
   Clearinghouse Handbook provides more complete information about the
   environmental document review process.

   In addition, the Clearinghouse is responsible for posting the various
   notices that CEQA requires lead agencies to prepare (the lead agency is
   the public agency having the principal responsibility for carrying out
   or approving a project subject to CEQA review). The Clearinghouse
   maintains a database of all environmental documents that it handles.
   This database contains over 100,000 records, dating to the early 1980s.

   For your convenience, the key CEQA notification forms may be downloaded
   and completed on your computer using Acrobat Reader, available as a
   free download from Adobe Systems. The completed form can then be
   printed and mailed to the State Clearinghouse. Because of the limited
   capabilities of Reader, however, you may have to purchase the entire
   Acrobat package from Adobe if you desire to save the completed form to
   your local drive. The following notice forms are available at this
   site:

     Notice of Preparation (NOP) - This notice informs the public of the
     intent of the lead agency to prepare an EIR. CEQA Guidelines,
     Section 15082 discusses the required contents.

     Notice of Completion (NOC) - Lead agencies are required to notify
     OPR as soon as a Draft EIR is complete. If state review is required,
     the NOC must accompany the required 15 copies of the EIR submitted
     to OPR. CEQA Guidelines, Section 15085 discusses the requirement.

     Notice of Determination (NOD) - Lead and responsible agencies are
     required to notify OPR and/or the county clerk when they make a
     determination to approve a project subject to CEQA. CEQA Guidelines,
     Sections 15075 and 15094 outline the content requirements.

     Notice of Exemption (NOE) - CEQA exempts from environmental review
     certain classes of projects specified in the CEQA statute or
     Guidelines. This notice informs OPR and/or the county clerk that the
     lead agency has determined that a project is exempt from CEQA
     review. CEQA Guidelines, Section 15062 discusses the content
     requirements.

   Public Resources Code Section 21091 allows for shortened review periods
   under certain circumstances. Additional information on the shortened
   review process and requirements is provided in the State Clearinghouse
   Handbook. A form, Shortened Review Request, is available at this site
   to ensure that the requesting agency provides all the information
   necessary for the State Clearinghouse to make a determination. However,
   use of this specific form is not a requirement of CEQA.

   An online version of the CEQA Initial Study Checklist can be found at
   the Association of Environmental Professionals (AEP) website. It may be
   downloaded in either Word or WordPerfect formats.
