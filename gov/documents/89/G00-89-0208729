   1. Purpose. This chapter describes the procedure to be followed in
   preparing the weekly weather and crop summary message (WWCSM) and the
   weekly divisional averages for crop moisture computation. It also
   directs the seasonal collection and transmission of reports of soil
   temperature, evaporation, and the depth of snow and ice on the ground
   at selected stations.

   2. Weekly Weather and Crop Summary Messages (WWCSM's). This section
   describes the WWCSM's, their purpose and transmission.

   2.1 Purpose. The WWCSM's are basic input for the state and national
   Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletins (WWCB), which are published in
   Washington in a cooperative effort by the NOAA/NWS Climate Analysis
   Center (CAC) and the Economic, Statistics, and Cooperative Service
   (ESCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Joint
   Agricultural Weather Facility (JAWF).

   2.2 Description. The WWCSM's are prepared in two portions, weather and
   agriculture. These messages are transmitted to the State Agricultural
   Statistician or another State/USDA office as early as possible each
   Monday (Tuesday, if Monday is a holiday). Examples are given in section
   2.2.2. Participating NWS offices are listed below. The following
   abbreviations are used: AWO, Agricultural Weather Office; AWSC,
   Agricultural Weather Service Center; RFC, River Forecast Center; SC,
   State Climatologist; WSFO, Weather Service Forecast Office; WSO,
   Weather Service Office.

   2.2.1 Weather Portion. The weather portion discusses the agricultural
   weather conditions that affected a given state for the previous week
   ending at midnight Saturday (see section 2.2.2). Principal emphasis
   should be on weather conditions which affected crops, livestock, farm
   operations, or some other aspect of the agricultural economy. Important
   weather events occurring through Saturday night should be included. In
   general, local place names of towns or creeks should be avoided,
   because they may be meaningless to a national audience. However, states
   that produce their own state WWCB's may use local names. In this case,
   JAWF will be responsible for their use or deletion in the national
   bulletin.

   Temperature and rainfall patterns and interesting or extreme events,
   such as severe storms may be highlighted. Trends, departures from
   normal, wet or dry spells, and hotter or colder periods which continue
   from past weeks, as well as changes in these patterns, should be
   mentioned. Unusual humidities, cloudiness or wind conditions should
   also be covered. Mention of routine weekly extremes of temperature is
   not required. The occurrence of freezes or of extreme cold or heat or
   the persistence of temperatures near or above 100 degrees should be
   reported where there is an agricultural impact.

   Be concise. If the message is too long, the national editor of the WWCB
   will delete items from the message.

   2.2.2 Examples of the Weather Portion.

   NEW ENGLAND: Late season cold record 17º on 12th. Record-breaking heat
   end of week. Rainfall sparse central and western New England (from the
   4/20/76 WWCB).

   INDIANA: Dry sunny and warm. Temperatures reached 80's, 12 degrees
   above normal. Evaporation at mid-summer levels. Relative humidity much
   below normal. Rainfall slight, 2.00 to 2.50 inches below normal past 3
   weeks (from the 4/20/76 WWCB).

   NORTH DAKOTA: Precipitation near normal except in west-central district
   where precipitation was above average. Highest total 0.33 in. west
   central. Temperature averaged up to 9 degrees above normal. Extremes
   from 51 degrees southwest 6th to 3 degrees below north-central 5th and
   northeast 4th (from the 12/8/81 WWCB).

   ARIZONA: Numerous showers over state during week. Rainfall eastern
   two-thirds state, 0.25 to 0.75 inches. Warmer, drier air across state
   during weekend. Average temperature 2º below to 5º above normal (from
   the 9/29/81 WWCB).

   2.2.3 Agriculture Portion. The agriculture portion for each state or
   state area is prepared in the office of the SAS or in a similar
   cooperating agricultural office.

   2.3 Transmission. The weather and agriculture portions are coordinated
   between NWS personnel and the SAS and combined into the WWCSM by the
   SAS who transmits it to the ESCS via telecopier or another economical
   and expeditious method. Product category WCR has been established for
   transmitting WWCSM's on the Automation of Field Operations and Services
   (AFOS) system.

   * 3. Weekly Divisional Averages for Crop Moisture Computations. NWS
   offices listed in section 3.5 furnish weekly averages of temperature
   and precipitation for up to ten climatological divisions in each state.
   These are known as divisional averages (DA). This annual program begins
   on the first Monday before February 5 and ends on the first Monday in
   November. Published analyses begin in April, by which time a good soil
   moisture history has been obtained. The 7-day period should end at
   0600Z Sunday or as close thereto as possible.

   Analyses should use all sources of temperature and precipitation data.
   These include AFOS, cooperative stations, Touch-Tone telephone, radar
   summaries, WS Form F-11 reports (see exhibit F-11-1), and satellite
   pictures to obtain the best estimates for each division. If values
   cannot be determined for any divisions, they should be estimated. To
   assist offices in preparing DA's, the National Meteorological Center
   transmits a bulletin on AFOS on Sundays consisting of
   computer-generated weekly means for over 200 observing sites (mostly
   NWS) for the week ending 0600Z Sunday. AFOS Product identifiers are
   NMCWMDERN, NMCWMDSRN, NMCWMDCEN, and NMCWMDWRN for bulletins containing
   Eastern, Southern, Central and Western Region means, respectively. NMC
   is the local node and WMD (as in Weekly Mean Data) is the product
   category.

   A CAC computer program calculates the Palmer Drought and Crop Moisture
   Indices from the divisional averages. These indices are then
   computer-plotted on maps for the conterminous United States and Puerto
   Rico, published in the national WWCB, and transmitted on AFOS and
   facsimile.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [f11.gif] /wsom/manual/IMAGES/F11.gif


     __________________________________________________________________

   * 3.1 Message Transmission Procedures. Offices should transmit their
   DA's Sundays between 2000 and 2359Z or Mondays between 0700 and 1400Z.
   Offices unable to transmit DA's this early should send them Mondays as
   soon after 2000Z as possible. AFOS Product Inventory List (PIL) headers
   are CCCNNNXX, where CCC is the appropriate AFOS node, NNN is WDA (as in
   Weekly Data for Agriculture), and XX is the two-letter state identifier
   of the originating office. Little Rock, Arkansas would use LITWDAAR,
   for example.

   The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) header is CXUS70 KCCC (plus
   the date-time group), where CCC is the source station, i.e., CXUS70
   KBOS for Boston. WOUSOO may replace CXUS70, if so instructed by
   regional headquarters.

   An office transmitting DA's for more than one state can send all data
   under the same PIL and WMO headers, since the state is identified for
   each division.

   If transmission via AFOS is not possible, messages may be telephoned to
   JAWF [FTS 447-7917, commercial (202) 447-7917].

   * 3.2 Code Form for Transmitting Weekly Divisional Averages. The
   Standard Hydrologic Exchange Format (SHEF) is used, as in the following
   sample message:

   AFOS Entry  Explanation
   BOSWDAMA  AFOS PIL header
   CXUS70 KBOS 131200  WMO header (use WOUSOO if so instructed)
   BOSWDAMA  Computer adds this line automatically, if needed
   .B BOS 0913 E DH0100/TAW/PPW  (explained below)
   MAD1 66/0.2 State, division, temperature and precipitation data
   MAD2 67/1.0 Data for division 2
   CTD1 67/.3 Data for division 1, different state
   .END Message ender

   Explanation of .B line

   .B message format (multiple data points or areas, all for same
   observation time period)
   BOS message source (Boston)
   0913  date (September 13)
   E time zone (Eastern-computer determines if EST or EDT) (if using GMT,
   omit the time zone indicator)
   DH0100 (or DH01) observation time (1:00 a.m.) (minutes digits may be
   omitted if 00)
   /TAW air temperature (TA), average for the week (W),
   /PPW precipitation in inches (PP) total for the week (W),
   solidi (/)  parameter separators
   The next line(s) contain data for the divisions.


   MAD1 Massachusetts (MA), division 1 (D1),
   66/0.2 temperature 66ºF, precipitation 0.2", etc.,
   .END the SHEF message ender.

   Use D10 for division 10, i.e., TXD10 for Texas, division 10.

   * 3.3 SHEF Message Format Flexibility. Entries in the preceding section
   show data for only one division per line. An alternate method is to
   enter several divisions on the same line. When this format is used,
   each division must be separated by a comma. Spaces may be inserted to
   make columns line up neatly. An example follows (headers omitted).


   MAD1 66/0.2, MAD2 66/1.0,  MAD3 6/ .2,    MAD4 -2/2.2,  MAD5 66/.9,
   MAD6 65/1.1
   MAD7 68/0,    MAD8 67/ .3,   MAD9 3/10.6, MAD10 16/1.8, CTD1 67/.3,
   CTD2 42/0.6

   At least one space must be inserted between the division or station
   identifier and the first data value regardless of the message format
   used. The maximum length of any line is 80 characters.

   * 3.4 Correction Code Form. To revise data sent earlier, use the format
   specifier .BR instead of .B. Send data only for the divisions requiring
   corrections.

   If an office later determines that its estimates are significantly in
   error, it should send a correction as soon as possible (see section
   3.2). Errors should be considered significant if estimates for the week
   are off by the greater of 15 percent or 0.25 inches for precipitation
   and/or 3E for temperature.

   3.5 Station Assignments for Transmitting Weekly Divisional Averages. DA
   messages are prepared at each of the following offices.

   4. Weekly Depth of Snow and Ice on Ground. A report of the depth of
   snow and ice on the ground (inches) each Monday morning at selected
   stations is to be sent during the snow season for use in the national
   WWCB. Most such stations are in mountainous areas, where orographic
   effects cause large areal variations in depths. These data will
   supplement the synoptic reports and other available sources in order to
   provide better coverage. The program will start each season on the
   first Monday in December and end on the last Monday in March.

   * 4.1 Stations and Collecting Centers. The stations from which snow and
   ice data should be collected are those that were in the program for the
   preceding year, unless circumstances require the collection center to
   make substitutions. The collecting centers are:

   Southern Region

   WSFO Albuquerque, NM

   Central Region

   WSFO Cheyenne, WY
   WSFO Denver, CO

   Western Region

   WSFO Boise, ID
   WSFO Great Falls, MT
   SC Logan, UT
   WSFO Phoenix, AZ
   WSFO Portland, OR
   WSFO Reno, NV
   WSFO Sacramento, CA
   WSFO Seattle, WA

   The NWS meteorologist in charge of the collecting centers should
   arrange for the opening and closing of the program each year. The
   stations above are the only sites from which special composite messages
   are sent since adequate coverage is available elsewhere from other
   reports. However, NWS meteorologists should include in their regular
   weekly weather and crop messages any pertinent information on snowfall
   occurring during the week or snow depths that may be available.

   The following information should be submitted to JAWF and the NWS
   Communications Division at least two weeks in advance of the first
   transmission each season.

     a. List of snow-reporting stations,
     b. Each station's name, latitude, longitude and (if possible)
     altitude,
     c. The day and approximate hour of measurement at each station,
     d. A map showing the location of stations.

   The latitudes and longitudes of stations should be made available to
   the NWS Office of Technical Services (W/OTS3) for listing in
   Communications Handbook No. 5 if not already listed.

   Send data on items a. through d. to:

   Joint Agricultural Weather Facility
   USDA
   South Building, Room 5844
   Washington, DC 20250

   Send items a. and b. to:

   NOAA, National Weather Service
   Communications Division, W/OTS32
   8060 13th St.
   Silver Spring, MD 20910

   4.2 Transmissions. The composite snow and ice messages should be
   transmitted via AFOS on Mondays between 0700 and 1400Z or as soon after
   2000Z as conveniently possible.

   Messages should be transmitted on AFOS in the SHEF code, as shown in
   the following example.

   AFOS Entry              Explanation

   DENWDACO                AFOS PIL header, (same as used for sending DA's)
   CXUS70 KDEN 071900      WMO header, (same as used for DA's)
   DENWDACO                Computer automatically adds this if necessary
   .B DEN 0307 M DH0700/SD Same as for DA's, except SD = snow depth,
                           inches
   ABSC2 36                Arboles (ABS) Colorado (C2) 36" snow
   MTRC2 122               Montrose (MTR) Colorado (C2) 122" snow depth
   GHIC2 0                 Snow depth zero
   .END                    Message ender

   Stations may transmit both DA and snow depth information in the same
   AFOS message, as described in section 6.

   5. Weekly Soil Temperature and Evaporation Information. The weekly
   average soil temperature (ºF, 4-inch depth, preferably bare ground)
   and/or the average daily evaporation rate (hundredths of inch per day)
   for the previous week may also be transmitted on AFOS for use in the
   WWCB. AFOS transmission is not required if the CAC receives the same
   data by other means (i.e., Touch-Tone telephone) and automatically
   computes weekly averages from the daily values.

   * 5.1 Stations and Collecting Centers. Collecting centers have not been
   specifically identified, but are likely to be WSFO's and
   agriculturally-oriented stations such as AWSC's. Names, latitudes, and
   longitudes of observing sites should be provided to JAWF and the
   Communications Division for listing in the NWS Communications Handbook
   if not already listed. The Communications Division will assign station
   identifiers as needed.

   * 5.2 Transmissions. Messages should be transmitted on AFOS between
   0700 and 1400Z or as soon after 2000Z Mondays as conveniently possible.
   Transmissions should use the WMO and AFOS headers shown in section 3.2,
   and be in the SHEF code as follows (headers omitted).

   .B ATL 0328 E DH07/TSW/ERW
   VRWG1 74/.23
   OVEG1 /.27
   CDEG1 73/M
   .END

   The above is interpreted as follows.

   AFOS Entry        Explanation

   .B ATL 0328       Atlanta, March (03) 28th (28)
   E                 Eastern time zone (computer determines if EDT or EST)

   CDEG1 73/M        Station CDE in Georgia, soil temperature 73, evaporation is
                     usually reported, but missing now
   .END              Message ender

   Offices not having access to AFOS nor sending data via Touch-Tone may
   telephone reports to JAWF [FTS 447-7917, commercial (202) 447-7917].

   Offices not having access to AFOS nor sending data via Touch-Tone may
   telephone reports to JAWF (FTS 447 7917, commercial 202 447 7917).

   * 6. Combining the Above Messages. Offices issuing two or more of the
   messages described in sections 3. 4, and 5 may combine them in order to
   reduce the number of AFOS transmissions. Generally, soil temperature
   and evaporation data may be appended to WDA messages. In such cases,
   the WDA portion is ended as usual with .END, and a new ".B" line is
   entered on the following line to introduce the soil temperature and
   evaporation data. In addition, snow depths, soil temperatures, and
   evaporation data may be combined in the same message, even when not all
   stations report the same parameters, provided parameters are sent in
   the exact sequence indicated in the ".B" line. This is illustrated in
   the following example.



   AFOS Entry Explanation

   .B BOS 0913 E DH0700/TSW/ERW/SD  (Explained previously)
   ABCM2 29/.12/4 soil temp. 29, evap. .12". snow depth 4"
   DEFM2 35/M/O soil temp. 35, evap. missing. snow depth zero
   GHIM2 //16 soil temp. and evap. not observed. snow depth 16"
   JKLM2 33// soil temp. 33, evap. and snow depth not observed
   .END message ender



   * 6.1 Coding "Missing" vs. "Not Observed" Parameters. The combination
   of two types of messages as shown in the above examples, will result in
   unreported parameters for some stations. The SHEF code makes a
   distinction between "missing" and "not observed" data. If a station
   fails to report a parameter it is normally expected to report, this
   parameter is "missing," and an "M" is entered for the parameter value.
   See station DEFM2 above, in which the evaporation is missing. If the
   station is not expected to observe and report a parameter listed in the
   .B heading, the slants must still be included, but the "M" is omitted.
