USGS Partners with NASA to Predict Non-native Plant Invasions

   Invasive plant species are a major threat to the integrity of native
   plant communities, and often threaten rare and endangered plants.
   Predicting invasive plant behavior in vulnerable areas is key to
   controlling them. USGS scientist Tom Stohlgren and NASA scientists John
   Schnase and Jim Smith have initiated a 3-year cooperative agreement
   with colleagues at Colorado State University to substantially improve
   predictive modeling capabilities for invasive plant species. Beginning
   in February 2002, new rapid spatial analysis techniques will be
   combined with high-performance computing capabilities for broad
   applications in ecological forecasting of the invasion process. Funded
   by the Computational Technologies Program at NASAs Goddard Space Flight
   Center, the studys test data sets will focus on, and immediately
   benefit, Rocky Mountain National Park, Grand Staircase-Escalante
   National Monument, and burn areas in Los Alamos, NM.
