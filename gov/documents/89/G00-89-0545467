   [why.gif] Mesoscale modeling at the Environmental Technology Laboratory
   (ETL) supports the traditional instrument development and measurement
   programs of the laboratory. The modeling work is being used 1) as an
   aid in planning field programs, 2) to better understand the physical
   context of observations, 3) as a test bed for new parameterizations
   derived from the observations, 4) as a tool for testing the utility of
   new data sources such as the anticipated offshore buoy-based profilers,
   and 5) to validate the models using the measurements. Both the Penn
   State/NCAR MM5 and CSU RAMS models have been used for these purposes.



     Most of ETL's recent modeling applications have been over oceanic and
     coastal regions. Some examples of these are:
       * During the San Clemente Ocean Probing Experiment (SCOPE), synthetic
         aperture radar (SAR) data obtained from satellite indicated very
         minimal amounts of scattering on the southeast side of the island
         in one case. A RAMS model simulation of the event indicated that
         this region was in the wake of the island and the surface winds
         were very weak, thus suggesting that the lack of back scatter was
         due to much smaller wind waves.
       * An array of CODAR radars for measuring ocean currents near Monterey
         Bay observed a diurnally varying gyre that is frequently present in
         the Bay. Simulations using RAMS showed that an atmospheric vortex,
         shed off of the nearby Santa Cruz mountains, would propagate across
         the Bay (Figure 1). The surface stress from the diurnally varying
         atmospheric flow over the bay was consistent with the observed
         varying ocean currents (Figure 2). Subsequent wind profiler
         measurements of the atmospheric flow around the Bay were found to
         be consistent with the model predictions.
       * "Southerly Surge" events on the U.S. West Coast are well-known for
         their rapid change of wind direction and speed, corresponding
         changes in sea-state, and for the generation of stratus clouds. MM5
         simulations of a southerly surge event along the central California
         coast predicts the existence of a potential vorticity plume
         offshore and suggests that it induces the southerly flow along the
         coast. The model indicates that this plume is frictionally
         generated along the northern California coastal mountains, where
         the model low-level flow is in excellent agreement with measured
         profiler winds.
       * MM5 simulations of an explosive cyclogenesis case from the ERICA
         experiment show that the use of different planetary boundary layer
         (PBL) parameterization schemes alters the mesoscale characteristics
         of the cold front and its precipitation pattern. Combinations of
         different PBL schemes with different convective parameterization
         schemes yield significantly different mesoscale structures
         associated with the cyclone. These results suggest that 1)
         measurements of the PBL structure and surface fluxes of heat and
         momentum, similar to those ETL has performed in more tranquil
         areas, are needed to improve parameteriztions under extreme but
         important conditions, and 2) such measurements and/or PBL
         parameterization improvements could have significant impacts on the
         forecasting of explosive cyclones.

     The current ETL focus of observational studies over oceans or in
     coastal areas has motivated the development a coupled
     atmosphere-ocean-wave model to be used in the laboratory. This
     development is in collaboration with researches at the University of
     Colorado, and is currently in progress. The MM5 is being used for the
     atmospheric component and the University of Colorado version of the
     Princeton model is being used for the oceanic component. The oceanic
     component will provide 3-D forecasts of u, v, w, T, and salinity, which
     will provide simulations of ocean circulations, sea-surface
     temperature, and storm surges, as well as provide feedback to the
     atmosphere (Figure 3). The WAM wave model will soon be incorporated.
     The development of this coupled model is being done using the excellent
     COPE data set taken by ETL along the coast of Oregon in the fall of
     1995. As part of this coupled system, a data assimilation system will
     be developed to incorporate atmospheric, oceanic, and wave observations
     into the model initialization.
