                         Digital Earth Reference Model

   The Digital Earth Reference Model (DERM) is intended to describe
   Digital Earth from several points of view and to specify the abstract
   architecture of a Digital Earth system.

   The DERM is currently in very early draft phase. All DERM information
   on this website should be considered preliminary and is not to be cited
   other than as a work in progress.

   Current draft of DERM
          Comments are solicited from Interagency Digital Earth Working
          Group members.
