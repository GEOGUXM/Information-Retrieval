   [shim.gif] What is the OBPR?
   Strategic Vision | HQ Organization | Advisory Comm/Boards

   Throughout most of history, human beings have viewed gravity as an
   inescapable constant. Gravity has also profoundly affected the way life
   on Earth has evolved. But new access to the space environment is now
   allowing scientists to conduct unprecedented research in low gravity,
   opening a new window on long-standing questions of science and
   technology. Space also poses physical challenges to space explorers,
   who must find ways to withstand space environment hazards for which
   humanity's evolution on Earth never prepared them.

   NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) conducts peer
   reviewed,interdisciplinary, fundamental and applied research to address
   the opportunities and challenges to NASA that are provided by the space
   environment and the human exploration of space.

   The Enterprise researches two fundamental questions basic to our
   future.
     * How can human existence expand beyond the home planet to achieve
       maximum benefits from space?
     * How do fundamental laws of nature shape the evolution of life?

   We seek to
     * Understand the Human Experience in Space
     * Understand Nature's Forces in Space

   for the benefit of all.
