              Department of Commerce Web Site Privacy Statement

   Thank you for visiting the Department of Commerce web site, a service
   of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This policy establishes how we will
   handle information we learn about you from your visit to our site.
   Please be assured that the privacy of our visitors is of utmost
   importance to us. We collect no personal information about you when you
   visit our site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

   The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to web
   sites maintained by or on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of
   Commerce. Other organizations within the Department of Commerce may
   have slightly different practices, though the overarching commitment to
   your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the
   privacy statements of other organizations when visiting their web
   sites.

   Some of our web pages contain links to web sites outside the Department
   of Commerce, including those of other federal agencies, state and local
   governments, and private organizations. Please be aware that when you
   follow a link to another site, you are then subject to the privacy
   policies of the new site.

   If you visit an Office of the Secretary web site...

     ...to read or download information: For each HTTP request received,
     we collect and store only the following information: the date and
     time, the originating IP address, the type of browser and operating
     system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the referring
     page (if provided by the browser), the object requested, and the
     completion status of the request.

     We use the information that we collect to measure the number of
     visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make
     our sites more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these
     logs periodically to determine the traffic through our servers, the
     number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages and topics
     of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any
     time and in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to
     insure the integrity of the data on our servers.

     We do not seek or collect any other data related to the specific
     users of Office of the Secretary servers, nor do we use web browser
     cookies of any type, for any purpose, on these servers.

     ...to complete an online form: Some of our sites provide forms
     allowing visitors to submit search engine queries, questionnaires,
     feedback, or other information. Some of these forms may request
     personally-identifying information (e.g., name, address, e-mail
     address) for specific purposes, such as when the submitter is
     requesting a personal response, registering for a conference, or
     subscribing to a mailing list.

     We may store non-personally-identifying information we collect (such
     as search engine queries and anonymous survey responses)
     indefinitely to help us better understand and meet the needs of our
     visitors. We may share non-personally-identifying information with
     others, including the the public, in aggregated form (for instance,
     in a list of our most popular search engine queries), in partial or
     edited form (such as in a report summarizing responses to a
     questionnaire), or verbatim (for example, in a complete listing of
     survey responses).

     Before collecting personally-identifying information, we will
     prominently disclose:
     * why we are requesting the information;
     * how it will be used;
     * how long it may be retained; and
     * under what conditions, and with whom, it may be shared.

     Generally, we will not share any personally-identifying information
     you give us with any other government agency, private organization,
     or the public, except with your consent or as required by law.

     ...to send us e-mail: By sending us an electronic mail message (for
     example, an e-mail message containing an official Freedom of
     Information Act request), you may be sending us
     personally-identifying information. In these cases, we may retain
     the information as long as necessary to respond to your request or
     otherwise resolve the subject matter of your e-mail. Please be aware
     that email is not necessarily secure from interception or
     misdirection. For your own protection you may wish to communicate
     sensitive information using a method other than email.

   We want to be very clear: regardless of the information being
   transmitted to any unit of the Department of Commerce, we will protect
   all such information consistent with applicable law including, but not
   limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act.
   It is also the policy of the Department to follow the Principles for
   Providing and Using Personal Information ("Privacy Principles"),
   published by the Information Infrastructure Task Force on June 6, 1995.
                                                                          spacer
