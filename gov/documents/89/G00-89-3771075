   Information for Homebuyers

      Graphic: House
      Buying a house is generally the biggest investment that the average
      person will make in his or her life. Following are some important
      things to consider when purchasing a home.

      Should I Buy A Home?

      In addition to providing you with a place to live, owning a home can
      provide you with a possible investment for many reasons including
      potential equity growth, the stability that comes with having ownership
      in a community, and possible tax advantages.

      Renting might make more sense for a mobile lifestyle or if you may need
      to move because of a job change or other factors. If you do not foresee
      staying in your home for several years, the amount of equity that you
      build up over the first year or two may be lost through selling costs
      and real estate commissions.
        __________________________________________________________________

      Can I Afford to Buy A Home?

      Normally, you need to have enough savings to cover a down payment of 5%
      to 20% of the purchase price plus an additional 3% to 7% of this price
      for closing costs. If you do not have the down payment, you may be able
      to qualify for a loan under various government programs that are
      available.
      Before you begin looking for a home decide what you want and can
      afford. Various factors are considered when a lender qualifies a
      purchaser for a home purchase including credit history, job stability
      and the size of the down payment. Prior to shopping for a home you may
      wish to visit a respected lender to determine the loan you can afford.

      Selecting an Agent
      Before you select an agent, do your homework. Interview several real
      estate agents to determine their level of experience in the area you
      wish to purchase. Check to ensure that the agent is properly licensed
      by using the licensee status inquiry feature of the California
      Department of Real Estate (DRE) Web site. Review any disciplinary
      actions that may be reflected on the licensee record and assess whether
      or not that information is important to you in your selection of an
      agent. Also, ask the agents for the names of past clients and check
      their references. For more information on agency relationships, click
      here.   Graphic: Denotes a PDF document
        __________________________________________________________________

      Finding Your Home

      Before you look for a home, you should determine the features that you
      need such as the location, number of bedrooms, size of the lot and
      proximity to stores, schools, hospitals, work and other services such
      as fire and police protection. You should also determine if there are
      any special taxes, assessments or homeowners association dues that
      could affect your monthly expenses.
        __________________________________________________________________

      Inspecting the Home

      Once you find a house that meets your specific needs, you should check
      the electrical, plumbing and structural integrity of the property.
      Consider hiring a qualified inspector to evaluate the structural
      aspects of the home you are considering purchasing. By doing this, you
      are giving yourself the opportunity to negotiate any necessary repairs
      with the seller. Under any circumstances, buying a home requires
      maintenance and sometimes unexpected expenses for repairs. When you
      make a decision to buy a home, remember to include this in your budget.
        __________________________________________________________________

      Presenting an Offer

      Decide what you wish to pay for the property. A good basis for this is
      to determine what other properties in the neighborhood have sold for.
      Your real estate agent can be a valuable source for this information.

      Make sure that your offer contains any contingencies or special
      conditions that you desire in the contract. This would include your
      need to qualify for a loan, repairs that you want the seller to
      complete prior to the close of escrow, as well as pest control
      inspections, home inspections, home warranty programs, and any other
      specific items. Remember, if your offer is accepted and thus becomes a
      binding contract, failure to complete the purchase could affect the
      return of your deposit.
      You should thoroughly review the contract before signing it and make
      certain that you understand it. If there are portions of the document
      that you do not understand, you should seek appropriate professional
      advice. If your real estate agent is unable to adequately answer your
      questions, you should ask to speak with his or her broker or seek legal
      advice. Make sure that the offer you sign does not contain any blank
      spaces that can be filled in after you signed it. Also, avoid giving
      cash as a deposit or down payment. Instead, always use a check, money
      order or cashier's check. This provides a permanent record of the money
      that you have deposited. For more information on the purchase contract
      and receipt for deposit, click here.   Graphic: Denotes a PDF document

      Disclosures

      There are a number of disclosures that you are entitled to receive
      during the course of your purchase. Two of the most important
      disclosures that you should receive in a residential purchase are as
      follows:

      Real Property Disclosure Statement This disclosure is completed by the
      seller and covers the physical condition of the property and potential
      hazards or defects that may be associated with it. While the seller is
      principally responsible for the disclosures presented in this document,
      the agent is also responsible for conducting a visual inspection of the
      property and disclosing any readily observable defects detected in the
      process. This document also discloses any special taxes, assessments
      and other factors that may have a material effect on the value or
      desirability of the property.

      Agency Relationship Disclosure Your real estate agent is required to
      provide you with a written disclosure stating whom he or she represents
      in the transaction. The agent may represent you as the buyer
      exclusively, or the seller exclusively, or be a dual agent representing
      both you and the seller. You should carefully review and understand
      this disclosure as it has a material effect on the level of
      responsibilities that your agent owes to you.
      Depending on the location, age and other factors involved with the
      residential property that you are purchasing, additional disclosures
      may be required. For more information on disclosures in residential
      transactions, click here.   Graphic: Denotes a PDF document
      Financing Disclosures Various financing disclosures are also required
      in real estate transactions providing you with important details of
      your loan. In this regard, the two major disclosures required are the
      Truth in Lending Statement (Regulation Z) and the Real Estate
      Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). The Truth in Lending Statement will
      provide you with important details on the terms and conditions of
      credit including the amount financed, the finance charge, as well as
      the annual percentage rate. RESPA requires detailed broker and lender
      good faith estimates regarding settlement and closing costs to be
      provided within three days after you apply for a loan. RESPA also
      requires a HUD Uniform Settlement Statement that provides you with a
      detailed accounting of actual disbursements and closing costs upon the
      completion of your loan transaction. For more information on financing
      disclosures, click here.   Graphic: Denotes a PDF document
      Public Report In all common interest facilities which have homeowners
      association dues, as well as in the initial offering of homes in
      standard subdivisions located outside city limits, a public report
      issued by the DRE is required. The public report is a detailed
      statement, which discloses to prospective buyers pertinent facts about
      the subdivision. The report includes information about utilities,
      water, roads, soil, geologic conditions, title, zoning, use
      restrictions, hazards, and the financial arrangements that have been
      made for the completion of the subdivision. For more information on the
      public report, click here.   Graphic: Denotes a PDF document
        __________________________________________________________________

      Escrow and Title
      You have a right to negotiate with the seller if you have a preference
      as to the escrow and title company that will be used in your
      transaction. The Escrow Company is a neutral third party with the
      responsibility of protecting the interests of both the buyer and
      seller. The escrow officer ensures that all terms of the contract as
      detailed in the escrow instructions have been met and that the
      appropriate deeds are recorded upon the close of the transaction. The
      Title Company provides an insurance policy to protect the buyer and the
      lender against any unknown defects with respect to the title to the
      property. Normally, the lender will require a title insurance policy as
      a condition of the loan. For more information on escrow procedures,

      Conclusion

      A real estate transaction can be complex and involves many parties and
      documents. When purchasing a home, you as the buyer should do your
      homework, be sure to read all documents involved in the transaction and
      seek professional advice in the event that you do not fully understand
      any aspect of your transaction.
      In the event that you use the services of a real estate licensee and
