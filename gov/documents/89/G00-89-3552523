   How Do I Become a Pilot?
        __________________________________________________________________

   What is the first step to becoming a pilot?

      Decide what you want to fly. This is because FAAs rules for getting a
      pilots license differ depending on the type of aircraft you fly. You
      can choose among airplanes, gyroplanes, helicopters, gliders, balloons,
      or airships. If you are interested in flying ultralight vehicles, you
      dont need a pilots license.

      You should also think about what type of flying you want to do. There
      are several different types of pilots licenses, from student pilot all
      the way up to airline transport pilot. This web page describes the
      eligibility, training, experience, and testing requirements for the
      following types of pilots licenses:
        * Student Pilot
        * Recreational Pilot
        * Private Pilot

   You may hear people refer to pilots "licenses" and pilots
   "certificates." Dont be confused, these two terms mean the same
   thingthe authorization from FAA to exercise certain flying-related
   privileges. Because "license" is a term familiar to most people, we use
   it on this webpage, but youll find the term "certificate" used in our
   regulations.

   The links at left answer the most frequently asked questions (FAQs)
   about getting started in flying. The information is based on FAAs
   rules, but is in a simplified form. You can read our rules on pilot
   certification in Part 61 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal
   Regulations.

   If you don't see your question answered here, contact your nearest
   pilot school or FAA Flight Standards District Office. For information
   on piloting careers, including job outlook and rates of pay, visit the
   Bureau of Labor Statistics.
