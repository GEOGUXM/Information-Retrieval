   Renewals
     __________________________________________________________________

   In order to streamline and clarify our handling of "renewals," we will
   treat the "renewals" as either (1) 2nd-year extensions, or (2) new
   proposals, as follows:
    1. Proposals for work that is a continuation or completion of the work
       funded in 2001 will be treated as a simple "extension" to the
       original proposal. They will be approved or denied on the basis of
       satisfactory progress-to-date and potential for completion.
    2. Proposals for work that is a spin-off, new twist, or development
       step beyond or different from the work originally proposed must be
       submitted as "new" proposals. They will be evaluated "from scratch"
       on equal footing with all other new proposals.
