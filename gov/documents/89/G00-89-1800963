   [Artist's Concept of AXAF]

                              CXO Project Science:
                              X-ray Calibration

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   AXAF underwent an extensive calibration at Marshall's X-Ray Calibration
   Facility ( XRCF) beginning in the Fall of 1996 and completing in the
   summer of 1997. An overview of the calibration from the Project Science
   perspective, as reported to the latest Independent Annual Review, is
   available as well as our latest contribution to SPIE (2 MB, postscript)
   on the subject. Here is the html version of SPIE-98.

   Individual Science Instrument, Grating, and Telescope Scientist teams,
   including Mission Support and Project Science, are completing Interim
   Reports. Also available are the Preliminary Reports from October 1997.
   As this is an effort involving many people in many places, the
   Calibration Analysis Team was created as a forum to discuss analysis
   issues and to communicate among all the participants. Links to other
   team member calibration pages are given below.

   In addition to current events, numerous pre-calibration reports and
   reviews are also documented below.

Announcements & Recent Calibration Analysis Team (CAT) Communications

  NOTE: As of July 1998, the Calibration Analysis Team does not formally meet.
  However, communication through this page and axaf_cat@alph.msfc.nasa.gov is
  still encouraged and supported.

  Calibration Meetings and Schedules

     * The Calibration Interim Reports are posted as they become
       available.
     * Most recent CAT open action items (as of 28 June 1998)
     * Most recent Minutes of the AXAF Calibration Analysis Team telecon
       (24 June 1998)
     * The CAT telecon (to discuss analysis issues, actions, and as a
       communication forum) is no longer held.
     * For full distribution to CAT participants, send E-mail to
       axaf_cat@alph.msfc.nasa.gov.
