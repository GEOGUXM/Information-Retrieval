   County, is the state's highest free-falling waterfall. The height of
   the falls is listed by various sources as somewhere between 54 and 63
   feet. Muddy Creek Falls has developed in the Pottsville formation,
   which consists easily eroded siltstones and shales and more resistant
   quartzites. These rocks date to the Pennsylvanian Period and are about
   300 million years old.

   Muddy Creek Falls and nearby Swallow Falls are part of Swallow Falls
   State Park. This park is well known for its scenic and wild beauty.
