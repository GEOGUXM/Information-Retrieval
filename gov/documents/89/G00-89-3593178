     * Argentine Republic's Geothermal Department
       Descriptions of low-enthalpy and high-enthalpy geothermal regions
       in Argentina.
       (http://www.mecon.ar/mineria/english/geother1.htm) - Temporarily
       Unavailable
     * Geothermal Education Office
       Introductory tutorial of geothermal energy concepts. Includes a
       good map of the world tectonic plates, with underlying descriptions
       of known areas of geothermal activity in each plate.
       (http://geothermal.marin.org/)
     * Geothermal Resources Council
       List of available publications concerning geothermal energy
       development.
       (http://www.geothermal.org/index.html)
     * International Geothermal Association
       Worldwide geothermal energy and estimated potential on a
       country-by-country basis. Although data quality and quantity varies
       among country pages, the amount of detail is usually sufficient to
       build a good understanding of the resource.
       (http://www.demon.co.uk/geosci/igahome.html)
     * Kansas State University's Geocrack Model
       Two- and three-dimensional models which solve the fully coupled
       structural deformation/fluid flow/heat transfer problem in
       fractured rocks. The Geocrack2D program solves the fully coupled
       fluid flow/heat transfer/rock deformation problem, including
       discrete fractures. Geocrack3D, presently under development, will
       model fluid flow on 3D planar fractures and include a tracer
       simulation with thermal degradation and adsorption.
       (http://www.mne.ksu.edu/~geocrack/)
     * Oregon Institute of Technology's Geo-Heat Center
       Resource and direct use maps for the United States, and maps of
       potential user communities in 10 states in the Western U. S.
       Resource maps for the 10 western states are accompanied by
       county-by-county data. A list of GHC publications is provided.
       (http://www.oit.osshe.edu/~geoheat/)
     * Southern Methodist University's Geothermal Lab
       Maps of heat flow and a data base of known geothermal well
       properties for the United States.
       (http://www.smu.edu/~geothermal/)
     * U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Geothermal Technologies
       Information on U. S. geothermal power production, technology, and
       prospects, as well as online issues papers and overviews of the DOE
       geothermal program. A glossary of commonly used geothermal terms is
       available, as well. Resource information are provided via links to
       OIT's Geo-Heat Center (domestic) and the International Geothermal
       Association (international).

     * U. S. Geological Survey Chemical and Isotope Studies of Thermal
       Waters of the Western United States
       List of reports and articles published from 1990 through 1997
       concerning the composition of thermal waters in the Western U. S.
       (http://water.usgs.gov/nrp/proj.bib/mariner.html)
     * University of Utah's Energy & Geoscience Institute
       Useful information about Brazil as well as tracer chemicals. An
       on-line brochure offers an excellent overview of geothermal energy
       resource development.
       (http://www.egi.utah.edu/geothermal/geothermal.htm)
     * Virginia Tech's Geothermal Data Page
       Maps and information on the geophysics and well characteristics of
       sites in the southeastern United States.
