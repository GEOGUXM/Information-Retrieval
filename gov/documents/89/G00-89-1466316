                           Stack Sampling Program

    Radioactive materials are an integral part of many activities at the
       Laboratory. Some operations involving these materials may vent
       emissions to the environment through a stack. We evaluate these
    operations to determine impacts on the public and the environment. If
      this evaluation shows that emissions from a stack may potentially
   result in a member of the public receiving 0.1 mrem or more in a year,
     this stack must be sampled in accordance with 40 CFR 61, Subpart H,
   "National Emission Standards for Emissions of Radionuclides Other than
    Radon from Department of Energy Facilities" (EPA 1989). As of the end
     of 1998, we have identified 28 stacks as meeting this criterion. An
         additional three sampling systems were in place to meet DOE
    requirements for nuclear facilities. Where sampling is not required,
   emissions are estimated using engineering calculations and radionuclide
                        materials usage information.

            Radioactive Materials Usage Survey for Point Sources

    The Radioactive Materials Usage Survey for Point Sources is an annual
    report compiled by ESH-17. As required by 40 CFR 61, Subpart H, LANL
    must monitor any point source with the potential to contribute a PEDE
    of 0.1 mrem/yr or greater to any member of the public. The regulation
    further requires that LANL perform periodic confirmatory measurements
    to verify the low emissions from unmonitored point sources. LANL uses
    data from its this survey to determine whether a point source exceeds
                           the monitoring levels.

                            Sampling Methodology

   As of the end of 1998, LANL was continuously sampling 31 stacks (28 of
     which are required as noted above) for the emission of radioactive
   material to the ambient air. LANL has categorized its radioactive stack
       emissions into four areas: (1) particulate matter, (2) vaporous
      activation products (VAP), (3) tritium, and (4) gaseous/mixed air
     activation products (G/MAP). For each of these emission types, the
   Laboratory employs an appropriate sampling method, as described below.

     We sample emissions of radioactive particulate matter, generated by
   operations at facilities such as the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research
     Building (CMR) and TA-55, using a glass-fiber filter. A continuous
   sample of stack air is pulled through the filter, where small particles
   of radioactive material are captured. These samples are analyzed weekly
   using gross alpha/beta counting and gamma spectroscopy to identify any
        increase in emissions and to identify short-lived radioactive
      materials. Every six months, ESH-17 composites these samples for
      analysis at an off-site laboratory. These composited samples are
    analyzed to determine the total activity of materials such as ^234U,
     ^235U, ^238U; ^238Pu, ^239Pu, ^240Pu; and ^241Am. We then use these
                        data to calculate emissions.

        VAP emissions, generated by LANSCE operations and by hot-cell
     activities at CMR and TA-48, are sampled using a charcoal filter or
   canister. A continuous sample of stack air is pulled through a charcoal
    filter where vaporous emissions of radionuclides are adsorbed. Gamma
   spectroscopy determines the amount and identity of the radionuclide(s)
                           present on the filter.

    We measure tritium emissions from the Laboratorys tritium facilities
    using a collection device known as a bubbler. This device enables the
    Laboratory to determine not only the total amount of tritium released
   but also whether it is in the elemental (i.e., HT) or oxide (i.e., HTO)
    form. The bubbler operates by pulling a continuous sample of air from
      the stack, which is then "bubbled" through three sequential vials
     containing ethylene glycol. The ethylene glycol collects the water
   vapor from the sample of air, including any tritium that may be part of
        a water molecule (HTO). "Bubbling" through these three vials
      essentially removes all HTO from the air, leaving only elemental
     tritium. The sample containing the elemental tritium is then passed
    through a palladium catalyst, which converts the elemental tritium to
        HTO. The sample is then pulled through three additional vials
    containing ethylene glycol, which collects the newly formed HTO. The
    amounts of HTO and HT are determined by analyzing the ethylene glycol
   for the presence of tritium using liquid scintillation counting (LSC).

       Tritium emissions from LANSCE are determined using a silica gel
   sampler. A sample of stack air is pulled through a cartridge containing
      silica gel. The silica gel collects the water vapor from the air,
     including any HTO. The water is distilled from the sample, and the
    amount of HTO is determined by analyzing the water using LSC. Because
    the primary source for tritium is activated water, sampling for only
                             HTO is appropriate.

   G/MAP emissions resulting from activities at LANSCE are measured using
    real-time monitoring data. A sample of stack air is pulled through an
   ionization chamber, which measures the total amount of radioactivity in
      the sample. Gamma spectroscopy and decay curves identify specific
                               radioisotopes.

                            Sampling and Analysis

    We chose analytical methods for compliance with EPA requirements (40
    CFR 61, Appendix B, [EPA 19] Method 114). These methods were selected
    during 1995, as part of the development of quality assurance project
   plans for tritium, particulate, and vapor sampling. General discussions
      on the sampling and analysis methods for each of LANLs emissions
                                   follow.

                               [arrowtop.gif]

                        Particulate Matter Emissions

    Glass-fiber filters that sample facilities with significant potential
      for radioactive particulate emissions were generally removed and
       replaced weekly and transported to the Health Physics Analysis
     Laboratory (HPAL). Before screening the samples for the presence of
    alpha and beta activity, the HPAL allowed approximately 72 hours for
     the short-lived progeny of radon to decay. These initial screening
    analyses ensured that potential emissions were within normal values.
     Final analyses were performed after the sample had been allowed to
       decay for approximately one week. In addition to alpha and beta
   analyses, the HPAL, using gamma spectroscopy, identified gamma-emitting
       isotopes in the samples by determining the energy of the gamma
   photon(s) emitted during radioactive decay. Because the energy of decay
    is specific to a given radioactive isotope, the HPAL could determine
    the identity of any isotopes gamma spectroscopy detected. The amount,
   or activity, of an isotope could then be found by noting the number of
   photons detected during analysis. Glass-fiber filters from LANSCE were
                   analyzed using only gamma spectroscopy.

         Because gross alpha/beta counting cannot identify specific
   radionuclides, the glass-fiber filters were periodically composited for
     radiochemical analysis at a commercial laboratory. This program was
   added in 1995. During 1998, we continued with changes to our composite
   analyses that were implemented in 1997. Specifically, rather than using
    isotopic data only to identify radionuclides as was done in the past,
   these data also quantified these emissions. We consider this method an
      improvement in sample analysis and in emissions determination. To
    ensure that the analyses requested (e.g., ^234U, ^235U, ^238U, ^238Pu
   and ^239Pu, etc.) identify any significant activity in the composites,
   ESH-17 compares the results of the isotopic analysis to gross activity
                                measurements.

                               P/VAP Emissions

      Charcoal canisters that sampled facilities with the potential for
    significant VAP emissions were generally removed and replaced weekly.
   These samples were transported to the HPAL where gamma spectroscopy, as
     described above, identified and quantified the presence of vaporous
                            radioactive isotopes.

                              Tritium Emissions

   Tritium bubbler samples that sampled facilities with the potential for
      significant elemental and oxide tritium emissions were generally
   collected and transported to the HPAL on a weekly basis. The HPAL added
        an aliquot of each sample to the appropriate amount of liquid
     scintillation cocktail and determined the amount of tritium in each
                                vial by LSC.

        Silica gel samples sampled facilities with the potential for
     significant tritium emissions in the oxide form only. These samples
    were transported to the Inorganic Trace Analysis Group (CST-9), where
   the water was distilled from the silica gel, and the amount of tritium
                   in the sample was determined using LSC.

                               [arrowtop.gif]

                               G/MAP Emissions

   We used continuous monitoring to record and report G/MAP emissions for
    two reasons. First, the nature of the emissions is such that standard
   filter paper and charcoal filters will not collect the radionuclides of
    interest. Second, the half-lives of these radionuclides are so short
   that the activity would decay away before any sample could be analyzed
        off line. The G/MAP monitoring system includes a flow-through
    ionization chamber in series with a gamma spectroscopy system. Total
       G/MAP emissions were measured with the ionization chamber. The
   real-time current measured by this ionization chamber was recorded on a
    strip chart, and the total amount of charge collected in the chamber
    over the entire beam operating cycle was integrated on a daily basis.
    The gamma spectroscopy system analyzed the composition of these G/MAP
      emissions. Using decay curves and energy spectra to identify the
       various radionuclides, LANSCE personnel determined the relative
   composition of the emissions. Decay curves were typically taken one to
   three times per week based on accelerator operational parameters. When
   major ventilation configuration changes were made at LANSCE, new decay
                  curves and energy spectra were recorded.

                 Analytical Results for 1994 to the Present

   A variety of measurements of Laboratory stack emissions, some starting
    as early as 1994 for some species, are available by request. We will
       continue to add historical data to this collection as time and
                              resources permit.

                              Long-Term Trends

   Radioactive emissions from sampled Laboratory stacks are discussed and
    trended in annual reports entitled "Environmental Surveillance at Los
   Alamos during yyyy" (where yyyy = specific calendar year). These may be
    accessed directly from our Air Quality Reports collection or through
                          the Lab's Report Library.
