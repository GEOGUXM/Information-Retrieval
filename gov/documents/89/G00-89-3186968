                   Board Meetings & Committee Information

       Public meetings are convened each month in Sacramento, at least
     quarterly in Culver City, and annually in San Diego. Board meetings
    offer taxpayers the opportunity to participate in the formulation of
      rules and regulations adopted by the Board to clarify the laws it
    administers, to present their case to the appellate body who reviews
    and decides property, business and income tax determinations, and to
           observe the Board as it carries out its official duties
