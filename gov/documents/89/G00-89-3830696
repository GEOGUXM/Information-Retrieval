   Welcome to Electronic Case Filing 101
   The Electronic Case Filing (ECF) Tutorial is designed for attorneys
   interested in learning how to use the CM/ECF system. Through guided
   practice, using simulated CM/ECF screens and actions, you will learn
   how to file pleadings and other materials using the CM/ECF system.

   The tutorial consists of six modules. The first five modules guide you
   through specific CM/ECF functions such as how to file a motion or how
   to create a docket report. The sixth module contains a link to an Adobe
   Acrobat tutorial on working with PDF documents. Please note that even
   though these tutorials will work with almost any browser, CMECF itself
   requires Netscape Navigator version 4.0 through 4.76 (but NOT higher).
   those browsers are freely downloadable from
   http://home.netscape.com/download/archive/client_archive47x.html
   Netscape 6 is not recommended for use with CM/ECF.  The CM/ECF
   technical staff in San Antonio are currently testing Internet Explorer
   version 5.5 to certify its compatibility with the CM/ECF system. The
   decision to limit browser support is the responsbility of the
   Administrative Office of the Courts, not the local court.

   If you are a new CM/ECF user, you should begin with Module 1 and
   continue to the end of Module 6. At any point in the tutorial, you can
   bookmark your place and return when and where it is convenient to you.
   The entire tutorial will take you about an hour to complete.
