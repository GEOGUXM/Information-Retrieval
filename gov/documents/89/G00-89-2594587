   TO: All Holders of Operations Manual

   SUBJECT: Transmittal Memorandum for Operations Manual Issuance 95-1

   1. Material Transmitted:

     WSOM Chapter C-12, Climate Outlooks.

   2. Effective Date:

     January 17, 1995

   3. Summary:

   This is a revised Chapter that accounts for major changes in the
   Climate Outlook program, as summarized by the following:

   a. One major change will be issuance of the Monthly (30-Day) and
   Seasonal (90-Day) Outlooks well ahead of the outlook valid time,
   instead of just a few days ahead of time as is done currently. This
   lead time, the time between issuance of the outlook and the first day
   of its valid period, will vary from 2 weeks to 12.5 months for several
   simultaneously issued outlooks.

   b. Another major change will be the increased number of Seasonal
   Outlooks issued simultaneously each month. Thirteen Seasonal Outlooks
   will be issued simultaneously EACH month for all 50 states at about
   mid-month. The outlooks will overlap in steps of 1 month with lead
   times varying from 2 weeks to 12.5 months. For example, on January 17,
   1995, Seasonal Outlooks will be made for February through April, March
   through May, April through June, and so on to February 1996 through
   April 1996.

   c. The Monthly Outlook (for all 50 states) will be issued just once per
   month (around mid-month) with a lead time of about 2 weeks.

   d. The Monthly and Seasonal Outlooks will depict the likelihood,
   through probabilities, that the average temperature and total
   precipitation for the outlook's valid period will be above, below, or
   near normal (median for precipitation). Climatologically, these three
   classes have been defined so that each occur one-third of the time over
   the long run. The outlook will indicate areas where one of the three
   classes is most likely for the outlook period. Areas where a favored
   class cannot be determined will be labeled "CL," indicating that equal
   chances of the three climatological classes is the only logical
   outlook.

   e. Hawaiian Outlooks, initially, will be issued in a tabular bulletin.
   Outlooks for all other states will be shown on maps. Climatological
   reference information will be distributed for interpretation of
   outlooks in the form of both maps and tables.

   f. In addition to the outlooks, a Tropical Pacific Mean Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) Outlook out to a year will be issued. Climate
   Analysis Center's (CAC) new outlook techniques rely mainly on the
   slowly varying global SST field and do have useable accuracy at long
   lead times.

   g. All outlooks and related information will be officially disseminated
   to National Weather Service (NWS) field offices through the NWS's
   Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) and other NWS
   systems to Alaska and Pacific Regions, to the Family of Service's AFOS
   Graphics Service, National Meteorological Center's Anonymous File
   Transfer Protocol, and Digital Facsimile (DIFAX) Service.

   h. In addition, CAC will disseminate outlooks experimentally on its
   home page on Internet. The Internet address is http://nic.fb4.noaa.gov.

   i. The publication, Monthly and Seasonal Weather Outlook, was
   discontinued with the one issued November 29, 1994.

   j. The narrative bulletins of the 30-Day Outlook (30NNA) and 90-Day
   Outlook (9ONUS) have been discontinued.

   4. Effects on Other Instructions:

   Supersedes WSOM Chapter C-12, Transmittal Issuance 94-1, dated February
   25, 1994. Also, the following sections of WSOM Chapter C-45,
   Meteorological Discussions and Forecast Coordination, Transmittal
   Issuance 94-12, are superseded:

   1. Purpose. This Chapter defines the climate outlooks. It covers the
   preparation and dissemination of information and statements as well as
   operating procedures.

   The National Weather Service (NWS) is proceeding with the modernization
   and associated restructuring (MAR). Office designations and
   responsibilities change during the different stages of the transition.
   Guidance outlined in this Chapter will be valid through that period of
   the MAR which is characterized by introduction of the Weather
   Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler, which was developed by the Next
   Generation Weather Radar program, and the Automated Surface Observing
   System (ASOS).

   2. Organizational Responsibilities.

   2.1 Weather Service Headquarters. The overall management of the Climate
   Outlook program rests with the Assistant Administrator for Weather
   Services. Staff assistance is provided by the Director, Office of
   Meteorology (OM), and OM's Operations Division, in cooperation with the
   Office of Hydrology.

   2.2 Climate Analysis Center (CAC), National Meteorological Center
   (NMC). CAC is responsible for the development and production of the
   Climate Outlook products as well as their distribution. All outlooks
   and related information will be officially disseminated by CAC through
   the NWS's Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) and other
   NWS communications systems to Alaska and Pacific Regions, AFOS Graphics
   Service, NMC's Anonymous File Transfer Protocol, and the Digital
   Facsimile (DIFAX) Service. In addition, CAC will disseminate outlooks
   experimentally on its home page on Internet. The Internet address is
   http://nic.fb4.noaa.gov .

   In addition, CAC may also provide outlook material directly to
   interested special users (i.e., Federal and state agencies and national
   associations concerned with energy use) by methods agreed upon by CAC
   and the user. Since outlooks are often an input into financial market
   activity, information should not be distributed to any user before the
   official release times. Before each calendar year, users and NWS field
   offices are notified of release dates for the Monthly and Seasonal
   Outlooks for the coming year.

   2.3 Regional Headquarters. Regional headquarters oversee and approve
   proper use of the products by field offices and submit recommended
   product changes to OM's Operations Division.

   2.4 Field Offices. Field offices, including Weather Service Offices,
   NEXRAD Weather Service Offices, Weather Service Forecast Offices
   (WSFO), NEXRAD Weather Service Forecast Offices (NWSFO), Agricultural
   Weather Service Centers (AWSC), and River Forecast Centers are
   responsible for appropriate use of the information in various
   statements and outlooks.

   2.5Regional Climate Centers (RCC). The RCCs will assist in distribution
   of outlook information as well as provide guidance to users on
   utilization of the information.

   3. Outlooks and Discussions. All outlook narrative messages should
   avoid the use of word contractions. The discussions may contain well
   known acronyms for numerical models and meteorological phenomena. The
   title sections for narrative products show the AFOS identifier and
   World Meteorological Organization (WMO) header in parentheses.

   Normal temperature values and median precipitation values are based on
   30 years of records and adjusted at 10-year intervals. The change to
   the 1961-1990 normal and median values has been implemented.

   3.1 6- to 10-Day Outlook (EONUS, FEUS40 KWBC). The 6- to 10-Day Outlook
   describes the deviations from normal of the mean temperature and
   precipitation over the conterminous United States (CONUS) for the 5-day
   period beyond the 3- to 5-day forecast. It is prepared three times a
   week and disseminated around 3 p.m., eastern local time, on Monday,
   Wednesday, and Friday, including holidays. This Outlook includes
   graphical presentation for temperature (AFOS graphic NMCGPH96T) and
   precipitation (AFOS graphic NMCGPH96E).

   The temperature outlook is expressed in terms of five climatological
   classes. There are three middle classes (above normal, normal, and
   below normal), each occurring 25 percent of the time in the long run.
   The two extreme classes (much above and much below normal) each occur
   12.5 percent of the time in the long run.

   The precipitation outlook is usually expressed using three equal
   climatological classes (above normal, normal, and below normal), each
   occurring 33.3 percent of the time in the long run. During dry
   climatological periods in certain areas, the classes may not have equal
   frequency, and the "below normal" class is replaced by a "no
   precipitation" class. During periods when virtually no precipitation
   occurs climatologically (e.g., California in summer), only the "no
   precipitation" and "above normal" classes are used since any amount of
   precipitation would exceed the normal.

   Limits for the classes (including temperature departures from normal
   for various locations) and an explanation of their use are given in
   Technical Procedures Bulletin #256, "Class Limits for 5-day Temperature
   and Precipitation Forecasts (tabular)," dated January 1, 1979. Analysis
   of the latest 1961-1990 data indicate no significant changes from the
   1979 bulletin.

   3.2 Prognostic Discussion for 6- to 10-Day Outlook (PMDMRD, FXUS06
   KWBC). This Discussion, released concurrently with the Outlook, gives
   the meteorological and climatological basis for the Outlook.
   Discussions may include analyses of numerical and statistical models,
   meteorological circulation patterns and trends, and confidence factors.
   Reference is usually made to the manually produced 6- to 10-day
   Northern Hemisphere prognoses for mean 500 millibar heights (AFOS
   graphic NMCGPH96H) and mean 500 millibar height anomalies (AFOS graphic
   NMCGPH96C). Discussions may also refer to the method of operational
   ensemble prediction at the National Meteorological Center (practical
   aspects), which is described in an article of the same name by M.S.
   Tracton in WeatherandForecasting, Volume 7, #3 (September 1993).

   THE ECMWF AND MRF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TODAY AND IN GOOD
   AGREEMENT WITH THEIR RECENT RUNS. TODAY'S SOLUTIONS OF BOTH MODELS
   TELECONNECT QUITE WELL AND HAVE REASONABLE CONTINUITY FROM THE FIRST 5
   DAYS. THUS EXPECT OVERALL MEAN PATTERN TO REMAIN MOSTLY UNCHANGED, WITH
   POSITIVE HEIGHT DEPARTURES FROM NORMAL OVER CANADA AND THE NORTHERN
   UNITED STATES AND THE SUBTROPICAL JET IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. A
   TROUGH RUNS JUST OFF OF THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA WHICH SHOULD
   MAKE THE WEST COAST STORMY. MODIFIED 500 MB PROG IS WEIGHTED BLEND OF
   ECMWF, MRF, MULTIPLE REGRESSION OF THE MRF AND ECMWF, AND THE MRF
   BAROTROPIC EXTENSION.

   THE TEMPERATURE PROG IS A BLEND OF REGRESSION CORRECTED PERFECT PROG
   TEMPERATURES, OBJECTIVE TEMPERATURES BASED ON THE MODIFIED PROG, AND
   OBSERVED CASES WITH POSITIVE HEIGHT DEPARTURES FROM NORMAL NEAR 53N
   90W, AND NEGATIVE HEIGHT DEPARTURES FROM NORMAL NEAR 30N 125W AND NEAR
   3ON 70W. PRECIPITATION PROG IS BASED ON MRF GUIDANCE MODIFIED FOR
   RECENT OBSERVED CASES AND OBSERVED CASES WITH ABOVE DEPARTURES FROM
   NORMAL.

   3.3 Monthly and Seasonal Outlook Information. Dramatic changes were
   made to the Monthly (30-Day) and Seasonal (90-Day) mean temperature and
   precipitation outlook program. One major change is issuance of the
   Outlook well ahead of the Outlook valid time, instead of just a few
   days ahead of time as was done previously. This lead time, the time
   between issuance of the Outlook and the first day of its valid period,
   is about 2 weeks for Monthly Outlooks and varies from 2 weeks to 12.5
   months for 13 simultaneously issued Seasonal Outlooks. The other major
   change was the increased number of Seasonal Outlooks (to 13) issued
   simultaneously EACH month.

   The Monthly and Seasonal Outlooks for the CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii are
   expressed by probabilities that the average temperature and total
   precipitation for the Outlook's valid period will be above, below, or
   near normal (median for precipitation). Climatologically, these three
   classes have been defined so that each occur one-third of the time over
   the long run. Areas will be indicated where one of the three classes is
   more likely for the Outlook's valid period. Areas where a favored class
   cannot be determined will be indicated by a "CL." CL means equal
   chances for each of the three climatological classes for the Outlook's
   valid period, which would be the only logical outlook.

   The following are four outlook examples with class probabilities for
   each case. The favored class (if any) is the one with the highest
   probability.

                                                              chances) (CL)

   Outlook graphics for the CONUS and Alaska depict positive anomaly
   contours describing areas having a favored outlook class. Alphanumeric
   outlook tables are used for Hawaii. Both Hawaii's Monthly and Seasonal
   Outlooks are given in the alphanumeric Hawaiian Outlook/Climatological
   Bulletin (AFOS ID NMCPMDHCO, WMO header FXHW40 KWBC). Examples of
   Monthly and Seasonal Outlook products are in appendix A. The Hawaiian
   Outlook is on pages A-2 through A-4 of appendix A.

   Since Monthly and Seasonal Outlooks pertain to the average temperature
   and total precipitation for an Outlook's entire valid period and not to
   the variability within it, they will not help people planning events
   for specific dates or sub periods. The Outlooks will be of most use for
   economic and business planning, particularly when used with climatic
   reference material. General climatic reference material is provided by
   CAC (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.5). More detailed climate information
   (e.g., heating and cooling degree day information) is available through
   the RCCs.

   Technical Procedures Bulletin number 418, dated November 3, 1994, has
   further information about outlooks, including their scientific basis,
   skill, and new methodologies.

   3.3.1 Monthly Outlook. The Monthly Outlook for temperature and
   precipitation is prepared once a month, around the middle of the month,
   with about a 2-week lead time. For example, the Monthly Outlook for
   January would be released around December 15. Release time is around 3
   p.m., eastern local time. Examples of the Graphical Monthly Outlook
   (for CONUS and Alaska) for temperature (AFOS graphic NMCGPH9MT) and
   precipitation (AFOS graphic NMCGPH9ME) are on page A-5 of Appendix A.

   3.3.3 Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook (PMD30D, FXUS07 KWBC).
   This Discussion, released concurrently with the Outlook, gives the
   meteorological and climatological basis for the Outlook. Discussions
   may include analyses of statistical models and possibly numerical
   models, meteorological and sea-surface temperature patterns and trends,
   and confidence factors. When numerical models are used, Discussions may
   refer to the method of operational ensemble prediction at the National
   Meteorological Center (practical aspects), which is described in an
   article of the same name by M.S. Tracton in Weather and Forecasting,
   Volume 7, #3 (September 1993).

   HALF MONTH LEAD OUTLOOK FOR OCTOBER 1994

   THE MONTHLY OUTLOOK IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CANONICAL CORRELATION
   ANALYSIS (CCA) AND OPTIMAL CLIMATE NORMALS (OCN) METHODS. WE ALSO HAD
   AT OUR DISPOSAL THE COUPLED MODEL INTEGRATION (CMI) TOOL IN TWO
   CONFIGURATIONS, NAMELY MRF ENSEMBLE RUNS WITH LOWER BOUNDARY OCEANIC
   CONDITION FROM SST PERSISTED FROM AUGUST 94 (PSST) AND THE SEA SURFACE
   TEMPERATURE (SST) PROJECTION BY THE COUPLED MODEL (FSST). THESE THREE
   TOOLS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR SKILL RECORD, WERE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED IN
   MAKING THE OFFICIAL T AND P OUTLOOKS FOR THE CONTIGUOUS US.

   THE GCM BASED INTEGRATIONS ARE TO BE USED WITH CAUTION, BECAUSE THE
   MODEL SKILL HISTORY IS NOT NEARLY AS WELL KNOWN AS THOSE FOR OCN AND
   CCA. APRIORI SKILL ESTIMATES FOR THE MODEL ARE BASED MOSTLY ON
   SIMULATIONS OVER 1982/93. THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. ON THIS OCCASION, THE
   PSST RUN AND FSST RUN WERE PRODUCING OPPOSITE RESULTS IN WHAT ARE
   EXPECTED TO BE HIGH SKILL AREAS, FOR SEVERAL TARGET SEASONS. THIS
   POINTS TO PROBLEMS, AND THEREFORE, THE CMI WAS BARELY USED.

   AS HAPPENED IN THE THREE PREVIOUS OUTLOOK CYCLES, THE OCN AND CCA OFTEN
   REINFORCE EACH OTHER AND DEFINITELY DO NOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER IN THE
   HIGH SKILL AREAS FOR ANY SEASON. THIS IS REASSURING WITH RESPECT TO THE
   VALIDITY OF THE SKILL ESTIMATES PRODUCED OVER 1956-PRESENT FOR THESE
   TWO TOOLS.

   IN TRANSITION SEASONS CCA HAS LESS SKILL, WHILE OCN HAS MODEST SKILL
   MORE UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ON BALANCE, THE OCN PROJECTIONS
   THEREFORE REFLECT, THE PERSISTENCE OF ANOMALIES (RELATIVE TO 1961-90)
   THAT EXISTED ON AVERAGE OVER THE LAST K YEARS, WHERE K IS TYPICALLY
   5-10, BUT RANGES ALL THE WAY FROM K=1 (EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN U.S.
   DURING DJF) TO OVER 20.

   THERE ARE LARGE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE DIRECTION THE CURRENT WEAK
   WARM EVENT MAY BE HEADING. THE CURRENT CONSENSUS AT CAC IS THAT THE
   WEAK WARM CONDITIONS IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC WILL PERSIST, AND THIS IS
   IMPLICITLY REFLECTED IN THE MONTHLY AS WELL AS THE SEASONAL OUTLOOKS.

   THE NEXT MONTHLY AND SEASONAL OUTLOOKS WILL BE ISSUED OCTOBER 20, 1994.

   3.3.4 Seasonal Outlooks. Around the middle of each month, 13 Seasonal
   Outlooks will be issued simultaneously with lead times from 0.5 months
   to 12.5 months. For example, in mid-January 1995, Seasonal Outlooks
   will be made for February through April, March through May, April
   through June, and so on to February 1996 through April 1996. Release
   time is around 3 p.m., eastern local time.

   temperature patterns and trends and past analogs, and confidence
   factors.

   PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) OUTLOOK

   THE CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS (CCA) AS WELL AS THE CANE-ZEBIAK
   COUPLED MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE A CONTINUATION OF NEAR TO SLIGHTLY
   ABOVE NORMAL EAST-CENTRAL TROPICAL PACIFIC SST THROUGH WINTER 1994-95.
   THE NCEP MODEL PREDICTS A COOLING OF THESE WATERS OVER THE NEXT TWO
   MONTHS, RESULTING IN NEGATIVE ANOMALIES OF ONE-HALF TO ONE STANDARD
   DEVIATION EAST OF 140W FROM LATE SEPTEMBER THROUGH WINTER 1994-95. NONE
   OF THE MODELS PREDICTS A COOLING OF THE PRESENTLY ABOVE NORMAL TROPICAL
   SST IN THE VICINITY OF THE DATE LINE. GIVEN THE PERSISTENTLY NEGATIVE
   SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX AND THE REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE SUBSURFACE
   WATER WITH A NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE ANOMALY IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN
   PACIFIC, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A COOL OR COLD EVENT FOR WINTER 1994-95
   APPEARS SMALL, WHILE THAT OF A NEUTRAL OR SOMEWHAT WARM EPISODE APPEARS
   GREATER.

   PROGNOSTIC MAP DISCUSSION HALF MONTH AND LONGER LEAD OUTLOOKS FOR OND
   1994 THROUGH OND 1995

   ALL 13 SEASONAL OUTLOOKS SHOWN HERE ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE CCA AND
   OCN OUTLOOK TOOLS. FOR THE FOUR SHORmanual LEADS, THE OND94, NDJ94/5,
   DJF94/5, AND JFM95 SEASONS, WE ALSO HAD AT OUR DISPOSAL THE CMF TOOL IN
   TWO CONFIGURATIONS, NAMELY MRF ENSEMBLE RUNS WITH LOWER BOUNDARY
   OCEANIC CONDITION FROM SST PERSISTED FROM AUGUST 94 (PSST) AND SST
   OUTLOOK BY THE COUPLED MODEL (FSST). THESE THREE TOOLS, TOGETHER WITH
   THEIR SKILL RECORD, WERE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED IN MAKING THE OFFICIAL T
   AND P OUTLOOKS FOR THE CONTIGUOUS US.

   THE GCM BASED OUTLOOKS ARE TO BE USED WITH CAUTION, BECAUSE THE MODEL
   SKILL HISTORY IS NOT NEARLY AS WELL KNOWN AS THOSE FOR OCN AND CCA.
   A-PRIORI SKILL ESTIMATES FOR THE MODEL ARE BASED MOSTLY ON SIMULATIONS
   OVER 1982/93. THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. ON THIS OCCASION, THE PSST RUN
   AND FSST RUN WERE PRODUCING OPPOSITE OUTLOOKS IN WHAT ARE EXPECTED TO
   BE HIGH SKILL AREAS, FOR SEVERAL TARGET SEASONS. THIS POINTS TO
   PROBLEMS, AND THEREFORE, THE CMF WAS BARELY USED.

   AS HAPPENED IN THE THREE PREVIOUS DRY RUNS, THE OCN AND CCA OFTEN
   REINFORCE EACH OTHER AND DEFINITELY DO NOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER IN THE
   HIGH SKILL AREAS FOR ANY SEASON. THIS IS REASSURING WITH RESPECT TO THE
   VALIDITY OF THE SKILL ESTIMATES PRODUCED OVER 1956-PRESENT FOR THESE
   TWO TOOLS.

   SINCE LAST MONTH, THE LIKELIHOOD FOR WARMER THAN NORMAL TROPICAL
   PACIFIC SST ANOMALIES NEXT WINTER HAS INCREASED. NEVERTHELESS, CCA IS
   NOT GOING STRONGLY FOR A CANONICAL-TYPE ENSO RELATED US T,P PATTERN.
   THE TYPICAL IMPACT OF ENSO CAN BE SEEN MOST CLEARLY ONLY IN THE JFM95 P
   OUTLOOK.

   IN TRANSITION SEASONS CCA HAS LESS SKILL, WHILE OCN HAS MODEST SKILL
   MORE UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ON BALANCE, THE OUTLOOKS THEREFORE
   REFLECT, THE PERSISTENCE OF ANOMALIES (RELATIVE TO 1961-90) THAT
   EXISTED ON AVERAGE OVER THE LAST K YEARS, WHERE K IS TYPICALLY 5-10,
   BUT RANGES ALL THE WAY FROM K=l (EAST AND SOUTHEAST DJF) TO OVER 20.
   K=l EXPLAINS WHY WE EXPECT A COLD EASTERN 1/4 OF THE NATION FOR DJF95.
   ALL OF THE OUTLOOKS SHOWN HERE (COVERING SON 1994 TO SON 1995) ARE
   BASED TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT ON THE CCA AND OCN OUTLOOK TOOLS,
   BUT THE FIRST TWO SEASONS (I.E., FOR SON 1994 AND DJF 1994-95) ARE ALSO
   BASED ON TWO 6-MONTH GCM RUNS DRIVEN BY TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF SST
   OUTLOOKS. THE FIRST OF THESE BOUNDARY FIELDS CONSISTS OF SSTS THAT
   PERSISTED FROM THE END OF JULY (PSST) AND THE SECOND, OF SSTS PREDICTED
   FROM A SMALL ENSEMBLE OF

   COUPLED OCEAN/ATMOSPHERE MODEL RUNS (FSST). THE MODEL-BASED GUIDANCE
   WAS USED CAUTIOUSLY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, THE MODEL OUTLOOK SKILL
   HISTORY IS NOT YET WELL-KNOWN, ESPECIALLY FOR WEAK OR NEUTRAL ENSO
   SITUATIONS, AND IS MOSTLY BASED ON HINDCAST SIMULATION RUNS. SECOND,
   THERE ARE LARGE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE DIRECTION THE CURRENT WEAK
   WARM EVENT MAY BE HEADING. THE CURRENT CONSENSUS AMONGST CAC
   FORECASTERS IS THAT THE WEAK WARM CONDITIONS IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC
   WILL PERSIST, AND THIS IS IMPLICITLY REFLECTED IN AT LEAST THE COLD
   SEASON OUTLOOKS.

   3.3.7 Tropical Pacific Mean Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) Outlook. The
   SST Outlook out to a year (AFOS Graphic NMCGPHSST) will be issued once
   per month around mid month with a half-month lead time. An example is
   on page A-10 of appendix A. CAC's new climate outlook techniques rely
   mainly upon the slowly varying global SST field and do have useable
   accuracy at long lead times. These outlooks make tangible the results
   of research activities by many scientists over several decades on the
   subjects of El Nino, ocean-atmosphere interaction, etc.

   3.4 Field Offices Outlook Products. WSFOs/NWSFOs are encouraged to
   issue statements that focus on interpretation of CAC outlooks for their
   forecast areas of responsibility, particularly 6- to 10-Day Outlooks,
   and Monthly and Seasonal Outlooks with 0.5 month lead time. These
   statements may be issued under the AFOS product identifier EOL (WMO
   header FEUS40) for 6- to 10-Day Outlooks and 30L (WMO Header FEUS30)
   for Monthly and Seasonal Outlooks. At the discretion of regional
   headquarters, field offices (including AWSCs) may provide specialized
   users (i.e., agriculture, forestry, etc.) with outlook information in
   the appropriate products. The period for which any outlook is valid
   shall be clearly stated in the product.

   When outlook information is included in a field office product, the
   expected temperature and precipitation conditions should be presented
   in class terms that are clearly understood by the user. For favored
   temperature outlook classes, phrases such as "warmer (or cooler) than
   normal," "near normal temperatures," etc. should be used for expected
   temperature conditions. For favored precipitation outlook classes,
   terms such as "wetter (or drier) than usual" or "near median
   precipitation" are appropriate phrases for precipitation outlooks. In
   addition, the phrase "little or no precipitation" is appropriate for
   Monthly Outlooks in the southwestern United States for late spring and
   summer and for 6- to 10-Day Outlooks when indicated on the EONUS.

   When no favored class is indicated, the terms "indeterminate" or "does
   not indicate a trend" may be used.

   When references to normal (or median) values are made, particularly
   where temperature is concerned, the normals should be included.

   Field offices may want to coordinate with CAC when incorporating
   outlook information into their products. This coordination could help
   in determining the outlook's confidence level and might help in
   phrasing within the product.

   SEASONAL PROGNOSTIC OUTLOOK DISCUSSION...

   WHILE CURRENT SST NEAR NORMAL IN THE VICINITY OF HAWAII, THE EFFECTS OF
   THE MILD WARM ENSO SST CONDITIONS IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC ARE EXPECTED
   TO RESULT IN A TENDENCY TOWARD WARMER AND DRIER THAN NORMAL HAWAIIAN
   CONDITIONS FROM THIS FALL THROUGH WINTER AND SPRING 1994-95, WITH
   HIGHEST PROBABILITY IN LATE WINTER AND EARLY SPRING. THESE ANOMALIES
   ARE LIKELY TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE PROMINENT IN THE NORTHERN THAN THE
   SOUTHERN ISLAND STATIONS. BY SUMMER 1995, THESE HAWAIIAN ANOMALIES ARE
   EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE, BOTH DUE TO THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE ENSO SST
   CONDITIONS TOWARD THEIR NORMAL AND THE WEAKER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
   EQUATORIAL PACIFIC SST AND HAWAIIAN CLIMATE DURING THAT TIME OF YEAR.
   FOR FALL 1995, THE EXPECTED ENSO CONDITION IS UNCERTAIN, BUT THE
   OUTLOOK IS FOR A MILD RECURRENCE OF ANOMALOUS WARMTH AND DRYNESS DUE TO
   THE PREVAILING DECADAL CLIMATE REGIME.
