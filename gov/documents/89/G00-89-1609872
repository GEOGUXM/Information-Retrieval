      The maximum rates listed below are prescribed under ยง 301-11 of this

      It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel Motel
      Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-391, September 25, 1990 as
      amended by Pub. L. No. 105-85, November 18, 1997), referred to as "the
      Act" in this paragraph, to save lives and protect property by promoting
      fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation
      affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's goals, employees are
      encouraged to stay in a facility which is fire-safe, i.e., an approved
      accommodation, when commercial lodging is required. Lodgings that meet
      the Government requirements are listed on the U.S. Fire
      Administration's Internet site at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel.
