Completed Research

     * New data on marriage, divorce, and remarriage in the United States
       show that 43 percent of first marriages end in separation or
       divorce within 15 years. The report, "First Marriage Dissolution,
       Divorce, and Remarriage" also shows that one in three first
       marriages end within ten years and one in five end within five
       years. The findings are based on data from the 1995 National Survey
       of Family Growth, a study of 10,847 women 15-44 years of age. Past
       research has shown that divorce is associated with higher rates of
       mortality, more health problems, and more risky behaviors such as
       increased alcohol use.  See: First Marriage Dissolution, Divorce,
       and Remarriage: United States, by Mathew Bramlett and William
       Mosher, May 31,2001. View the full report in PDF format (169 KB).
     * "Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Practices Among Teenagers in the
       United States, 1988 and 1995" presents national estimates of sexual
       experience, contraceptive use, and selected aspects of sexual
       experience among never-married males and females aged 15-19 in the
       United States. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth and
       the National Survey of Adolescent Males indicate that teenagers
       with more highly educated mothers, with mothers who delayed child
       bearing past age 19, from two parent families, and whose schooling
       was on schedule were less likely to engage in sexual risk
       behaviors. See: "Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Practices Among
       Teenagers in the United States, 1988 and 1995, by Joyce Abma and
       Freya Sonenstein, April 2001, Series 23, No. 21. 87 pages (PHS)
       2001-1997, in PDF format only (632KB).
     * Fathers and Mothers Involvement in Their Children's Schools by
       Family Type and Resident Status
       This report profiles findings about the importance of fathers and
       mothers involvement in their childrens education, even if parents
       and children do not reside together.  Released by the Department of
       Education/National Center for Education Statistics the report uses
       data from the 1996 National Household Education Survey to address
       questions about the level of involvement of parents with their
       childrens schools and the relationship between involvement and
       student outcomes.  The report looks at differences in fathers and
       mothers involvement by family and parent type.  It also examines
       differences in nonresident fathers and mothers involvement with
       their childrens schools.  The association between fathers and
       mothers school involvement and student outcomes is explored by
       family type and resident status.  View the full report in PDF

     * Serving Noncustodial Parents: A Descriptive Study of
       Welfare-to-Work Programs, by Karin Martinson and John Trutko (Urban
       Institute) and Debra Strong (Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.),
       December 2000. Also available in PDF format.
     * Nonresident Fathers: To What Extent Do They Have Access to
       Employment-Based Health Care Coverage, by Laura Wheaton, June 2000.
       The report contains the findings presented to the Medical Support
       Working Group during the course of their deliberations.  These
       findings, based on analysis of the Current Population Survey Child
       Support Supplement and the Survey of Income and Program
       Participation, provided a fact-based analytical framework for the
       Working Group activities.  Prepared by Laura Wheaton of the Urban
       Institute.
     * Income and Demographic Characteristics of Nonresident Fathers in
       1993, June 2000.
       During the past few years, research has shown that nonresident
       fathers, as a whole, can afford to pay more child support, but that
       a minority of them are poor and have limited ability to pay child
       support.  This report updates and improves on earlier analyses and
       provides more information on the circumstances of low-income
       fathers.  The findings confirm that strengthening child support
       enforcement is warranted, but that poor fathers may need a
       different approach, one building on their capacity to pay child
       support.  Prepared by Elaine Sorensen and Laura Wheaton of the
       Urban Institute.

       Economy, An Initial Analysis, by Kathryn Edin, Laura Lein, and

Research Synthesis

     * The Spring 2000 issue of Focus is devoted to child support
       enforcement policy and low-income families
       This issue of the Institute for Research on Povertys Focus
       magazine provides a review of recent research and evaluation
       findings related to child support enforcement policy and low-income
       families.  The issue includes studies on fathers, mothers and
       children, child support and custody policy, and international
       perspectives.  For more information, see the web site:  Institute
       for Research on Poverty (IRP).
     * The March-April 2000 issue of Poverty Research Center News is
       devoted to fathers
       According to the cover of the issue:  The issue looks at fathers 
       their contribution to child well-being, the part they play in
       welfare reform, and the unintended consequences of child support
       policy.  Moving beyond the stereotype of 'deadbeat dads', the
       articles in this issue signal the role fathers can play beyond that
       of breadwinner.  The authors review a range of policy and program
       initiaties, as well as chronicle the difficulties fathers face in
       sustaining a meaningful role in their childrens lives.  For more
       information, see the web site:  Joint Center for Poverty Research
       (JCPR).
