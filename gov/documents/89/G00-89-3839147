   In a constantly changing world that is demanding increasingly complex
   skills from its workforce, we believe in Preparing America's Future.
   The policies and programs of the Office of Vocational and Adult
   Education (OVAE) support the goal that no learner be left behind.

   We support a wide range of policies, programs, and activities that help
   young people and adults obtain the knowledge and skills they need to
   prepare for postsecondary education, successful careers and productive
   lives. The OVAE gateway includes access to information, research and
   resources to help students become lifelong learners and make the most
   of their education, their careers, and their individual human
   potential. On this site, you will find useful information related to:
     * High Schools
     * Career and Technical Education
     * Community Colleges
     * Adult Education and Literacy
     * Grants & Programs
     * Legislation and Policy for Career and Technical Education and Adult
