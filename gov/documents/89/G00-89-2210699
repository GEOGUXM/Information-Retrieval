   Atomic-Level Characterization of Advanced Aluminum Alloys

   [sphase.gif]

   A research team led by an NCEM visitor from Belgrade University
   employed quantitative high resolution microscopy to characterize
   advanced aluminum alloys for use in aerospace technologies. The group
   analyzed and refined the crystal structure of minute inclusions only
   nanometers in size, and has shown how this structure leads to the shape
   and distribution of the strengthening phase.

   Combining the use of the unique electron beam microcharacterization
   facilities at Berkeley and Argonne, a team of scientists has made the
   first direct high-resolution observations of melting and solidification
   in bimetallic alloys. By confining nanometer-sized "ingots" in a solid
   matrix, the researchers were able to characterize the initial stages of
   liquid formation on a distance scale two orders of magnitude smaller
   than previously feasible.

   High Energy Electron Diffraction Reveals Bonding in Metals and Alloys

   [Fox.gif]

   Many important properties of engineering materials depend on the
   spatial distribution of the electrons responsible for atomic bonding.
   The electron charge distribution can be obtained from low angle
   structure factors. This work has made extensive use of the Berkeley
   1.5MeV HVEM to measure the low-angle structure factors and temperature
   factors of simple metals and alloys with unprecedented accuracy (better
   than 0.1%) by employing the critical voltage technique. In conjunction
   with theoretical calculations, this has uncovered the bond distribution
   in many elements and binary alloys of interest in materials science.

   Atomic Imaging of Light Elements: Nitrogen in Gallium Nitride

   [Atomic.gif]

   The One-Ångstrom Microscope, a new generation of high resolution
   instruments, enables NCEM scientists to investigate solids that contain
   light elements such as C, N and O with mono-atomic resolution. For the
   first time a full reconstruction of the electron wave at the exit
   surface of a GaN sample is achieved, separating N and Ga columns with a
   spacing of 1.13Å at a cubic / hexagonal interface. This result is based
   on the combination of electron optical performance with advanced
   computer processing and demonstrates that light elements such as N can
   be observed at ultra-high resolution with coherently scattered
   electrons.

   A new type of electron microscope with high sensitivity to magnetic
   structures of solid metal sur-faces and thin surface layers has
   recently become operational at NCEM. This instrument can image magnetic
   domains of arbitrary magnetization direction with high speed and at low
   temperatures. Integrated sample preparation facilities have also been
   installed which enable us to analyze samples prepared in outside user
   systems.

   Lattice Imaging with Sub Ångstrom Information

   [DiamondHLT.gif]

   By installing a new generation of high resolution electron microscope
   (HREM), NCEM enables scientists to investigate materials with short
   bond lengths at a mono atomic level. Diamond is the most challenging of
   these materials in this respect. For the first time mono atomic
   resolution was achieved in different projections of the diamond lattice
   by exploitation of the sub angstrom infor-mation limit of a field
   emission electron microscope.

   Nature of Charge Carriers and Origin of "Colossal" Magnetoresistance in
   Perovskite Manganite

   [CMR.gif]

   Using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements in NCEM's
   recently installed FEG/TEM, researchers have conclusively shown that
   the charge carriers responsible for the conduction mechanism in
   manganites have significant O2p hole character. This discovery proves
   that these manganites are insulators of the charge-transfer rather than
   the Mott-Hubbard type, questions the validity of the well established
   "double-exchange" model of magnetoresistance and explains the origin of
   CMR. Based on the publication of these results, a first new rigorous
   theoretical formula-tion to explain CMR and metal-insulator transition
   has been proposed by a Russian research group.

   By processing multiple series of high-resolution electron microscope
   images, scientists at UC Berkeley and LBNL have produced
   three-dimensional potential maps of mineral specimens. These maps
   reveal the positions of all the atoms in the structure, including light
   atoms such as oxygen that are not detectable in ordinary
   two-dimensional micrographs.

   Quantification of Information from Lattice Images: Local Lattice
   Parameters and Chemical Composition

   NCEM provides sophisticated image analysis software that enables
   scientists to extract quantitative information about the local
   composition and structure of materials from lattice images. Recently,
   it was shown that local displacements as small as 1 pm can be detected
   in systems with low crystal-lographic symmetry at a spatial resolution
   of 0.3-0.5 nm. The developed method was applied to analyze the light
   emission from commercialized GaN/InGaN/AlGaN heterostructures.

   Magnetic Anisotropy and its Microstructural Origins: Advances in
   Electron-Optical Characterization

   [MagnHLT.gif]

   Electron microscopy investigations of epitaxially grown Sm-Co thin
   films show how atomic scale defects due to local compositional
   variations (polytypoids), observed only in high resolution elec-tron
   microscopy, could explain their large coercivities by contributing to
   domain wall pinning. Unequivocal identification of such coercivity
   mechanisms requires advances in domain imaging techniques such as the
   novel differential phase contrast imaging technique currently being
   devel-oped at the NCEM.

   Using the Berkeley Atomic Resolution microscope, researchers have been
   able to obtain direct confirmation for their model of the origin of
   diamond-hexagonal silicon, a recently discovered structural
   modification of silicon. This breakthrough proves that shear stresses,
   rather than hydrostatic pressure, are the cause of the observed
   structural modification.

     NCEM Studies Characterize Lanthanum-Soil Complexes

     Results are Relevant to Mobility of Uncontained Hazardous Isotopes

                      Slide of this work in pdf format

     Scott Fendorf of the University of Idaho and the late Mark Fendorf
     of the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) investigated,
     for the first time, the mechanism by which lanthanum is adsorbed on
     the surfaces of model soils on the sub-nanometer scale. The results
     show important differences in adsorption of lanthanides to different
     types of soil minerals, which can be related to the mobility of
     these hazardous materials in the environment.

     Significant amounts of radioactive isotopes of the lanthanide series
     elements Ce, Pm, Eu, and Eu are generated in the fission of uranium
     and plutonium reactor fuels. Due to their persistence (half lives of
     1-16 years) and extreme toxicity, it is of great importance to
     understand the interaction of these species with the clay minerals
     in the soils and sediments found at contaminated sites. Binding of
     lanthanides to clay would remove them from the mobile aqueous phase
     and limit their transport from a contaminated site. However, the
     extent of retention and the potential for remobilization must be
     known to assess the risk of contamination of neighboring areas.

     Adsorption to clay as a function of pH is a commonly used measure of
     this phenomenon. The team applied this technique to investigate the
     adsorption of lanthanum, a model lanthanide, on three metal oxides
     present in many soils and sedimentsbirnessite ( d -MnO2 ), goethite
     ( aFeOOH), and rutile (TiO2 ). As shown in the figure, birnessite is
     the most effective of the three for La sorption at low pH but by pH
     5.5 there is essentially 100% sorption of the La onto all three
     minerals. However, this macroscopic test does not address the
     underlying sorption mechanism, which must be elucidated to evaluate
     the potential for remobilization.

     The researchers employed the unique microscopy capabilities of NCEM
     to study La sorption in more detail and found striking differences
     between the sorption mechanisms on the three minerals. Unreacted
     birnessite has a needle-like morphology. After La sorption at pH 5
     the needles are blunted and completely coated with multilayers of
     La(OH)x -nH2O (see figure), indicative of a dominant "surface
     precipitation mechanism." In contrast, this surface precipitation
     was found only at much higher pH on goethite (7.8) and rutile (6.3).
     At the lower pH values typically found in soils, the sorption
     mechanism of these latter two minerals appears to be "surface
     complexation," in which the coating of the La sorbate is limited to
     a monolayer or less in thickness.

     With this knowledge of the sorption mechanism, the researchers are
     working to determine the relative effects of bond strength and
     surface morphology on the stability of the sorbate. Clearly, the
     thickness and bonding geometry of the lanthanides on the soils will
     affect their remobilization.

     Bending of Carbon Nano-Rope

     Observed Directly Using Berkeley High Voltage Microscope

                      Slide of this work in pdf format

     Carbon nanotubes, discovered by electron microscopist Iijima in
     1991, hold great promise for novel materials applications ranging
     from nano-scale electronic components to high strength fibers in
     structural composites. For applications in composites, it is
     important to understand their mechanical behavior, especially
     plasticity and fracture strength. Its Young's modulus has been
     measured by electron microscopy at a value of 1.8 TPa, one of the
     highest of any material. However, most other mechanical properties
     still elude measurement, in part to the difficulty of handling
     nanotubes because of their small size. In-situ electron microscopy
     has sufficient resolution to locate and observe nanotubes during
     manipulation.

     Using the 1.5 MeV High Voltage Electron Microscope at the National
     Center for Electron Microscopy, the team modified a special specimen
     stage originally designed for indentation experiments to permit the
     bending deformation experiments. The stage consists of a central rod
     that can move independently along the rod axis and two perpendicular
     lateral directions. At the end of the rod, a diamond tip is mounted
     if it is to be used for indentation. For the present experiments,
     the diamond indenter is replaced by a thin metal wire with a sharp
     tip, to which an aggregate of carbon soot is attached. These carbon
     soots usually have an elongated texture and it is not uncommon that
     a number of nanotubes protrude from the edge. These nanotubes can be
     used as the test sample. Opposite to the central rod is a clean
     silicon chip with cantilever beams intended to give a qualitative
     estimate of the force involved in the deformation by measuring the
     degree of their deflection.

     Typical mechanical behavior such as exceptional flexibility and
     resilience of carbon nanotubes is demonstrated in a series of
     deformation sequences recorded from a bending experiment . The
     specimen was a bundle of single-walled tubes forming a so-called
     carbon nanorope. As the rope touched the silicon chip at the
     opposite side, it started to deform. In the linear small deformation
     limit (a,b), the bending deformation was homogeneous; the sample
     formed a smooth arc along its length. However, as deformation
     proceeded further, the deformation mode bifurcated from the
     homogenous mode to kinking where finite strain was now concentrated
     locally (c). Further deformation only increased the degree of
     kinking, and did not reach the stage of fracture failure which would
     be typical for other materials at this point. After the nanorope was
     pulled back, the kink disappeared and the nanorope recovered from
     most of the strain (d). This behavior was reproducible through
     several cycles.

     Further work will focus on obtaining quantitative information with
     aim to shed light on the mechanical behavior of carbon nanotubes in
     the regime large deformation. It is envisaged that this challenge
     can be addressed by a combination of microfabrication and
     transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

     Ferroelectric Polarization in BaTiO3

     Mapped at High Resolution

                      Slide of this work in pdf format

     Collaborating with scientists from Ecole des Mines-Paris and PUC,
     Brazil, NCEM scientists have developed a method which allows for the
     first time to map the ferroelectric polarization across domain walls
     in BaTiO3.

     Ferroelectric materials are characterized by their ability to
     maintain an electric polarization in the absence of an external
     electric field. Barium-Titanate (BaTiO3) is a prototypical
     ferroelectric material. Its polarization is caused by a relative
     displacement of charged atoms (ions). As shown in the schematic, the
     positively charged barium and titanium ions are shifted relative to
     the negatively charged oxygen ions. This in turn leads to a small
     distortion of the unit cell which can be measured directly from
     atomic resolution micrographs.

     The electric polarization is generally not constant over a large
     area of the material, but forms domains characterized by a constant
     direction of the polarization vector. The way the polarization
     vector changes from one domain to another is of fundamental
     importance to the behavior of ferroelectric materials. However,
     until now it has not been possible to make direct measurements of
     the polarization in the vicinity of a domain boundary.

     Using atomic resolution electron microscopy, the group obtained
     images in which the barium atoms appeared as bright spots. The
     position of these atoms was determined with great precision using a
     computer pattern recognition algorithm specially developed at NCEM's
     image analysis facility. By comparison with an undistorted reference
     lattice, distortions of the unit cell could be determined as a
     function of distance from the domain boundary. The method allows
     both the magnitude and the direction of the distortion to be mapped
     with a spatial resolution of a single atomic unit cell (4Å). The
     image shows a vector plot of the displacement field across a domain
     boundary obtained with this technique.

     Computer-based image analysis such as that employed here is becoming
     increasingly important in the derivation of quantitative data from
     atomic resolution images. The group is now working on a
     user-friendly version of the technique which will allow its
     widespread application by other researchers and to other
     ferroelectric materials.

     Growth, Morphology and Symmetry

     of Mazed Multicrystal Films

     Atomic Templates for Extreme Textures

                      Slide of this work in pdf format

     LBNL scientists have discovered a novel method of growing
     heteroepitaxial thin films with extreme textures. Based on
     principles of color crystallography and using electron microscopy
     for characterization, they were able to show that vapor deposition
     on single crystal substrates can generate thin films of any desired
     complexity in a range of different metals.

     Most metals, alloys and ceramics possess a polycrystalline
     microstructure, made of small grains in many different orientations.
     The size and shape of the grains and the orientation distribution of
     grains, or texture, are fundamental features of great importance for
     the physical behavior of materials. Textured materials exhibit
     direction-dependent properties which may be detrimental for some
     applications and beneficial for others. Understanding and
     controlling texture is therefore of fundamental importance.

     Texture in thin films is derived from the epitaxial relationship
     between a film and its substrate. On a single crystal substrate, a
     thin film may grow as a polycrystal with grains in Q different
     orientations. The Qth order Potts model describes a polycrystalline
     microstructure as a tiling of a plane with each tile occupied at
     random by one of a number Q of orientations. This is illustrated for
     Q=1,2,3,48 in the figure for a non-periodic irregular tiling in the
     shape of the map of the continental United States where the shapes
     and sizes of tiles range from Rhode Island to Texas.

     For Q=1, all "grains" have the same orientation, making the entire
     area a single crystal (a). For Q=2, the "grains" are given two
     different orientations at random, resulting in a "mazed bicrystal"
     (because of the maze-like topography of the two interpenetrating
     grains), (see b). Because a mazed bicrystal has only two grain
     orientations there are no triple junctions. For Q=3, the "grains"
     are given three different orientations, indicated by different
     colors, again distributed randomly among the "grains" (see c). This
     is the lowest order Potts model microstructure to exhibit triple
     junctions. For Q=48, all triple junctions are different, and a
     quadruple junction is seen at the Four Corners area (d).

     A practical means of generating Potts model microstructures is the
     use of a single crystal substrate as a template for heteroepitaxial
     growth of thin films. The schematic shows that islands nucleated in
     two different orientations (Q=2), will grow and impinge to form
     grain boundaries in a mazed bicrystal. While bicrystals are
     described by two-color symmetry, higher order polycrystals generate
     new symmetry elements given by the different permutations of Q
     colors. It has been shown that color groups are completely
     characterized by their noncolor supergroup G and a subgroup H which
     maps at least one color onto itself.

     The research team has been able to grow tailored multicrystal films
     of many different metals on various substrates. The two electron
     micrographs show examples of a mazed bicrystal film of iron and a
     mazed tricrystal film of Al grown by this technique.

     Tailored multicrystal films with extreme textures can be useful for
     technological applications and as models for bulk components with
     different microstructures. Although the underlying crystallographic
     principles are simple to apply in practice, their implications for
     the behavior of materials are only beginning to be explored.
