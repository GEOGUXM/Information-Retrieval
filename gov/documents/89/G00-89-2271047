   Lake Erie-Lake St. Clair Basins
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Lake Erie-Lake St. Clair Basins in Indiana, Michigan, New York,
   Ohio and Pennsylvania is one of more than 50 study units that are part
   of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment
   (NAWQA) Program. The long-term goals of this program are to describe
   the status and trends in the quality of a large, representative part of
   the Nation's surface- and ground-water resources, and to provide a
   sound, scientific understanding of the primary factors affecting the
   quality of these resources.
