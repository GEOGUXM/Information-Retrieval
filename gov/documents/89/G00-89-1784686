   Phone It is now possible to verify a registered nursing license by
   calling 1-800-838-6828. This service is available seven days a week, 24
   hours a day from any touch-tone phone.

   In order to use this system you must have the four to six digit
   registered nurse (RN) license number. You can verify three permanent RN
   licenses Monday through Friday 8 AM to 5 PM and up to ten licenses
   after office hours and on weekends. (Temporary licenses and interim
   permits are not available on the system and can only be verified by an
   operator during regular office hours.)

   This verification system has been implemented to provide better access
   to employers in accordance with Business and Professions Code Section
   2732.05. This section states that, "Every employer of a registered
   nurse and every person acting as an agent for such a nurse in obtaining
   employment, shall ascertain that such nurse is currently authorized to
   practice as a registered professional nurse within the provisions of
   this chapter. As used in this section, the term 'agent' includes, but
   is not limited to, a nurses registry."

   When making a determination about the licensure status of a prospective
   employee, in addition to verifying the license with the Board, we also
   recommend close inspection of the original license document as well as
   a recent photo identification card.

   If you experience any difficulty with this toll-free verification
   system during regular business hours, please call the main telephone
   number of the Board at (916) 322-3350 and press "0" for the operator.
