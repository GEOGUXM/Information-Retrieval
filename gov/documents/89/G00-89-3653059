                     Tactical Mobile Robot called Urbie

   The Tactical Mobile Robot called "Urbie"

   One of the important technologies that must be developed for any sort
   of free-roaming robot is stereoscopic vision. Otherwise the robot will
   not be able to accurately and quickly navigate toward its target,
   seeing and avoiding obstacles along the way. Real-time stereoscopic
   "machine vision" is one of the advanced technologies being developed
   and demonstrated for the "Urbie" Tactical Mobile Robot.

   In the past, robots used a single camera as its "eye" and human
   operators used the picture from that one camera to "see" obstacles and
   move the robot around to avoid them. This approach doesn't work too
   well, though, when the robot is moving quickly or in a hazardous
   situation. There just isn't time for a human operator to analyze the
   image and react in time with commands to the robot. Also, for
   exploration of other planets, moons, asteroids and comets, the robot
   must be autonomous. It takes minutes to hours for an image signal from
   a robot on a distant body to reach a human operator on Earth and for a
   command to be sent back to the robot. By that time, the robot could
   have fallen into a deep hole or gotten itself stuck between a rock and
   a hard place!

   Urbie's initial purpose is mobile military reconnaissance in city
   terrain. However, many of its features will also make it useful to
   police, emergency and rescue personnel. The robot is rugged and
   well-suited for hostile environments and its autonomy will make Urbie
   ideal for working in dangerous situations. Such robots could
   investigate urban environments contaminated with radiation, biological
   warfare, or chemical spills. And, of course, such a robot will make an
   ideal space explorer.

   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Association (DARPA) has enlisted
   JPL's Machine Vision Group in leading the design and implementation of
   its urban robot project, a Tactical Mobile Robot. This urban robot
   (Urbie) is a joint effort of JPL, IS Robotics, the Robotics Institute
   of Carnegie Mellon University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the
   University of Southern California Robotics Research Laboratory.
