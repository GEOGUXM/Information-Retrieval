[blueball.gif] Projects overview

   The central focus of our research is to provide theoretical and
   computational methods for interpreting experimental data measured at
   surfaces and interfaces, particularly at Berkeley's Advanced Light
   Source. We investigate photoemission and related techniques, especially
   photoelectron diffraction (PD), photoelectron holography (PH) as well
   as x-ray holography (XH). Our computer codes are available for free
   downloading.
   Through the global SRRTNet (Synchrotron Radiation Research Theory
   Network), we also provide access for experimentalists everywhere to
   methods and/or computer codes developed by other theoretical groups:
   these cover a wide variety of techniques used at synchrotron radiation
   sources, besides PD, PH and XH, e.g. XAS, XAFS, XES, XRD, XMCD and IXS.
   A particular emphasis of our work is to study the atomic-scale
   structure of crystalline surfaces, both with and without synchrotron
   radiation. We thus have developed and continue to develop theoretical
   and computational methods for surface crystallography and apply them to
   help understand a wide variety of materials. This includes low-energy
   electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning probe microscopies (STM, AFM,
   ...), while we also occasionally perform electronic-structure and
   total-energy calculations.
   Results of surface crystallography, obtained by this and other groups
   in the world, are collected in the Surface Structure Database, which is
   sponsored and marketed by NIST.
