        Join us at the 10th International Meshing Roundtable held in
              Newport Beach, California, on October 7-10, 2001.

   In 1992, Sandia National Laboratories started the Meshing Roundtable as
   a small meeting of like-minded companies and organizations striving to
   establish a common focus for research and development in the field of
   mesh and grid generation. Now after 10 consecutive years, the
   International Meshing Roundtable has become recognized as an
   international focal point annually attended by researchers and
   developers from dozens of countries around the world. The relaxed
   atmosphere at each Roundtable provides an open and technically rich
   environment in which to share new ideas and technical advances.

   The International Meshing Roundtable continues to focus on bringing
   together researchers and developers from academia, national labs and
   industry in a stimulating, open environment to share technical
   information related to mesh generation and general pre-processing
   techniques. In 2001, Roundtable attendees will enjoy the balmy weather
   and breathtaking beaches of Newport Beach, California, located between
   Los Angeles and San Diego on the Pacific coast. This year's conference
   will be hosted by UGS, Inc. which maintains its principle development
   site in Southern California.

   EVENTS at this year's roundtable included:
     * Pre-conference short course on Sunday, October 7
     * Technical presentations of contributed papers
     * Keynote and invited speakers
     * Poster session with Best Technical Poster, Best Student Poster, and

       software vendors.
     * Birds-of-a-Feather session providing a discussion forum for small
       groups of researchers working in similar fields.
