   The INEEL's Nuclear and Energy Systems Engineering Division is
   dedicated to promoting the development and deployment of energy systems
   and practices that will provide current and future generations with
   energy that is clean, reasonably priced, and reliable.

   The Division performs leading edge research and development in a
   diverse array of nuclear and non-nuclear energy technologies and is
   grouped into two directorates in support the DOE's Energy Resources
   mission:
     * Nuclear - Advanced Nuclear Energy
     * Non-nuclear - Energy Efficiency and Natural Resources.
