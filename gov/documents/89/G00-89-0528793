                             Information Center

   Approximately 6,000 acres of land have been cleared for KSC operations,
   and facilities and personnel are distributed across a much larger area.
   For this reason, tracking down the person or information you need can
   be a challenge. This collection of pages was specifically designed to
   make it easier for our visitors to find information regarding KSC's
   organizations and administration, as well as the Freedom of Information
   Act.
