   The USGS manatee research group is participating for the fifth year in
   Journey North, an on-line educational website for students. Journey
   North allows students to track wildlife migration, and travels north in
   the spring. Students from more than 4,500 schools in all 50 U.S. states
   and 7 Canadian provinces participate in the program. Students following
   manatee movements will learn about capturing, tagging and releasing
   wild manatees in a previously unexplored area called Ten Thousand
   Islands right along the western edge of the Everglades. Researchers
   hope to tag 10 manatees there. Visit the Journey North website.
   The Florida Caribbean Science Center Educational Page & Kid´s Corner
   The newest addition to our Center´s web site ... and growing!
   The USGS Biological Resources Division Kids Corner provides links to
   wildflower and endangered species coloring books, classroom activities
   and fact sheets.
   Frogweb has information for students K-12 on amphibian research,
   disease and declines.  The site has links to educational resources,
   classroom and outdoor activities, and news releases.
   BioBot - the biological search engine for the Internet developed by the
   National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) lets the user
   find information about a particular species or environmental issues.
   Users can conduct simple or advance searches, or NBII and deliver
   biological information daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly.
   National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Education website
   provides educators, parents, and students of all ages with access to
   online resources that emphasize the teaching of biology, biodiversity,
   and ecology.  Included are activities, lesson plans, experiments,
   projects, resources, and references for classroom and home use.
   .
   Visit online the Mad Scientist Network, which is a collective of
   scientists from around the world, who are trained in a variety of
   disciplines.  They can answer questions on topics from astronomy to
   zoology.  The site is a "laboratory that never sleeps."
   Travel to EE Link to learn more about endangered species, species
   recovery and related scientific definitions.  Educational and
   interactive information is also provided by the site.
   The USGS "Learning Web"  is dedicated to K-12 education, exploration
   and lifelong learning.  Visitors can explore the Earth virtually
   through the Internet.  Take a journey and encounter the hidden worlds
   of plants and animals and land and water.   Learn how biology,
   hydrology, and geography help us to understand our changing world.
   The Learning Place  provides educational materials in the National Park
   Service site, ParkNet.  The website is designed for those who are
   interested in learning about America´s natural and cultural heritage in
   relation to national parks.
   Visit the U.S Environmental Protection Agency´s site, U.S. EPA, to find
   external links to education grants, curriculum resources and community
   service activities information.
   Why should we care about endangered and threatened species?  Find out
   why through the Fish and Wildlife Service´s site at Kids Information
   Central.   Students can learn what their school can do to help save
   endangered species.   Teachers can get educational materials to explain
   the issues behind endangered plants and animals.
   The mission of the NASA Classroom of the Future  is to challenge
   students to become problem solvers when given the resources provided by
   NASA´s large scientific database.  Expand young minds and discover a
   new universe of  learning in this site.
   View Earth images from space via satellites in NASA´s Earth Observing
   System (EOS) site.  The program is a long-term observation of the
   Earth´s surface, the atmosphere and the oceans.
   Information Central from nationalgeographic.com is an online
   encyclopedia, which includes information on animals, biographies,
   science careers, environmental concerns, geography and history.
   To read the article, Caribbean Quest: The Search for New Species by
   Mary K. Miller, go to the Discovery Channel online site.  Travel to the
   Caribbean project with external links and peruse maps and photos.
   The Virtual Natural History Museum is a new website worth checking out
   (and contributing to)!  The Virtual Natural History Museum has
   interesting articles and a lots of great zoological links.  It is
   currently under construction, but is in the process of becoming a great
   source of information to recommend to non-scientists and students.
   Join scientists as they dive to the mid-ocean ridge thousands of meters
   deep at Dive and Discover, an interactive distance learning website
   designed to immerse you in the excitement of discovery and exploration
   of the deep sea floor.
