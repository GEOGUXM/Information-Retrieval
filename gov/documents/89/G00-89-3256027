                  Volcanic Hazards

                         Types of Volcano Hazards on
                            the Island of Hawai`i

   The following types of volcanic hazards on the Island of Hawai`i are
   described in the online publication, Volcanic and Seismic Hazards on
   the Island of Hawai`i, revised and reprinted in 1997.

   Lava flows

          Lava flows are the most common volcanic hazard on Hawai`i and
          pose the greatest threat to property. For example, since 1983,
          lava erupted by Kilauea Volcano has covered 102 km^2 of land,
          claimed 181 houses, and closed the coastal highway as flows
          resurfaced 13 km of it with as much as 25 m of lava.

            on the Island of Hawai`i.
          + Overview, lava-flow hazards and effects

   Explosive eruptions

          Explosive eruptions are relatively rare but pose a serious
          threat to life when they do occur -- a large explosive eruption
          in 1790 A.D. killed more than 80 Hawaiian warriors marching
          across the summit area of the volcano.

            Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i.

   Airborne lava fragments

          Airborne lava fragments erupted by lava fountains pose a serious
          hazard only in the immediate vicinity of an erupting vent.

   Sulfur dioxide gas

          Sulfur dioxide gas, continuously emitted during Kilauea's
          current long-lived eruption, has resulted in persistent volcanic
          air pollution in areas of the island downwind of the eruption.

            Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i.

          + Overview, volcanic gases and their effects

   Ground cracks and settling

          A lesser volcanic hazard is created by ground movement that
          occurs when molten rock moves underground; large cracks may
          appear across roads and other property, and subsidence can cause
          uneven settling of foundations.

            Seismic Hazards on the Island of Hawai`i.
