   Daschlenomics 101 Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and other
   Democrats want Americans to believe that the president's tax relief
   package is responsible for the current budget deficit.
   The total cost of President Bush's tax relief plan last year was $41
   billion, compared to the $313 billion surplus the Congressional Budget
   Office (CBO) estimated last January. How could a $41 billion tax
   reduction be responsible for erasing a $313 billion budget surplus?
   Sen. Daschle's new brand of economics has it all backwards. Government
   policy doesn't create surpluses, the economy does. When the economy
   grows, tax revenues climb and surpluses accumulate -- that's Economics
   101.
   Devoid of any new ideas to pull the economy out of recession, Democrats
   have resorted to pointing fingers and assigning blame. It's time for
   Democrats to help the president and Republicans pass a stimulus plan or
   get out of the way
