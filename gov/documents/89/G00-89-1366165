                 The NOAA Corps - America's Seventh Service


                     NOAA Corps Song "Forward with NOAA"

   The "NOAA Corps Song" is actually entitled "Forward with NOAA". In
   1987-88 the National Association of Commissioned Officers (ACO) was
   interested in commissioning a NOAA Song. Captain (then Commander) Steve
   Manzo was a member of the ACO Executive Board and volunteered to
   assist. Manzo contacted a long-time friend, Bob Arberg. Bob's father,
   Bud Arberg, had actually written the music and words to the "Army Song"
   -- while assigned to the Adjutant General's Staff during World War II.
   Dr. Arberg (former Princeton graduate in music) was retired and he
   readily volunteered to write a song. Dr. Arberg was provided reference
   materials on the NOAA Corps. He recognized at the outset that this was
   an attempt to build NOAA Corps morale and he cautioned that
   buy-in/acceptance within the Corps would not be easy.  The song was
   first presented at a National ACO Dining-In in either 1988 or 89.
   Secretary of Commerce William Verity was present, as were both Bud and
   Bob Arberg. Bud Arberg played the piano and performed the "NOAA Song"
   to the assembled group of ~150 officers and guests. Upon completing the
   NOAA Song, Secretary Verity graciously presented Dr. Arberg with a
   small gift of thanks on behalf of DOC/NOAA/NOAA Corps. The music was
   arranged by the USAF Band. The words are as follows:

     "Forward with NOAA"

     Forward with NOAA
     With the Corps that's got it all

     Science and Service
     We are always there to meet the call

     We survey the oceans
     And we track storms in the air

     Forward with NOAA
     We're the NOAA Corps, we're always there

     -- Musical Interlude then Repeat --

     Forward with NOAA
     With the Corps that's got it all

     Science and Service
     We are always there to meet the call

     We survey the oceans
     And we track storms in the air

     Forward with NOAA
     We're the NOAA Corps, we're always there
