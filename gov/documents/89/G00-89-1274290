   How Earnings Affect Payment
   Survivor Annuities
   Frequently Asked Questions

   Annuities are payable to surviving widows and widowers, children and
   certain other dependents. Lump-sum benefits are payable after the death
   of a railroad employee only if there are no qualified survivors of the
   employee immediately eligible for annuities. With the exception of a
   residual lump-sum death benefit, eligibility for survivor benefits
   depends on whether or not the employee was “insured” under the Railroad
   Retirement Act at the time of death.
   An employee is insured if he or she has at least 10 years of railroad
   service and a “current connection” with the railroad industry as of the
   month the annuity begins or the month of death, whichever occurs first.
   The current connection requirement is described at the beginning of
   this pamphlet.
   If a deceased employee was not so insured, jurisdiction of any survivor
   benefits payable is transferred to the Social Security Administration
   and any survivor benefits are paid by that agency instead of the Board.
   Regardless of which agency has jurisdiction, the deceased employee's
   railroad retirement and social security credits will be combined for
   the purpose of benefit computations.

                         Types of Survivor Benefits

   Annuities are payable to widows, widowers, and unmarried children; in
   certain cases, benefits are also payable to parents, remarried
   widow(er)s, grandchildren and surviving divorced spouses.
   WIDOWS’ and WIDOWERS’ ANNUITIES are payable at:

     Age 60; age reductions are applied to annuities awarded before full
     retirement age. The eligibility age for unreduced annuities is
     gradually rising from age 65 to age 67, depending on the year of
     birth.
     Ages 50-59 if the widow(er) is totally and permanently disabled and
     unable to work in any regular employment. The disability must have
     begun within seven years after the employee's death or within seven
     years after the termination of an annuity based on caring for a
     child of the deceased employee. A five-month waiting period is
     required after the onset of disability before a disability annuity
     can begin.
     Any age if the widow(er) is caring for an unmarried child of the
     deceased employee under age 18 or a disabled child of any age who
     became disabled before age 22.

   Survivor annuities may also be payable to a surviving divorced spouse,
   or remarried widow(er). Benefits are limited to the amounts social
   security would pay and therefore are less than the amount of the
   survivor annuity otherwise payable.
   A surviving divorced spouse may qualify if she or he was married to the
   employee for at least 10 years, is unmarried or remarried under the
   conditions described in the next paragraph, and is age 60 or older (50
   if disabled). A surviving divorced spouse who is unmarried can qualify
   at any age if caring for the employee’s child and the child is under
   age 16 or disabled, in which case the 10-year marriage requirement does
   not apply.
   The portion of a survivor annuity equivalent to a social security
   benefit may be paid to a widow(er) or surviving divorced spouse who
   remarries after age 60, or to a disabled widow(er) or disabled
   surviving divorced spouse who remarries after age 50; however,
   remarriage prior to age 60 (or age 50 if disabled) would not prevent
   eligibility if such remarriage ends. Such social security level
   benefits may also be paid to a younger widow(er) or surviving divorced
   spouse caring for the employee’s child who is under age 16 or disabled,
   if the remarriage is to a person receiving railroad retirement or
   social security benefits or the remarriage ends.
   OTHER SURVIVOR ANNUITIES are payable to:

   An unmarried child under age 18.
   An unmarried child age 18 in full-time attendance at an elementary or
   secondary school, until the student attains age 19 or the end of the
   school term in progress when the student attains age 19. In most cases
   where a student attains age 19 during the school term, benefits are
   limited to the two months following the month age 19 is attained.
   An unmarried disabled child over age 18 if the child became totally and
   permanently disabled before age 22.
   An unmarried dependent grandchild meeting any of the requirements
   described above for a child, if both the grandchild’s parents are
   deceased or disabled.
   A parent at age 60 who was dependent on the employee for at least half
   of the parent’s support. If the employee was also survived by a
   widow(er), surviving divorced spouse or child who could ever qualify
   for an annuity, the parent's annuity is limited to the amount that
   social security would pay.

                         Survivor Annuity Estimates

   The best way for survivors to obtain an annuity estimate is to visit or
   telephone the nearest Board field office. Active or retired employees
   who are concerned about the amount of benefits which would be payable
   to their survivors may also receive estimates from the nearest Board
   field office.
   The following information may be helpful in providing an idea of the
   amount of potential survivor benefits:
   The average annuity awarded to widow(er)s in fiscal year 2000,
   excluding remarried widow(er)s and surviving divorced spouses, was $997
   a month. Children received $858 a month, on the average. Total family
   benefits for widow(er)s with children averaged $2,237 a month. The
   average annuity awarded to remarried widow(er)s or surviving divorced
   spouses in fiscal year 2000 was $631 a month.
   If the spouse of a retired employee is receiving an annuity from the
   Board, the widow(er)’s annuity will not be less than the annuity she or
   he was receiving as a spouse in the month before the employee died.

                           Survivor Annuity Tiers

   Survivor annuities, like retirement annuities, consist of tier I and
   tier II components.
   Tier I is based on the deceased employee's combined railroad retirement
   and social security credits, and is generally equivalent to the amount
   that would have been payable under social security.
   Tier II amounts are percentages of the deceased employee's tier II
   amount, as described in the section on formulas.

                        Survivors with Dual Benefits

   Social Security Benefits

   The tier I portion is reduced by the amount of any social security
   benefits received by a survivor annuitant, even if the social security
   benefits are based on the survivor's own earnings. This reduction
   follows the principles of social security law which, in effect, limit
   payment to the higher of any two or more benefits payable to an
   individual at one time. When both railroad retirement annuities and
   social security benefits are payable, they are generally combined into
   a single payment issued through the Board. A survivor annuitant must
   notify the Board if any benefits are received directly from the Social
   Security Administration or if those benefits increase.
   Public Pensions
   The tier I portion of a widow’s or widower’s annuity may be reduced for
   receipt of any Federal, State or local government pension based on the
   widow(er)’s own earnings. The reduction generally does not apply if the
   employment on which the public pension is based was covered under
   social security as of the last day of the individual’s employment.*
   However, most military service pensions and payments from the
   Department of Veterans Affairs  will not cause a reduction. For those
   subject to the public pension reduction, the tier I reduction is equal
   to 2/3 of the amount of the public pension.
   * A special rule applies to Federal employees who switch from the Civil
   Service Retirement System to the Federal Employees Retirement System.
   Employee Annuity
   If a widow(er) is qualified for a railroad retirement employee annuity
   as well as a survivor annuity, a special guaranty applies in some
   cases. If both the widow(er) and the deceased employee started railroad
   employment after 1974, the survivor annuity payable to the widow(er) is
   reduced by the amount of the employee annuity.
   If either the deceased employee or the survivor annuitant had some
   service before 1975 but had not completed 120 months of railroad
   service before 1975, the employee annuity and the tier II portion of
   the survivor annuity would be payable to the widow(er). The tier I
   portion of the survivor annuity would be payable only to the extent
   that it exceeds the tier I portion of the employee annuity.
   If either the deceased employee or the survivor annuitant completed 120
   months of railroad service before 1975, the widow or dependent widower
   may receive both an employee annuity and a survivor annuity, without a
   full dual benefit reduction.

               Cost-of-living Increases in Survivor Annuities

   Cost-of-living increases, effective December 1 and included in the
   January payment, are made on the basis of increases in national prices
   or, in some circumstances, average national wages, and calculated the
   same way as cost-of-living increases in employee and spouse annuities.

                        Work and Earnings Limitations

   A survivor annuity is not payable for any month the survivor works for
   a railroad or railroad union.
   Survivors who are receiving social security benefits have their
   railroad retirement annuity and social security benefit combined for
   earnings limitations purposes. Prior to the calendar year in which full
   retirement age is attained, there is a deduction of $1 in benefits for
   every $2 earned over an exempt amount ($10,680 in 2001). The deduction
   is $1 for every $3 earned over an exempt amount ($25,000 in 2001) for
   the months in the calendar year in which the individual attains full
   retirement age, up to the month of attainment. Work deductions stop
   effective with the month full retirement age is attained. In the first
   year in which a survivor is both entitled to an annuity and has a
   non-work month, a full annuity can be paid for those months in which
   the survivor had low earnings or did not have substantial
   self-employment, no matter what total earnings for the year were.
   As work and earnings may affect the payment of an annuity, they must be
   reported promptly to the Board in order to prevent potential
   overpayments and penalties.
   These earnings restrictions do not apply to disabled widow(er)s under
   age 60 or to disabled children. However, any work or earnings by a
   disability annuitant must be reported and are reviewed to determine
   whether they indicate recovery from the disability.

                         When Survivor Payments Stop

   Payments stop upon death, and no annuity is payable for the month of
   death.
   A widow(er)’s annuity or surviving divorced spouse’s benefit stops if
   (1) the annuity was based on caring for a child under age 18 (16 for a
   surviving divorced spouse) or a disabled child and the child is no
   longer under age 18 (16 for a surviving divorced spouse) or disabled,
   or (2) the annuity was based on disability and the beneficiary recovers
   from the disability before age 60. A disability annuity can be
   reinstated if the disability recurs within seven years and the
   widow(er) is still under age 60. Remarriage will reduce a widow(er)’s
   annuity rate, and, in some cases, prevent payment.
   A child’s or grandchild’s annuity will stop if he or she
   (1) marries, (2) reaches age 18, or (3) recovers from the disability on
   which his or her annuity was based. If the child is 18 and a full-time
   elementary or high school student, the annuity stops upon graduation
   from high school, attainment of age 19, or the end of the first school
   term after attainment of age 19. In most cases where a student attains
   age 19 during the school term, benefits are limited to the two months
   following the month age 19 is attained.
   A parent's survivor annuity may stop upon remarriage; in certain cases,
   a remarried parent is entitled to a tier I benefit.
   Any of the above occurrences must be reported promptly to the Board in
   order to prevent an overpayment.

                           Lump-sum Death Benefits

   A lump-sum death benefit is payable to certain survivors of an employee
   with 10 or more years of railroad service and a current connection with
   the railroad industry if there is no survivor immediately eligible for
   an annuity upon the employee’s death.
   The amount payable depends primarily on whether the deceased employee
   (1) was credited with 10 years of service before January 1, 1975, in
   which case the average benefit payable is about $890, or (2) completed
   the 10th year of railroad service after 1974, in which case the
   lump-sum benefit is $255.
   If the employee had 10 years of service prior to 1975, the lump-sum
   benefit is payable to the widow(er) if she or he were either living
   with or supported by the employee at the time of death, or if the
   employee were under a court order for support. If the employee was not
   survived by a qualified widow(er), the benefit may be paid to the
   funeral home or the payer of the funeral expenses, but the amount paid
   cannot exceed the actual costs involved. However, if the employee
   acquired the 10th year of service after 1974, the lump sum is payable
   only to the widow(er) living in the same household as the employee at
   the time of the employee’s death.
   If a widow(er) is eligible for monthly benefits at the time of the
   employee’s death, but the widow(er) had excess earnings deductions
   which prevented annuity payments or for any other reason did not
   receive monthly benefits in the 12-month period beginning with the
   month of the employee’s death totaling at least as much as the lump
   sum, the difference between the lump-sum benefit and monthly benefits
   actually paid, if any, is payable in the form of a deferred lump-sum
   benefit.
   Residual Lump-sum Payment

   There is an additional death benefit--a residual payment--for which an
   insured status is not required. The residual lump sum is, in effect, a
   refund of a deceased employee’s pre-1975 railroad retirement taxes plus
   an amount in lieu of interest. The residual amount is reduced for any
   employee or spouse benefits that have been paid on the basis of the
   employee’s service, except for the vested dual benefit, and for any
   survivor benefits previously paid by either the Railroad Retirement
   Board or the Social Security Administration. Therefore, if an employee
   received an annuity for two or more years, there is little chance that
   a residual would be payable to his or her survivors.
   A residual cannot be paid if there are immediate or future monthly
   survivor benefits payable. However, a widow(er) or parent who would be
   eligible in the future can, before attaining age 60, elect to waive
   future rights to monthly benefits in order for the residual payment to
   be made. The residual cannot be paid if there is a surviving divorced
   spouse who could qualify for monthly benefits unless she or he waives
   all rights to future benefits.
   Once a residual is paid, no further benefits are payable on the basis
   of the employee's railroad earnings.
   Furthermore, the widow(er) or parent electing a residual also gives up
   rights to Medicare based on the deceased employee's railroad service.
   If the individual is not qualified for Medicare on her or his own
   earnings, she or he could qualify for Medicare as an uninsured person.
   However, she or he would have to pay substantial premiums for hospital
   insurance coverage, in addition to the normally required medical
   insurance premiums.
   The residual payment is made to the employee’s widow(er) (who was
   living with the employee), children, grandchildren, parents, brothers
   and sisters, or estate, in that order of precedence. It cannot be paid
   to a surviving divorced spouse. If an employee wishes any residual
   payment that may become due to be made differently, he or she can file
   a designation of beneficiary with the Board. The forms are available at
   any field office. Once such a designation is made, the employee must
   file a new one if he or she ever wants to change the beneficiary. The
   average residual lump sum paid in 2000 was approximately $3,800.
