                       HOW TO HANDLE AN ANTHRAX THREAT

   PUBLIC FACILITIES

   If you receive a letter or phone call claiming to be infected with
   Anthrax, your first response has to be containment. Anthrax is a
   treatable infection using common everyday antibiotics such as
   penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. The key to controlling the
   situation is not to panic and limit the exposed area and people. Until
   a permanent directive can be established, the following procedure is to
   be adhered to:
    1. Lock your door and DO NOT let anyone in or out.
    2. Don't pass the letter or package around or call a co-worker for
       help.
    3. Call 911 immediately and let them know what you have.
    4. Note the type of package, how it was delivered, and anything that
       will help in the subsequent investigation.
    5. Limit your exposure by leaving the item alone, closing the package
       or envelope with the materials inside.
    6. Keep your hands away from your face so you don't touch your eyes,
       nose or mouth. Wash Your Hands!

   SCHOOLS

   If you receive a letter claiming to be infected with Anthrax or a phone
   call saying there is an Anthrax presence at your site, your first
   response has to be containment. The key to controlling the situation is
   to remain calm and limit the area and persons exposed to the threat.
   Immediately after identifying the threat, Immediately Dial 911 make an
   announcement that all staff and students are to remain in the rooms
   they are in (or proceed immediately to their next scheduled room). If
   applicable, do not allow anyone in or out of the room where the letter
   was opened. Do not call in any additional personnel for help, as you
   will only increase the number of people with possible exposure. Next,
   contact you Chief Engineer Custodian and advise her or him to turn off
   all air handling equipment. After shutting down the air flow movements
   at your site, contact the District Emergency Coordinator, the District
   Director of Security Services and your immediate supervisor. If
   applicable, note the type of package, how it was delivered, and
   anything that will help in the subsequent investigation. Limit your
   exposure by leaving the item alone, closing the package or envelope
   with the materials inside. Keep your hands away from your face so you
   don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Wash Your Hands! Symptoms of
   inhalation anthrax can begin as early as 24 hours after breathing the
   spores. Initial symptoms may include fever and chills, cough, chest
   soreness, chest pain, noisy breathing, weakness and lethargy.

   HOW TO HANDLE AN ANTHRAX THREATANTHRAX FACTS (FAQ's)

   What is Anthrax?
   Anthrax is a disease normally associated with plant eating animals
   (sheep, goats, cattle and to a lesser degree swine), caused by the
   bacteria Bacillus Anthracis. Anthrax has been recognized as an illness
   for centuries.

   How Do I Get Infected by Anthrax?
   Human infection with Anthrax usually results from direct contact with
   infected animals, or animal products such as wool, meat or hides.
   However, when Anthrax is used as a biological weapon, people become
   infected by breathing Anthrax that is released into the air. Anthrax
   can also enter the human body through broken skin.

   Can Anthrax be Transmitted from Person to Person?
   No. There have been no reports of Anthrax ever being transmitted from
   person to person.

   Can Anyone Get Anthrax from Washing My Clothing?
   There have never been any reports of family members contracting Anthrax
   handling clothing soiled with known Anthrax spores.

   Is Anthrax Treatable?
   If treated before symptoms become severe, Anthrax is treatable with
   common antibiotics. Therefore, it is very important to observe anyone
   with possible exposure for any of the above symptoms.

   I Have Flu-Like Symptoms, Should I Ignore Them?
   No. Since a threat of Anthrax was made, anyone exhibiting flu-like
   symptoms would be seen by a doctor, the Erie County Medical Center or
   other local Emergency Department.

   Can We Attend Work Or Treatment At The Site Tomorrow?
   Yes. The Anthrax spore has a very short life span once airborne.
