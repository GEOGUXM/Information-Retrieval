                                  Introduction

   This bibliography lists scientific articles and papers coauthored by
   the Principal Investigators, Coinvestigators, and their associates of
   the eleven Voyager science investigations. They report analysis and
   research based on data from six planetary encounters, the intervening
   cruise periods, and the post-Neptune interstellar cruise. The
   bibliography covers publications from 1977 through 1999. Annual updates
   will be issued as addendums to this bibliography.

   This listing organizes articles and papers by investigation, as shown
   in the table of contents, then by year of publication, and,
   alphabetically by author. It also identifies some (but by no means all)
   of the collaborative efforts of scientists from different
   investigations. Generally, the multiauthor articles appear according to
   the first author's affiliation.
