                  GSFC DAAC Dataset via DODS DODS-Homepage

     The information on this page is provided to the Distributed
     Oceanographic Data System (DODS) users. Assuming the users have some
     knowledge with the DODS client/server software, the information
     shown here will direct you to the locations where DODS enabled data
     are stored. With the different links available, users can cut and
     paste the links from our data files directly into your DODS client
     or browser for further data manipulation. Currently these data sets
     are available at GSFC's Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) via
     the DODS server. To get more details on the data files click on the
     icons.

   TOMS Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Daily Gridded Data
   Global total column ozone levels. The data were acquired from
   instruments aboard the NIMBUS-7, Meteor-3, ADEOS, and EP-TOMS
   satellites.


   CIDC Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection (CIDC)
   Monthly means of over 70 parameters from the fields of meteorology,
   atmospheric, land surface, oceanic, cryospheric, biospheric, solar and
   remote sensing sciences in a format designed for easy comparisons.


   TRMM Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM) Gridded Rainfall Data
   The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission is the first mission dedicated
   to measuring tropical and subtropical rainfall through microwave and
   visible infrared sensors, and includes the first space borne rain
   radar.


   GOME Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) Daily Gridded Ozone Data
   (Globally Interpolated)
   Global total column ozone levels. The data were aquired from GOME
   aboard the ERS-2 satellite. The GOME instrument data are unique in that
   they represent the only source of satellite derived global total ozone
   measurements during the period when there were no TOMS data (July 1995
   to July 1996).


   MSU Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) Deep Layer Temperatures and Ocean
   Precipitation Data
   Deep layer temperatures and oceanic precipitation rates derived from 16
   years of measurements taken by the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) flown
   aboard NOAA's Polar-Orbiting Operational Satellites (POES).
