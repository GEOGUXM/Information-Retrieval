     What's New on the TEA-21 Web Site
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century was enacted June 9,
   1998 as Public Law 105-178. TEA-21 authorizes the Federal surface
   transportation programs for highways, highway safety, and transit for
   the 6-year period 1998-2003. The TEA 21 Restoration Act, enacted July
   22, 1998, provided technical corrections to the original law. The
   material presented on this web site reflects the combined effect of
   these two laws and refers to this combination as TEA-21. The contents
   of the TEA-21 web site are organized as follows:


   Legislation The full text of TEA-21, the TEA 21 Restoration Act, and
   the related congressional reports.
   Cross Reference For each section of TEA-21, the legislative language,
   links to related guidance (policy memoranda, Federal Register notices,
   regulatory actions), fact sheets, questions and answers, and other
   resources.
   Summary Information Summaries of TEA-21 content, progress reports, etc.
   Fact Sheets Fact sheets on the programs and provisions in TEA-21.
   Funding Tables Tables showing TEA-21 authorizations, apportionments,
   allocations, obligation limitations.
   Information Exchange Information about the TEA-21 outreach sessions,
   including session summaries.
