   The TERRA spacecraft (formally known as EOS-AM) will operate in a
   near-circular, sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of
   approximately 98.2 degrees. The descending node crossing time is
   10:30am.

   Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS) will
   be the ground system used to command and control the TERRA spacecraft.
   In addition, EOSDIS will also be used to process, archive and
   distribute the science data products.

   The primary communication link between the TERRA spacecraft and EOSDIS
   is via TDRSS. Command and housekeeping telemetry will be transmitted
   via S-band. The science data recorded onboard will be transmitted via
   Ku-band at 150 Mbps. The nominal mode of operation is to acquire two 12
   minute TDRSS contacts per orbit. During each TDRSS contact, both S-band
   and Ku-band transmission will be used.

   In the event that TDRSS communication becomes unavailable, the EOS
   Polar Ground Stations (EPGS) located at Poker Flats, Alaska and
   Spitzbergen, Norway and the Wallops Island Station, VA will be used to
   support command and housekeeping telemetry via the S-band.

   Besides Ku-band and S-band communication, TERRA is also capable of
   downlinking science data via the X-band. The X-band communication can
   be operated in three different modes, Direct Broadcast (DB), Direct
   Downlink (DDL) and Direct Playback (DP). DB and DDL will be used to
   directly transmit real-time MODIS and ASTER science data respectively
   to users. In the DP mode, recorded science data can be downlinked to
   the EPGS and serves as a backup to the primary Ku-band communication
   link.
