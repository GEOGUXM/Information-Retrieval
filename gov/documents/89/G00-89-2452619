   DATES: All applications must be received by 5 p.m. Eastern Standard

   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
   Introduction
       The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) announces that applications
   are being accepted for participation in the Fiscal Year 2003 Cooperator
   (Cooperator) program. The program is designed to create, expand, and
   maintain foreign markets for United States' agricultural commodities
   and products through cost-share assistance. Financial assistance under
   the Cooperator program will be made available on a competitive basis
   and applications will be reviewed against the evaluation criteria
   contained herein. The Cooperator program is administered by the Foreign
   Agricultural Service (FAS).
       Under the Cooperator program, CCC enters into agreements with
   nonprofit U.S. trade organizations which have the broadest possible
   producer representation of the commodity being promoted and gives
   priority to those organizations which are nationwide in membership and
   scope. Cooperators may receive assistance only for the promotion of
   generic activities which do not involve promotions targeted directly to
   consumers. The program generally operates on a reimbursement basis.
   Authority
       The Cooperator program is authorized by section 5(f) of the
   Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, 15 U.S.C. 714c(f). Cooperator
   program regulations appear at 7 CFR part 1484.
   Eligible Applicants
       To participate in the Cooperator program an applicant must be a
   nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization.
   Application Process
       To be considered for the Cooperator program an applicant must
   submit to the FAS information required by the Cooperator program
   regulations set forth in 7 CFR part 1484. Incomplete applications and
   applications which do not otherwise conform to this announcement will
   not be accepted for review.
       The FAS administers various other agricultural export assistance
   programs, including the Market Access Program (MAP), Cochran
   Fellowships, the Emerging Markets Program, the Quality Samples Program,
   Section 108 foreign currency program, and several Export Credit
   Guarantee programs. Organizations which are interested in applying for
   Cooperator program funds are encouraged to submit their requests using
   the Unified Export Strategy (UES) format. The UES allows interested
   entities to submit a consolidated and strategically coordinated single
   proposal that incorporates requests for funding and recommendations for
   virtually all the FAS marketing programs, financial assistance
   programs, and market access programs. The suggested UES format
   encourages applicants to examine the constraints or barriers to trade
   which they face, identify activities which would help overcome such
   impediments, consider the entire pool of complementary marketing tools
   and program resources, and establish realistic export goals. Applicants
   are not required, however, to use the UES format.
       Organizations can submit applications in the UES format by two
   methods. The first allows an applicant to submit information directly
   to the FAS through the UES application Internet site. The FAS highly
   recommends applying via the Internet, as this format virtually
   eliminates paperwork and expedites the FAS processing and review cycle.
   Applicants also have the option of submitting electronic versions
   (along with two paper copies) of their applications to the FAS on
   diskette.
       Applicants planning to use the Internet-based system must contact
   the FAS Marketing Operations Staff on (202) 720-4327 to obtain site
   access information. The Internet-based application, including
   step-by-step instructions for its use, is located at the following URL
   address: http://www.fas.usda.gov/cooperators.html.
       Applicants who choose to submit applications on diskette can
   download the UES handbook, including the suggested application format
   and instructions, from the following URL address:
   http://www.fas.usda.gov/mos/ues/unified.html. A UES handbook also may
   be obtained by contacting
   the Marketing Operations Staff on (202) 720-4327.
       All cooperator program applicants, whether applying via the
   Internet on diskette, also must submit by March 11, 2002, via hand
   delivery or U.S. mail, an original signed certification statement as
   specified in 7 CFR section 1484.20(a)(14). The UES handbook contains an
   acceptable certification format.
       Any organization which is not interested in applying for the
   Cooperator program but would like to request assistance through one of
   the other programs mentioned should contact the Marketing Operations
   Staff on (202) 720-4327.
   Review Process and Allocation Criteria
       The FAS allocates funds in a manner which effectively supports the
   strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government Performance and
   Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the USDA's Food and Agricultural Policy
   (FAP). In deciding whether a proposed project will contribute to the
   effective creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets, the
   FAS seeks to identify a clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy
   and a program effectiveness time line against which results can be
   measured at specific intervals using quantifiable product or country
   goals. The FAS also considers the extent to which a proposed project
   targets markets with the greatest growth potential. These factors are
   part of the FAS resource allocation strategy to fund applicants who can
   demonstrate performance and address the objectives of the GPRA and
   FAP.    Following is a description of the FAS process for reviewing
   applications and the criteria for allocating available Cooperator
   program funds.
   (1) Phase 1--Sufficiency Review and FAS Divisional Review
       Applications received by the closing date will be reviewed by the
   FAS to determine eligibility of the applicants and the completeness of
   the applications. These requirements appear at Sec. 1484.14 and Sec.
   1484.20 of the Cooperator program regulations. Applications which meet
   the application requirements then will be further evaluated by the
   proper FAS Commodity Division. The Divisions will review each
   application against the criteria listed in Sec. 1484.21 and Sec.
   1484.22 of the Cooperator program regulations. The purpose of this
   review is to identify meritorious proposals and the recommend an
   appropriate funding level for each application based upon these
   criteria.
   (2) Phase 2--Competitive Review
       Meritorious applications then will be passed on to the Office of
   the Deputy Administrator, Commodity and Marketing Programs, for the
   purpose of allocating available funds among the applicants.
   Applications which pass the Divisional Review will compete for funds on
   the basis of the following allocation criteria (the number in
   parentheses represents a percentage weight factor):
   (a) Contribution Level (40)
       The applicant's 6-year average share (1998-2003) of all
   contributions (contributions may include cash and goods and services
   provided by U.S. entities in support of foreign market development
   activities) compared to
       The applicant's 6-year average share (1998-2003) of all Cooperator
   marketing plan budgets.
   (b) Past Export Performance (20)
       The 6-year average share (1997-2002) of the value of exports
   promoted by the applicant compared to
       The applicant's 6-year average share (1997-2002) of all Cooperator
   marketing plan budgets plus a 6-year average share (1996-2001) of
   foreign overhead provided for co-location within a U.S.
   agricultural trade office.
   (c) Past Demand Expansion Performance (20)
       The 6-year average share (1997-2002) of the total value of world
   trade of the commodities promoted by the applicant compared to
       The applicant's 6-year average share (1997-2002) of all Cooperator
   marketing plan budgets plus a 6-year average share (1996-2001) of MAP
   program ceiling levels and a 6-year average share (1996-
   2001) of foreign overhead provided for co-location within a U.S.
   agricultural trade office.
   (d) Future Demand Expansion Goals (10)
       The project total dollar value of world trade of the commodities
   being promoted by the applicant for the year 2008 compared to
       The applicant's requested funding level.
   (e) Accuracy of Past Demand Expansion Projects (10)
       The actual dollar value share of world trade of the commodities
   being promoted by the applicant for the year 2001 compared to
       The applicant's past projected share of world trade of the
   commodities being promoted by the applicant for the year 2001, as
   specified in the 1998 Cooperator program application.
       The Commodity Divisions' recommended funding level for each
   applicant is converted to a percentage of the total Cooperator program
   funds available then multiplied by the total weight factor to determine
   the amount of funds allocated to each applicant.
   Closing Date for Applications
       All Internet-based applications must be properly submitted by 5
   p.m. Eastern Standard Time, March 11, 2002. Signed certification
   statements also must be received by that time at one of the addresses
   listed below.
