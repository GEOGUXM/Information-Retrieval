      USFA stands for the United States Fire Administration. The USFA is part
      of the federal government. One of our jobs is to help prevent fires. We
      want everyone to be safe from fire, including you! The Kids Page is
      full of tips that can help you and your family be safe from fire.



       Can you guess how many fires are started by kids every year?

   2 Or maybe 200

   Every year, children start nearly 100,000 fires that hurt people and
   cause a lot of damage.

   That's why playing with fire -- lighters , matches or candles -- is
   such a bad idea.

      Fires are very dangerous. More people die in fires than in hurricanes,
      earthquakes, floods and all other natural disasters combined!

      We're glad you want to help us prevent fires. We need YOUR help.

      We hope you like the Kids Page.

      OK kids! Where do you want to go first?
