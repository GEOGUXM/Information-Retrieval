   Civic Center Exterior The St. Lucie County Civic Center is the only
   venue of its kind on the Treasure Coast, and hosts a wide variety of
   business and entertainment events year round.  The auditorium offers
   24,000 square feet of exhibit space (which can be divided in half),
   full theater and staging, locker and dressing rooms,  concession and
   kitchen facilities, and balcony seating.  It lends itself to antique
   and craft shows,  fund raising events,  and lectures/large group
   events.   Two separate multi-purpose rooms are located in the Center,
   one which accommodates 75 people (classroom style) and the other which
   will hold 130 (classroom style).  These spaces can be rented separately
   or in combination.
