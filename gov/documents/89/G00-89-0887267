   Registry for .Gov Top-level Domain

   In October of 1997, the Federal Networking Council (now abolished)
   delegated full responsibility for the Internet Domain Space .GOV to the
   General Services Administration. GSA's Office of Electronic Government
   has management responsibility for GOV Domain policy.
   The Federal Networking Council (FNC) also submitted an Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) Informational RFC 2146 to provide
   guidance for determining which organizations were eligible to register
   in the .gov domain space.
   It is clear that the intent of the FNC was to reduce the number of .gov
   domain names. However, there is a provision (section 1A) in the RFC
   2146 for cross-agency collaborative organizations, which allows .gov
   registration upon presentation of a charter. Further, there is a
   provision (section 1F) that allows names by request of an agency Chief
   Information Officer (CIO). These latter two provisions have been the
   bulk of requested, and approved names since the RFC was issued.
   Visit http://www.nic.gov for more information or to submit an
   electronic request for a new domain under .GOV, .FED, or .US.
   For GOV Domain policy, inquiries can be submitted to the following
   e-mail address marion.royal@gsa.gov . Please label the subject line of
   your e-mail message as "GOV Domain policy."
