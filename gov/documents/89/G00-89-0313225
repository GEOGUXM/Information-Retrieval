  How Family Members Can be Supportive
   __________________________________________________________________

   After exposure to a traumatic event many people experience unsettling
   reactions that are out of the ordinary for them. Exposure to these
   incidents may result in a disruption of person's physical and emotional
   well-being. These unsettling reactions are not uncommon; in fact they
   are normal. No one is immune from these responses, regardless of your
   age or past experience. Often these reactions appear immediately after
   the event or they may appear hours, days or weeks later. The following
   are some coping tips that may help your family member deal with
   exposure to this type of trauma.

     * Listen, listen, listen - One of the most important needs after
       exposure to a traumatic event is the need to talk about it. It may
       be difficult for you to hear, or you may get tired of hearing about
       the same story, but talking is a critical part of your loved ones
       recovery. Be supportive and sympathetic, but try to avoid
       overreacting. Your loved one needs to tell his or her own story. If
       your loved one tries to shield you from the event by refusing to
       talk about it, you should not force him or her to talk about it.
     * Don't encourage your loved one to quit work - After crisis emotions
       run high. It is easy to rush into things without thinking. While it
       may be difficult for your loved one to face going back to work,
       returning to work may actually be the best way to recover from the
       crisis. Work can provide the support of others who have been
       through the same thing you have
     * Include the whole family in the healing process - Both you and your
       spouse may feel that you should protect your children from the
       upsetting event. But they will undoubtedly know something is wrong.
       If you try to hide the truth from them, your children may think
       they are somehow to blame. This can be a stressful time for them
       too, and they may need some help getting through it.
     * Watch for signs of strain in your relationship - Marital problems
       are common after exposure to a traumatic event. If you experience
       this, please contact the EAP.
     * Take care of yourself - you also need some support. Ask family or
       friends for help, and don't be afraid to call the EAP for
       assistance.
