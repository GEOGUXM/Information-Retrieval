Obtaining Instrument Time

     There are several ways for users to obtain beam time on NCNR
     instruments.

     Proposals

     The primary method is through our proposal system. Calls for
     Proposals are issued approximately twice a year. Proposals are
     normally peer-reviewed, first by technical experts on the scientific
     topic of the proposals, then by the NCNR Program Advisory Committee,
     which recommends beam time allocation. NCNR staff schedule the time
     for approved proposals.
     For more information on User Proposals, see our latest Call For
     Proposals.
     Here are some statistics for proposals received in response to a
     recent Call.

     Collaborations

     Many users obtain instrument time through scientific collaborations
     with NCNR staff. If you are interested in starting a collaborative
     project, please contact a staff member to discuss your ideas.

     Research Consortia

     There are several NCNR instruments (e.g. NG7 30-m SANS, NG7
     reflectometer, BT1 powder diffractometer) that were built and are
     maintained by research consortia, typically including NIST and
     several other institutions. The consortium members are entitled to a
     portion of the time on these instruments.
