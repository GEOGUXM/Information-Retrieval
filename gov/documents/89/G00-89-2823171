                            Saturn's Ring System

   The rings of Saturn have puzzled astronomers ever since they were
   discovered by Galileo in 1610 using the first telescope. The puzzles
   have only increased since Voyagers 1 and 2 imaged the ring system
   extensively in 1980 and 1981. In addition to the images, several
   Voyager instruments observed occultations of the ring system with
   radial resolution as fine as 100 meters. The rings have been given
   letter names in the order of their discovery. The main rings are,
   working outward from the planet, known as C, B, and A. The Cassini
   Division is the largest gap in the rings and separates Rings B and A.
   In addition a number of fainter rings have been discovered more
   recently. The D Ring is exceedingly faint and closest to the planet.
   The F Ring is a narrow feature just outside the A Ring. Beyond that are
   two far fainter rings named G and E. The particles in Saturn's rings
   are composed primarily of water ice and range from microns to meters in
   size. The rings show a tremendous amount of structure on all scales;
   some of this structure is related to gravitational perturbations by
   Saturn's many moons, but much of it remains unexplained.

Animations

     * The Voyager 2 flyby of Saturn (Quicktime format, 822 Kbytes)
       This animation illustrates the geometry of Voyager 2's passage
       through the Saturn system. This was a NASA full motion video clip,
       converted to QuickTime format.
     * A "spoke" movie (Quicktime format, 1.02 Mbytes)
       A sequence of Voyager images was used to generate this movie
       showing the motion of the mysterious "spokes" in Saturn's B Ring.
     * A stellar occulation by Saturn's rings (Quicktime format, 1.02
       Mbytes)
       The Voyager 2 photopolarimeter (PPS) and ultraviolet spectrometer
       (UVS) instruments observed the occultation of the star delta Sco by
       Saturn's rings. These experiments resolved the rings down to a
       scale of 100 meters. This animation shows the viewing geometry
       during the experiment.
