   Introduction:
   [p_hotline.gif]
   The Office of Inspector General (OIG) maintains a Hotline to facilitate
   the reporting of allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement
   in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) programs or operations. If you wish
   to report such allegations, you may call the Inspector General (IG)
   Hotline or send a letter to one of the addresses below. Allegations may
   be reported by DOE employees, contractors, or the general public.
   Issues that should be reported:
     * Contract, Procurement, and Grant Fraud
     * Environment, Health, and Safety Violations
     * Computer Crimes
     * Product Substitution and Suspect/Counterfeit Parts
     * Bribery, Kickbacks, and Gratuities
     * False Statements and False Claims
     * Conflicts of Interest and Ethics Violations
     * Travel Fraud
     * Theft and/or Abuse of Government property
     * Other Violations of Federal Laws and Regulations

   Callers are encouraged to provide relevant and specific details of
   their complaints, including the identity of the person, company, or
   organization alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing; a description of
   the alleged impropriety; the DOE facility and program affected by the
   alleged misconduct; contract numbers; date(s) of alleged wrongdoing;
   how the caller is aware of the alleged impropriety; the identity of
   potential witnesses; and the identity and location of supporting
   documentation.

   Complaint processing:
   Upon receipt of a specific allegation of fraud, waste, abuse, or
   mismanagement, the OIG may take any one of the following actions: open
   an investigation, audit, or inspection; refer the matter to DOE
   management for appropriate review and action; or refer the allegation
   to another Federal agency, including the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation. Allegations with limited specificity or merit may be
   held in abeyance until further, specific details are reported.

   Callers may remain anonymous:
   Individuals who contact the Hotline, via telephone or letter, are not
   required to identify themselves to the Hotline operator. However,
   persons who report allegations are encouraged to identify themselves in
   the event additional questions arise as the OIG evaluates or pursues
   their allegations.

   Confidentiality:
   The Office of Inspector General will protect the identity of
   complainants to the maximum extent possible by law. Confidentiality is
   established by Section 7(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, which
   precludes the IG from disclosing the identity of a DOE employee who
   reports an allegation or provides information, without the employee's
   consent, unless the IG determines that disclosure is unavoidable during
   the course of the investigation. Non-Department of Energy employees who
   report allegations may specifically request confidentiality.
    1. Inquiries about DOE press releases, programs and operations,
       publications, and energy information data can be made at the DOE
       home page or by calling the DOE Public Affairs Office at
       202-586-5575.
    2. If you would like to locate a DOE employee, please call the
       operator at 202-586-5000 or perform a name search of the DOE
       Telephone Directory.
    3. Questions about a utility bill or service for your residence or
       business should be directed to your local utility provider.
    4. Concerns about improper private or public disposal of hazardous
       wastes should be directed to your state or county environmental
       protection agency (EPA), or the Federal EPA at 1-888-546-8740. To
