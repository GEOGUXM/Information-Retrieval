   The NHTSA Vehicle Crash Test Database contains engineering data
   measured during various types of research, the New Car Assessment
   Program (NCAP), and compliance crash tests. Information in this
   database refers to the performance and response of vehicles and other
   structures in impacts. This database is not intended to support general
   consumer safety issues. For general consumer information please see the
   NHTSA's information on buying a safer car.
   Hours of Operation

        Access to the Vehicle Crash Test Database is limited to the hours
        listed below. Outside of these hours the database is unavailable in
        order to support regular maintenance. Occasionally, the database may
        be unavailable briefly during the listed hours due to unexpected
        maintenance or application updates.
        NOTE: All times are with respect to Washington, DC, USA (US Eastern,
        Daylight Savings Time is observed).

   Accessing the Database

     Interactive Access

     Examples of vehicle tests are those done as part of the NCAP and
     lateral vehicle-to-vehicle impacts. Features of the interactive
     access tools include drill-down to detail views, support for
     plotting of the crash test signals, download of individual signals
     in either NHTSA UDS-1992 or ASCII X-Y (as tab separated values)
     format, and download of entire test data sets in either NHTSA
     UDS-1992 or NHTSA EV5 ASCII format. Plotting a signal requires that
     your browser support Java 1.1 or later and Java applets.
     star Query by test parameters
     Includes definitions of data elements identifying the test (type,
     configuration, date, performing contractor) as well as some elements
     that identify test conditions (closing speed or impact angle).
     Signal plotting, signal download, and download of an entire data set
     are supported by this application.
     star Query by vehicle parameters such as make, model, and year
     Includes information about the vehicle being tested (make, model,
     year, engine type) as well as data gathered during testing (travel
     angle, vehicle damage index, bumper engagement). Signal plotting,
     signal download, and download of an entire data set are supported by
     this application.
     star Query by barrier parameters
     Includes information where a fixed object that doesn't move is
     involved, such as a bridge rail, a pole, or a flat angled barrier.
     Information on tests not incorporating a barrier-type element will
     not be available via this query interface. Signal plotting, signal
     download, and download of an entire data set are supported by this
     application.
     star Browse the available tests
     Signal plotting and signal download are supported by this
     application.

   Catalogs

   These are summary catalogs detailing tests released for public
   access and review. They are generated dynamically with each request
   from the live database and so reflect the very latest released
   tests. A supporting document describing the coded contents of the
   catalogs is available.

   arrow Sorted by NHTSA assigned test number (TSTNO)

     Database Exports

     The files listed below are exports of the NHTSA Vehicle Crash Test
     Database made available for download by any user wishing to explore
     the available crash test specification data. While we cannot provide
     specific technical assistance for individual database products, a
     descriptive summary of the format of the export files is available
     to aid users. The files are compressed ZIP archives of ASCII files.
     Data fields are delimited by the pipe character ("|") used to
     designate EVS data fields.

     Supporting software will be required to extract the files and import
     them into other programs. Programs such as Microsoft Access and
     Excel support an ASCII file import facility and allow the user to
     select the data field delimiter.

   Offline Access

   Copies of the contractor test reports and high speed films
   associated with released tests may be obtained, for a fee, from
   George Washington University's National Crash Analysis Center at
   (703) 726-8236.
