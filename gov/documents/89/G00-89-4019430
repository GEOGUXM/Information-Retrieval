                  What's New with the USGS Browse Image Viewer

December 18, 2001

     * All of the pages should now have a look and feel similar to other
       EDC web pages.
     * The Intermediate Regional views for navigating around the world
       have been eliminated. Clicking on the main page using the color
       shaded relief map of the world now invokes the Browse Image Viewer
       at that location.
     * Landsat 4 and 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) data is available! Use the
       selector to view either Landsat 4/5 TM, or Landsat 7 ETM (Enhanced
       Thematic Mapper).

   Note: The Landsat 4/5 TM Browse images are only 480m resolution when
   viewed in the single scene view at "full resolution". Though they
   appear to be only 1/2 as large, the coverage roughly equates to the
   same area as a Landsat 7 TM scene. The Browse images are created using
   different systems, and are subsampled to a different resolution.
