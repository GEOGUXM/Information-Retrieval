                                                        Astronomy Experiment

   Following the Beatenberg Declaration (3 June 1994), space agencies from
   all over the world met in Hamburg, at the EGS Moon Workshop (3-7 April,
   1995) and in full agreement decided to create an International Lunar
   Exploration Working Group (ILEWG).

    The charter of ILEWG is:

    1. To develop an international strategy for the exploration of the
       Moon.
    2. To establish a forum and mechanism for the communication and
       coordination of activities.
    3. To implement international coordination and cooperation.

   In order to facilitate communication among all interested parties ILEWG
   agrees to establish an electronic communication network for exchange of
   science, technology and programmatic information related to lunar
   activities.

   All interested space agencies will appoint two or three members. A
   chairperson is selected among the ILEWG members every two years.

   ILEWG will meet regularly, at least once a year, and will lead the
   organization of an International Conference every two years in order to
   discuss the state of lunar exploration.

   Formal reports will be given at COSPAR meetings.
