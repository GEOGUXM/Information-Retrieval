                WELCOME THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREÂ’S
               FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (F O I A) HOME PAGE.

     We hope you will find this site informative and useful and that it
     will give you a better understanding of the Freedom of Information
     Act (FOIA) and its implementation at the U.S. Department of
     Agriculture. The USDA FOIA site covers the range of information that
     you need to know about the FOIA.
     The FOIA is found in Title 5 of the United States Code, Section 552.
     FOIA was enacted in 1966 and gives any person the right to request
     access to almost any federal agency record, except those protected
     from disclosure by legal exemptions and exclusions (e.g., classified
     national security, business proprietary, personal privacy, and
     investigative documents.)
     On October 2, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Electronic
     Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA). E-FOIA will
     make it possible for individuals to have electronic access to
     certain USDA information without making a formal FOIA request.
