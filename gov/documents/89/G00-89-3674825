             The purpose of the TALENT BANK is to identify women
                     for service on boards of directors.
     __________________________________________________________________


        The citizens of Erie County need the insights and talents of both
   men and women on public, not-for-profit, and private boards of
   directors that shape our civic, business, and community life. In 2001,
   women are still significantly underrepresented on such boards.

        This is a call for women to increase their influence in the
   affairs of Erie County and its communities. By filling out this online
   questionnaire, you can place your name in the TALENT BANK that the Erie
   County Commission on the Status of Women maintains for the purpose of
   identifying women candidates for service on boards of directors. Click
   here to see Recent Commission Reports.
     __________________________________________________________________


        The Commission works to increase the number of women serving on
   public, not-for-profit, and private boards of directors, and to assure
   access for women to boards with community impact. The Commission's
   TALENT BANK is open to all women who would like to be considered for
   board appointments. The TALENT BANK is the Commission's primary tool
   for bringing women who wish to serve to the attention of boards seeking
   to fill vacancies or to expand representation.
     __________________________________________________________________


        To place your name or organization in the TALENT BANK, just
   complete the online questionnaire. Registered organizations will have
   access to profiles of prospective candidates on file with the TALENT
   BANK. Additional information from prospective candidates may be sought
   by registered organizations.
