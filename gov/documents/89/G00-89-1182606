                                  Missions

          Each ocean observing satellite mission represents a unique
    contribution to the understanding of our ocean planet. NASA's ability
     to continually collect global information on our oceans and analyze
    this data over time, in combination with data gathered through other
      regional and global efforts, allows us to better predict climate
      changes and use this knowledge to enhance our life on earth. The
    primary satellite missions are currently focused on gathering data on
                        three ocean characteristics:

     Ocean surface vector wind or wind speed and direction and forcing

     Ocean surface topography or wave height and circulation response

     Ocean color or phytoplankton content

     Water vapor, clouds and precipitation interaction
   In the next few years another major oceanography mission will be added
   to observe Sea surface salinity.

                           Topography/Wave Height

         NASA studies ocean surface topography or wave height through
   altimeter missions that seek to observe the ocean response to wind and
                     thermal forcing by the atmosphere.
     Currently the primary altimeter project s are the Ocean Topography
    Experiment (TOPEX) or TOPEX/ Poseidon mission and Jason-1, managed at
   JPL. TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 are both a partnership with the French
          Space Agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES.)
       Jason-l, launched in 2001, is a follow-on to the Topex/Poseidon
   mission, which has been measuring ocean topography since 1992. Like its
      predecessor, Jason-1 is a joint mission of the United States and
    France. These two satellites will provide a unique global view of the
      oceans that is impossible to acquire using traditional ship-based
                                  sampling.
     Like TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 measures the large and small hills and
   valleys of the ocean's surface. These measurements allow scientists to
      study the ties between the oceans and atmosphere, improve global
   climate forecasts and predictions, and monitor events such as El Ni√±o
                        conditions and ocean eddies.

                                 Ocean Color

      Another ocean characteristic observed by NASA is color. The purpose
    of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) project is to
   provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical properties to the
     Earth science community. NASA works in cooperation with OrbImage to
     observe how subtle changes in ocean color signify various types and
     quantities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), the
   knowledge of which has both scientific and practical applications. The
      SeaWiFS Project develops and operates a research data system that
       processes, calibrates, validates, archives and distributes data
             received from an Earth-orbiting ocean color sensor.
      In 1999 NASA launched the Terra satellite that hosts the Moderate
     Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Terra reached final orbit on
     February 24, 2000, MODIS opened its nadir aperture doors and began
                         acquiring data on that day.
   MODIS monitors large-scale changes in the biosphere that will yield new
      insights into the workings of the global carbon cycle. MODIS can
        measure the photosynthetic activity of land and marine plants
   (phytoplankton) to yield better estimates of how much of the greenhouse
   gas is being absorbed and used in plant productivity. Coupled with the
    sensor's surface temperature measurements, MODIS' measurements of the
   biosphere are helping scientists track the sources and sinks of carbon
                   dioxide in response to climate changes.

                              Sea Surface Winds

         NASA also measures the winds over the oceans. The SeaWinds on
   QuikSCAT mission also managed by JPL, uses an onboard scatterometer to
   observe wind speed and direction. The QuikSCAT mission seeks to acquire
    all-weather, high-resolution measurements of near-surface winds over
   the global oceans. NASA and its partners are working to use ocean wind
     data to determine atmospheric forcing, ocean response, and air-sea
   interaction mechanisms on various spatial and temporal scales. QuikSCAT
   data is also combined with measurements from scientific instruments in
   other disciplines to help us better understand the mechanisms of global
                    climate change and weather patterns.
    QuikSCAT is the follow on mission from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT)
   mission that launched aboard Japan's ADEOS-Midori Satellite in August,
    1996. Its mission was to collect information on coverage, resolution,
    and accuracy in the determination of ocean wind speed and direction,
   NSCAT data has already been applied to a wide variety of scientific and
                            operational problems.

                            Sea Surface Salinity

        In the next few years a new objective will be added to the NASA
    Oceanography portfolio. Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) research will seek
     to better understand the role of salinity at the ocean's surface in
                               climate change.
     Over the past two decades, it has been demonstrated that SSS can be
        measured from space because of the dependence of sea surface
             reflectivity on salt at low microwave frequencies.
    In the western tropical Pacific, intense rainfall reduces the SSS and
    forms a boundary layer that alters air-sea exchange processes. In the
    North Atlantic, SSS influences the overturning of the global conveyor
    belt of ocean circulation. In the Southern Ocean, SSS determines the
    strength of vertical convection that conducts surface water into the
                                 deep ocean.

                        Tropical Rainfall Measurement

      Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a research satellite
    designed to help our understanding of the water cycle in the current
    climate system. By covering the tropical and semi-tropical regions of
     the Earth, TRMM provides much needed data on rainfall and the heat
    release associated with rainfall. It does not single-handedly provide
        the solution to the climate change debate - it does, however,
    contribute to our understanding of how clouds affect climate and how
    much energy is transported in the global water cycle. In coordination
    with other satellites in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, TRMM is part
    of the process of understanding the interactions between water vapor,
     clouds and precipitation that is central to regulating the climate
                                   system.
