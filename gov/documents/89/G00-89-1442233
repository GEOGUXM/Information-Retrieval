      HUD responds to 6 kinds of complaints:

      Housing discrimination: Federal law prohibits housing discrimination
      based on your race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family
      status, or disability. If you have been trying to buy or rent a home or
   apartment and you believe your rights have been violated, you can file
   a fair housing complaint.

   Bad landlords in federal housing: Hundreds of landlords have been fined
   and/or debarred from doing business with the federal government as a
   result of failing to provide safe and decent housing for the poor,
   while enriching themselves on taxpayer-funded subsidies. Find out how
   to report a bad landlord.

   Manufactured housing: If you have a problem with your manufactured
   home, learn how to solve the problem.

   Land sales: The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act protects
   consumers from fraud and abuse when buying or leasing land from
   developers. If you believe your rights have been violated, you can file
   a complaint by writing to HUD.

   Deceptive contractors: HUD insures loans to help people renovate and
   repair their homes through a program called Title 1. If you have
   problems with a contractor who is performing work for you under this
   program, find out how to report it to HUD.

   Fraud, waste, and abuse: If you are aware of fraud, waste, and abuse in
   HUD programs and operations, report it to HUD's Hotline!
