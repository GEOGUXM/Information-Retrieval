   template The Dynamics and Control Branch (DCB) encourages and supports
   research in areas consistent with its mission and current research
   areas, and innovative concepts and technologies with potential for
   application to the modeling and control of all types of flight
   vehicles. To this end DCB welcomes unsolicited proposals from qualified
   individuals and groups in academia and industry for research to be
   conducted under grants, cooperative agreements, and memoranda of
   agreement.

   DCB participates in the NASA Research Grants Program by providing
   technical review, serving as technical officer, and, in some cases,
   providing funding. Complete information on NASA research grants and
   cooperative agreements with educational institutions and nonprofit
   corporations is available in the NASA Research Grant Handbook (NASA
   Handbook 5800.1C) from the Office of Procurement, National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001 or from the Head,
   Grants and Services Contracts Branch, Mail Stop 126, NASA Langley
   Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681-0001. For additional information
   follow the link to the NASA Acquisition page.

   When providing technical review, DCB uses its best effort to assign two
   independent peer reviewers - one of whom is knowledgable government
   employee external to NASA. Unsolicited proposals will be evaluated
   using NASA Langley Form P-317 with specific point scores assigned
   according to DCB's Template for assessing Strategic and Technical
   Benefits of research activities.

   In cases wherein DCB serves as technical officer and provides funding,
   a business plan that projects monthly costing for the grant shall be
   provided. All DCB provided funding will be on a pro rata basis for the
   fiscal year with futures funding applied for the remainder of each
   grant year. For example if a grant isawarded in October, the first
   month of the Federal fiscal year, it will be fully funded with that
   fiscal year's funds. A grant awarded in April will committ only those
   funds expected to be spent through September 30 with remaining grant
   year funding of October 1 through March of the succeeding calendar year
   listed in "futures".

   In addition to sponsored research NASA Langley Research Center and the
   Dynamics and Control Branch (DCB) offer other opportunities. To learn
