   The Environmental Carbon Observatory (ECO) will monitor the function of
   the global terrestrial ecosystem, particularly the net uptake or
   release of CO[2]. This will be accomplished with observation and
   experimentation units distributed throughout the world. ECO is proposed
   as the mechanism for integrating global-scale science in order to
   obtain synoptic understanding of the carbon cycles of the major
   components of the terrestrial biosphere and improved predictive
   capability to understand how activities of human kind may alter the
   coupled biosphere-climate system. Ecosmall2.gif (12921 bytes)

   Some of the basic building blocks for ECO tool are at hand within the
   portfolio of DOE-supported research; the Ameriflux and FACE programs
   provide the basic tools from which ECO can be developed (Integrating
   FACE & Ameriflux).

   Proposed ECO Principles

   [smallbullett.gif] The proposed facility is intended to focus on the
   global carbon cycle. This does not exclude other interesting questions
   in various fields, but sets the theme and target for the facility.
   [smallbullett.gif] A distributed facility similar in scale to a major
   research reactor, astronomical telescope or particle accelerator is
   proposed. This is seen as a means of integrating and focusing research
   on the key issue of uncertainty in modeling climate change, its effects
   on terrestrial systems, and feedback from the biosphere to the
   atmosphere and climate system.

   [smallbullett.gif] Reducing uncertainties in estimates of future
   C-flux, C-sequestration and [CO[2]][atm ]requires providing truly
   integrated research across disciplines and on an unprecedented global
   scale.

   [smallbullett.gif] Emphasis on linked process-level models and scaling,
   with ecosystem-level manipulation experiments and ecosystem/biome
   inventories.

   [smallbullett.gif] Integration of program elements and management.

   [smallbullett.gif] A major new multi-laboratory facility to quantify
   terrestrial C-flux, sequestration and ecosystem function throughout the
   world.

  [smallbullett.gif] Expanded eddy-flux measurement of Net Ecosystem
                     Exchange for contemporary conditions of C-flux and storage.

   [smallbullett.gif] New, large-scale manipulation experiments with
   emphasis on integration through process-level models and scaling.

   [smallbullett.gif] Integrated data system; an on-line, virtual
   laboratory for system control, data acquisition and manipulation.

   [smallbullett.gif] A collaboratory to enhance widest user participation
                      and minimize cost.
   [smallbullett.gif] Providing the physiological basis for modeling
                      future conditions

   [smallbullett.gif] A major theme for ECO is scaling of information from
   plant-level physiological processes to the planet.
   [smallbullett.gif] The construction and operation of this facility will
   require a massive increase in funding for the facility, for research
   and for training.
