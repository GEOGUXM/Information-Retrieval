   Success Stories

   arrow Ying FayChan, the owner of CES, an MBE/DBE, was recently
   appointed by Governor Gary Locke to serve as a member of the Washington
   State Board of Registration for professional engineers and land
   surveyors. This Board is responsible for regulating and licensing
   professional engineers and land surveyors in the state of Washington.

   arrow She is known as The Glove Lady. The owner and operator of Excel
   Gloves & Safety Supplies, Inc., Irene Reyes, sells gloves and other
   safety and related supplies to the medical industry. She has been
   certified as a Minority Women's Business Enterprise since shortly after
   she started the business in 1993. As with so many businesses, she
   struggled in the beginning, but effort and hard work made it grow.
   Reyes also credits the M/WBE program for much of her success because
   being certified helped give her the initial opportunity to compete. So
   in March 1999, "The Glove Lady" was awarded a statewide contract by the
   Office of State Procurement to provide medical gloves to public
   agencies, not just in Washington, but as the result of an interstate
   agreement, with Oregon as well. Approximately $700,000 in sales is
   expected during the two-year duration of the contract. What is also
   notable is that she got this contract subsequent to the passage of
   I-200. No preferences; straight up competition. According to Kathleen
   Haskett at State Procurement, Reyes won the contract because she
   out-hustled everyone else and submitted separate low bids on each of
   the possible five individual lines. She won them all.

   arrow Gloria Ashford, owner of Ashford Electric & Construction Company,
   was recently appointed by Governor Locke to serve on the State

   is located in Kirkland and has been certified as a WBE/DBE since 1987.
