   Why choose FedSource over other government-wide contracts?

   contracts, and we provide you with one convenient bill at the end of
   the month.

   What is a Franchise Fund?
   Franchise Funds were established by Congress under the Government
   Management Reform Act of 1994, Public Law 103-356 to foster competition
   and creativity in government. FedSource operates under the franchise
   granted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and our mission is to
   provide government-to-government support on a competitive,fully
   cost-reimbursable basis.

   Is FedSource affiliated with other Treasury Franchises?
   FedSource is an alliance of the Treasury's St. Louis, Seattle, and
   Chicago Franchise Business Activity (FBA) offices. We also collaborate
   with other FBA offices across the U.S.

   What can a recovery audit do for my organization?
   On the average, private sector recovery audits turn up one payment
   error for every 1,000 purchases. Federal payment errors have occurred
   at four times that rate in limited recovery audits that already have
   been conducted in some executive agencies. --Government Executive
   Magazine. 11/17/99

   How will my agency benefit from an EAP program?
   For every dollar they invest in an EAP, employers generally save
   anywhere from $5 to $16. The average annual cost for an EAP ranges from
   $12 to $20 per employee.

                                                         BACK TO QUESTIONS

   How long does it take to start Project Support services?
   Once we have your signed funding document, you are free to submit task
   orders for services. Some services can begin within a day or two.
   Others may require a few weeks for specialized recruitment.

                                                         BACK TO QUESTIONS

   What about competition and other FAR requirements?
   All FAR requirements are met via full and open competition when
   FedSource contracts are awarded. FedSource conducts a rigorous
   evaluation of all bidders to ensure our customers get the best value
   provider.

                                                         BACK TO QUESTIONS

   Under what authority does FedSource purchase and provide interagency
   services?
   Unlike many interagency acquisitions that fall under the Economy Act,
   FedSource has its own independent authority under the Treasury
   Department Appropriation Act of 1997 (PL 104-208) as amended by the
   Treasury Department Appropriation Act of 2001 (PL 106-554). This gives
   us the authority to provide service to both the Treasury Department and
   other Federal agencies. Our services are available to the Executive
   (DOD and civilian agencies), Legislative and Judicial Branches.
   Therefore, our customers do not need to reference the Economy Act to
   purchase from us.

   How does FedSource charge for services?
   The pricing we submit to you will include all contract costs and fees.
   We will bill your organization electronically based on your funding
   document. Bills are issued monthly. You will receive a detailed
   statement outlining services and charges, regardless of the number of
   services you select.

                                                         BACK TO QUESTIONS

   Who will I deal with on a daily basis?
   A FedSource representative is always available to assist you with any
   service concerns or questions. Unlike some other cross-servicing
   agencies, we are your advocates with vendors. It’s just part of the
   value-added service you get with FedSource.
