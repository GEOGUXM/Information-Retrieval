          Picture of SOUTH CENTRAL VA HEALTH CARE NETWORK building

   South Central VA Healthcare Network, also known as Veterans Integrated
   Service Network (VISN) 16, the largest of 22 VISNs within the Veterans
   Health Administration, as measured by unique numbers of veterans
   treated at its health care facilities (approximately 400,000 over a
   three-year period); veteran population (1.8 million in 1998) or budget
   (1.2. billion in FY 1998).

   In addition, the Network covers a vast area of 170,000 square miles
   providing health care to veterans in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana,
   Mississippi and parts of Texas, Missouri, Alabama and Florida.

   The South Central VA Healthcare Network is moving rapidly to become an
   integrated health care delivery system with care delivered at ten
   medical centers (two of which are two division), 20 community based
   clinics, seven nursing homes, two domiciliaries, and nine veterans
   outreach centers. The large workload, coupled with widely dispersed
   health care delivery sites, presents many opportunities and challenges
   to achieve the goal of an integrated network.

   Mission

   The mission of the South Central VA Healthcare Network is to provide
   quality, timely, and compassionate healthcare to veterans, along the
   continuum of care, stressing customer service and satisfaction. Our
   patients benefit from state-of the-art medical care, enhanced through
   exemplary medical teaching and research in an environment that is
   continuously improving. The entrepreneurial spirit will be exemplified
   in the South Central VA Healthcare Network as we move into the 21st
   century.

   Vision

   This Veterans Integrated Service Network will be the healthcare
   provider and employer of choice, a leader in the healthcare community,
   and a center of excellence in both education and research. The South
   Central VA Healthcare Network will be known for its quality of care and
   continuous performance improvement.

   Areas of Special Interest:

   Many Network patients are poor which makes VA the only option some
   veterans have for their health care. Two states in the Network,
   Mississippi and Louisiana, have the lowest per capita income in the
   nation. They also rank among the lowest in terms of health status.
   According to the results of the survey, Health Status of Veterans,
   veterans residing in the South Central VA Healthcare Network have one
   of the highest disease burdens in the country. Many Network patients
   delay treatment for health conditions until they are very ill, driving
   up resource needs and lowering the likelihood of good outcomes. Many
   live in rural areas, a significant distance from a VA facility,
   exacerbating access issues.

   Some additional significant facts regarding the South Central VA
   Healthcare Network are:
     * Over 95% of all South Central VA Healthcare Network patients are
       Category A veterans.
     * The South Central VA Healthcare Network has one of the highest
       percent market penetration rates of Category A veterans in the
       country (33% versus the national average of 27.20%). However, in
       terms of individuals, the South Central VA Healthcare Network has
       the largest number of eligible veterans, over 500,000, who choose
       not to use VA (or do not have access to VA) for their healthcare.
     * The vast majority of patients seen in the South Central VA
       Healthcare Network are provided care in the outpatient setting,
       reflecting the transition from the more expensive inpatient setting
       to outpatient and home based care. The largest number of patients
       seen in the Network suffer from heart disease, diabetes, cancer,
       pulmonary disease, and substance abuse. A sizable number of Network
       patients are also chronically mentally ill, and the Network
       provides services to these veterans through two referral sites.
     * The South Central VA Healthcare Network patients are generally
       under the age of 65, and a large number present themselves for care
       with substance abuse problems.
     * Trends in the treatment of substance abuse patients within the
       South Central VA Healthcare Network mirror those across the
       country, with the majority of medical centers realigning substance
       abuse treatment into the outpatient setting. Each offers
       alternatives for housing veterans in lodging and residential homes,
       space available if needed.
     * The number of patients with spinal cord injuries has remained
       stable in the Network, with approximately 1,500 unique veterans.
       The number of women veterans seeking care from the Network
       continues to increase as reflected in the number of visits to
       Women's Clinics.
     * the South Central VA Healthcare Network has one of the lowest costs
       per unique patient served, approximately $3,900 per patient versus
       the national rate of over $4,300 per patient.
     * Two Network medical centers have entered into agreements with
       Tricare providers, VAMCs Jackson and Biloxi.

   The South Central VA Healthcare Network became officially operational
   in July 1996.

                                   VALUES

   The core values for the South Central VA Healthcare Network are
   committment, compassion, excellence, trust and respect.

                                 PHILOSOPHY

   A guiding philosophy of this health care institution is that it can
   significantly increase & improve primary care services while offering a
   total continuum of care with specialized but increasingly efficient
   tertiary services needed by the VISN's veterans.

   Another, complementary philosophy, is that improvements in performance,
   increased efficiencies, etc., can often be achieved through staff
   education and process improvement using the tools and techniques of
   Total Quality Improvement and involving staff at all levels of the
   organization through VISN-wide and facility-level process action teams.

                   SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SERVICE DELIVERY

   the South Central VA Healthcare Network is implementing a health
   services delivery system based on a comprehensive continuum of care
   accessible to all veterans within the Network.

   This delivery system will emphasize a primary care backbone with
   supportive components including wellness and preventive services fully
   integrated with primary care, tertiary/acute care, extended and
   supportive care, mental health and special care.

   Many significant changes in service delivery are underway in this
   Network. Many more are planned.

   First is the shift from inpatient to ambulatory care delivery of
   patient services. Examples include the creation of short stay units
   (observations beds), ambulatory care surgical suites, the closure of
   unneeded inpatient wards and reduction in number of beds,
   implementation of pre-admission screening programs and establishment of
   "hoptels."

   Second is a shift from specialty outpatient services to primary care.
   Began in late FY 1996, this effort will gain momentum as more primary
   care clinic space and FTEE becomes available.

   A third significant change in service is an increasing effort to
   maintain patients needing primary care services at the VA facility
   nearest their home.

   A fourth shift that is taking place in the South Central VA Healthcare
   Network is establishment of a wide variety of sharing ventures with
   other federal, state and local government agencies, as well as
   private-sector health care entities.

   The Network believes that development of these ties will open up many
   opportunities to become more efficient as well as offering alternative
   revenue streams to support the VISN mission and future direction.

   Another significant change within the Network is the network-wide
   Clinical Practice Guideline Initiative. The impact on uniformity of
   care, clinical outcomes and efficiencies resulting from consistent
   Clinical Practice Guidelines, clinical pathways and protocols will have
   a far reaching effect within the Network, insuring the best care for
   patients.

   Each medical center in the network adopted one disease and is
   developing clinical guidelines for the management of the disease.
   Together, these diseases account for about 80 percent of all hospital
   admissions.

   The medical centers and their adopted cohorts are: Oklahoma City,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Little Rock, congestive heart
   failure; New Orleans, diabetes; Jackson, angina; Shreveport, pneumonia;
   Houston, renal failure; Alexandria, manic depression; Biloxi, major
   depression; Muskogee, hypertension; and Fayetteville, obesity.
