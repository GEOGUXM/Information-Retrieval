                           The Ames Fitness Center
       For health and fitness the American College of Sports Medicine
       recommends a well-rounded training program that includes aerobic
       training, resistance training, and flexibility exercises. The staff
       at the Ames Fitness Center are highly qualified to put together an
       exercise program that will work for you.
       The Ames Fitness Center recently acquired additional new equipment
       at the facility. The Paramount work stations provide a variety of
       options that will exercise almost every part of the body. The cable
       crossover unit is particularly good for shoulder therapy exercises.
       The leg press is designed to adjust for any body type and is a
       common piece of equipment used for knee therapy. Other stations
       will work the chest, stomach, back, calves, and shoulders. The
       pulley and cam technology incorporated by Paramount provides a
       smooth, well-leveraged, range of motion on all lifts.
       In addition to the paramount equipment, the Ames Fitness Center has
       Nautilus, Maxicam and free weight lifting equipment. Treadmills,
       Lifecycles, rowing and step machines are available for
       cardiovascular work outs.
       There are no fees for contractors, retired or current federal
       employees to use the Fitness Center, but a medical clearance form
       is required to be on file at the Fitness Center before taking the
       classes or using the facility. For additional information, contact
       the Ames Fitness Center at 650-604-5804.
