   This page will take you to lots of interesting tidbits about lake
   effect weather.

   Learn about how lake effect snow develops and where it occurs around
   the world by clicking on our "Lake Effect Primer".  Follow our current
   snow season.  Look back at past year's storms.  Check out ice cover on
   Lakes Erie and Ontario from our GOES satellite.

   Under "Storm Inventory",  click on each snow season and you will get a
   summary of significant lake effect episodes that produced more than 6"
   of snow off either Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in New York State.  For
   this season, lake effect snow events will be named for Birds (we name
   storms for archiving purposes only). We will also continue our
   tradition of ranking archived storms on a "Lake Flake Scale", a
   subjective way to rank events based on snowfall and effect on the
   population.

   The "Ice Inventory" will get to you to visible satellite images of
   Lakes Erie and Ontario throughout the mid to late winter and early
   spring so you can follow ice break-up on the lakes.
