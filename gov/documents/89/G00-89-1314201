   The Office of College and University Evaluation (OCUE), oversees all
   degree-granting colleges and universities in New York State, and
   assures that the programs they offer for credit meet or exceed minimum
   quality standards.  Before an institution can offer a new program below
   the doctoral level, OCUE reviews the curriculum, faculty, library and
   other learning resources, academic advising and records, administrative
   oversight, physical facilities and financial resources.

   The Office's computerized Inventory of Registered Programs contains
   information on nearly 20,000 separate college programs.  The Web site
   for the Office of College and University Evaluation  is organized in
   the following categories:
