   Contact: Brad Orr

   Atmospheric and oceanic energy processes in tropical western Pacific
   Ocean are a driving engine for much of the globe's climate, including
   development of the semi-periodic El Ni√±o phenomenon. The U.S.
   Department of Energy selected this area for intensive study as part of
   its Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and has established
   two densely instrumented Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) sites near
   the equator, including the tiny island nation of Nauru, which is
   located about mid-way between Australia and Hawaii. Instruments on the
   island, including and ETL-built cloud radar monitor clouds and
   radiative and thermodynamic features of the atmosphere over head. In
   the summer of 1999, the new NOAA research vessel, the Ron Brown, and
   the Japanese ship, Mirai, will conduct research for ARM in the Nauru
   vicinity to characterize how large- and small-scale properties of the
   ocean and atmosphere affect the radiative balance, and how well the
   CART island-based measurements represent open ocean conditions. The
   project is called Nauru99. ETL will operate air/sea-interface flux
   instruments and remote sensors on the Brown, including a
   millimeter-wave cloud radar, a microwave radiometer, an infrared
   radiometer, and a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR), all
   housed in one sea container.
