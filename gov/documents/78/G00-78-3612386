                      Bird Monitoring in North America

   The monitoring programs highlighted on these pages can be used to track
   changes in North American bird populations. These trends give
   conservationists, managers, citizens, and policy makers a window into
   the natural world and the health of environment. The patterns of
   increase and decrease are quantifications that can be tested against
   and compared to the subjective feelings we have on the status of birds
   in North America. Are more species increasing than decreasing? Are
   Eastern Bluebirds doing well or poorly? What do we know about
   shorebirds? Learn about these programs, use their data, participate in
   the counts, and write about the changes.
