   E-GOVERNMENT

   Recently, the City of Long Beach completed an e-Government Strategic
   Plan. The Plan's purpose is to chart an e-Government direction in
   support of the Long Beach 2010 Strategic Plan. E-Government has the
   potential to help attain many of the goals presented in the 2010 Plan
   including:
     * Improving communication between the City and the community
     * Providing remote access to information and services 24 hours a day,
       seven days a week
     * Decentralizing City services
     * Fostering economic development
     * Improving the responsiveness and accountability of government.
