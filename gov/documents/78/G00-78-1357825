   Global Precipitation Measurement Navigation Bar

Mission Objectives:

     * Improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global
       measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical
       processes thereby providing information on a key indicator of
       whether the global water cycle is varying in response to climate
       change
     * Improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through
       more accurate, frequent near-global measurement of instantaneous
       rain rates and latent heating, both which are key inputs needed by
       computer models to produce more accurate weather predications
     * Provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's
       precipitation closer to its natural space and time scales to that
       better prediction of flood hazards and management of
       life-sustaining activities dependent upon fresh water can be
       achieved

Mission Architecture:

     * Core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a
       calibration standard for the Constellation spacecraft
     * International constellation with up to 8 contributed spacecraft to
       provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis
     * 14 heavily instrumented ground rainfall calibration sites
     * Global Precipitation Data Center

Primary Instruments:

     * Core Spacecraft
          + Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar
          + Passive Microwave Radiometer
     * Constellation Spacecraft
          + Passive Microwave Radiometer
