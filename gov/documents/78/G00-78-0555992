   Energy Commission MTBE Study
   Study of Alternatives to Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether, an Oxygenate in
   California Reformulated Gasoline

   On March 25, 1999, Governor Gray Davis released Executive Order D-5-99
   that ordered the removal of the additive MTBE (Methyl Tertiary-Butyl
   Ether) from gasoline at the earliest possible date, but not later than
   December 31, 2002.

   The Governor also directed the California Energy Commission to evaluate
   and report to the Governor and the Secretary for Environmental
   Protection on the potential for development of a California waste-based
   or other biomass ethanol industry. The Commission was directed to
   "...evaluate what steps, if any, would be appropriate to foster
   waste-based or other biomass ethanol development in California should
   ethanol be found to be an acceptable substitute for MTBE."
