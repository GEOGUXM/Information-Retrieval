   TARR Logo Limitations Regarding The TARR Database
   space

   Understanding the limitations of this TARR database can help you avoid
   significant problems. Prior to using the USPTOs trademark database on
   the Web, it is critical that you review the following information. If
   you have any questions regarding adoption or use of a trademark, the
   USPTO strongly recommends that you consult with an attorney. The USPTO
   cannot recommend particular attorneys or law firms.
   Currency of the TARR Database
   The USPTOs trademark information on the Web is updated daily from noon
   to 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The TARR database does not include any
   newly-filed applications, nor amendments thereto, entered into the
   USPTOs internal trademark database after the last TARR update. For
   example, the TARR database shows applications that registered after its
   last update as pending applications rather than registrations. The TARR
   database does not include edits made to individual records after its
   last update.
   Web Database Contents
   The fact that a mark is not present in the TARR database does not
   necessarily mean that the mark is not currently being used as a
   trademark. The TARR database contains only those trademarks that are
   Federally registered or that are pending (applications undergoing
   examination at the USPTO). The TARR database does not contain any
   information on state, foreign, or common law trademarks.
