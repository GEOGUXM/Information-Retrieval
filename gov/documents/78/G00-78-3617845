                        The FLRA's Collaboration and Alternative
                               Dispute Resolution Program

              Federal sector labor-management relations has changed
         significantly in recent years. Greater emphasis is now placed on the
         use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and consensus
         decision-making in resolving workplace disputes and in improving
         labor-management relationships in the Federal sector. The FLRA's
         Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution (CADR) program
         enhances these efforts by integrating ADR into all of the case
         processes used by the various FLRA components. The CADR Office (CADRO)
         provides overall coordination and support to the FLRA components in
         implementing the CADR program.

                               Frequently Asked Questions

         What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)?

              ADR is an informal process that allows parties to discuss and
         develop their interests in order to resolve the underlying issues and
         problems in their relationship. The discussion is facilitated by a
         third party neutral who is there to ensure a productive dialogue.

         What are the benefits of using ADR in Labor-Management Relationships?

              ADR allows everyone to have an active part in the decision-making
         process. Solutions are adopted by consensus, and reflect an
         understanding of the interests of all parties. As a result, the
         solutions are tailored to the needs of the participants.

              ADR encourages creative, innovative solutions, moving away from
         the traditional win/lose results of adversarial proceedings.

              ADR resolves disputes while preserving relationships, and thereby
         helps create a productive working environment.

         What types of services does the CADR program provide?

              The services focus on alternatives to traditional case processing
         and formal dispute resolution.

              The CADR program assists the parties both in preventing disputes
         before they become cases and in coming up with ways to informally
         resolve disputes in pending cases. This includes interest-based
         conflict resolution and intervention services in pending unfair labor
         practice cases,  representation cases,  negotiability appeals,  and
         impasse bargaining disputes.

              The CADR program also provides facilitation, training and
         education to help labor and management develop collaborative
         relationships.

              The ultimate goal is to provide parties with the skills they need
         to do ADR on their own.

         Is the CADR program voluntary?

              Yes.

         Where does the CADR program fit in the normal case processing?

              The FLRA's Regulations for negotiability, unfair labor practice,
         and representation cases ensure that parties have the opportunity to
         use ADR to resolve their cases. For example, in negotiability cases,
         during the post-petition conference, if the parties express interest in
         using ADR services, the case will be put on hold to give the parties
         time to get help from the CADR Office. In unfair labor practice cases,
         an ADR process is available that allows the parties to resolve the
         underlying dispute by facilitating a problem-solving approach, rather
         than having the Regional Office investigate the facts and determine the
         merits of the charge. For cases on their way to hearing, the
         Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) settlement program is available for one
         more attempt at informal resolution.

              ADR services are also available in some circumstances for parties
         who do not have a case filed, but would like assistance with disputes
         or relationship issues.

         Who provides CADR program services?

              All of the FLRA components provide CADR program services.

              The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) offers ADR services in
         unfair labor practice and representation cases, both before cases are
         filed and while they are pending. Through its Regional Offices and the
         National Office, the OGC provides facilitation, intervention, training
         and education services to agencies and unions. Each Regional Office has
         a Regional Dispute Resolution Specialist who coordinates ADR services
         within the Region.

              The ALJ's office has a settlement program for parties who have
         hearings pending before an ALJ.

              The Federal Service Impasses Panel uses ADR techniques in
         resolving bargaining impasses.

              Staff from the Authority Members' offices participate in
         interventions in negotiability and other cases, offering facilitation
         to help the parties resolve their differences before the case is ruled
         on by the Authority.

              The CADR Office assists all FLRA components in the delivery of ADR
         services in cases and training sessions.
