   1. Summary

   A. Total costs from September 9, 1994 inception through September 30,
   1999: $22,272,788

   B. Estimated costs for next 6-month period (October 99 - March 2000):
              $696,327

   C. Approximately $6.2 million (27.8%) of the $22,272,788 spent through
   September 1999 were costs Acharged@ for the use of personnel from and
   services other federal agencies (Aintergovernmental transfers@).

   D. As of September 30, 1999, this Office=s convictions and referrals
   have resulted in the imposition of $11,594,581 in criminal fines, civil
   penalties, damages and reimbursement of costs. Approximately $9,924,025
   of that amount has been received and deposited into the U.S. Treasury.

   2. Discussion:

        An Independent Counsel investigation starts from "ground zero." At
   the time of his appointment, the Independent Counsel has no office, no
   staff, no attorneys, no agents, and no equipment. He must locate and
   lease appropriate office space and then assemble from scratch a fully
   functioning investigative office. His statutory mandate is to fully
   investigate the matters referred by the Attorney General, and all
   matters and individuals whose acts may be related to those subject
   matters. He is also under statutory command to complete his
   investigation and any prosecutions promptly.

        During the course of the investigation, numerous allegations may
   require additional investigation that do not result in Independent
   Counsel prosecutions and does not become a matter of public knowledge
   until the Independent Counsel publishes his Final Report at the
   conclusion of the investigations, trials, and appeals (unless there is
   an indictment or a public statement concerning matters the Independent
   Counsel referred to the Department of Justice).

        The costs of Independent Counsel investigation are frequently
   mentioned -- but seldom analyzed. The three phases that generate the
   major expenditures for the Independent Counsel investigations are: (1)
   the investigation, which includes collection and analysis of relevant
   documents, questioning witnesses and bringing witnesses before the
   grand jury; (2) indictment and trial of cases which, in some instances,
   requires opening field offices where the trial will occur, and extended
   staff time in preparation and trial; and (3) the post-trial and
   appellate phase. The last phase is the least costly because significant
   agent expenses and witness costs are not incurred.

        Expenses of the Independent Counsel
   =s investigation are primarily driven by two separate but related
   factors: (1) the costs of personnel to operate the office, agents and
   lawyers to conduct the investigations and prosecutions, and equipment
   and office rental costs; and (2) the length of time to conduct and
   complete the investigations, trials, and appellate matters, and the
   preparation and publication of the final report.

        While an Independent Counsel can control, to a certain extent, the
   size of his investigative staff, he does not, and cannot control the
   length of his investigation. Length of investigations depends on the
   Independent Counsel
   =s ability to get the relevant documents and testimony of witnesses,
   which depends in substantial part on the degree of cooperation of the
   witnesses. When an Independent Counsel encounters delays in the
   investigative, trial, or appellate phases of the investigation, the
   delays increase the costs because they lengthen the process. When the
   investigative process encounters obstructive challenges, e.g.,
   protracted litigation to quash grand jury subpoenas, the investigative
   process is lengthened and the cost increased; moreover, the Independent
   Counsel must often increase his staff to meet these obstructive tactics
   which also increase costs.

        Independent Counsels are required by statute to submit a Statement
   of Expenditures every six months. The reporting periods coincide with
   the Federal Government
   =s fiscal year: October 1 through March 31, and April 1 through
   September 30. Auditors from the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO)
   audit each statement. Upon completion of the audits of all current
   independent counsels (IC), GAO publishes all IC financial statements,
   and its opinions and discussions, in a publication entitled FINANCIAL
   AUDIT-- Independent Counsel Expenditures for the Six Months Ended
   (date). The latest audit report, its fifteenth, covering the period
   October 1, 1998 through March 31, 1999, was published on September 30,
   1999.

        Audit reports are available to the public. They can be ordered
   from GAO by telephone (202-512-600) or by Internet (http//www.gao.gov).

        Independent Counsels are also required to provide a semiannual
   Statement of Expenses to the Special Division of the U.S. Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia. An estimate of future expenses is
   also required with each submission. The Statement of Expenses differs
   from the Statement of Expenditures in that the Expenditure Statement
   includes only cash or equivalent disbursements (cash basis accounting).
   The Expense Statement includes all costs as incurred and recorded,
   whether the corresponding bills have been paid or not (accrual basis
   accounting).

        So that the reader has some idea of the amount, type, and nature
   of expenditures incurred by this office
   =s operations section 3 below presents a graph showing the expenses
   incurred in each of the 6-month reporting periods (September 1994
   through September 1999). A brief explanation of the major Independent
   Counsel expenses -- salaries, rent, capital equipment expenses, and
   estimated expenditures -- is set forth in section 4.


   3. OIC Smaltz Costs (by 6-month period)

        The following graph displays total costs incurred by this Office
   in each of the 6-month periods corresponding to the GAO audit periods.
   The first period shown (Prd 1), ending 9/30/94, reflects costs
   ($49,000) incurred from Mr. Smaltz
   = appointment on 9/9/94. Costs increased through the first four full
   periods, and then receded as the Office completed various activities.
   The amount of activities correlates with the level of costs shown in
   the graph. These activities are listed by Period (Prd) number following
   the graph.

   Note 5. Contractual Services: includes expenditures for investigative
   services, trial preparation services and other legal, accounting and
   other professional services.

   Note 6. Capital Equipment: Includes furniture, copying, facsimile and
   computing equipment, and other assets purchased by this Office. All
   equipment assets are inventoried and sight-audited every six months. At
   the conclusion of the investigation, these assets will be transferred
   to the Department of Justice, or another federal government agency.

   The amount shown, $466,198, represents the actual amount paid for major
   equipment acquisitions. It does not represent the actual value of
   equipment inventory held by this Office. A significant amount of
   furniture and equipment originally purchased by another Independent
   Counsel was transferred to this office from storage. With reduced
   operations, the Office has transffered excess furniture and other
   equipment to other Independent Counsel.

   Note 7. Administrative Services: AOUSC charges an administrative fee of
   3% of all expenditures, for performing disbursement, personnel, payroll
   and accounting functions. Payment of these fees is automatically
   recorded in the month following the posting of the expenditures. From
   inception, this fee totals $521,313.

   In addition, AOUSC incurs expenditures on behalf of all Independent
   Counsels, but which are not directly attributable to any specific
   office. For each six-month audit period, GAO
   Acharges@ a percentage of these AOUSC costs to each Independent Counsel
   based on the average number of personnel on each office=s payroll. For
      this office, GAO has allocated administrative service costs total
                                  $656,737.

   Note 8. Indirect (Unreimbursed) Costs: Includes payroll costs of
   investigators assigned to this Office by various government agencies.
   These costs were paid by the investigators
   = respective agencies.  The cumulative amounts (unaudited) provided by
                              each agency are:
