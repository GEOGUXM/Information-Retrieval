      The Nonproliferation & International Technology group (NIS-8) studies
      international scientific research, development, and production related
      to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. NIS-8 works to
      deter the proliferation of nuclear materials, weapons of mass
      destruction, and critical technologies by applying scientific and
      engineering expertise and developing computerized information systems.
      NIS-8 maintains expertise in reactor and fuel cycle design, reactor
      safety systems design, information sciences, special nuclear materials
      production, nuclear weapon production, weapon testing, image
      enhancement and analysis, and foreign languages. Technical analyses
      support U.S. government concerns regarding foreign civil, military, and
      commercial technological advances.
