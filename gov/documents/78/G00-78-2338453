   PuFF experiment aboard the Space Station: Expedition Four Flight
   Engineer Dan Bursch performs the Pulmonary Function in Flight (PuFF)
   experiment in the Destiny lab module of the International Space
   Station. PuFF, developed by the University of Califronia, San Diego,
   and managed by NASA's Johnson Space Center, focuses on lung function
   following spacewalks and inside the Space Station during long-term
   exposure to microgravity. (Quicktime movie, 1.18 MB)

   Time-lapse photos of colloids experiment aboard the Space Station:
   Still photographs taken over 16 hours on Nov. 13, 2001, on the
   International Space Station have been condensed into 6 seconds to show
   the de-mixing - or phase separation - process studied by the Experiment
   on Physics of Colloids in Space. Commanded from the ground, dozens of
   similar tests have been conducted since the experiment arrived on the
   Station last year. The sample is a mix of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA
   or acrylic) colloids, polystyrene polymers and solvents. The circular
   area in the video is 2 centimeters in diameter.

   The phase separation process occurs spontaneously after the sample is
   mechanically mixed. The evolving lighter regions are rich in colloid
   and have the structure of a liquid. The dark regions are poor in
   colloids and have the structure of a gas. This behavior cannot be
   observed on Earth because gravity causes the particles to fall out of
   solution faster than the phase separation can occur. While similar to a
   gas-liquid phase transition, the growth rate observed in this test is
   different from any atomic gas-liquid or liquid-liquid phase transition
   ever measured experimentally. Ultimately, the sample separates into
   colloid-poor and colloid-rich areas, just as oil and vinegar separate.
   The fundamental science of de-mixing in this colloid-polymer sample is
   the same found in the annealing of metal alloys and plastic polymer
   blends. Improving the understanding of this process may lead to
   improving processing of these materials on Earth. (Flash time-lapse

   Scientists are growing biological crystals on the International Space
   Station. When these crystals are returned to Earth, scientists analyze
   the crystals to determine their structures. Then, they create computer
   models similar to this animation of a generic protein. Traveling over
   the surface of this model is like riding the twists and turns of a
   roller coaster. Another type of model demonstrates how the different
   molecules, shown in the animation as colored balls, fit together to
   form the protein. A drug, shown here as a cluster of balls or molecules
   docking with the ball model, enters the body and fits into the protein
   like a key in a lock. The better the fit, the better the medicine works
   with fewer side effects. Learning how proteins are made and how they do
   their jobs has applications in many fields, including agriculture and
   medicine. Scientists are using many different types of devices and
   techniques to grow biological crystals on the Space Station. (QuickTime

     This microscopic image of a colloidal gel taken on the ground is a
    snapshot of the formation process being studied in the Experiment on
    Physics of Colloids in Space on board the International Space Station
     during Expedition Four. The gel in the image consists of 95 percent
   liquid and 5 percent colloid particles less than 5 microns in diameter.
   The gel being grown on the International Space Station contains nearly
    1000 times less colloid, consisting of 99.992 percent water and only
   0.008 percent colloids. Scientists are using the microgravity of space
   to get a better picture of the gel formation stage. On the ground, the
     clumps would sink to the bottom of the container before the sample
                                   gelled.
