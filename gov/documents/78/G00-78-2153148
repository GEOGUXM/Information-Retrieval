   Overview:

   The purpose of Technology Validation Assurance (TVA) is to provide a
   short cycle, low cost approach to building in quality through design
   optimization, and quality and reliability analysis for critical
   electronic hardware. Concurrent engineering, theoretical analysis and
   empirical data are used to produce information about a technologyâ€™s
   mechanical, thermal and electrical limitations and its most likely
   failure mechanisms.
