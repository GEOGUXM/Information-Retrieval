    Where do I find...
    and other Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)?

    Thank you for visiting Destination Earth. We try very hard to answer
   all mail. Unfortunately, there are only a few of us to answer the many
   inquiries we receive from approximately 1,000,000 visitors we serve
   each month. We hope that this section will help you navigate quickly
   and easily to FAQ's, Ask-an-Expert sites, and other valuable resources.

   We cannot write your science project, search the Web for you, answer
   general science questions, or evaluate your personal theory. We will
   answer as quickly as possible those questions for which we may be
   uniquely qualified to answer. If you feel that your question can only
   be answered by us, please follow these suggestions to contact us.
