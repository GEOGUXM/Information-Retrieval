Publications and Information Products

   The National Wetlands Research Center has been a significant publisher
   of wetland studies for over 20 years. Because the center has operated
   under several missions and names, its publications and information
   products list is a myriad of peer-reviewed journal articles, technical
   publications, maps and posters, and outreach publications.

   Some of the publications you will find on this list are available in
   full from this web site, in the form of PDF files. We recommend using
   Adobe Reader 4.0 to view these documents. Other publications cannot be
   displayed because of copyright restrictions, but you may be able to
   obtain a reprint by sending a request to the NWRC Library.
