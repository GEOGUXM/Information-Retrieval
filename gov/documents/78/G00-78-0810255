   DISTRICT OVERVIEW
   By Richard H. Weare, District Court Executive/Clerk of Court
   The increasing complexity and sophistication of the District Court as
   an institution has never been more apparent than in this year's Annual
   Report. The District will soon have its full complement of twelve
   active judgeships, an increase of four positions from the eight
   authorized judgeships that we have had for the last twenty years.
   Similarly, our magistrate judge complement will soon increase to twelve
   full-time positions, for a total of 24 active judicial officers serving
   the District of Arizona.
   Some of the highlights of this year's report include:

   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] Over a quarter of a million
   pleadings were docketed during fiscal year 2000.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] With the assistance of a new
   Consolidated Administrative Services Division, Space & Facilities, the
   Court moved into two new state-of-the-art courthouses in Phoenix and
   Tucson, both of which feature high tech electronic courtrooms.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] The District has implemented a
   new Jury Management System (JMS); the Jury Interactive Voice Response
   System (IVRS); and the Automated Jury Information System (AJIS). A web
   based version of this was also implemented during this reporting
   period.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] Three additional court
   interpreter positions were allotted to the district this year. Two of
   the positions were assigned to the Tucson office and one position to
   the Yuma office, in recognition of the increasing number of cases being
   processed in both locations.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] The Finance section of the
   office disbursed over 23 million dollars and the new CJA Voucher Review
   Unit processed over 5.7 million dollars in payments to CJA panel
   attorneys, an increase of 27% over the previous year.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] The Human Resources Division
   processed over 2,200 applications for employment and 99 new employees
   entered on duty. The division also hosted the 2000 Ninth Circuit Human
   Resources Division Conference.
   [white%20bullet.gif?OpenImageResource] As the District makes the
   sometimes painful transition from the paper to the electronic medium,
   the Systems & Technology Division was in the forefront both locally and
   nationally on numerous innovations which are described in detail
   throughout this report. The projects range from Y2K planning, to the
   systems incorporated in the two new buildings, to Internet and Intranet
   sites, to Palm Pilot computing.

   2001 promises to be every bit as exciting and challenging as this year,
   and all members of the greater court family should feel proud to be a
   part of the District's evolving history during this transitional
   period.
