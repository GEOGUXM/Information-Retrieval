   Space physics data occupy a significant portion of NSSDC's archives.
   Much of NSSDC's most popular NASA space physics data is accessible
   electronically through NSSDC's near-line data system (NDADS) and
   various on-line services (e.g., OMNIWeb). NSSDC also archives and
   distributes a number of space physics CD-ROMs and models. Those
   interested in reading about data available from, and other aspects of,
   currently important NASA space physics missions should browse through
   the Flight Projects section on this page.

   NSSDC is a partner of the Space Physics Data Facility, within Goddard's
   Space Science Data Operations Office, in bringing public data and
   services to the NASA and more general space physics communities.
