   CALFED Background

      The CALFED Bay-Delta Program was established by a State and Federal
      partnership in 1995 to address the many and complex issues facing the
      Bay-Delta Estuary. In addition to the 18 government agencies, CALFED
      also has representatives from agriculture, urban, environmental,
      fishery, business, and rural counties who participate. To date, Bay
      Area counties and municipalities have participated very little in
      CALFED activities.

      CALFED's mission is to develop a long-term comprehensive plan that will
      restore ecological health and improve water management for beneficial
      uses on the Bay-Delta system. CALFED has created common programs to
      address the problems, which include: levee system integrity, water
      quality improvements, ecosystem restoration, water use efficiency
      measures, water transfers, and watershed management.

      The ABAG Executive Board has established a San Francisco Bay Area
      CALFED Task Force. This Task Force is comprised of locally elected
      officials, (who represent the Bay Area citizenry), local government
      staff to assist the Task Force in its duties, and representatives from
      the major Bay Area water supply agencies.
