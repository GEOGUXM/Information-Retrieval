                                Intended Use
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Purpose
   The Office of Financial Management (OFM) recognizes that "external
   content" - content that is provided by entities that are not part of
   government -- may be included in the publicly accessible website
   operated by OFM at WWW.OFM.WA.GOV. OFM does not intend that our website
   be an open public forum, and external content on pages operated by OFM
   will be permitted at the sole discretion of the agency director.

   Applicability
   This policy applies only to pages that are developed and maintained by
   OFM. This policy is not intended, and shall not be construed, to
   prohibit external content that is:
     * Required or authorized by law;
     * Constitutes official government business;
     * Furthers the specific purpose of a government organization's web
       page; or
     * On web pages not operated by OFM.

   It may be in the public interest to include on the website operated by
   OFM:
     * Links to resources that are provided by others on web sites outside
       of OFM control; and
     * Public acknowledgement of sponsors or other contributors of
       resources to allow OFM to expand the on-line information and
       services.

   External content therefore includes, but is not limited to, links and
   acknowledgements on pages operated by OFM.

   Content Guidelines
   In exercising its discretion to allow external content on its website,
   OFM will be guided by the purpose of the website, which is as follows:

   OFM's website is intended to support, as efficiently, conveniently, and
   cost effectively as possible, and in a manner of presentation befitting
   government, the following uses by citizens, businesses and public
   employees:
     * Location of and access to useful public information provided by
       public agencies or non-profit, non-partisan organizations
     * Location of websites provided by public agencies or non-profit,
       non-partisan organizations
     * Location of public services
     * Delivery of public services via the Internet

   The Director(s) of OFM, at their sole discretion, will determine
   whether external content meets these purposes. Generally, external
   content that does not suit these purposes includes, but is not limited
   to, content that contains, suggests, or infers any of the following:
    1. Advocacy of or opposition to any politically, environmentally, or
       socially controversial subjects, issues, or candidates.
    2. Disparaging or promoting any person or class of persons.
    3. External content not suitable for readers or viewers of all ages,
       or links to or other promotion of businesses whose products or
       services are not suitable for persons of all ages.
    4. Promoting or inciting illegal, violent, or socially undesirable
       conduct.
    5. Promotion or availability of alcohol or tobacco products.
    6. Promotion or availability of illegal drugs.
    7. Promotion or availability of adult or sexually oriented
       entertainment or materials.
    8. Promotion, opposition, or availability of weapons.
    9. Promotion, opposition, or availability of gambling.
   10. Claims of efficacy, suitability, desirability, or other
       non-objective statements about businesses, products, or services.
   11. Content that infringes on any trademark, copyright, or patent
       rights of another.
   12. Claims or representations in violation of advertising or consumer
       protection laws.
   13. Content that a reasonable citizen may not consider appropriate to
       maintain the dignity and decorum of OFM.

   Removal of Content
   The Director(s) of OFM reserves the right, at their sole discretion, to
   withdraw external content that otherwise meets its guidelines. This
   discretion may be exercised if OFM becomes aware, receives claims or
   allegations, or has reason to inquire whether, the content refers or
   links the viewer to content not on OFM's web site that is either in
   violation of any of the above listed guidelines, except No. 10, or
   would be reasonably likely to offend a reasonable citizen. Withdrawal
   of content on these bases will be permitted whether or not OFM is
   legally obligated to act upon any information of which it is aware.
