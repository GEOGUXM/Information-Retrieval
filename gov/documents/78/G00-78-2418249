SEC Complaint Center

   Welcome to the SEC Complaint Center. The Division of Enforcement and
   the Office of Investor Education and Assistance created the SEC
   Complaint Center to make sure that the concerns and problems of
   individual investors are known throughout the SEC and considered when
   we take action. We welcome hearing from you because your complaint may
   be the one that alerts us to a bad broker or firm, an unfair practice
   in the securities industry that needs to be changed, or the latest
   Internet fraud.

How Do I File a Complaint?

   There are several ways to file a complaint:
     * You can file a complaint right now, by using one of our online
       complaint forms.
     * You can print out a form or write us a letter and mail or fax it to
       us. Our address is:


                              SEC Complaint Center
                              450 Fifth Street, NW
                           Washington, D.C. 20549-0213
                                Fax: 202-942-9634
     * Please note that if you decide to mail us your complaint, the SEC
       (as well as other federal agencies) have recently experienced
       delays in the delivery of mail. As a result, you may want to submit
       your complaint online or by fax.
     * You can forward spam (junk email) or copies of message board
       postings to enforcement@sec.gov. Please do not use this email box
       for general complaints or questions.

   If you have a general question about the federal securities laws or
   your investments, go to our "Fast Answers" web page.

What Should I Say in My Complaint?

   We can best review a complaint if we receive accurate and complete
   information from you. Though you are not required to furnish any more
   information than you wish, critical information for us to completely
   evaluate your complaint includes:
     * Your name, mail and email addresses, and telephone numbers.
     * The name, mail and email addresses, telephone numbers, and website
       address of any individual or company you mention in the complaint.
     * Specific details of how, why, and when you were defrauded or
       encountered problems with investments or your broker or adviser.

What Happens After I File a Complaint

   We thoroughly review and evaluate each complaint so that we may refer
   it to the appropriate SEC office. The Office of Investor Education and
   Assistance will handle certain general questions about the securities
   laws and complaints relating to financial professionals or a
   complainant's personal financial matters. The professionals in this
   office can counsel you regarding possible remedies and may, under
   appropriate circumstances, approach brokerage firms, advisers or other
   financial professional concerning matters you have raised.

   Attorneys in the Division of Enforcement evaluate complaints
   implicating violations of the federal securities laws. It is the SEC's
   policy to conduct its investigations on a confidential basis to
   preserve the integrity of its investigative process as well as to
   protect persons against whom unfounded charges may be made or where the
   SEC determines that enforcement action is not necessary or appropriate.

   Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the SEC
   cannot disclose the existence or non-existence of an investigation and
   any information gathered unless made a matter of public record in
   proceedings brought before the SEC or in the courts. You can find
   information about public enforcement actions on our Web site.
