   Funding oppurtunities at NIST


    NIST funds industrial and academic research in a variety of ways. Our
    Advanced Technology Program co-funds high-risk, high-payoff projects
   with industry. The Small Business Innovation Research Program funds R&D
       proposals from small businesses. We also offer other grants to
       encourage work in specific fields: precision measurement, fire
                      research, and materials science.

     Grants/awards supporting research at industry, academic, and other
      institutions are available on a competitive basis through several
     different Institute offices. For general information on NIST grants
              programs, contact Joyce Brigham, (301) 975-6329.
