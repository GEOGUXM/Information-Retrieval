   Governor unveils public works plan to put people to work
   OLYMPIA — Gov. Gary Locke restarted the state’s $880 million capital
   improvement program today, urging the Legislature to take swift action
   on a refinancing plan that will cover a $200 million shortfall in the
   construction budget and add another $100 million in projects.
   “Not only do we need these investments for the long-term economic
   health of our state, but also to help our working people weather the
   current economic slowdown and the layoffs it has brought,” Locke said.
   “This refinancing plan will support 4,200 new jobs and in a recession,
   every job counts.”
   Flanked by legislative leaders, the governor said at a news conference
   that he is confident the Legislature will approve the refinancing
   package as quickly as it can after convening its 2002 session on Jan.
   14.
   “The sooner the Legislature acts, the sooner these projects will create
   new jobs,” the governor said.
   One week after the terrorist attacks, the governor’s budget office
   “paused” funding for capital projects because of uncertainty about
   declining state revenue. The amount of general obligation bonds the
   state can finance for construction projects is limited by the amount of
   revenue the state expects to collect.
   The November 2001 revenue forecast did, in fact, reduce state revenue
   for the 2001-03 biennium by $813 million. And that reduced the bonding
   capacity of the state by $175 million.
   The refinancing proposal saves a total of 2,800 new jobs that would
   have been lost and also creates 1,400 new jobs in the coming year.
   “This is good news, good economic news, for every area of our state,”
   said Sen. Lisa Brown, D-Spokane, chair of the Senate Ways and Means
   Committee. “Not only are these construction projects badly needed by
   the people they serve, but the jobs they create are an extra bonus for
   our communities.”
   The governor proposes to increase the state’s bonding capacity through
   an innovative refinancing approach that relies on a special provision
   of Initiative 728. Passed in November 2000, the initiative provides a
   reliable source of funds – $25 million in state lottery revenue – that
   can be used for debt service rather than being spent as cash in the
   Education Construction Fund.
   The governor’s plan will:
     * Permit $200 million in capital projects to go forward.
     * Create another $100 million in state bonding capacity to finance
       additional capital projects.
     * Provide $25 million in bond proceeds to replace the education
       construction funds proposed to be used for debt service in 2002.

   “We are delighted,” said Lisa Macfarlane of the League of Education
   Voters. “Voters of this state, when they approved I-728 last year, not
   only created a student achievement fund, they also provided a source of
   funding for the state’s education construction fund. By directing the
   lottery proceeds to this fund, I-728 enables critically needed
   community college and higher education construction projects to move
   forward in this tough economic year.”
   “At a time when unemployment rates in Washington state have risen
   drastically, I cannot help but feel that freeing up the capital budget
   will be a great stimulant to an otherwise waning economy,” said Rep. Ed
   Murray, D-Seattle, chair of the House Capital Budget Committee.
   “I am encouraged by the governor’s decision to restart the state’s
   capital improvement program,” said Sen. Joseph Zarelli, R-Vancouver,
   ranking minority member of the Senate Capital Budget Committee. “This
   action not only ensures a variety of projects will continue, more
   importantly it enhances the state economy by preserving and creating
   thousands of jobs across Washington.”
   In addition, Locke said approval of a long-term funding plan for
   badly-needed transportation improvements would offer another major
   boost to the economy. The governor plans to unveil his transportation
   proposal later this month.
