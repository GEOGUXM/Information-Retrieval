                           State Program Inventory
     __________________________________________________________________

   On April 21, 1989 the Coordinating Board directed the staff, with the
   assistance of Missouris public institutions, to develop a comprehensive
   program inventory that will display complete information on programs,
   options and emphasis areas. This inventory will reflect standardized
   nomenclature and program code assignments, and can be linked to an
   improved data support system that will provide information on
   enrollment, credit hours, degrees conferred, and instructional
   expenditures will be useful in monitoring trends at the programmatic
   level.

   In order to reach the individual institution's program inventory, go to
   Academic Program Inventory for a listing by institution.
