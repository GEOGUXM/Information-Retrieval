   Automated Cameras Work
   FHWA Study Finds Red Light Running Violations Down 60 Percent

   A report released today by the U.S. Department of Transportation's
   Federal Highway Administration shows that red light running violations
   decreased by as much as 60 percent at intersections where cameras
   automatically enforce the law.

   The report analyzed results of red light running camera programs in Los
   Angeles County; San Francisco; New York City; Howard County, Md.; and
   Polk County, Fla.

   "These results indicate once again that innovation and new
   technologies, such as cameras used to prevent red light running, can
   help improve safety, which is President Clinton's and Vice President
   Gore's highest transportation priority," U.S. Transportation Secretary
   Rodney E. Slater said. "Red light running is dangerous, and aggressive
   driving behavior can can result in tragic injuries and deaths for
   pedestrians and other motorists."

   In Los Angeles, cameras were installed at rail-grade crossings.
   Reductions in violations by 92, 78 and 34 percent were found at each of
   three crossings where cameras were initially installed.

   Six months into the pilot program in San Francisco, the number of
   vehicles photographed running red lights at intersections with
   enforcement cameras decreased more than 40 percent.

   A 38 percent reduction in violations in New York City led to the
   extension of state legislation enabling the use of automated
   enforcement.

   Maryland's public education and awareness program, which included
   automated cameras at selected intersections, resulted in a decrease in
   violations from 90 per day to 60.

   Florida transportation officials reported that this technology brought
   about a decrease in violations and proved to be accurate, safe,
   reliable and cost effective.

   "Using technology such as high-tech automated cameras at busy
   intersections is key to making our highways safer," said Federal
   Highway Administrator Kenneth R. Wykle. "These cameras are an important
   tool that can help save lives."

   In 1998, there were almost 1.8 million intersection crashes, including
   those caused by drivers running red lights. The crashes resulted in 1.2
   million injuries and more than 8,000 deaths.

   TRANSPORTATION PARTNERS KICK OFF
   NATIONAL WORK ZONE SAFETY AWARENESS WEEK

   With the goal of saving lives during what may be the busiest season of
   road construction in the nation's history, a public-private partnership
   of roadway safety and construction groups are sponsoring National Work
   Zone Safety Awareness Week April 3-7.

   "Safety is President Clinton and Vice President Gore's highest
   transportation priority, and this campaign alerts motorists about the
   need for careful, attentive driving in work zones," U.S. Transportation
   Secretary Rodney E. Slater said. "We can improve safety for both
   travelers and construction workers by exercising caution in work
   zones."

   The purpose of the work zone safety awareness week is to urge motorists
   and work zone workers to take basic steps to help save lives and
   prevent injuries in work zones. Motorists can foster safety in roadway
   work zones, for example, by not using cellular phones and slowing to
   posted speed limits within the work zone, according to the U.S.
   Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

   FHWA, the American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA), the
   American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
   (AASHTO) along with numerous roadway safety and construction groups
   held a kick-off event today at the Springfield, Va., "Mixing Bowl"
   interchange on the outskirts of Washington, D.C.

   "There will be more work zones on our highways this summer than ever
   before," said Kenneth R. Wykle, FHWA administrator. "By taking care and
   showing patience, we can save lives and reduce crashes. When work is
   completed, all of us will benefit from better roads and fewer delays."

   In the past decade more than 8,000 fatalities were reported in work
   zones. Fatalities in 1998 rose to 772, reversing a three-year decline
   in work zones fatalities in 1995-1997. Approximately 38,000 people were
   injured in work zones in 1998, the last year for which figures are
   available.

   "Too many lives are lost each year simply because people are not
   slowing down or are not paying attention when they enter a work zone.
   Work zones are a fact of life, and they are here to stay for years to
   come as roadways are improved and made safer," said Roger Wentz,
   Executive Director of ATSSA.

   Orange signs on along roadways indicate work zones. On average,
   motorists can expect to encounter a work zone every 50 miles they
   travel, more in metropolitan areas.

   During National Work Zone Safety Awareness Week, motorists will be
   asked to take the following actions when entering work zones:
     * Stay alert and give full attention to the roadway.
     * Pay close attention to signs and work zone flaggers.
     * Turn on headlights so workers and motorists can see vehicles.
     * Do not tailgate.
     * Do not speed. Slow down to posted limits.
     * Keep up with the traffic flow through work zones.
     * Do not change lanes in work zones.
     * Minimize distractions in vehicles. Avoid changing radio stations
       and using mobile phones.
     * Expect the unexpected. Keep an eye on workers and their equipment.
     * Be patient. Remember work zones are necessary to improve roads and
       make them safer.

   "The safety of the driving public and workers in highway work zones is
   of paramount importance to state departments of transportation. We
   applaud the many private and public sector partners involved in
   promoting this event, and we join them in encouraging the driving
   public and work zone workers to 'Stay Alert!,'" said Thomas R. Warne,
   AASHTO president.

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Slater Says Record Infrastructure
   Investments Have Improved Transportation Safety, System Conditions

   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater today announced a
   report on the status of the nation's surface transportation system,
   saying that record levels of highway and transit investment by the
   Clinton-Gore Administration, $34.5 billion in 2000 alone, have greatly
   improved transportation safety and enhanced system conditions but that
   further progress is necessary in the new century and the new
   millennium.

   "Public investment in surface transportation is at its highest level
   ever," Secretary Slater said. "This report illustrates how our record
   levels of investment have paid off in enhanced safety, which is our
   highest transportation priority, and an improved surface transportation
   system. The report also makes clear, however, more still needs to be
   done."

   The report finds that the average annual cost to maintain physical
   conditions of highways and bridges for the next 20 years is projected
   to be $56.6 billion by all levels of government in 1997 dollars. It
   finds that capital spending on highways and bridges would need to rise
   16.3 percent above 1997 levels to maintain this level. Over the life of
   the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), this
   difference is expected to decline to 5.7 percent.

   The estimated average annual investment required to maintain the
   transit systems in the same condition as today is $10.8 billion. The
   estimated cost to improve the transit systems by eliminating
   deficiencies is estimated to be $16 billion. Capital spending on
   transit would need to increase 41 percent to reach the $10.8 billion
   projected as the cost to maintain transit systems. This difference is
   expected to decline to 12.9 percent over the life of TEA-21.

   Total spending on highways and bridges was $101.3 billion for highways
   and bridges in 1997, an 8.4 percent increase over 1995. Of this, $48.7
   billion was for capital improvements, a 10.2 percent increase. The
   federal government contributed 41.1 percent of the capital outlay, down
   from 44.5 percent in 1995.

   Total spending on transit was $25.1 billion in 1997, a 5.5 percent
   increase over 1995. Of that total, $7.6 billion was for capital
   improvements, an increase of 8.6 percent. The federal government
   contributed 27 percent of public funding for transit, up from 25
   percent in 1995.

   In addition, the report finds that the pavement condition of the
   nation's urban and rural highways has improved overall. Since 1993, the
   percentage of Interstate road miles with acceptable ride quality
   increased from 91.2 percent in 1993 to 92.4 percent in 1997. The
   percent of total road miles in poor condition dropped from 8.6 percent
   to 6.6 percent over that same time period.

   The report also finds that the condition of the nation's bridges has
   improved, with the percentage of deficient bridges overall at 29.6
   percent in 1998, compared with 34.6 percent in 1992. The Interstate
   system has the lowest percentage of deficient bridges, 16.4 percent in
   rural areas and 26.8 percent in urban areas . Deficient bridges are not
   necessarily unsafe but, in many cases, are not built to meet current
   traffic demands.

   Transit systems route miles show a 10-year increase of 44.2 percent in
   rail service and 10.4 percent in non-rail service. Vehicle revenue
   miles for rail increased 22.4 percent, while non-rail increased 17.1
   percent over the period. In 1997, rail travel accounted for almost 53
   percent of transit passenger miles while serving just 5.1 percent of
   route miles.

   The average condition of urban bus vehicles was 3.1 on a scale of 5.0,
   or "adequate," with the status largely unchanged over the last decade.
   The average condition of rail vehicles was 4.0, or "good." The downward
   trend in rail vehicle condition is caused primarily by a deterioration
   in the nation's heavy rail vehicles, which comprise 60 percent of rail
   vehicles and whose average condition rating declined from 4.7 in 1987
   to 3.9 in 1997.

   The study finds that most measures of congestion show an increase over
   the last several years. Travel density in terms of travel per lane mile
   is clearly increasing. Delays increased on all highways between 1993
   and 1997, rising from 8.3 to 9 hours per 1,000 VMT. Although daily VMT
   has grown for both rural and urban highways, it has increased at a
   faster rate on rural routes. DVMT grew by 3.4 percent on rural
   interstates between 1987 and 1997.

   The department's Condition and Performance Report: 1999 Status of the
   Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit, is a biennial report to
   Congress that provides information on the physical and operating
   characteristics and future investment needs of the highway, bridge and
   transit segments of the nation's surface transportation system.

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Slater: Survey Shows Americans Run Red
   Lights Without Regard for Consequences

   "National Stop on Red Week" Reminds Drivers to Stop on Red

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater today announced the
   results of a survey by the Stop Red Light Running partnership revealing
   that 98 percent of Americans agree that red light running is dangerous,
   but over half admit deliberately running red lights because they are in
   a hurry.

   The release of the survey marks the second annual "National Stop on Red
   Week," which runs from Sept. 24 to Oct. l. The program is a
   public/private partnership between the Federal Highway Administration
   (FHWA), the American Trauma Society (ATS) and DaimlerChrysler
   Corporation.

   "I applaud this partnership and participating communities for their
   efforts to improve safety, which is President Clintons highest
   transportation priority," Secretary Slater said. "Observing red lights
   can prevent tragic injuries and deaths of pedestrians and motorists
   alike."

   The research also provides new evidence that red light runners do not
   conform to a set demographic the dangerous practice reaches across
   drivers of all age, economic groups and gender. The perpetrators are
   everyday people; professionals, blue-collar workers, unemployed,
   homemakers, parents, and young adults.

   According to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics, drivers who
   run red lights are involved in 89,000 crashes a year, inflicting more
   than 80,000 injuries and nearly 1,000 deaths. In addition, from 1992 to
   1998, the number of fatal crashes at intersections has increased by 16
   percent, while all other types of fatal crashes have increased by only
   five percent.

   "These numbers remind me of the state of affairs some years ago with
   drunk driving, where a lot of otherwise decent people knew better, but
   did it anyway because they didnt realize how truly perilous it was,"
   said ATS Executive Director Harry Teter. "So the message is clear weve
   got to do a better job of consciousness raising of making people aware
   that running red lights simply is not acceptable."

   Although, social scientists involved with the survey hypothesized that
   "frustration" and "road rage" would represent what most people
   perceived as the cause of red light running, the results proved
   otherwise. Only 15.8 percent of respondents cited those reasons, while
   nearly half (47.8) admitted to being prompted by nothing more
   complicated than being in a hurry.

   "Red light running is not only rude, its life threatening," said Susan
   Cischke, DaimlerChrysler vice president for vehicle safety and
   regulatory affairs. "It has the same effect as driving under the
   influence in terms of probability of serious injury and death."

   The survey focused on what drivers reported to be their red light
   running behaviors, as opposed to what they believed about red light
   running. Overall, 55.8 percent of the respondents admit running red
   lights. Those in lower technology (68.3) and blue-collar jobs (59.7),
   as well as unemployed (68.8), and non-parents (65 percent) reported
   significantly more red light running than respondents in other
   categories.

   Professionals (59.7) and homemakers (54.8) also rank high. Parents with
   children less than 20 years old (65.6) are likely to run red lights
   more than parents of older children (40.8). Respondents with bachelors
   and postgraduate degrees rank at 58.4 and 56 percent respectively.

   The survey also found that a majority of drivers (80.5) were more
   frustrated with discourtesy on the roads than they were with any other
   traffic problem, including congestion.

   The poll was conducted by the Social Science Research Center at Old
   Dominion University and has a margin of error of plus or minus three
   percentage points. It queried 880 licensed drivers ages 18 and older on
   behalf of the Stop Red Light Running program.

   This years National Stop on Red Week is "A Call to Action" to encourage
   more traffic safety advocates, law enforcement agencies, hospitals, law
   makers and others, to help raise awareness about the danger of running
   red lights.

   Communities across the country are raising awareness of red light
   running through press conferences, increased enforcement, and
   distribution of educational materials and other activities. The Stop
   Red Light Running program provides those interested in promoting
   highway safety with step-by-step guides for program development and
   grants for local implementation. Additionally, a toll-free number
   (877-STOP-555) and a website (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/stoprlr) are
   available for further information.

   FHWA Recognizes Highway Safety Partners Before NASCAR Craftsman Truck
   Series Race

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Federal Highway Administration's Deputy
   Administrator Gloria Jeff today presented awards to Nashville Speedway
   U.S.A. and the Tennessee Trucking Association for their efforts to
   educate race fans about how to safely "Share the Road" with large
   trucks.

   "Safety is President Clinton's highest transportation priority," Jeff
   said. "By working in partnership with the trucking industry and the
   NASCAR family we will communicate important highway safety messages to
   drivers of other vehicles."

   A Tennessee Trucking Association tractor trailer will be displaying
   "Don't hang out in the No-Zone" decals at the Federated Parts 250 Race
   and make a parade lap around the speedway before Saturday's race.

   "I think what the Department of Transportation is doing to educate
   people nationwide about sharing the road safely with large trucks is
   very important," said Bob Harmon, president of the Nashville Speedway
   U.S.A. "I agreed to support the No-Zone highway safety campaign because
   transportation is a big part of our business. I appreciate the
   importance of this information to help show people how to drive around
   large vehicles."

   The FHWA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation, will have
   a second No-Zone truck, provided by M.S. Carriers, at the NASCAR race
   to distribute No-Zone literature and display No-Zone safety materials.

   NASCAR is America's fastest growing spectator sport, and getting
   highway safety messages out to fans may help influence people to become
   safer drivers, Jeff said.

   The No-Zone public highway safety campaign includes radio and print
   PSAs, driver education materials, and a website address of
   www.nozone.org.

   EDITORS AND CORRESPONDENTS

   A new national system of selecting motor carriers for on-site safety
   inspections, concentrating on a carrier's safety performance to
   identify and prioritize carriers that are "at risk," is being
   instituted this month by the Federal Highway Administration.

   Called SafeStat (for Safety Status), the new system will focus on
   carriers posing the highest potential risk to highway safety, making it
   possible for the Office of Motor Carriers to better utilize its limited
   resources.

   SafeStat will evaluate carrier performance in four areas -- accidents,
   driver violations, vehicle violations, and safety management record
   relative to the entire carrier population for which data are available.
   Unlike previous carrier selection methodologies, SafeStat recognizes
   that a carrier's recent accident history is the most significant
   indicator of safety performance.

   This new approach will further FHWA's ongoing transition toward
   results-oriented regulations and safety programs. It was successfully
   tested recently in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and Oregon.

   Further information is available from Bryan Price of the Office of
   Motor Carriers, (202) 366-5720.

   Sincerely yours,

   George L. Reagle
   Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers

   A crash is not an accident.

   Changing the way we think about events and the words we use to describe
   them affects the way we behave. Motor vehicle crashes occur "when a
   link or several links in the chain" are broken. Continued use of the
   word "accident" implies that these events are outside human influence
   or control. In reality, they are predictable results of specific
   actions.

   Since we can identify the causes of crashes, we can take action to
   alter the effect and avoid collisions. These are not Acts of God but
   predictable results of the laws of physics.

   The concept of "accident" works against bringing all appropriate
   resources to bear on the enormous problem of highway collisions. Use of
   "accident" fosters the idea that the resulting damage and injuries are
   unavoidable.

   "Crash," "collision," and "injury" are more appropriate terms, and we
   encourage their use as substitutes for "accident."

   Along with the Department's Research and Special Programs
   Administration, the Federal Highway Administration has joined the
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in declaring that the
   word "accident" will no longer be used in materials we publish, in
   speeches or other statements, or in communications with the media and
   others.

   Sincerely yours,

   George L. Reagle
   Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers

   I am pleased to report that today the Federal Highway Administration
   honored longtime highway safety advocate Linda Householder by
   presenting her the coveted FHWA Public Service Award.

   Ms. Householder, who founded the Professional Drivers Institute of
   America 14 years ago and is still its president, was instrumental in
   instituting trucking awareness instruction in many high school driver
   education curriculums.

   In addition, on the national scene she has provided outstanding
   leadership through involvement with senior citizen groups,
   corporations, law enforcement agencies, and many others in teaching how
   to drive safely around commercial vehicles.

   Ms. Householder was one of the safety experts who participated in
   FHWA's 1995 National Truck and Bus Safety Summit and she has worked
   with the National Safety Council and others in helping promote
   sharing-the-road educational campaigns.

   She resides in Sandy, Utah.

   Sincerely yours,

   George L. Reagle
   Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers
