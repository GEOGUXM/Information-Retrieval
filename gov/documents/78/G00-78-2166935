   BACKGROUND
   The Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP), National Institute of Neurological
   Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health develops implanted
   devices that interface directly with the nervous system to replace or
   supplement function in neurologically disabled individuals.
   Significant advances have been made in demonstrating the feasibility of
   bypassing peripheral sensory organs such as the ear and the eye to
   restore lost sensory functions. Recently, a blind individual had an
   array of 38 microelectrodes with percutaneous leads implanted into her
   visual cortex for a period of three months. During this time she was
   able to see and describe visual phosphenes produced by electrical
   stimulation through the microelectrodes. Critical engineering
   parameters, such as phosphene thresholds as low as 4 microamperes and a
   two point resolution of 500 microns, were determined which now permit
   the design of a permanent implant controlled by electromagnetic signals
   passing across the skin. (Ref. Hambrecht, F.T., 1995, Visual prostheses
   based on direct interfaces with the visual system. In Brindley, G.S.
   and Rushton, D.N. eds., Baillière's Clinical Neurology:
   Neuroprostheses, Baillière Tindall, London, pp 147-165.) Because such a
   permanent implant would not require any leads passing through the skin,
   there should be little risk of infection and the implant could be left
   in place indefinitely.
   Specifically, a transcutaneous stimulation system consisting of a
   computer controlled transmitter and a group of implantable
   receiver-stimulator modules, each with 256 stimulus channel outputs, is
   needed. Research and development are required to assure that the
   implanted portion of this system will be small enough to fit safely and
   comfortably beneath the scalp and that the stimulus outputs are
   flexible enough to provide the range of stimulus parameters necessary
   for producing patterns of phosphenes by intracortical microstimulation.
   This transcutaneous transmission system will interface not only with
   discrete wire microelectrodes but also with silicon microstimulating
   microelectrodes presently being developed by other investigators in the
   NPP. The extracorporeal portion of the system will include a computer
   controlled transmitter for sending power and control signals across the
   skin to the implanted receiver-stimulator modules.
   This contract research is a new project not previously supported by the
   NPP. A bibliography listing publications resulting from NPP studies
   related to this project is available, free of charge, from the Neural
   Prosthesis Program, NIH, Federal Building, Room 916, Bethesda, MD

   STATEMENT OF WORK
   I. Independently, and not as an agent of the government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to design and fabricate a transcutaneous
   transmission system suitable for use in a human visual prosthesis. The
   system shall consist of: 1.) a group of appropriately packaged,
   implantable, 256 channel receiver-stimulator modules each with high
   density connectors suitable for connection to 256 cortical
   microelectrodes; 2.) an external transmitter interfaced to an external
   computer which can be used to control the implanted receiver-stimulator
   modules; 3.) a reverse telemetry system for monitoring key voltages in
   the receiver-stimulator modules. The contractor will not be required to
   furnish the microelectrodes nor perform any animal or human testing.
   Specifically the Contractor shall:
   A. Design the overall system such that it can be expanded in modules of
   256 channels up to 1024 channels.
   B. Design the receiver-stimulator module to meet the following target
   specifications. (Note: Priorities and limits will have to be assigned
   to some of the stimulus parameters under certain operational conditions
   to avoid conflicts. These rules of operation will be established
   shortly after the beginning of the contract in a joint meeting between
   the contractor and the Project Officer.)
   1. Capable of passing truly simultaneous biphasic current pulses
   through at least 16 of any of the 256 microelectrodes that will be
   connected to its output with the capability of passing interleaved
   biphasic current pulses through any or all of the non-simultaneously
   pulsed microelectrodes.
   2. Capable of stimulating each channel at repetition rates of 10 to 250
   Hz. The repetition period should have a resolution of 250 microseconds.
   3. Phase durations of each phase of a biphasic pulse pair controllable
   over the range of 50 to 750 microseconds (50 microsecond
   resolution/phase)
   4. Output compliance voltages of at least +/- 5 volts.
   5. Amplitude of each phase controllable over the range of0 to +/- 64
   microamperes (0.5 microampere resolution) unless limited by the
   compliance voltage.
   6. Have an anodic bias supply adjustable over the range of 0 to 0.75
   volts referenced to a standard calomel electrode (SCE). In a functional
   system, the actual voltage of this bias must be translated to
   correspond to the use of a large surface area platinum reference
   electrode that will be used in place of a SCE. Each channel must be
   connected to the anodic bias supply through large bias resistors (e.g.
   10 megohm)
   7. Train length on each channel of 1 to 255 biphasic pulse pairs.
   8. Train delay times for each channel referenced to a reference timing
   pulse (e.g, a reference pulse for channel #1) adjustable over the range
   of 0 to 12700 microseconds (100 microsecond resolution).
   9. Maximum total output current of each module at least 1024
   microamperes.
   10. Have built-in safety features that include the ability to sense the
   failure of any of the output drivers or other modes of operation that
   could result in charge imbalance and tissue damage.
   a. Since it is assumed that space will not permit output coupling
   capacitors on each channel, a desired feature would be the ability to
   disconnect a shorted output driver from its power supply.
   11. The modules should be capable of independent operation, i.e. should
   any of the modules fail, such failure should not affect the operation
   of the remaining modules.
   12. Have a reverse telemetry system for monitoring the following
   voltages within each module on demand
   a. The voltage waveform developed across any remotely selected
   microelectrode during stimulation.
   b. The anodic bias supply.
   c. The positive and negative power supply voltages
   13. Contained in a hermetic package
   a. Suitable for implantation between the scalp and the skull with
   dimensions no greater than 5 mm thick, 30 mm wide, and 30 mm long, not
   including any receiving antennae which can be external to the package.
   b. With 4 separate 66 contact, high-density, low disconnect force,
   connectors in the package walls that interface with appropriate
   connectors terminating the leads from the microelectrodes or on dummy
   loads during in-vitro testing.
   c. With smooth, rounded edges and attachment sites for immobilizing the
   package to the skull in an appropriate manner.
   C. Design the external transmitter portion of the system to supply
   power and full control of up to four receiver-stimulator modules.
   1. The transcutaneous transmission signal should be capable of reliably
   operating through human scalp tissue with thicknesses ranging from 2 mm
   to 10 mm.
   2. The transmitter shall be under the control of a computer whose
   output can be altered by keyboard entries, by software or by a remote
   interface that will eventually be controlled by an image sensing device
   such as a television camera. (The contractor does not need to supply
   the image sensor, nor any interface electronics between the image
   sensor and the computer, only the remote interface that will allow full
   control of the receiver-stimulator modules.)
   3. Although the external portions of the systems to be supplied under
   this contract do not need to be "patient portable", the design should
   not ignore the fact that future generations of the system will be
   portable.
   D. Fabricate and test, in-vitro, a complete system with 1024 channels.
   1. Document the ability of the system to deliver the specified design
   stimuli at the specified rates without significant cross talk between
   channels.
   2. Test functional receiver-stimulator packages with integral
   connectors for hermeticity and proper electrical operation in an
   accelerated aging environment of heated saline solution for a period of
   at least 6 months.
   E. Before the end of the first year of the contract, furnish the
   Project Officer with 5 empty but hermetically sealed receiver-module
   packages with at least one 66 contact connector for in-vivo testing by
   other investigators in the Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP).
   F. Before the end of the second year of the contract, furnish the
   Project Officer with at least 5 fully functional, 256 channel systems,
   complete with mating connectors so that other investigators in the NPP
   can attach microelectrode leads and test the complete system in
   animals.
   G. Before the end of the third year of the contract, furnish the
   Project Officer with at least 2 fully functional, 1024 channel systems,
   complete with mating connectors for attachment to microelectrode leads
   for human testing by other NPP investigators.
   H. Should failures occur during the above mentioned in-vitro or in-vivo
   testing, the remaining required deliverables will be reduced, upon
   mutual agreement between the contractor, the Project Officer and the
   Contracting Officer, to allow resources to be applied to the redesign
   and fabrication of relevant parts of the system.
   I. The contractor shall coordinate his work, through the Project
   Officer, with other investigators in the NPP.
