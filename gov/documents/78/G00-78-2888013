                          Recent Commission Reports

   Gender Distribution on Erie County Municipal Boards

     * Women comprise 54 percent of Erie County's population, yet account
       for only 32 percent of the representation on its municipal boards.
     * Of the 71 paid municipal boards, numbering 389 seats, women hold a
       mere 59 seats (15 percent). Of these 71 boards, 29 have no women
       serving on them.
     * Boards with the greatest fiscal impact on municipalities, such as
       Planning, Zoning, and Assessment Review, have a greater number of
       men than women serving on them. There are a total of 106 such
       boards with 597 seats. Women hold 104 seats (17 percent). Men hold
       403 seats (83 percent).
     * Women are presented in greater numbers on such boards as Parks and
       Recreation, Senior Citizens, Beautification, Youth, and Libraries,
       yet even these kinds of boards are only now approaching gender
       equality. There are 55 of these boards with 613 seats. Women hold
       293 seats (48 percent). Men hold 320 seats (52 percent).

   Women.

   Gender Distribution on Erie County Not-for-Profit Boards

   The intention of this report is to focus public attention on the gender
   representation on not-for-profit boards with budgets of $1 million or
   greater located in Erie County, as well as to increase awareness of the
   opportunities for women to participate in the important task of service
   on these boards.

    1. This survey found that females account for 34% of the
       representation on not-for-profit boards located within Erie County.
    2. Of 91 agencies, 8% stated that they have experienced difficulty
       finding women to serve on their boards.
    3. Of 2103 seats, 113, or 5% are vacant.
    4. Of 181 seats on the Community/Business Boards, 29, or 16%, are held
       by females. Of 42 officer positions, 7, or 17%, are held by
       females.
    5. Of 254 seats on the Cultural Boards, 60, or 24%, are held by
       females. Of 51 officer positions, 8, or 16%, are held by females.
    6. Of 494 seats on the Health/Mental Health Boards, 166, or 34%, are
       held by females. Of 100 officer positions, 40, or 40%, are held by
       females.
    7. Of 260 seats in the Children/Youth category, 113, or 43%, are held
       by females. Out of 935 seats in the Human Services category, 361,
       or 39%, are held by females. It is important to note that even on
       these boards there is not gender equality.
    8. Of the agencies surveyed, 61% stated that prior participation with
       the organization is considered when selecting a board member. Of
       these agencies, 35% of the board members are female.
    9. Of the agencies surveyed, 75% stated that professional experience
       is considered when selecting a board member. Of these agencies, 34%
       of the board members are female.
   10. Of the agencies surveyed, 36% stated that a financial contribution
       to the agency is required to be a member of the board. Of these
       agencies, 30% of the board members are female.
   11. The term of office varies in each organization from one to five
       years. Some terms change yearly, some are staggered. The term of
       office had no impact on the number of males or females on the
       not-for-profit boards. The Committee found that the term of office
       had no relevance to the representation of women.
   12. Most not-for-profit agencies surveyed responded that reimbursement
       for expenses was not given. Almost all agency members received no
       fee or honorarium. Those that indicated fees/honorariums did not
       specify an amount.
   13. The geographic area served by the agency had no impact on the
       gender distribution of the board.
   14. The appointment and recommendation process varied greatly in each
       agency. For instance, some agencies noted a nominating committee or
       provided a lengthy explanation. Therefore, it is difficult to draw
       any conclusions from the information obtained from the survey
       responses.
