                    Independent Medical Review Decisions

   One of the most important ways our HMO Help Center can assist people
   who are having a problem with their HMO is through our Independent
   Medical Review program, where doctors tell HMOs what to do.

   HMO problems can be very simple for us to resolve, such as fixing a
   paperwork error that's preventing you from getting an appointment with
   a specialist.

   But there are some very complicated HMO problems that involve medical
   questions. For these cases, we provide our Independent Medical Review
   program, under which an independent panel of doctors decides whether an
   HMO was right or wrong in denying treatment.

   There are two categories under which Independent Medical Reviews are
   used:

   Medical Necessity: Independent Medical Reviews in which the disputed
   treatment was either delayed, denied or modified by the HMO based on
   medical necessity.

   Experimental/Investigational: Independent Medical Reviews in which the
   disputed treatment was denied by the HMO as being experimental or
   investigational.

   If the HMO's denial is overturned, it is required to pay for the
   requested service or treatment and we will enforce that decision to the
   full extent of the law.
