   Transportation Energy Division
   California Energy Commission

   California's size and its "love affair" with the automobile translates
   into roughly 51 percent of all energy in the state being used by the
   transportation sector. The state's more than 18 million automobiles
   consume more than 14 billion gallons of gasoline each year. That's
   enough gasoline to fill a line of tanker trucks stretched bumper to
   bumper from San Francisco to San Diego and back! A NEW website for
   consumer information on Transportation can be found on our Consumer
   Energy Center website.

   The Energy Commission is concerned with the impact transportation fuels
   has on our state. Under the new Commission reorganization, a new
   Division was formed to focus on transportation energy and alternatives
   to conventional fuels. Additionally, the division houses the
   Commission's Global Climate Change Office and the Energy Technology
   Export Program Office.
