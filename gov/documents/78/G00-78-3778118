   Research Interests:

   John Sutherland uses optical and other physical methods to study the
   structure, function and dynamics of DNA, proteins and other biological
   materials. He developed theory and electronic imaging systems for
   quantifying DNA damage by gel electrophoresis and the
   method-of-moments, and participated in studies of the damage induced by
   UV in DNA in human skin and plants in situ, the repair of this damage,
   and the environmental implications of depletion of stratospheric ozone.
   Similar approaches are being used to quantify DNA damage induced by
   ionizing radiations.

   He pioneered the use of synchrotron radiation for the measurement of
   circular dichroism and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in the
   ultraviolet/visible spectral regions. Recent innovations include the
   Fluorescence Omnylizer, a single-photon counting detector that
   simultaneously records the time-delay, wavelength and polarization of
   each detected photon, and a beamline that measures circular dichroism
   of soft X-ray using phase-sensitive detection. Current interests
   include free-electron lasers as probes of biomolecular structure and
   dynamics.


   [U9B_icon.jpg] He also manages NSLS beamline U9B and its attendant
   external user program for far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and
   time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.
   [omni_spectrum_i.gif] At U9B the a spectrograph developed in John
   Sutherland's lab, the Omnilyzer, is frequently used to simultaneously
   record the fluorescent intensity at all wavelengths as a function of
   time and polarization.
