                       A Photo of the Earth's weather

   Click to see your planet's weather in motion! These GOES-8 satellite
   images were collected by high school students on a very low cost
   satellite weather station. The students have enhanced the moisture
   channel and recorded the same view over several days in an effort to
   understand how the El Nin√µ effect couples into our USA weather.

   One of my recent projects is working with the schools to enable this
   new technology to be used routinely at the high school level to fulfill
   Earth Science requirements.

                           The EOS PM-1 satellite

   Here is a painting of the EOS PM-1 satellite that I'm working on at
   NASA. It is being built by a major aerospace company called TRW. With
   this satellite in orbit, scientists will be studying Earth processes
   related to the climate in more detail than ever. Anything that affects
   the weather will naturally be a factor in the longer-term Earth Process
   called the "climate". This project is sponsoring the special education
   initiative detailed above. Some of the realtime data from this mission
   will be brought into the classrooms via the curricula developed for the
   GOES weather data. We plan to be ready to launch by Dec 31, 2002.

   Here is a GOES-10 images of the Moon's shadow passing over the Earth
   during the Febuary 1998 eclipse!!

                          South Pole Internet Link

   NASA's NEW Internet Link to the South Pole is now working!!

   Scientists at several universities in the USA are controlling their
   instruments at the exact South Pole from their desktop computers!

                 Today's Composite Ozone Over Antarctica !!

   Color Images of the Antarctic Ozone Hole were suspended due to failure
   of Spacecraft Transmitter #1. With only one transmitter left, NASA is
   limiting it to one dump per day of the previous 24 hours of data. The
   above link is produced at Goddard. It provides the composite image of
   the data each day in discrete or movie forms, plus lots of other cool
   stuff.

    Download Images of Recent Composite Ozone Over Antarctica !!

   Without access to the realtime data, we must now depend on this link
   for products 24 hours after the fact, such as:
     * The Daily Reflectivity Level off the Polar Ice
     * Daily Composite Sulphor Dioxide Image

   Did you notice that we had been providing realtime, color images of the
   Antarctic Ozone Hole, as seen by our TOMS-EP spacecraft. The images
   presented here were updated every orbit. There is still a movie of the
   development of one Antarctic Ozone Hole, up through its maximum extent
   in early October. We hope to resume this realtime link, as soon as the
   spacecraft controllers agree to resume the realtime downlinks, using
   the back up transmitter onboard TOMS-EP.

   Take the VIP Tour to see one of my trips from the Antarctic to the
   equator. The tour includes pictures on the ice, some spectacular views
   of Mt. Erebus, a day off in New Zealand, a penguin rookery, and some
   time in Ecuador. COOL stuff!
