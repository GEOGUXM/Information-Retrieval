                          AETD Technology Programs

   Technology and know how (i.e. applied engineering) work in tandem to
   enable NASA missions and our vision for the future. To make a better,
   faster, or cheaper product and to make scientific quests a reality,
   requires capabilities that typically do not exist until the underlying
   technologies are developed.

   These technologies include thermal control, spacecraft navigation,
   microelectronics, intelligent systems and super conducting detectors.
   All these and more are imagined and developed under the auspices of
   AETD in partnerships with scientists and technologists across GSFC and
   externally with collaborators in industry, academia, as well as at
   other NASA Centers and government agencies.

   AETD technology programs are funded by a number of traditional sources
   such as flight programs, and also from SOMO, CETDP, DDF (Directors
   Discretionary Fund), SBIR and ESTO to name few.

   partners and programs.
