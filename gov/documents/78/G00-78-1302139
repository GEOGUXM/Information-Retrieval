USGS Social Scientists Examine Citizen Attitudes Toward Prairie Dogs

   Much controversy has surrounded the potential listing of the
   black-tailed prairie dog as a threatened species. Successfully
   addressing this complex issue involves understanding public knowledge
   and sentiments. What is the level of citizen knowledge regarding
   black-tailed prairie dogs? What are their attitudes and preferences
   regarding this animal, and what explains individual differences? A
   study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and conducted
   by social scientists at the USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center
   answers these and similar questions. Principal investigator Berton Lee
   Lamb presented results from this citizen survey, conducted in the
   11-state short-grass prairie region of the U.S., at a symposium
   entitled "Understanding and Conserving Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs." The
   symposium was held in conjunction with the Western Association of Fish
   and Wildlife Agencies meeting January 6-7 in Las Cruces, NM.
