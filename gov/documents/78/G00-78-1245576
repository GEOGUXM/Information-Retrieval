   Step 1: A Memorandum of Understanding

   To use our services, you first need to have a Memorandum of
   Understanding with Region 2, FTS.  This is our "contract" with you to
   provide goods and services under the IT-Solutions program.

   Use our handy Memorandum of Understanding Builder to help you complete
   the form.  After the form is completed, you can fax it to our office
   and that will be you started.  We will be notified automatically.

   Step 2: Register in IT-Solutions

   Once your Memorandum is active, you need to sign up with GSA's Central
   Order Processing System - IT-Solutions.   The sign up forms on the site
   forms will walk you through the process.

   Step 3: Order your Goods or Services

   It's FAST and easy to order your goods through us - You can use the
   screens in IT-Solutions to quickly get your order processed.  As an
   additional help, we have a Bill of Materials Builder for you to use.

   It's just that easy!
