   Executive Summary

   [hr.gif]

      The Pollution Prevention (P2) Handbook is an initiative effort to
      standardize Environmental processes throughout NASA centers. The
      objective of this effort is to provide a guidance document for Program
      Managers and Process Owners to use in their pollution prevention
      initiatives. The handbook will address all phases of life-cycle
      management and associated agency level Pollution Prevention (P2) cost.
      Guidance on the Environmental Impact and Analysis Process (EIAP) and
      Environmental Life-Cycle Total Cost Assessment (ELCTCA) will also be
      incorporated.

      Pollution Prevention in Life-Cycle Management is defined as "those
      activities relating to the reduction or elimination of pollutants that
      can impact the environment, safety and health of workers and the public
      from all phases of the life-cycle of aerospace systems along with their
      subsystems and support systems. It is an integral part of the systems
      engineering approach which evaluates options, considering cost,
      performance, schedule, and Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH)
      impacts."

      While this handbook will not contain specific guidance, it will be
      prepared using suggested language and will not be intended to be all
      encompassing for every aerospace system program. However, with
      acquisition approaches ranging from "buy off the shelf" to total system
      development, there are many considerations and possible actions to
      minimize environmental impact. In addition, there are special
      environmental issues to consider for different types of aerospace
      systems. This handbook will describe the environmental issues
      associated with a variety of acquisition approaches and aerospace
      systems and discuss possible actions to mitigate environmental impacts.
      It will offer useful ideas and suggestions on how to deal with
      environmental problems in a structured way. The handbook will be
      incorporated as a discretionary National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) handbook and appropriate pollution prevention
      templates for specific life-cycle management documents and processes
      within the agency information structure.

      The intended audiences for this handbook are Program Managers and
      Process Owners and their life-cycle management and sustainment staff,
      either at product manufacture or NASA centers; as well as, the
      contractor, subcontractors and suppliers supporting the aerospace
      systems, components and processes. The handbook is scheduled for
      completion by December 2000.
