        PROPOSED FOR NASA AMES

        A draft of the NASA Ames Development Plan (20.5Mb pdf file) and the
        NASA Research Park Design Guide (3.4Mb pdf file) are available to
        download in Adobe Acrobat (software that can be downloaded for free)
        format.

      (The following text is from the NASA Ames Development Plan [20.5Mb pdf
      file])

      The NASA Ames Development Plan (NADP) (20.5Mb pdf file) details the
      transformation of the original 200-hectare (500-acre) campus of NASA
      Ames Research Center and the 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of the former
      Naval Air Station Moffett Field into an integrated, dynamic research
      and education community in the heart of Silicon Valley. This
      transformation will be led by the establishment of the NASA Research
      Park, a 86-hectare (213-acre) research and development campus for
      partners from academia, industry and non-profit corporations with
      shared goals in support of NASAs mission.

      For planning purposes, Moffett Field has been divided into several
      smaller areas or districts, each with its own identity and function.
      The idea of expressing separate districts is a way to organize NASA
      Ames large, diverse environment into a set of smaller parts that are
      coherent and manageable.
