      The heliosphere is a bubble in space produced by the solar wind.
      Although electrically neutral atoms from interstellar space can
      penetrate this bubble, virtually all of the material in the heliosphere
      emanates from the Sun itself.

      The solar wind streams off of the Sun in all directions at speeds of
      several hundred km/s (about 1,000,000 mph in the Earth's vicinity). At
      some distance from the Sun, well beyond the orbit of Pluto, this
      supersonic wind must slow down to meet the gases in the interstellar
      medium. It must first pass through a shock, the termination shock, to
      become subsonic. It then slows down and gets turned in the direction of
      the ambient flow of the interstellar medium to form a comet-like tail
      behind the Sun. This subsonic flow region is called the helio-sheath.
      The outer surface of the helio-sheath, where the heliosphere meets the
      interstellar medium, is called the heliopause.

      The precise distance to, and shape of,  the heliopause is still
      uncertain. Interplanetary spacecraft such as Pioneer 10 and 11 and
      Voyager 1 and 2 are traveling outward through the solar system and will
      eventually pass through the heliopause.

      The solar wind consists of particles, ionized atoms from the solar
      corona, and fields, in particular magnetic fields. As the Sun rotates
      once in about 27 days, the magnetic field transported by the solar wind
      gets wrapped into a spiral. Variations in the Sun's magnetic field are
      carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in
      the Earth's own magnetosphere.
