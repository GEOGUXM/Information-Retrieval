                     GPS/GLONASS Performance Evaluation


   [BS00981_.gif] GLONASS/GPS Satellite Visibility - Displays the number
   of GLONASS and GPS satellites tracked by an Ashtech GG24 receiver   or
   a 3S Navigation R100 receiver located at the WJH Technical Center in
   Atlantic City.   On 14 February 2000, the number of useable  GLONASS
   satellites dropped from 10 to 9 at 1239 UTC.  Satellite 16/22
   (slot/freq) went down for maintenance at 1239 UTC (NAGU 033-000215).
   The NAGU information was obtained from
   http://mx.iki.rssi.ru/SFCSIC/english.html.  On 12 April 2000, this NAGU
   was still active and only 9 GLONASS satellites were available.

   [BS00981_.gif] Vertical Position Error - Displays the vertical position
   error using both GLONASS and GPS satellites tracked by the Ashtech GG24
   receiver or a 3S Navigation R100 receiver over a 24-hour period and the
   vertical position error using just GPS satellites tracked by the
   Novatel Millenium receiver over the same 24-hour period.  All three
   receivers are located at the WJH Technical Center in Atlantic City.
   The third graph displays the number of GLONASS satellites at each
   second over the 24-hour period.

   [BS00981_.gif] East Position Error - Displays the east position error
   using both GLONASS and GPS satellites tracked by the Ashtech GG24
   receiver or a 3S Navigation R100 receiver over a 24-hour period and the
   east position error using just GPS satellites tracked by the Novatel
   Millenium receiver over the same 24-hour period.  All three receivers
   are located at the WJH Technical Center in Atlantic City.  The third
   graph displays the number of GLONASS satellites at each second over the
   24-hour period.

   [BS00981_.gif] North Position Error - Displays the north position error
   using both GLONASS and GPS satellites tracked by the Ashtech GG24
   receiver or a 3S Navigation R100 receiver over a 24-hour period and the
   north position error using just GPS satellites tracked by the Novatel
   Millenium receiver over the same 24-hour period.  All three receivers
   are located at the WJH Technical Center in Atlantic City.  The third
   graph displays the number of GLONASS satellites at each second over the
   24-hour period.

   [BS00981_.gif] Horizontal Position Error  - Displays a scatter plot of
   the horizontal position error using GLONASS and GPS satellites tracked
   by the Ashtech GG24 receiver or a 3S Navigation R100 receiver over a
   24-hour period and GPS satellites tracked by the Novatel Millenium
   receiver over the same 24-hour period.  All three receivers are located
   at the WJH Technical Center in Atlantic City.  The third graph displays
   the number of GLONASS satellites at each second over the 24-hour
   period.


   PAN Report - The Performance Analysis (PAN) Report is issued
   quarterly.  It contains GPS SPS performance data and also has a section
   on GPS/GLONASS performance on data collected for the quarter.  The next
   PAN report will be posted on 31 October  2000.
