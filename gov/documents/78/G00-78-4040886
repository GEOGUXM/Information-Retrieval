   Questions/Comments
   The Sealed Bid sale is held whenever the property is attractive to a
   widely dispersed market. It requires a written mail-in bid and can be
   used to sell virtually any type of property, from heavy equipment to
   computers.

   The Invitation for Bid (IFB) may be viewed below by clicking on the
   Sealed Bid Sale Number. The IFB contains item descriptions, sale terms
   and conditions, item inspection times and location, and a bid form. If
   you decide to bid, fill out the bid form and hand carry or mail it to
   the address listed on the IFB. Your bid must be received by the bid
   opening date and time specified in the IFB. Late bids are not accepted
   under any circumstances. Successful bidders must pay for and remove the
   property in the specified number of days or be charged a penalty.
