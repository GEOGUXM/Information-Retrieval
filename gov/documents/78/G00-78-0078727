   The idea of democracy is inextricably linked to the national identity
   of the United States. Even during the most isolationist periods in our
   early history, our relatively young country was seen as a shining
   beacon to individuals and families seeking personal freedoms.
   Today the world is a much smaller place, and its problems confront us
   in more immediate ways. The United States is vigorously engaged in all
   corners of the globe, acting as a force for peace and prosperity.
   Expanding the global community of democracies is a key objective of
   U.S. foreign policy.
   As the primary channel for U.S. foreign assistance in the developing
   world, USAID has taken a leading role in promoting and consolidating
   democracy worldwide. Expanding democracy improves individual
   opportunity for prosperity and improved well-being, thus contributing
   to the more traditional goals of the Agency.
