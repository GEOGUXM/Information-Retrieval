                              January 24, 2002

                 Senate Passes Resolution Honoring Adoption
                            Advocate Dave Thomas

            Senator Clinton Praises Thomas' Commitment to Helping
                    Children Find Permanent, Loving Homes

   Washington, DC - The Senate passed a bipartisan resolution Senator
   Hillary Rodham Clinton (NY) helped to introduce to pay tribute to
   Wendy's founder and adoption advocate Dave Thomas. The resolution,
   which recognizes Thomas' outstanding contributions to finding permanent
   homes for children waiting to be adopted, passed the Senate by
   unanimous consent last night.

   For over ten years, Dave Thomas served as a spokesperson for various
   White House adoption and foster care initiatives. In 1992, he founded
   the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption to raise awareness about the
   need to find permanent homes for children awaiting adoption and to
   direct support to organizations that aid them. He also founded the Dave
   Thomas Center for Adoption Law. Thomas himself was an adopted child.

   "Though well known as the founder of Wendy's, Dave Thomas also left a
   profound mark on our society through his charitable works. I had the
   great pleasure of working with him over the years to strengthen our
   nation's foster care system and advance the cause of adoption," Senator
   Clinton said. "I am so pleased that the Senate passed this resolution
   today honoring the life of a tireless advocate and altruistic business
   leader."

   Senator Carl Levin (MI) introduced the resolution and Senators Charles
   Grassley (IA), Max Baucus (MT), Mary Landrieu (LA), George Voinovich
   (OH), Jay Rockefeller (WV) and Jesse Helms (NC) are among its
   cosponsors.

   "I have always admired Dave Thomas' untiring commitment to the idea
   that every child deserves a permanent, loving home -- a commitment that
   led to the establishment of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
   His vision, leadership and generous spirit have touched countless lives
   and will continue to serve as an inspiration to all of us," Senator
   Clinton said.
