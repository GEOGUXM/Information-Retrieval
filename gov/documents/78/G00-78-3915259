                  Remote Automatic FTP Authentication to HPSS

   The primary way files are transferred between NERSC's HPSS and remote
   systems (outside the NERSC domain) is via the ftp protocol. Ftp
   authentication is insecure because usernames and passwords are sent in
   plain text across the internet.

   In an effort to help protect its users' data, NERSC has developed a
   more secure method of remote automatic authentication to HPSS. Your
   username and password are still sent in plain text across the internet,
   but they are now sent in an encrypted form linked to a site. If you ssh
   into the authentication server from Brookhaven and encrypt your
   username/password combo, you can only use this combo from machines on
   the Brookhaven network. If you are coming from a NERSC machine, e.g.,
   Killeen, you will need to generate a different combo.

   Additional security is provided because it is now more difficult for
   potential hackers to gain access to your HPSS account even if your
   special username and password are sniffed over the internet.

  Overview

   The process described here requires the use of two windows (xterms are
   recommended) on the machine from which access to HPSS is desired. (In
   the example to follow, this machine is named "highline".) Special
   encrypted username/password strings (called "identity strings" below)
   are generated and put into a file named ".netrc".

   Please note:
     * The encrypted identity strings can be inserted in .netrc files, or
       entered manually (either directly in interactive ftp sessions or
       edited into ftp "here-docs" in shell scripts). They can also be
       used in ftp access via web browsers.
     * On PC's, GUI-based ftp clients may not use .netrc files; thus, the
       encrypted strings must be entered manually.
     * An HPSS user can generate multiple encrypted identities for use on
       different machines. For example, you will need an identity string
       for your workstation in your office and another one for access from
       the NERSC supercomputers. Other combinations may be necessary
       depending on the topology of your network.
     * Encrypted identity strings generated on a particular workstation
       can be used in accessing all NERSC Production Mass Storage systems
       from that workstation.
     * You can use the encrypted identity strings as often as you want. At
       any time, you can re-generate a new encrypted identity string.
     * This procedure does not prevent the use of ftp with your usual
       NERSC HPSS login and password. However, that may change in the
       future.

  Generating and Using Encrypted Identity Information

   In the following steps, all text the user must type is shown in red.

   Step 1: In a window (xterm) on your workstation, connect via ssh to
   "auth.nersc.gov"; For the login name and password, load the module
   "www" on any major NERSC system.

   highline 10: ssh -l auth auth.nersc.gov auth@mover2.nersc.gov's
   password: Last login: Thu Mar 15 15:29:38 2001 from highline.lbl.gov

   ***********************************************************************
   You are in an authentication shell Type help to list the commands you
   can run [auth]:

   Now you are in a restricted shell that will accept only a few commands.
   Among them is "ftppass", which will be used in step 2. You can see the
   allowed commands via the "help" command:

   [auth]: help The following commands are the only ones recognized:
   ftppass chpass help h quit q exit For abbreviated help on commands type
   'help commandname' The commands: q, quit and exit will all exit auth
   [auth]:

   Step 2: Use the "ftppass" command to generate an encrypted identity
   combo of you HPSS username and password; these will be used to access
   ftp instead of your usual HPSS login id and password.

   [auth]: ftppass DCE Principal: your_HPSS_username DCE Password:
   your_HPSS_password login [encrypted string] password [encrypted string]
   [auth]: exit Bye Connection to auth.nersc.gov closed.

   The encrypted identity strings are those returned in the lines
   beginning with "login" and "password"; these lines will be used in step
   3.

   Step 3: In another window (xterm) on your workstation, edit a file
   named "~/.netrc", and insert three lines for each of the storage
   systems you wish to connect to:

    a. the first of the three lines specifies the name of a storage
       system;
    b. the next two lines are the "login" and "password" lines returned by
       storage_auth, in step 2. The easiest thing to do is to copy and
       paste the two identity lines into this file. The file's contents
       should look something like this:

       machine hpss.nersc.gov login = [encrypted string] password [encrypted
       string] machine archive.nersc.gov login = [encrypted string] password
       [encrypted string]
       Save the file.

   Step 4: Change the permissions for the ".netrc" file to "600
   " or "Owner Read-Write"; if they are anything else, the file will not
   be used by ftp and the process will not work:

   highline 9: chmod 600 .netrc highline 10: ls -l .netrc -rw------- 1
   user staff 75 Mar 16 10:03 .netrc

   This completes the generation of an encrypted identity. Now, whenever
   ftp is used by this user from this workstation to connect to either of
   the HPSS systems, the encrypted identity strings in the ".netrc" file
   will provide authentication, as shown in the next step.

   Step 5: Connect to one of the HPSS systems via FTP from the workstation
   that was used in the previous steps. For example:

   highline 11: ftp hpss.nersc.gov Connected to hpss-g0.nersc.gov.
