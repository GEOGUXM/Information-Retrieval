      EAS Logo Welcome to the Emergency Alert System (EAS) page. The EAS
      system was established by the FCC in November of 1994 with the approval
      of Part 11 EAS rules. The EAS replaced the Emergency Broadcast System
      (EBS) as a tool the President and others may use to warn the public
      about emergency situations.
