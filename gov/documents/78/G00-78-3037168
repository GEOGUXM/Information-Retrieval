   [SHARP-B01] NASA Ames, in conjunction with small companies, has been
   developing new Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs). We believe the
   UHTCs will enable sharp leading edges for space vehicles. We have
   successfully tested these materials in the ground-based arc jet
   facilities, and the first flight demonstration is scheduled for May,
   1997. We are working with Sandia National Laboratory and the U.S. Air
   Force to integrate a UHTC nosetip onto a reentry vehicle.

   SHARP leading edge designs will have reduced drag, reducing cost to
   orbit; high L/D which may enable global cross-range capability; and may
   eliminate the communications blackout period.
   [Crucial Data Points]

   The test objectives of the May 1997 SHARP-B01 flight will be to
   demonstrate the non-ablating performance of the 3D UHTC "sharp" nosetip
   by performing a ballistic entry through the aerothermal performance
   constraint, and to correlate ground based sensors with flight sensors
   to characterize the material performance.

      See a more detailed discussion of high-temperature TPS design and
                                optimization.
