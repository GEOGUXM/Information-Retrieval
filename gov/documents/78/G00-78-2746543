 History of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Members Who
                           Have Served As Chairman
       _______________________________________________________________

   The current Committee on Education and the Workforce was established on
   January 7, 1997. The Committee's basic jurisdiction is over education
   and labor matters generally. While Congress has been concerned over
   education and labor issues since its beginning, attempts to create a
   Committee with jurisdiction over education and labor failed in early
   Congresses due to Representatives' concern over the constitutional
   grounds for such a federal role and the belief that education was more
   properly the responsibility of the States.

   The first Committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Education and
   Labor was established on March 21, 1867 in the aftermath of the Civil
   War and the growth of American industry. On December 19, 1883, the
   Committee on Education and Labor was divided into two standing
   committees: Committee on Education and Committee on Labor. On January
   2, 1947, the Legislative Reorganization Act again combined the
   Committees, renamed the Committee on Education and Labor. On January 4,
   1995, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Economic and
   Educational Opportunities. On January 7, 1997, the Committee was
   renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce.

   The Committee is composed of 49 Members of the House of
   Representatives, 27 Members are from the Republican party and 22
   Members are from the Democrat party. The Members are chosen to serve on
   the Committee by their respective party caucus.
