   Supercomputers of the future will run on chips containing "cells".
   Combining protein science research at ORNL with cellular architecture
   design research of IBM, scientists are developing processors that
   contain memory and communications circuits. This will enhance computer
   performance to 1,000 trillion calculations per second (petaflops)
   instead of the 1 trillion (teraflops) they can perform today. Go to
