                 Interagency Public Minerals Data for Alaska

                              Pooling Resources

   Recent budget and personnel reductions within Federal and State
   agencies in Alaska have increased the need to coordinate
   minerals-related activities. An Interagency Minerals Coordinating Group
   is identifying cooperative ventures which allow the expedition,
   production, and dissemination of minerals data. The group includes
   representatives from --

                  (ADGGS),
     [bullet.gif] Bureau of Land Management (BLM),
     [bullet.gif] USDA, Forest Service (FS), and the
     [bullet.gif] Geological Survey (USGS).

     This effort mutually benefits the agencies and the general public.

   An important project underway by the Interagency Minerals Coordinating
     Group is a Digital Index of Geologic Information for Alaska, which
      combines public information produced by each of the coordinating
     agencies. First, the agencies are preparing a combined database for
      geologic publications in Alaska. The Index will expand during the
   five-year program to include a vast array of information and citations
    for geochemical, geophysical, mineral assessment, and economic data.

      The Coordinating Group's aim is to increase the dissemination of
   Alaskan mineral information in accessible formats. The Digital Index of
     Geologic Information will be available on the Internet, and will be
                       searchable by quadrangle name.

   Cooperative Projects

   The Coordinating Group has proposed a five-year plan for cooperative
   projects. The list of projects will be reviewed annually by the
   agencies and by other Alaska user groups.

   A common thread among Coordinating Group members is the collection of
   mineral-resource information which they use or provide to others such
   as policy makers, local governments, land managers, and the private
   sector. To increase their ability to collect and disseminate
   mineral-resource information, the Coordinating Group is targeting areas
   of cooperation in the following categories:

   field activities

   [bullet.gif] geologic mapping
   [bullet.gif] topical mineral studies
   [bullet.gif] other types of data gathering, including geophysical and
                geochemical studies

   data production

   [bullet.gif] compilation of existing data
   [bullet.gif] new data acquisition
   [bullet.gif] data synthesis and analysis
   [bullet.gif] data archival and storage
   [bullet.gif] information dissemination

   Data at risk?

   In the Fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Bill, Congress asked the U.S.
   Geological Survey to take the lead in inventorying the acquisition,
   storage, and accessibility of minerals data in Alaska. The inventory is
   due March 31, 1997. All interested user groups are asked for input. For
   further information, contact Don Grybeck at the USGS office in
   Anchorage: (907)-786-7424 or by e-mail (dgrybeck@usgs.gov).

   What happened to the U.S. Bureau of Mines?

   In 1995, the U.S. Bureau of Mines was eliminated as an agency. In
   Alaska, remaining programs, personnel, and property were transferred to
   the Bureau of Land Management. Active participation in the Interagency
   Minerals Coordinating Group and a vigorous field program for 1997
   signify BLM's good faith in continuing investigations of the mineral
   development potential on Alaska public lands. [spacer.gif]
