   Overview
   The National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) is a
   partnership effort to: 1) develop performance standards for public
   health practice as defined by the Essential Services of Public Health,
   2) collect and analyze performance data, and 3) improve system-wide
   performance. Comprehensive performance measurement tools for the
   assessment of public health practice at both the state and local levels
   are being designed in partnership with other national public health
   organizations. Additionally, a surveillance instrument has been
   prepared as a rapid assessment tool to provide local, state, and
   federal public health officials with a snapshot of local public health
   capacity and performance.
