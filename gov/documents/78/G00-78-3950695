   Who We Are
   Overview Cheapest Money Around
   The Washington Economic Development Finance Authority (WEDFA) is an
   independent agency within the executive branch of state government,
   created by the legislature to ...develop innovative approaches to the
   problem of unmet capital needs  for small and medium-sized businesses
   in the state.

    WEDFA has the authority to issue nonrecourse economic development
   bonds on both a taxable and tax-exempt basis in support of qualifying
   projects - manufacturing and processing facilities and projects
   categorized as exempt facilities under federal tax law.  These may
   include wastewater, solid waste disposal, mass commuting, and some
   types of recycling and cogeneration projects.  WEDFA cannot assist
   retail projects.

   The Authority is staffed by an Executive Director and has a seventeen
   member board chaired by Scott Hardman, investment banker with Alexander
   Hutton, Inc.

   There is no governmental financial support, either direct or indirect,
   for WEDFA bonds.  Payment of principal and interest is solely the
   responsibility of the borrowing company.  The ability to borrow at
   tax-exempt rates makes this type of financing very attractive,
   however.  The all-in annual borrowing cost for companies in the past
   has averaged several percent below prime!

    WEDFA is not supported by government funding in any way; the Authority
   is prohibited by statute from receiving any appropriation of state
   funds.  WEDFA is solely dependent upon fee income derived from its bond
   issuance programs to pay all its staffing and other operational
   expenses.

    "WEDFA not only assists Washington businesses; WEDFA is a Washington
                                 business!"
