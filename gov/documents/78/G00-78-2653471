   The mission of the Commission is to identify, analyze, and develop

   In order to achieve this mission, the Commission should consider

          + the validity of neighborhoods and neighborhood services;
          + the economy, economic development, and jobs;
          + education, health care, crime, and safety policies; and
          + the interplay between state, local, and federal housing
            policies and actions.
    2. Analyze existing federal, state, and local housing programs, and
       private sector delivery systems, and:
          + provide better housing opportunities for families,
            neighborhoods, and communities;
          + find ways to increase the role of the private sector in
            providing affordable housing;
          + explore overlaps with other federal initiatives in the areas
            of tax policy, health care, education, and public safety;
          + examine the housing finance system;
          + explore the links between federal, state, and local housing
            mechanisms;
          + and review the importance and opportunities of evolving
            technologies.
    3. Develop specific recommendations including legislative and / or
       regulatory initiatives, especially focused at the federal level,
       but including linkages between federal activities and action at the
