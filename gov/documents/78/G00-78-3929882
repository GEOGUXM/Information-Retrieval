   The mission of the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) is to anticipate
   the science and technology that will be needed by the nation's
   operational atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic forecasting services
   in the next five to ten years. After researching and developing new
   observing and forecasting systems, FSL transfers those technologies to
   operational users such as the National Weather Service (NWS), other
   government agencies (e.g. U.S. Air Force and the FAA), the commercial
   and general aviation communities, foreign weather forecasting services,
   and other private interests.
   The Laboratory's essential functions are:

   [bullet icon] Exploratory Systems Development. The rapid pace of
   technological change requires continuous, exploratory systems
   development by FSL. In cooperation with operations specialists, FSL
   first developed and now continuously upgrades forecasting software,
   called AWIPS, used by the National Weather Service. It is also
   investigating the use of the Linux operating system, high speed
   networks, and PC technology to make forecasting even more efficient and
   effective. Other systems under development include FX-Net and the World
   Wide Web Workstation which are inexpensive, scaled-down, forecast
   workstation systems using the Internet, more easily used for training,
   education, fire weather, and other special applications such as the
   Olympic Games.

   [bullet icon] Research Applications. Research conducted by FSL seeks to
   capitalize on an improved understanding of the atmosphere-land-ocean
   environment to develop better techniques for observations, data
   assimilation, and operational forecast models. FSL operates
   demonstration wind profilers, is developing a new technique for
   recovery of water vapor using GPS, and continues to design future
   observing systems using balloons and automated aircraft. Data received
   from satellites, radar, and other operational observing systems are
   used in many different operational forecast models. Along with other
   participants, FSL is currently working on development of the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a very high-resolution mesoscale
   model designed to serve both the research and operational forecasting
   communities. Supercomputing by FSL's massively parallel processor,
   named Jet, will be instrumental in developing and testing the WRF
   model, and also in the development of the North American Observing
   System (NAOS). In determining what observing systems should be part of
   NAOS, an extraordinary amount of computer processing is necessary to
   run models repeatedly with different inputs simulating the different
   composites of the observing system.

   [bullet icon] System Validation. Before new technologies can be
   transferred to operational services, FSL uses real-time and archived
   data to test and evaluate new diagnostic and forecasting techniques and
   new hardware and software technologies.

   [bullet icon] Technology Transfer. After the quality assurance process,
   FSL works directly with users to transfer technology improvements to
   operational use, as well as to users of environmental information and
   prediction systems.
