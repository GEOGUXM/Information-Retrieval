                         Finding Military Personnel

    | Military Locator Service | Army | Navy | Air Force | Marine Corps |

                            Department of State|

   The following list of Federal agencies and private organizations assist
   individuals in locating persons of unknown whereabouts. The Privacy Act
   of 1974 prohibits Federal agencies from providing the home addresses or
   telephone numbers of individuals without their written permission. Keep
   this in mind before beginning your search. In most cases, the agency or
   organization will only agree to let the person know you are trying to
   locate them. They may also agree to forward a letter written by you to
   the person that you are trying to locate. Be sure to include the
   appropriate first class postage with the letter to the locator service.
   It will be up to the individual to respond.

   Of course if you suspect the person you are unable to locate has been
   the victim of a crime, you should immediately contact your closest law
   enforcement agency.

   Military Locator Services

   This information can help you to locate active, reserve, and retired
   Department of Defense (DOD) military personnel.

   Each of the four branches of the military has separate procedures for
   contacting active or past service members. In cases of emergency,
   immediate family members should contact the local chapter of the
   American Red Cross. The telephone number and address are available from
   your local telephone directory, directory assistance, or by calling our
   National Contact Center toll-free at 800-688-9889, Monday through
   Friday, from 9a.m. to 8p.m., eastern time.

   Provide as much identifying information as possible about the person
   you wish to locate, such as full name, rank, last duty assignment/last
   known military address, service number, and Social Security number.

   The locator service is free to immediate family members and Federal and
   State government officials. Other family members, civilian friends,
   businesses, or any others must pay a non-refundable fee of $3.50 in the
   form of a check or money order made payable to the U.S. Treasury.

   Locating Private Individuals

   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration,
   and the Salvation Army can assist you in locating individuals here in
   the United States. The Department of States American Citizens Service
   Abroad can assist you in locating relatives or friends living or
   visiting abroad and who are U.S. citizens.

   Please review the policies and guidelines for each agency/organization
   below:

   Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

   The IRS may forward a letter to someone when humane reasons are
   involved. For example:

     To notify someone of a serious illness, imminent death, or death of
     a close relative,
     To seek an individual for a medical study to detect and treat
     medical defects, or
     To notify an individual who cannot otherwise be located that he or
     she is entitled to certain assets.
     The IRS will forward a letter from an attorney, estate
     administrator, or other person who directly controls the assets.

   For more information and clarification as to what may constitute
   "humane" reasons, you may refer to the IRS Handbook 1.3, Chapter 11,
   which you may find in Other Information Available to the Public.

   If you would like the IRS to help you locate an individual, place a
   personal letter addressed to the individual in a blank envelope.
   Include first class U.S. postage, and do not seal the letter. Place the
   unsealed letter in another envelope and address it as follows:

          Internal Revenue Service
          Office of Disclosure Operations
          1111 Constitution Avenue NW
          Washington, DC 20224

   Image linking to top of page Social Security Administration

   The Social Security Administration will attempt to forward a letter to
   a missing person for reasons similar to those mentioned in the IRS
   section above. There is a $3.00 charge for forwarding letters to inform
   persons about money or property they may be owed. Humanitarian letters
   are forwarded free of charge.

   Follow the same guidelines for sending a letter, and address it as
   follows:

          Social Security Administration
          Office of Public Inquiries
          6401 Security Blvd.
          Baltimore, Maryland 21235

   The Salvation Army has operated a Family Tracing Service since 1885.
   The service is designed to help people reestablish contact with close
   relatives they may have lost touch with a few years ago or many years
   ago. The service is available in many of the 100 countries where the
   Salvation Army is located.

   The Salvation Army will not help to locate someone in the following
   instances:
     * Friends
     * Situations where adoptions have taken place
     * Alleged fathers of non-marital children
     * Young people under 17 years of age
     * Former husbands or wives
     * Spouses for divorce purposes
     * Estate or similar business matters

   From the United States, you may contact the Salvation Army Territory
   Office for your state. Local Salvation Army office numbers are listed
   in your local telephone directory. You may also contact them to begin
   your search.

   a Privacy Act waiver before information about them is released to a
   third party.

   whereabouts of U.S. citizens abroad by calling the Overseas Citizens
