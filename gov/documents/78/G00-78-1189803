   HTML Format   HTML File Format

   HTML is the standard file format for most web pages.   All that is
   needed to view an HTML file is a standard web browser such as the one
   you are using to read this page.  HTML is the best file choice when you
   just want to quickly view a file online in your browser.  It loads more
   quickly than PDF and WORD in most cases, and you don't need any
   additional software to view HTML files.  An HTML file would not be the
   best choice when you want to print the content being viewed on your
   screen.  If you want to print a particular document, look to see if a
   PDF or WORD version is available.  Look at the file descriptions below
   for more details on the other file types.

   Adobe Acrobat PDF Format   PDF File Format

   The PDF file format is the best choice for printing reports and other
   documents, viewing graphically intensive documents, and observing
   documents in their original format.  You must have the free Adobe
   Acrobat Reader installed on your PC to view PDF documents.  PDF is a
   very common format for viewing documents on the Internet so installing
   the Acrobat Reader will be useful on other websites as well.   To
   download the Acrobat Reader or to find out more about the product,
   click on the Adobe icon below...
   Get Adobe Acrobat Reader

   Microsoft Word Format   Microsoft WORD File Format

   The Microsoft Word Document format (.DOC) is the file format for all of
   the available documents and reports on our site written in Microsoft
   Word.  You must have either have Microsoft Word or the free Microsoft
   Word Viewer installed on your PC to view MS Word files.  If you don't
   have either installed, you can also download (save) the Word file to
   your PC and either take it to a PC that has Word or try and open it in
   your word processor for conversion.  To downloard the Microsoft Word
   Viewer or to find out more about the product, click on the Microsoft
   icon below...
   Get Microsoft Word Viewer
