                          Basic Service Requirement

   The basic requirement for a regular employee annuity is 120 months (10
   years) of creditable railroad service. Service months need not be
   consecutive, and in some cases military service may be counted as
   railroad service.
   Credit for a month of railroad service is given for every month in
   which an employee had some compensated service for an employer covered
   by the Railroad Retirement Act, even if only one day's service is
   performed in the month. (However, local lodge compensation earned after
   1974 is disregarded for any calendar month in which it is less than
   $25.) Under certain circumstances, additional months of service may be
   deemed.
   Covered employers include railroads engaged in interstate commerce and
   certain of their subsidiaries, railroad associations and national
   railway labor organizations.
   Railroad retirement benefits are based on months of service and
   earnings credits. Earnings are creditable up to certain annual maximums
   on the amount of compensation subject to railroad retirement taxes.

           Age and Service, Disability and Supplemental Annuities

   An AGE AND SERVICE ANNUITY can be paid to:
   Employees with 30 or more years of service. They are eligible for
   regular annuities based on age and service the first full month they
   are age 60. Early retirement reductions are applied to annuities
   awarded before age 62.
   Employees with 10 to 29 years of creditable service. They are eligible
   for regular annuities based on age and service the first full month
   they are age 62. Early retirement annuity reductions are applied to
   annuities awarded before full retirement age--the age at which an
   employee can receive full benefits with no reduction for early
   retirement. This ranges from age 65 for those born before 1938 to age
   67 for those born in 1960 or later, the same as under social security.
   Reduced annuities are still payable at age 62 but the maximum reduction
   will be 30% rather than 20% by the year 2022. Part of an annuity is not
   reduced beyond 20% if the employee had any creditable railroad service
   before August 12, 1983. These reductions do not affect those who retire
   at age 62 with 30 years' service but will affect those who retire at
   ages 60-61.
   Click here for a detailed explanation of age reductions.
   An annuity based on age cannot be paid until the employee stops
   railroad employment, files an application and gives up any rights to
   return to work for a railroad employer.
   A DISABILITY ANNUITY can be paid for:
   Total disability, at any age, if an employee is permanently disabled
   for all regular work and has at least 10 years (120 months) of
   creditable railroad service.
   Occupational disability, at age 60, if an employee has at least 10
   years of railroad service or at any age if the employee has at least 20
   years (240 months) of service, when the employee is permanently
   disabled for his or her regular railroad occupation. A “current
   connection” with the railroad industry is also required for an annuity
   based on occupational, rather than total, disability.
   A five-month waiting period beginning with the month after the month of
   the onset of disability is required before any disability annuity
   payments can begin.
   While an annuity based on disability is not paid until an employee has
   stopped working for a railroad, employment rights need not be
   relinquished until the employee attains full retirement age. However,
   in order for a supplemental annuity to be paid by the Board, or for an
   eligible spouse to begin receiving annuity payments, a disabled
   annuitant under full retirement age must relinquish employment rights.
   A SUPPLEMENTAL ANNUITY can be paid at:
   Age 60, if the employee has at least 30 years of creditable railroad
   service.
   Age 65, if the employee has 25-29 years of railroad service.
   In addition to the service requirements, a “current connection” with
   the railroad industry is required for all supplemental annuities.
   Eligibility is further limited to employees who had some rail service
   before October 1981.

                       Current Connection Requirement

   An employee who worked for a railroad in at least 12 months in the 30
   months immediately preceding the month his or her railroad retirement
   annuity begins will meet the current connection requirement for a
   supplemental annuity, occupational disability annuity or the survivor
   benefits described later in this booklet. (If the employee died before
   retirement, railroad service in at least 12 months in the 30 months
   before death will meet the current connection requirement for the
   purpose of paying survivor benefits.)
   If an employee does not qualify on this basis, but has 12 months’
   service in an earlier 30-month period, he or she may still meet the
   current connection requirement. This alternative generally applies if
   the employee did not have any regular employment outside the railroad
   industry after the end of the last 30-month period which included 12
   months of railroad service and before the month the annuity begins or
   the date of death. Full or part-time work for a nonrailroad employer in
   the interval between the end of the last 30-month period including 12
   months of railroad service and the beginning date of an employee's
   annuity, or the date of death if earlier, can break a current
   connection.
   Self-employment in an unincorporated business will not break a current
   connection; however, self-employment can break a current connection if
   the business is incorporated.
   Working for certain U.S. Government agencies--Department of
   Transportation, National Transportation Safety Board, Surface
   Transportation Board (the former Interstate Commerce Commission),
   National Mediation Board, Railroad Retirement Board--will not break a
   current connection. Neither State employment with the Alaska Railroad,
   so long as that railroad remains an entity of the State of Alaska, nor
   non-creditable Canadian railroad service will break a current
   connection.
   A current connection can also be maintained, for purposes of
   supplemental and survivor annuities, if the employee completed 25 years
   of railroad service, was involuntarily terminated without fault from
   the railroad industry, and did not thereafter decline an offer of
   employment in the same class or craft in the railroad industry,
   regardless of the distance to the new position. A termination of
   railroad service is considered voluntary unless there was no choice
   available to the individual to remain in service. Generally, where an
   employee has no option to remain in the service of his or her employer,
   the termination of the employment is considered involuntary, regardless
   of whether the employee does or does not receive a separation
   allowance. However, each case is decided by the Board on an individual
   basis. This exception to the normal current connection requirements
   became effective October 1, 1981, but only for employees still living
   on that date who left the rail industry on or after October 1, 1975, or
   who were on leave of absence, on furlough, or absent due to injury on
   October 1, 1975.
   Once a current connection is established at the time the railroad
   retirement annuity begins, an employee never loses it no matter what
   kind of work is performed thereafter.

                              Spouse Annuities

   The age requirements for a spouse annuity depend on the employee’s age
   and date of retirement and the employee’s years of railroad service.
   If a retired employee with 30 years of service is age 60, the
   employee’s spouse is also eligible for an annuity the first full month
   the spouse is age 60. Certain early retirement reductions are applied
   to the spouse annuity if the employee’s annuity begins before age 62,
   unless the employee attained age 60 and completed 30 years’ service
   prior to July 1, 1984. If a 30-year employee’s annuity begins at or
   after age 62, an age reduction is not applied to the spouse annuity
   even if the spouse retires at age 60 rather than age 62, unless the
   employee retired on the basis of disability.
   If a retired employee with 10-29 years of service is age 62 (or age 65
   if the employee’s annuity began before 1975), the employee’s spouse is
   also eligible for an annuity the first full month the spouse is age 62.
   Early retirement reductions are applied to the spouse annuity if the
   spouse retires prior to full retirement age. Full retirement age for a
   spouse is gradually rising from age 65 to age 67, just as for an
   employee, depending on the year of birth. Reduced benefits are still
   payable at age 62, but the maximum reduction will be 35% rather than
   25% by the year 2022. Part of a spouse annuity is not reduced beyond
   25% if the employee had any creditable railroad service before August
   12, 1983.
   A spouse of an employee receiving an age and service annuity (or a
   spouse of a disability annuitant who is otherwise eligible for an age
   and service annuity) is eligible for a spouse annuity at any age if
   caring for the employee's unmarried child, and the child is under age
   18 or the child became disabled before age 22.

   The employee must have been married to the spouse for at least one
   year, unless the spouse is the natural parent of their child, the
   spouse was eligible or potentially eligible for a railroad retirement
   widow(er)’s, parent’s or disabled child’s annuity in the month before
   marrying the employee or the spouse was previously married to the
   employee and received a spouse annuity. However, entitlement to a
   surviving divorced spouse, surviving divorced young mother(father), or
   remarried widow(er) annuity does not waive the one-year marriage
   requirement.
   An annuity may also be payable to the divorced wife or husband of a
   retired employee if their marriage lasted for at least 10 years, both
   have attained age 62 for a full month and the divorced spouse is not
   currently married. The amount of a divorced spouse’s annuity is, in
   effect, equal to what social security would pay in the same situation
   and therefore less than the amount of the spouse annuity otherwise
   payable.

                    Employee and Spouse Annuity Estimates

   Because of the complexities of the railroad retirement laws and the
   need for lifetime earnings records, it is generally not practical for
   an employee to attempt to estimate his or her own regular annuity or
   the annuity of the spouse. Employees who want estimates should contact
   the nearest field office of the Railroad Retirement Board for
   approximate figures. Each Board field office can furnish estimates for
   employees with at least 10 years of railroad service.

     less than 30 years.

   The maximum total benefit payable by the Board to an employee and
   spouse is $4,550 in 2001.

                    Two-tier Annuities and Dual Benefits

   Regular railroad retirement annuities are calculated under a two-tier
   formula. The annuity formula components for employees and spouses are
   described in the section on formulas.
   The first tier is based on railroad retirement credits and any social
   security credits an employee has acquired. The amount of the first tier
   is calculated using social security formulas, but with railroad
   retirement age and service requirements.
   The second tier is based on railroad retirement credits only, and may
   be compared to the retirement benefits paid over and above social
   security benefits to workers in other industries.
   An additional amount may also be payable as part of the regular annuity
   if an employee qualified for both railroad retirement and social
   security benefits before 1975 and met certain vesting requirements.
   Employees with Railroad Retirement and
   Social Security Benefits
   Since 1975, if a retired or disabled railroad retirement annuitant is
   also awarded social security benefits, the Social Security
   Administration determines the amount due, but a combined monthly dual
   benefit payment is issued by the Railroad Retirement Board.
   The tier I portion of an employee annuity is based on his or her
   combined railroad retirement and social security credits, figured under
   social security formulas, and approximates what social security would
   pay if railroad work were covered by that system. It is reduced by the
   amount of any actual social security benefit paid on the basis of the
   employee’s nonrailroad employment in order to prevent a duplication of
   benefits based on social security covered earnings. The tier I amount
   is also reduced in the event a social security benefit is payable to
   the employee on the basis of another person’s earnings. This reduction
   follows principles of social security law which, in effect, limit
   payment to the higher of any two or more benefits payable to an
   individual at one time. An annuitant is required to advise the Railroad
   Retirement Board if any benefits are received directly from the Social
   Security Administration or if those benefits increase.
   If an employee qualified for dual benefits before 1975 and met certain
   vesting requirements, he or she can receive an additional annuity
   amount, which offsets, in part, the dual benefit reduction. This
   additional amount, which reflects the dual benefits payable prior to
   1975, is called the vested dual benefit payment.
   Requirements for vested dual benefits.--Employees who worked for a
   railroad in 1974 and retired after 1974 are considered vested if on
   December 31, 1974, they had both at least 10 years of railroad service
   and sufficient quarters of coverage to qualify for a social security
   retirement benefit at age 62. Employees qualified on this basis are
   eligible for vested dual benefit amounts computed on their railroad and
   social security credits through December 31, 1974.
   Employees who did not work for a railroad in 1974 but had 25 or more
   years of railroad service before 1975 or employees with 10 years of
   railroad service before 1975 who had either a current connection with
   the railroad industry on December 31, 1974, or at the time their
   annuities began are also considered vested under the same conditions as
   persons who were railroad employees in 1974.
   Other employees who completed 10 or more years of railroad service
   before 1975 but left the industry before 1974 are considered vested
   only if they had sufficient social security quarters of coverage to
   qualify for a social security retirement benefit as of the end of the
   year before 1974 in which they left the railroad industry. Their vested
   dual benefit amount is based only on credits acquired through their
   last year of pre-1975 railroad service instead of through December 31,
   1974.
   Employees who do not qualify for a vested dual benefit may be eligible
   for a refund of any excess social security taxes they paid.
   Limitations on vested dual benefits.--Vested dual benefit payments are
   funded by annual appropriations from general U.S. Treasury revenues,
   rather than the railroad retirement payroll taxes and other revenues
   that finance about 98% of the railroad retirement system’s benefit
   payments.
   Payment of these vested dual benefits is dependent on the time and
   amount of such appropriations. If the appropriation in a fiscal year is
   for less than the estimated total vested dual benefit payments,
   individual payments must be reduced.
   Employees with Public, Non-profit or Foreign Pensions
   For employees first eligible for a railroad retirement annuity and a
   Federal, State or local government pension after 1985, there may be a
   reduction in the tier I amount for receipt of a public pension based,
   in part or in whole, on employment not covered by social security or
   railroad retirement after 1956. This may also apply to certain other
   payments not covered by railroad retirement or social security, such as
   from a non-profit organization or from a foreign government or a
   foreign employer, but it does not include military service pensions,
   payments by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or certain benefits
   payable by a foreign government as a result of a totalization agreement
   between that government and the United States.
   Workers’ Compensation

   If an employee is receiving a disability annuity, the tier I portion
   may, under certain circumstances, be reduced for receipt of workers’
   compensation or public disability benefits.
   If an annuitant becomes entitled to any pensions or benefits as
   described above, the Board must be notified immediately.

                         Spouses with Dual Benefits

   Social Security Benefits
   The tier I portion of a spouse annuity is reduced for any social
   security entitlement, regardless of whether the social security benefit
   is based on the spouse's own earnings, the employee's earnings or the
   earnings of another person. This reduction follows principles of social
   security law which, in effect, limit payment to the higher of any two
   or more benefits payable to an individual at one time.
   Public Pensions
   The tier I portion of a spouse annuity may also be reduced for receipt
   of any Federal, State or local pension separately payable to the spouse
   based on the spouse’s own earnings. The reduction generally does not
   apply if the employment on which the public pension is based was
   covered under the Social Security Act on the last day of public
   employment.*   Most military service pensions and payments from the
   Department of Veterans Affairs will not cause a reduction. For spouses
   subject to the public pension reduction, the tier I reduction is equal
   to 2/3 of the amount of the public pension.
   * A special rule applies to Federal employees who switch from the Civil
   Service Retirement System to the Federal Employees Retirement System.
   Employee Annuity
   If both the husband and wife are qualified railroad employees and
   either had some railroad service before 1975, both can receive separate
   railroad retirement employee and spouse annuities, without a full dual
   benefit reduction.
   If both the husband and wife started railroad employment after 1974,
   only the railroad retirement employee annuity or the spouse annuity,
   whichever he or she chooses, is payable.

             Minimum Guaranty for Employee and Spouse Annuities

   Under a special minimum guaranty provision, railroad families will not
   receive less in monthly benefits than they would have if railroad
   earnings were covered by social security rather than railroad
   retirement laws. This guaranty is intended to cover situations in which
   one or more members of a family would otherwise be eligible for a type
   of social security benefit which is not provided under the Railroad
   Retirement Act.
   For example, social security provides children's benefits when an
   employee is totally disabled, retired, or deceased. The Railroad
   Retirement Act only provides children’s benefits if the employee is
   deceased. Therefore, if a retired rail employee has children who would
   otherwise be eligible for a benefit under social security, the
   employee's annuity would be increased to reflect what social security
   would pay the family, unless the annuity is already more than that
   amount.

                         Railroad Retirement Maximum

   The law limits the total amount of monthly railroad retirement benefits
   payable to an employee and spouse at the time the employee’s annuity
   begins. This maximum is based on the highest two years of creditable
   railroad retirement or social security covered earnings in the 10-year
   period ending with the year the employee's annuity begins. The maximum
   reduction is generally applied at the time the employee’s and/or
   spouse’s annuity is initially awarded, and that reduced amount receives
   all applicable subsequent cost-of-living increases.

   The maximum may increase every year as the amounts of creditable
   earnings rise. Therefore, an employee with high recent earnings who is
   affected by the maximum can still gain larger benefits by continuing
   work after his or her earliest eligibility date.
   The maximum provision may also affect certain long-service employees as
   well as those with low or no earnings in the 10-year period ending with
   the year the employee’s annuity begins. An example of someone with low
   earnings could be an employee who accepted a separation allowance and
   then worked part-time social security covered jobs until retirement.
   Cases with no earnings could include Canadian employees whose coverage
   under the Railroad Retirement Act ceased after December 31, 1982, and
   who had no subsequent creditable earnings under the Railroad Retirement
   or Social Security Acts. Cases with no earnings could also include
   persons working in noncovered Federal jobs. (More information)
   Cost-of-living Increases in Employee and Spouse Retirement Benefits
   After retirement, the tier I portions of both employees’ and spouses’
   annuities are generally increased for higher living costs at the same
   time, and by the same percentage, as social security benefits. These
   increases, effective December 1 and included in the January payment,
   are triggered under both programs when the Consumer Price Index rises
   during the 12 months ending the previous September 30. Generally, if
   the Index increases by 5%, for example, the tier I portion increases by
   5%. Under certain circumstances, the increase can be based on average
   national wage increases rather than price increases.
   If an annuitant is receiving both railroad retirement and social
   security benefits, the increased tier I portion is reduced by the
   increased social security benefit.
   The tier II portions of retired employee and spouse annuities are
   normally increased annually by 32.5% of the increase in the Consumer
   Price Index.
   Tier II cost-of-living increases are generally payable at the same time
   as tier I cost-of-living increases. Vested dual benefit payments and
   supplemental annuities are not increased by these cost-of-living
   adjustments.

                          Working After Retirement

   Neither a regular annuity, a supplemental annuity nor a spouse annuity
   is payable for any month in which a retired employee works for a
   railroad employer, including labor organizations. However, earnings of
   less than $25 a month by a local lodge employee will not prevent
   payment of the annuity for that month.
   Retired employees and spouses who work for their last pre-retirement
   nonrailroad employer are subject to an earnings deduction. Such
   employment will reduce tier II benefits and supplemental annuity
   payments, which are not otherwise subject to earnings deductions, by $1
   for each $2 of compensation received, subject to a maximum reduction of
   50%.
   Retired employees and spouses who have not yet attained full social
   security retirement age, which ranges from age 65 for those born before
   1938 to age 67 for those born in 1960 or later, may also be subject to
   additional earnings deductions for any earnings outside the rail
   industry that exceed certain exempt amounts. The tier I and vested dual
   benefits of these employee and spouse annuities are subject to
   deductions if earnings exceed the exempt amounts applicable to social
   security beneficiaries. Prior to the calendar year in which full social
   security retirement age is attained, the deduction is $1 in benefits
   for every $2 of annual earnings exceeding an exempt amount ($10,680 in
   2001).
   If the employee or spouse has a tier I reduction for social security
   benefits, the tier I benefit is not reduced for excess earnings.
   In the first year in which an employee subject to these earnings
   deductions is both entitled to an annuity and has a non-work month, a
   full annuity can be paid for those months in which the employee had low
   earnings or did not have substantial self-employment, no matter what
   total earnings for the year were. A non-work month is one in which the
   employee neither earns over 1/12th of the annual exempt amount nor has
   substantial self-employment. Non-work months can be claimed in only one
   calendar year, which need not necessarily be the first year of
   entitlement.
   In the calendar year in which an individual attains full social
   security retirement age, deductions of $1 are made in tier I and vested
   dual benefits for every $3 earned in excess of an exempt amount
   ($25,000 in 2001), but only counting those earnings in the months prior
   to the month full retirement age is attained. These tier I and vested
   dual benefit deductions stop effective with the month full retirement
   age is attained.
   Earnings consist of all wages received for services rendered plus any
   net earnings from self-employment. Interest, dividends, certain rental
   income or income from stocks, bonds, or other investments are not
   generally considered earnings for this purpose.
   Annuitants under full retirement age who work after retirement and
   expect that their earnings for a year will be more than the annual
   exempt amount must promptly notify the Board and furnish an estimate of
   their expected earnings in order to prevent an overpayment and
   penalties. They should also notify the Board if their original estimate
   changes significantly.
   Retired employees and spouses who return to work for a railroad or for
   their last pre-retirement nonrailroad employer must notify the Board,
   regardless of earnings or age.
   A spouse benefit is subject to reductions not only for the spouse’s
   earnings, but also for the earnings of the employee, regardless of
   whether the earnings are from service for the last pre-retirement
   nonrailroad employer or other post-retirement employment.
   A spouse annuity is not payable for any month in which the employee’s
   annuity is not payable, or for any month in which the spouse works for
   a railroad employer or railroad union.
   Disability Annuities
   If an annuity is based on disability, there are certain work
   restrictions that can affect payment, depending on the amount of
   earnings. The annuity is not payable for any month in which the
   annuitant works for a railroad employer or railroad union. The annuity
   is not payable for any month in which the annuitant earns more than
   $400 in any employment or net self-employment, exclusive of
   work-related expenses. Withheld payments will be restored if earnings
   for the year are less than $5,000 after deduction of disability-related
   work expenses. Otherwise, the annuity is subject to a deduction of one
   month’s benefit for each multiple of $400 earned over $4,800 (the last
   $200 or more of earnings over $4,800 count as $400). Failure to report
   such earnings could involve a penalty charge.
   These disability work restrictions cease upon a disabled employee
   annuitant’s attainment of full retirement age when the annuitant
   becomes subject to the work and earnings restrictions applicable to
   employee annuities based on age and service. This transition is
   effective no earlier than full retirement age even if the annuitant had
   30 years of service.

   If a disabled annuitant works before full retirement age, this may also
   raise a question about the possibility of that individual’s recovery
   from disability, regardless of the amount of earnings. Consequently,
   any earnings must be reported promptly to avoid overpayments, which are
   recoverable by the Board and may also include penalties.

                             When Annuities Stop

   Payment of any annuity stops upon the annuitant's death, and the
   annuity is not payable for any day in the month of death.
   A disability annuity stops after the employee recovers from the
   disability; it can be reinstated if the disabling condition recurs
   within a specified period of time.
   A spouse annuity stops if the employee's annuity terminates, or the
   spouse annuity was based on caring for a child and the child is no
   longer under 18 or disabled or the child is no longer in the spouse's
   care. However, the spouse annuity may continue if she or he is
   qualified without the child or it can resume when the spouse attains a
   qualifying age.
   While a divorce ends eligibility for a spouse annuity, a divorced
   spouse may, under conditions described previously, qualify for a
   divorced spouse's annuity.
   A divorced spouse’s annuity stops upon remarriage or upon entitlement
   to a social security benefit based on her or his own earnings, if the
   unreduced social security benefit is equal to or greater than one-half
   of the employee’s unreduced tier I amount. A divorced spouse’s annuity
   may be reduced or stopped if the divorced spouse is also entitled to a
   railroad retirement annuity.
   It is important to notify the Railroad Retirement Board promptly if one
   of the above changes occurs. Failure to report can result in an
   overpayment, which the Board will take action to recover, sometimes
