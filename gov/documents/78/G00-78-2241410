The Society of Performers, Artists, Athletes and Celebrities for Space
Exploration, Inc. (SPAACSE) has announced a competition for the first
George R. Faenza Scholarship for graduating American high school
seniors. SPAACSE hopes this will become an annual award.

SPAACSE is a not-for-profit organization formed to foster public
education projects to bring a heightened awareness to and support for
space exploration, through the national and international academic,
scientific, artistic, athletic, political and celebrity communities.

The scholarship will be awarded on the basis of an essay that best
describes 'Why the United States Needs a Space Program'. Along with
the essay, three letters of recommendation and a synopsis outlining how
the applicant has contributed to space education at the school,
community, state or national level - should be included.

In addition to the $1,000 scholarship award, the winner will be offered
an all-expenses paid trip to Washington, D.C. to participate in this year's
ongoing effort to educate Congressional leaders about the importance of
continuing the United States space exploration effort.

The application deadline is April 12th, 1999, with the winner to be
announced by May 3, 1999.

Amateur Radio license has value beyond the fun and excitement of
hamming -- it's your key to help with meeting those tuition costs.
