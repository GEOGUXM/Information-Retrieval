   (Office), an independent agency in the legislative branch, was
   established by the CAA to administer and enforce the Act and provide a
   process for the timely and confidential resolution of workplace
   disputes. Section 301(h) of the CAA requires that the Office of
   Compliance: . . . compile and publish statistics on the use of the
   Office by covered employees, including the number and type of contacts
   made with the Office, on the reason for such contacts, on the number of
   covered employees who initiated proceedings with the Office under this
   Act and results of such proceedings, and on the number of covered
   employees who file a complaint, the basis for the complaint, and the

   dispute resolution procedures, and adjudicative hearings and appeals
   for covered legislative branch employees and education and information

   enforces the provisions of sections 210 and 215, relating to health and
   safety and public access requirements, including investigation and
   prosecution of claims under these sections, and periodic inspections to
   ensure compliance. Additionally, the General Counsel investigates and
   prosecutes unfair labor practices under section 220 of the CAA. 1 The
