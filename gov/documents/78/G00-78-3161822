Detecting Transiting Planets

     Detecting transit and reflected light signals are classical
     signal-detection problems for deterministic signals in colored noise
     (Van Trees 1968). Essentially, the optimal detector whitens the
     observations and then correlates the whitened data with the signal
     resulting from passing a transit through the same whitening filter.
     An essential component of signal detection is the characterization
     of the observational noise, including stellar variability. The
     result is a time series of test statistics representing the
     likelihood that a transit was occurring at each point in time.
     Folding this time series at the orbital period of a planet
     coherently adds the test statistics for the bin containing the
     transit. The test statistics add incoherently if the wrong period or
     bin is chosen. The detection threshold is set so that no more than
     one false alarm occurs for the entire mission. Thus, the result is
     still meaningful even if terrestrial planets are infrequent or the
     mission had to be de-scoped. The detection rate depends on the SNR
     of a single event, the number of observed events and the detection
     threshold. The adaptive, nonparametric matched filter algorithm
     suggested by Kay (1999) is well suited to Kepler's needs,
     particularly when modified as per Jenkins (1999).

     The number of independent tests depends on the signal to be detected
     and the range of values each signal parameter can have. In the case
     of transits, there are two basic parameters: period and phase (time
     to first transit). For orbital periods of less than 2 years, there
     are about 5x10^6 tests per star required, for a total of 5x10^11
     tests. In order to have no more than one false alarm for the entire
     experiment, a detection threshold of 7 sigma is required, assuming
     Gaussian statistics, which is important for being able to address a
     null result. We note that the measurement noise in the Tech Demo was
     well characterized as being Gaussian. For the point design of a 4
     sigma single event SNR the combined SNR of a set of four transits is
     8 sigma, yielding a detection efficiency of 84%.

     The figure below shows SNRs for four transits of an Earth-size
     planet about an m[v]=12 G2 dwarf star as a function of transit
     duration during periods of low, high and mean stellar variability.
     Here, low, high and mean stellar variability correspond to data
     collected by ACRIM 1 in 1985 and 1986, in the last half of 1988 and
     in 1989 and over the entire data set, respectively. For transits
     between 3 and 5 hours, 1 R[e] planets are detected at least 84% of
     the time on average. If the transits are longer than 5 hours, 97%
     are detected on average, and at least 84% are detected even if all
     transits occur during high stellar activity. Planets of 1.3 R[e] are
     detected virtually always out to m[v]=12, and about 88% of the time
     for those orbiting m[v]=14 G-dwarf stars. Planets yielding average
     SNRs below the threshold are also detected, but at a lower rate. For
     example, planets with SNRs of 7 sigma and 6.5 sigma are detected 50%
     and 30% of the time, respectively.

     Note that a central Earth-analog passage lasts 13 hours. Since the
     chord length of a circle falls as the cosine with distance from the
     center >50% of transiting Sun-Earth-analogs have durations >11.3
     hours, >70% are >9.2 hours. Quoting results for 6.5-hour periods
     represents a conservative estimate of the single event SNR.

   The three curves give the SNR for 4 combined transits about an m[v]=12
    solar-like star at times of low, medium and high stellar variability.


Simulated Transit Events

     A simulation was performed to demonstrate the detectability of the
     transit signal for an Earth-size planet in the presence of all the
     noise that is expected to be in the data.
    1. The stellar noise was generated to match the solar noise spectrum
       obtained from the ACRIM 1 instrument aboard the SMM spacecraft to
       form a 4 year data sequence.
    2. Shot noise and pointing noise were added to the synthetic stellar
       noise to model the case for an m[v]=12 G2V (solar-like) star.
    3. A set of four 12 hour Earth-size transits (R=1.0 R[e]) was added to
       the noise sequence.

     A matched filter algorithm was applied to the data set to search for
     planets with periods between 100 and 400 days. The peak event of 8.5
     sigma indicated a planet with the correct period of 365 days, as
     shown in the figure below. The probability of this event occurring
     by chance is less than 1x10^-17 for Gaussian noise, demonstrating
     the significance of the detection. The additional blue spikes result
     from folding signals composed of multiple pulses. The red points are
     the result for the same data set without the transits incorporated.

           Probability of Occurrence by Chance for Simulated Data.
     The strong minimum at 365 days in blue indicates the presence of a
   planet with a high confidence level. The red points are the result for
     the same data set without transits, with all events attributable to
                                   noise.

     The figure below shows the sections of the data used in the above
     simulation. The individual transits are shown (left-hand scale),
     along with the result of folding and adding the data at the correct
     period derived with the detection algorithm (right-hand scale).

      The four sections of a light curve containing the transits of an
   Earth-size planet (1.0 R[e]) are folded at the correct period, with the
       sum shown in red. The presence of the transit is unmistakable.

Detecting Giant-Inner Planets

     For the case of detecting giant-inner planets by phase modulation of
     reflected light, the number of tests depends only on the length of
     observation and on the largest planetary period to be considered.
     Stellar variability limits this search space to periods less than
     about 7 days as shown in the figure below. Thus, there are about
     1,278 tests per star, for a total of 1.3x10^8 tests (assuming the
     solar rotation period is typical of all stars in the sample).
     Jovian-size planets are detectable with periods less than 6 days and
     Uranus-size planets with periods less than 2.5 days. Because the
     signal amplitude depends on the planetary albedo, planets with low
     albedos are more difficult to detect than that shown here.

      Detectability of Reflected Light from Short-Period Giant Planets
    The blue, red and green curves represent the total noise and include
   expected stellar variability, shot noise, CCD noise and pointing noise
          appropriate for m[v]=10, 12, and 14 stars, respectively.
     The blue spike at 4.2 days is the reflected light signature of a 51
     Peg-type planet with an albedo of 0.5 (assumed to match Jupiter) in
     orbit about a m[v]=10 star. At other periods, the strength of this
       spike would vary, as given by the black dotted reflected light
   envelope. Since this envelope exceeds the measurement noise curves for
   periods less than about 7 days, giant planets with periods up to 7 days
                               are detectable.
