   Evans Wants Assurance of Veterans Preference in Transportation Security
   Screener Corps Hiring

      For Release:  January 15, 2002
        __________________________________________________________________

      Washington, DC - Congressman Lane Evans (D-IL) is seeking assurance
      from the Department of Transportation (DOT) that preference for hiring
      veterans for security screener positions, as specified in the
      Transportation Security Act of 2001, will be implemented. In a January
      14th letter to DOT Secretary Norman Mineta, Evans requested information
      on agency procedures for hiring federal security screeners and
      guidelines for assessing veterans who apply.

      The new law anticipates hiring a significant number of new Federal
      employees for this vital duty and specifies that veterans of our armed
      services shall receive preference for the positions.
      "It makes a lot of sense", says Evans, "That our veterans should have
      first consideration for these Federal security positions. All who have
      served in the military have had background checks, many have held
      sensitive security clearances, and almost all have a detailed record of
      their performance, reliability and training accomplishments." He
      further noted that, "Where the goal is to quickly hire large numbers of
      qualified people with known, reliable backgrounds, America's veterans
      would seem the best place to start."
      But the new law, specific only to screener positions, does not specify
      what degree of hiring preference veterans must receive; rather it
      states that the Under Secretary for the Transportation Security
      Administration shall provide a preference for veterans. According to
      current Federal Civil Service law that affects most other Federal jobs,
      qualified veterans receive either 5 or 10 points to augment their score
      on a 100-point scale. "When the Civil
      Service requirement for veterans preference is used properly," says
      Evans, "it serves as a reasonable advantage for veterans and recognizes
      their prior service and sacrifice to our country - it makes them whole
      in the Federal
      job arena for the time spent in uniformed service."
      Evans has requested assurance that the DOT security screener hiring
      process will fully utilize the veteran job pool when gearing-up to
      sustain its security screener initiative. The Federal Aviation
      Administration (FAA)
      plans to have a federal aptitude test available to screen for the
      position in February 2002. Veterans interested in Security Screener
      positions should call toll free at 1-866-404-1227 or apply through the
      FAA web site at: http://jobs.faa.gov/SecurityScreeningPersonnel.htm.
