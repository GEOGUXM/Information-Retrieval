Financing Types Cash Management Tools

   Do you know where the money is hidden in your business?

Look inside, first! An area often overlooked by a capital-seeking
entrepreneur is inside the business itself. Look inside and be creative
before seeking external funds. You may have a stronger position, in future
negotiations with investors and lenders if the company has a history of
profitability and positive cash flow, developed from sound cash management.
It may also help to avoid a dilution of the ownership.

   September 23rd, 2001

   Professional investors and capital providers look at the cash
   management systems developed within the firm. These systems aid the
   small business owner to maximize the value of internal funds while
   reducing the amount of external funding needed to grow the business.


   Many times, a small business owner can reduce the need for external
   funds by focusing on three key areas: Accounts Payable, Inventory, and
   Accounts Receivable.


   The objective is to get paid from your customer, before you need to pay
   your vendor, so that you dont create a cash crunch.


   Other common cash management tools.
     * Whenever possible, negotiate credit terms with your vendors and
       suppliers.
     * Make materials and supply purchases "just in time".
     * Consider leasing equipment instead of purchasing it.
     * Sell obsolete inventory.
     * Collect any salary advances or notes payable from employees and
       officers.
     * Request customer deposits or payment in advance.
     * Consider accepting credit cards instead of offering internal credit
       terms.
     * If you offer credit, consider discounts or terms to encourage
       customers to pay sooner.
     * Collect on all outstanding accounts receivable. Follow through even
       on charge-offs.
     * Take available discounts for advance payment or quantity purchases,
       when appropriate.
